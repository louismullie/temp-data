## Question

Reactive lymph nodes in chikdren

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about reactive lymph nodes in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining reactive lymph nodes and their normal physiology in pediatrics. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and common etiologies. Next, I will review the clinical approach, including history, examination, and red flags. After that, I need to check the role and limitations of imaging, especially ultrasound. Then, I will examine when and how to biopsy, including pitfalls and special entities. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and highlight key takeaways with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and normal physiology. Reactive lymph nodes are enlarged nodes reflecting an immune response to antigenic stimulation rather than primary nodal disease; in children, this is common because the lymphoid system peaks in size around puberty and responds robustly to infections, so palpable nodes under 1 cm are often normal, particularly in the cervical region [^83cfc65a] [^bf85b6f3]. Wait, let me verify the size thresholds I'm using; I initially thought "less than 1 cm" was a universal normal, but I should correct that: up to 1 cm is generally considered normal in cervical chains, whereas inguinal nodes up to 1.5–2 cm can still be physiologic, and size alone should be interpreted in clinical context rather than as a standalone arbiter of pathology [^notfound].

> Next, I should review epidemiology to anchor pretest probabilities. Reactive lymphadenopathy is the most common cause of pediatric lymph node enlargement, with studies showing roughly 60% reactive hyperplasia and about 39% lymphadenitis among benign cases, and malignancy accounting for a minority even in referral cohorts, though the proportion rises with age and concerning features [^d59abc5b] [^bed334d6]. Hold on, I should verify the malignancy risk framing: in primary care settings, malignancy prevalence is very low, whereas in tertiary biopsy series, rates near 50% reflect selection bias; thus, I need to emphasize that most children with lymphadenopathy have benign, reactive nodes [^696ad3cb] [^bed334d6].

> I will now examine common etiologies. Viral infections are the leading cause of reactive nodes, including EBV, CMV, RSV, and common cold viruses; bacterial etiologies include streptococcal pharyngitis and atypical mycobacteria such as M. avium complex, which can cause chronic, fluctuant nodes with characteristic ultrasound features; autoimmune conditions like SLE and IgG4-related disease can present with generalized lymphadenopathy; and rare entities such as Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease and progressive transformation of germinal centers can mimic malignancy and require histopathology for diagnosis [^83cfc65a] [^4492a1ad] [^8f5f55c2] [^00278d79] [^ca9eb12f] [^d99de1b8]. Let me consider vaccine-related nodes as well; COVID-19 mRNA vaccines commonly cause ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy that is reactive and typically self-limited, which should be documented to avoid misinterpretation on imaging [^b0fde34a].

> Now, I need to ensure a structured clinical approach. History should document duration, location, systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), recent infections, animal exposures, travel, TB risk, and vaccination timing; examination should distinguish localized from generalized disease, assess node size, consistency, mobility, and look for red flags such as supraclavicular nodes, nodes larger than 3 cm, fixation, or systemic B symptoms [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84]. Hold on, I should verify the red flags that truly change risk: supraclavicular location, size greater than 3 cm, duration beyond 4 weeks without improvement, hard or fixed consistency, and generalized lymphadenopathy with B symptoms are consistently associated with higher malignancy risk and should prompt expedited workup [^ad871a22] [^b934a48c].

> Next, I should review imaging strategy and its limitations. Ultrasound is first-line in children because it avoids radiation, characterizes nodal morphology, and can identify features suggesting suppuration or atypical mycobacterial disease; however, size cutoffs are imperfect, and morphology such as preserved fatty hilum, oval shape, and central vascularity favors reactive nodes, whereas round shape, absent hilum, peripheral vascularity, necrosis, or calcification raise concern for malignancy or granulomatous disease [^1234e0d9] [^88ae1847] [^82ca2f92]. Wait, let me double-check the size thresholds: many pediatric radiology sources use a short-axis greater than 10 mm as abnormal, but interrater variability and age-related norms complicate this, so size must be integrated with clinical and sonographic features rather than used in isolation [^f5b9e7ce] [^88ae1847].

> I should confirm when to escalate to biopsy. Indications include nodes larger than 3 cm, persistence beyond 4 weeks without improvement, supraclavicular location, hard or fixed consistency, generalized lymphadenopathy with B symptoms, or abnormal labs or imaging suggesting systemic disease; excisional biopsy remains the gold standard for lymphoma and atypical lymphoproliferations, while fine-needle aspiration can be used for accessible nodes when cytology will suffice, recognizing its limitations for lymphoma subtyping [^b145dbe8] [^cc94ef84]. Hold on, I should verify a common pitfall: corticosteroids can mask lymphoma and should be avoided until a tissue diagnosis is secured when malignancy is suspected, which is a critical management principle [^cc94ef84].

> Let me consider special entities that often cause diagnostic confusion. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease presents with painful cervical nodes and systemic symptoms, often in adolescents, and requires histology for diagnosis; it is benign and self-limited but can recur, and misdiagnosis as bacterial lymphadenitis leads to unnecessary antibiotics [^ca9eb12f] [^0d802fc0]. Progressive transformation of germinal centers is a histologic finding associated with immune dysregulation and carries a small but real risk of Hodgkin lymphoma; patients may need surveillance and targeted immune evaluation if systemic features are present [^d99de1b8] [^ec526a26]. Nontuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis in young children shows characteristic ultrasound features with central hypoechogenicity, matting, and eventual calcification; surgical excision is often curative, whereas incision and drainage are discouraged due to chronic fistulization risk [^4492a1ad] [^9a523269].

> I need to ensure management principles are clear and practical. Most reactive nodes are observed with reassurance and follow-up, reserving antibiotics for clear bacterial lymphadenitis and avoiding corticosteroids when malignancy remains in the differential; parental education about expected timelines for resolution and red flags is essential to reduce anxiety and prevent unnecessary imaging or procedures [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84]. But wait, what if the family is requesting imaging for reassurance? In children with persistent but non-enlarging, non-tender, mobile nodes under 1 cm without systemic symptoms, watchful waiting remains appropriate, and routine imaging is not indicated; if imaging is pursued, ultrasound can provide reassurance when features are reassuring [^83cfc65a] [^88ae1847].

> Finally, I should synthesize key takeaways. Reactive lymph nodes are the most common cause of pediatric lymphadenopathy, driven by the robust immune responses of childhood; most resolve spontaneously, but persistent nodes beyond 4 weeks, nodes larger than 3 cm, supraclavicular location, hard or fixed consistency, or systemic B symptoms warrant expedited evaluation; ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality, and excisional biopsy is the gold standard when tissue diagnosis is needed; avoiding premature corticosteroids and recognizing mimics such as Kikuchi disease and PTGC are crucial to safe, efficient care [^3ca08590] [^1234e0d9] [^b145dbe8] [^cc94ef84] [^ca9eb12f] [^d99de1b8].

---

Reactive lymph nodes in children are **benign enlargements** of lymph nodes due to immune responses to infections, inflammation, or immune stimuli [^03506fad]. They are **very common**, especially in the head and neck, and usually resolve spontaneously within 2–4 weeks [^83cfc65a]. Evaluation should be guided by history and exam, with **ultrasound as first-line imaging** when persistent or atypical features are present [^1234e0d9] [^88ae1847]. Biopsy is reserved for nodes persisting beyond 4–6 weeks, larger than 3 cm, hard/fixed, supraclavicular, or with systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84]. Most cases require no treatment beyond observation and reassurance, though antibiotics are used when bacterial infection is suspected [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Reactive lymphadenopathy reflects **immune activation** — most often to viral or bacterial infections, but also to inflammation, immune stimuli, or medications [^03506fad]. Common triggers include:

- **Viral infections**: EBV, CMV, RSV, adenovirus, influenza, and common cold viruses [^notfound].
- **Bacterial infections**: Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bartonella henselae (cat-scratch disease), and atypical mycobacteria [^4492a1ad].
- **Immune stimuli**: Vaccinations, autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE, IgG4-related disease), and immune dysregulation syndromes [^8f5f55c2] [^00278d79].
- **Medications**: Anticonvulsants, antibiotics, and other drugs can cause drug-induced lymphadenopathy [^notfound].

Histologically, reactive nodes show **follicular hyperplasia**, plasmacytosis, and immunoblast proliferation without malignant transformation [^a24f2d23].

---

## Clinical presentation

Reactive lymph nodes typically present with the following features:

- **Location**: Commonly cervical, submandibular, axillary, and inguinal; head and neck nodes are most frequent in children [^83cfc65a].
- **Size**: Usually 1–2 cm, but can be larger in acute infections [^notfound].
- **Consistency**: Soft to firm, mobile, non-tender or mildly tender [^24d346f5].
- **Associated symptoms**: Fever, upper respiratory symptoms, or localized infection; systemic symptoms are uncommon unless due to systemic disease [^3ca08590].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### History and physical examination

A thorough history and exam are essential to distinguish reactive from concerning nodes. Key elements include **duration, rate of growth, associated symptoms, exposures (animals, travel, TB), vaccination history, and family history** [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84]. On exam, assess node size, consistency, mobility, tenderness, and look for signs of local infection or systemic disease [^3ca08590].

---

### Laboratory tests

Routine labs are not required for uncomplicated reactive nodes. Consider CBC, ESR/CRP, and targeted serologies (e.g. EBV, CMV, Bartonella, TB) when nodes persist, are unusually large, or systemic symptoms are present [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84].

---

### Imaging

Ultrasound is the **first-line modality** for persistent or atypical nodes, helping assess size, shape, vascularity, and necrosis; it avoids radiation and can guide management [^1234e0d9] [^88ae1847]. CT or MRI is reserved for deep or complicated disease, and PET-CT is not routinely used for reactive nodes [^2bc51d5f].

---

### Indications for biopsy

Biopsy is indicated for nodes with any of the following:

- Persistence beyond 4–6 weeks without regression [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84].
- Size> 3 cm [^3ca08590] [^ad871a22].
- Hard, fixed, or rapidly growing nodes [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84].
- Supraclavicular location [^3ca08590] [^b934a48c].
- Systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84].
- Abnormal labs or imaging suggesting malignancy [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84].

Excisional biopsy is preferred for lymphoma or atypical lymphoproliferative disorders; FNA may be used for accessible lesions when cytology suffices [^b145dbe8] [^cc94ef84].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential includes:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Viral (EBV, CMV, RSV, adenovirus) <br/> - Bacterial (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bartonella, atypical mycobacteria) <br/> - Fungal (histoplasmosis, cryptococcus) [^4492a1ad] [^14ddecff] [^c9226dd6] |
| Inflammatory/autoimmune | - SLE<br/> - IgG4-related disease<br/> - Progressive transformation of germinal centers [^8f5f55c2] [^00278d79] [^d99de1b8] |
| Malignant | - Lymphoma (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin) <br/> - Leukemia<br/> - Metastatic disease [^7948b42d] [^019e472e] |
| Medication-induced | - Anticonvulsants<br/> - Antibiotics [^notfound] |

---

## Management

Most reactive nodes require **no treatment** beyond observation and reassurance, with expected resolution in 2–4 weeks [^3ca08590]. Antibiotics are indicated only when bacterial infection is suspected (e.g. streptococcal pharyngitis, cat-scratch disease) [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84]. Corticosteroids are generally avoided unless treating an underlying autoimmune disease, as they can mask malignancy [^cc94ef84]. Follow-up should confirm regression; persistent or evolving nodes warrant re-evaluation and possible biopsy [^3ca08590].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis is **excellent**; most reactive nodes resolve spontaneously without sequelae. Recurrence is common with repeated infections, and rare entities (e.g. PTGC) may carry a low malignancy risk and merit surveillance [^d99de1b8].

---

## Parental education and counseling

Parents should be counseled on the **benign nature** of reactive nodes, expected timeline for resolution, and red flags requiring urgent care (persistent nodes> 4 weeks, rapid growth, hard/fixed nodes, systemic symptoms) [^3ca08590] [^cc94ef84]. This reduces anxiety and unnecessary healthcare use [^notfound].

---

Reactive lymph nodes in children are **common, benign, and self-limited**; a focused history and exam, selective imaging, and judicious use of biopsy ensure safe, efficient care while avoiding overtesting and overtreatment [^3ca08590].

### Reactive lymph nodes in pediatric practice [^03506fad]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

A variety of unusual reactive conditions may be seen in lymph nodes from the pediatric age group. Some of these, such as the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, reflect underlying abnormalities of the immune system and cellular control processes, while others are related to viral infections or are of unknown cause. Many of these conditions can mimic malignant neoplasms, so it is important that pathologists recognize these unusual reactive patterns.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding on physical examination in the pediatric population. Although it is often physiologic, lymphadenopathy can also be associated with more serious illnesses and has many possible etiologies. A broad differential diagnosis can be narrowed with a thorough clinical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. The goal of this review is to provide a framework for understanding normal physiology, identify when enlarged lymph nodes may be associated with pathology, develop differential diagnoses associated with lymphadenopathy, and apply a systematic approach for diagnostics and appropriate management, with a focus on findings concerning for malignancy and the initial evaluation.

### Point-of-care ultrasound for evaluating lymphadenopathy in the pediatric emergency department: case series and review of literature [^82ca2f92]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Children present to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with enlarged lymph nodes due to a broad spectrum of conditions ranging from benign causes like reactive lymph nodes to adverse conditions like malignancy. Identifying sonographic features typical of infection, inflammation, and neoplasms will help assist clinicians in deciding the disposition of the patients from the ED. Point-of-care ultrasound has become an essential adjunct for diagnostic assessment in pediatric emergency medicine. The wider accessibility of ultrasound along with greater resolution using high-frequency probes places this noninvasive, nonradiation-based bedside examination, an ideal tool for real-time examination of the lymph nodes in the EDs.

Case Series

We present a series of cases in which the point-of-care ultrasound examination proved valuable in the timely diagnosis and expedited care of lymph node pathologies secondary to reactive, infectious, and malignant processes. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Point-of-care ultrasound will facilitate diagnosis in children with lymph node swelling and should be considered in children of all ages. While assessing the lymph node pathology at the bedside, describe the shape, size, internal echotexture, borders, vascularity, and the pattern of the perinodal soft tissue to differentiate between a normal, reactive, infectious, inflammatory, or malignant underlying pathology.

### Lymphadenopathy in children: a streamlined approach for the surgeon – A report from the APSA cancer committee [^b3186b17]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

Lymphadenopathy is a common complaint in children. Pediatric surgeons are often called upon to evaluate, treat, and/or biopsy enlarged lymph nodes. With many nonsurgical causes in the differential diagnosis, the surgeon plays the important role of providing reassurance and timely diagnosis while minimizing the pain and morbidity associated with surgical interventions in children. The purpose of this summary paper is to provide a management guide for surgeons working up children with lymphadenopathy.

Materials/Methods

The English language literature was searched for "lymphadenopathy in children". All manuscript types were considered for review, regardless of medical specialty, with emphasis placed on published guidelines, algorithms, and reviews. After thorough review of these manuscripts and cross-referencing of their bibliographies, the attached algorithm was developed, with emphasis on the role and timing of surgical intervention.

Results

The APSA Cancer Committee developed the attached algorithm to fill a gap in the surgical literature. It outlines lymphadenopathy workup and treatment with emphasis on the role and timing of surgical intervention.

Conclusion

This review defines and summarizes the common etiologies and presentations of lymphadenopathy in children, and offers a straightforward algorithm for evaluation of and treatment with an emphasis on malignancy risk and surgical management.

The differential diagnosis in pediatric lymphadenopathy includes bacterial, viral, fungal, and idiopathic causes. A systematic approach to patient evaluation is necessary because the differential diagnosis, presentation, and work up must consider infectious, immunologic, neoplastic, and idiopathic disorders. A thorough history and examination are vital to determining the diagnosis and ruling out a malignant process.

### Analysis of children with peripheral lymphadenopathy [^d59abc5b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In this study, the clinical and laboratory features of children with lymphadenopathy were evaluated. Over a 3-year period, 126 patients were referred to the clinic for lymphadenopathy. Twenty-eight of cases have diseases mimicking lymphadenopathy; 98 (mean age: 86+/-55 months) have lymphadenopathy. Localized, limited, and generalized involvement was found in 52%, 30%, and 18% of patients. The most common localization was the head and neck region. The causes of lymphadenopathy were benign diseases in 75 patients. Sixty percent were reactive lymphadenopathy, 39% were lymphadenitis. Lymphadenitis was more frequently localized and bigger than 3 cm compared with reactive adenopathy (p=.02, p=.004). Twenty-three patients have malignant diseases whose mean age was higher than others (p=.002). The enlargement of supraclavicular nodes was more likely due to malignant disease (p=.001). The risk of malignant disease was higher in patients who had generalized lymphadenopathy, lymph nodes bigger than 3 cm, hepatosplenomegaly, and high lactate dehydrogenase levels. In conclusion, this study pointed out the important clues for the differential diagnosis, which were present in the history, physical, and laboratory findings.

### Imaging of cervical lymphadenopathy in children and young adults [^e5cb71ae]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This article describes the role of imaging in evaluating cervical lymphadenopathy in patients from birth to their mid-20s, illustrates imaging features of normal and abnormal lymph nodes, and highlights nodal imaging features and head and neck findings that assist in diagnosis.

Conclusion

Cervical lymph node abnormalities are commonly encountered clinically and on imaging in children and young adults. Although imaging findings can lack specificity, nodal characteristics and associated head and neck imaging findings can assist in determining the underlying cause.

### Using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging-derived radiomics to classify cervical lymphadenopathy in children [^6c85ad94]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervical lymphadenopathy is common in children and has diverse causes varying from benign to malignant, their similar manifestations making differential diagnosis difficult.

Objective

This study aimed to investigate whether radiomic models using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could classify pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy.

Methods

A total of 419 cervical lymph nodes from 146 patients, and encompassing four common etiologies (Kikuchi disease, reactive hyperplasia, suppurative lymphadenitis and malignancy), were randomly divided into training and testing sets in a ratio of 7:3. For each lymph node, 1,218 features were extracted from T2-weighted images. Then, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models were used to select the most relevant ones. Two models were built using a support vector machine classifier, one was to classify benign and malignant lymph nodes and the other further distinguished four different diseases. The performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curves and decision curve analysis.

Results

By LASSO, 20 features were selected to construct a model to distinguish benign and malignant lymph nodes, which achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 and 0.80 in the training and testing sets, respectively. Sixteen features were selected to construct a model to distinguish four different cervical lymphadenopathies. For each etiology, Kikuchi disease, reactive hyperplasia, suppurative lymphadenitis, and malignancy, an AUC of 0.97, 0.91, 0.88, and 0.87 was achieved in the training set, and an AUC of 0.96, 0.80, 0.82, and 0.82 was achieved in the testing set, respectively.

Conclusion

MRI-derived radiomic analysis provides a promising non-invasive approach for distinguishing causes of cervical lymphadenopathy in children.

### Pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy [^83cfc65a]. Pediatrics in Review (2018). Low credibility.

Cervical lymphadenopathy affects as many as 90% of children aged 4 to 8 years. With so many children presenting to doctors' offices and emergency departments, a systematic approach to diagnosis and evaluation must be considered. In the following review, we aim to provide the pediatric clinician with a general framework for an appropriate history and physical examination, while giving guidance on initial diagnostic laboratory testing, imaging, and potential need for biopsy. The most common cause of cervical lymphadenopathy in the pediatric population is reactivity to known and unknown viral agents. The second most common cause includes bacterial infections ranging from aerobic to anaerobic to mycobacterial infections. Malignancies are the most concerning cause of cervical lymphadenopathy.The explosion in the use of ultrasonography as a nonradiating imaging modality in the pediatric population has changed the diagnostic algorithm for many clinicians. We aim to provide some clarity on the utility and shortcomings of the imaging modalities available, including ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

### The pathology of reactive lymphadenopathies: a discussion of common reactive patterns and their malignant mimics [^a24f2d23]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Context

-Distinguishing between a reactive and a neoplastic lymphoid proliferation is a clinically significant task frequently performed by the surgical pathologist in routine practice.

Objectives

-To highlight common situations in lymph node pathology where reactive changes and lymphoma may be misdiagnosed.

Data Sources

-Data sources are peer-reviewed journal articles, textbooks, and clinical experience.

Conclusions

-This review aims to refresh and enhance the surgical pathologist's awareness of the shared and distinguishing features of select reactive and neoplastic lymphoproliferations, which in turn will allow the surgical pathologist to make more accurate diagnoses and avoid the pitfalls of misdiagnosis. This will be done by describing a selection of commonly encountered reactive histologic changes observed in lymph nodes, present the lymphomas with which they share overlapping features, outline the features that distinguish them, and describe an approach to making an accurate diagnosis and avoiding a misdiagnosis in each scenario.

### Pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy [^87c75773]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article provides an overview for evaluation and management of the pediatric patient with cervical lymphadenopathy. A thorough history and physical examination are crucial in developing a differential diagnosis for these patients. Although infectious causes of lymphadenopathy are more prevalent in the pediatric population compared with adults, neoplasms should also be considered. Judicious use of imaging studies, namely ultrasound, can provide valuable information for accurate diagnosis. Common and uncommon infectious causes of cervical lymphadenopathy are reviewed. Surgical intervention is occasionally necessary for diagnosis and treatment of infections, and rarely indicated for the possibility of malignancy. Indications for surgery are discussed.

### Assessment of lymphadenopathy in children [^51a675e2]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The assessment of lymphadenopathy in children is a common diagnostic problem in pediatrics. An understanding of the wide variety of diseases and conditions that may present as lymphadenopathy is essential to determining the most appropriate work up for an individual patient. Although the majority of these children will prove to have a benign disorder, it is important that the pediatrician also have an appreciation for the malignant diseases that may present with lymphadenopathy, so that in such cases the diagnosis of a serious or life-threatening disease can be made in a timely manner.

### Cervical lymphadenopathy in children: a diagnostic tree analysis model based on ultrasonographic and clinical findings [^26750a0b]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To establish a diagnostic tree analysis (DTA) model based on ultrasonography (US) findings and clinical characteristics for differential diagnosis of common causes of cervical lymphadenopathy in children.

Methods

A total of 242 patients (131 boys, 111 girls; mean age, 11.2±0.3 years; range, 1 month-18 years) with pathologically confirmed Kikuchi disease (n =127), reactive hyperplasia (n =64), lymphoma (n =24), or suppurative lymphadenitis (n =27) who underwent neck US were included. US images were retrospectively reviewed to assess lymph node (LN) characteristics, and clinical information was collected from patient records. DTA models were created using a classification and regression tree algorithm on the basis of US imaging and clinical findings. The patients were randomly divided into training (70%, 170/242) and validation (30%, 72/242) datasets to assess the diagnostic performance of the DTA models.

Results

In the DTA model based on all predictors, perinodal fat hyperechogenicity, LN echogenicity, and short diameter of the largest LN were significant predictors for differential diagnosis of cervical lymphadenopathy (overall accuracy, 85.3% and 83.3% in the training and validation datasets). In the model based on categorical parameters alone, perinodal fat hyperechogenicity, LN echogenicity, and loss of fatty hilum were significant predictors (overall accuracy, 84.7% and 86.1% in the training and validation datasets).

Conclusions

Perinodal fat hyperechogenicity, heterogeneous echotexture, short diameter of the largest LN, and loss of fatty hilum were significant US findings in the DTA for differential diagnosis of cervical lymphadenopathy in children.

Key Points

• Diagnostic tree analysis model based on ultrasonography and clinical findings would be helpful in differential diagnosis of pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy. • Significant predictors were perinodal fat hyperechogenicity, heterogeneous echotexture, short diameter of the largest LN, and loss of fatty hilum.

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and evaluation-AAFP (...) [^24d346f5]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The cause of lymphadenopathy is often obvious: for example, the child who presents with a sore throat, tender cervical nodes and a positive rapid strep test, or the patient who presents with an infection of the hand and axillary lymphadenopathy. In other cases, the diagnosis is less clear. Lymphadenopathy may be the only clinical finding or one of several nonspecific findings, and the discovery of swollen lymph nodes will often raise the specter of serious illness such as lymphoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or metastatic cancer. Definition The body has approximately 600 lymph nodes, but only those in the submandibular, axillary or inguinal regions may normally be palpable in healthy people. Physical Examination When lymphadenopathy is localized, the clinician should examine the region drained by the nodes for evidence of infection, skin lesions or tumors.

In children, lymph nodes larger than 2 cm in diameter were predictive of granulomatous diseases or cancer. 11 These studies were performed in referral centers, and conclusions may not apply in primary care settings. Pain/Tenderness. When a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process or suppuration, but pain may also result from hemorrhage into the necrotic center of a malignant node. The presence or absence of tenderness does not reliably differentiate benign from malignant nodes.
4. Consistency. Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant.

The term “shotty” refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses. 4 Having the patient perform a Valsalva's maneuver during palpation of the supraclavicular fossae increases the chance of detecting a node. Lymphadenopathy of the right supraclavicular node is associated with cancer in the mediastinum, lungs or esophagus. The left supraclavicular node receives lymphatic flow from the thorax and abdomen, and may signal pathology in the testes, ovaries, kidneys, pancreas, prostate, stomach or gallbladder.

### Measurements of cervical lymph nodes in children on computed tomography [^f5b9e7ce]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines and literature are inconsistent in terms of cut-off values for normal cervical lymph node sizes. None of them provides guidelines specifically for children. Based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST), axial short-axis diameters should not exceed 10 mm, whereas the Lugano criteria state that axial long-axis diameter can be up to 15 mm without being malignant. However, these guidelines are specifically for malignant diseases and might therefore be inappropriate for distinguishing between normal and abnormal when looking at other causes (e.g. infectious disease). Other authors recommend a cut-off point of 15 mm in the long axis (all imaging planes) for Levels I–III and 10 mm for Levels IV–VI or a short axial axis cut-off of 11 mm for Levels II and III and 10 mm for all other levels. For ultrasound, a short-axis upper limit of 10 mm is generally used, as well. In our clinical practise a cut-off point of 10 mm in short-axis diameter in the axial plane is considered the upper limit for all levels except Level II, where 15 mm is used. With these size limits, four lymph nodes (all in different children) would have been classified as being enlarged at our centre (3% of the included children). Although size is an important criterion in assessing lymph nodes on all imaging modalities, other factors such as shape, borders, internal architecture and enhancement characteristics are of course important, as well. This is especially relevant because interrater variability is to some extent unavoidable when assessing measurements in radiologic images. This variability should be considered, and size alone should not be used to form clinical decisions, but rather other imaging features and the clinical presentation should be taken into account as well, especially when measurements approach the clinically used cut-off points.

### Lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^cc94ef84]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy occurs in 0.6% of the population annually, usually from a benign cause. History should focus on lymph node location, duration of lymphadenopathy, associated symptoms (particularly fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), past and current medical conditions, occupation, travel history, animal exposures, medication use, recent vaccine history, drug use, sexual history, and family history. Physical examination should first differentiate localized from generalized lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually caused by underlying systemic disease. Although usually benign, localized lymphadenopathy may represent infection or malignancy, particularly if epitrochlear or supraclavicular nodes are affected. Lymph nodes that are larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted/fused to surrounding structures may indicate malignancy or granulomatous diseases, especially in children. When lymphadenopathy persists beyond four weeks or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, imaging and appropriate laboratory studies (eg, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tuberculosis testing) should be obtained. Biopsy may be performed through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be considered if a benign or self-limiting etiology (eg, bacterial lymphadenitis) is suspected. Corticosteroids should be avoided because they can mask the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.

### FDG uptake in cervical lymph nodes in children without head and neck cancer [^8927a3ce]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Reactive cervical lymphadenopathy is common in children and may demonstrate increased 18 F-fluoro-deoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).

Objective

We sought to evaluate the frequency and significance of 18 F-FDG uptake by neck lymph nodes in children with no history of head and neck cancer.

Materials and Methods

The charts of 244 patients (114 female, mean age: 10.4 years) with a variety of tumors such as lymphoma and post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD), but no head and neck cancers, who had undergone 18 F-FDG PET/CT were reviewed retrospectively. Using the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), increased 18 F-FDG uptake by neck lymph nodes was recorded and compared with the final diagnosis based on follow-up studies or biopsy results.

Results

Neck lymph node uptake was identified in 70/244 (28.6%) of the patients. In 38 patients, the lymph nodes were benign. In eight patients, the lymph nodes were malignant (seven PTLD and one lymphoma). In 24 patients, we were not able to confirm the final diagnosis. Seven out of the eight malignant lymph nodes were positive for PTLD. The mean SUVmax was significantly higher in malignant lesions (4.2) compared with benign lesions (2.1) (P = 0.00049).

Conclusion

18 F-FDG uptake in neck lymph nodes is common in children and is frequently due to reactive lymph nodes, especially when the SUVmax is <3.2. The frequency of malignant cervical lymph nodes is higher in PTLD patients compared with other groups.

### Imaging of pediatric neck masses [^6415abae]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Palpable neck masses are a common indication for pediatric imaging. Such lesions may be caused by infectious, inflammatory, tumoral, traumatic, lymphovascular, immunologic, or congenital etiologies. Radiological assessment of neck masses in young children should be tailored based on patient presentation and physical examination, as well as clinical suspicion. The goal of imaging should be to help arrive at a diagnosis or limited differential in an efficient manner while minimizing radiation exposure.

### Rapid access multidisciplinary lymph node diagnostic clinic: analysis of 550 patients [^2b4cd268]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy (LA) is common and affects patients of all ages. An annual incidence of 0.6–0.7% has been estimated for the general population (;). Patients with lymphadenopathy present to a wide range of medical specialties. When physicians are faced with these patients, the critical tasks are to differentiate benign from malignant lymph nodes, to identify serious medical conditions that require specialist care, and to reassure patients with benign reactive lymphadenopathy or self-limiting diseases.

The possibility of malignancy raises the most concern among patients and health care professionals. Prompt referral for definitive investigations and treatment cannot be overstated, as cancer is perhaps the disease people fear most. Despite the incidences of many cancers being broadly similar in England compared with other European countries and the USA, the corresponding survival rates are poorer (Table 1 

Table 1 
Five-year relative survival of common cancers) (;). To address this problem, the British government proposed, in September 2000, the National Health Service (NHS) Cancer Plan to provide a comprehensive strategy for bringing together prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and care for cancer to improve survival. The current guideline recommends all patients with lymphadenopathy of more than 1 cm in size persisting for 6 weeks to be referred urgently for further evaluation.

Apart from cancer, there are also other medical conditions presenting with LA that will require urgent medical attention. This would include infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), both of which pose an important public health problem. In addition, immune-induced injury disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis will also require specialist care.

### Assessment of peripheral lymphadenopathies: experience at a pediatric hematology-oncology department in Turkey [^b934a48c]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Since a large variety of disorders may lead to lymph node enlargement determining the cause of peripheral lymphadenopathy (LAP) in children can be difficult. This retrospective study evaluated 200 children who were admitted to an Oncology-Hematology department because of lymphadenopathy and aimed to determine the clinical and laboratory findings that were valuable for differential diagnosis. A specific cause for lymphadenopathy was documented in 93 (46.5%) cases. One hundred forty (70%) children were classified as having a benign cause for lymph node enlargements. Fourteen (10%) of these cases underwent an excisional lymph node biopsy, and histopathological examination showed a reactive hyperplasia. Sixty (30%) cases were classified as having a malignant disease-causing lymphadenopathy. In terms of differential diagnosis, some associated systemic symptoms, physical findings, and laboratory investigations showed significant difference between benign and malignant lymphadenopathy groups. The following findings were determined as being important to alert the physician about the probability of a malignant disorder: location of the lymphadenapathy (supraclavicular and posterior auricular), duration of the lymph node enlargement (>4 weeks), size of the lymph node (>3 cm), abnormal complete blood cell findings, abnormalities in chest X-ray, and abdominal ultrasonography.

### Head and neck lymph nodes in children: the spectrum from normal to abnormal [^2bc51d5f]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy of the head and neck region is a common finding in children and a very common reason to image the craniocervical region. Enlarged lymph nodes are commonly palpated by the pediatrician in the office and commonly imaged by the pediatric radiologist. The difficult task of the clinician is to determine whether the adenopathy is acute (<3 weeks) or chronic (>6 weeks) and when imaging is indicated. In children, radiation is always a consideration when choosing an imaging modality; thus, US is usually the first imaging study at our institution, and CT the second option, usually reserved for the very ill child or for when there is a high index of suspicion for malignancy. We present the normal anatomy of head and neck lymph nodes and the US, CT, and MRI appearances in normal and pathologic states to help clinicians generate a reasonable differential diagnosis and prevent unnecessary procedures.

### Ultrasound evaluation of persistent cervical lymph nodes in young children [^adb48653]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To review the ultrasonographic outcomes of persistent lymph nodes, in the absence of other concerning signs or symptoms, in patients <6 years of age.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 98 patients <6 years old who had neck ultrasound for persistent lymph nodes at a single university hospital over a 3.5 year period between January 2016 and June 2019.

Results

There were no cases of malignant disease or serious systemic illness. Ninety-two of the 98 examinations showed normal or reactive lymph nodes. There were three sonographically indeterminate cases and two non-lymph-node structures: haemangioma and dermoid cyst. One examination reported an abnormal lymph node, which had resolved by the time of review in clinic.

Conclusion

Persistently enlarged or abnormal lymph nodes should be investigated; however, a distinction should be made between lymph nodes that have regressed to <1 cm but are still palpable and persistently enlarged or abnormal lymph nodes. The findings of the present study indicate that persistence of non-enlarged lymph nodes is not a predictor for malignancy. It is advised that clear guidelines are used, which state the criteria for further investigation, to promote the best use of imaging.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^72da86f4]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, and autoimmune disorders, as well as medications and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns. Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as two or more involved regions, often indicates underlying systemic disease. Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter. The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

### Primary abdominal lymphonodular cryptococcosis in children: 2 case reports and a literature review [^c9226dd6]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cryptococcus neoformans is an important opportunistic fungal pathogen that is acquired via the respiratory tract. It causes several clinical syndromes and most commonly presents as meningitis. The establishment of C neoformans infections in immunocompetent individuals could be owing to increased virulence, dose of the organism, or genetically determined differences in the ability to generate a protective immune response against the organism.

Objectives

The purpose of this study is to report on 2 case studies and a literature review and to discuss the diagnosis and management of primary abdominal lymphonodular cryptococcosis.

Methods

We conducted 2 case studies and a literature review.

Results

Two cases of primary abdominal lymphonodular cryptococcosis in childhood were reported herein. The patients suffered from C neoformans without immunoglobulin or lymphocyte abnormalities. The cause of hospitalization of the 2 cases was mainly the persisting fever with or without abdominal pain. Imaging findings indicated dramatic lymphadenopathy and light hepatosplenomegaly. Excision biopsy of the abnormal lymph node demonstrated reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and the presence of C neoformans. The results of nested polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis of C neoformans.

Conclusion

This is the first report on C neoformans in the primary abdominal lymph node in children. This report suggests that C neoformans infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of fever and marked lymphadenopathy, and empirical administration of antifungal agent may be necessary. C neoformans antibody test, polymerase chain reaction assay, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or surgical excision biopsy is needed in early diagnosis.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and granulomatous lymphadenopathy [^8f5f55c2]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

SLE is a chronic autoimmune disorder which is characterized by inflammation of blood vessels and connective tissue involving multiple systems and presence of circulating autoantibodies especially ANA and Anti-dsDNA antibodies. SLE is relatively uncommon in children and estimated incidence ranges from 10 to 20 per 100 000 children depending on the ethnic population.

Children and adolescents represent 15-20% of all patients with SLE. Females are affected three to five times more often than males. SLE is well known to present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Children with SLE may present with constitutional symptoms (fatigue, myalgia, weakness, weight loss), skin rashes, especially malar rash or arthralgia/arthritis that may precede the detection of organ-specific lesion.

Prevalence of lymphadenopathy has been reported in 23-34% of patients with SLE with a female preponderance. Despite being frequent manifestation, lymphadenopathy is not included in the ACR criteria for the diagnosis of SLE. Lymphadenopathy has even been reported as the first clinical manifestation of SLE in children [-]. Lymphadenopathy is very common in children due to variety of etiologies and hence may pose a delay in the diagnosis of SLE.

Lymph nodes in SLE are usually soft, non tender, mobile, generalized and of varying size. We also observed similar findings in our patient. On histopathology, coagulative necrosis with hematoxylin bodies is specific to lupus lymphadenitis but is rarely observed. More commonly lymph node biopsies in SLE show reactive follicular hyperplasia which is considered a nonspecific feature. Atypical lymphoproliferation found in the lymph node biopsies of SLE were classified as reactive follicular hyperplasia with giant follicles, aspects similar to Castelman’s disease, atypical paracortical hyperplasia with lymphoid follicles, and atypical immunoblastic and lymphoplasmacytic proliferation. A classification system with three patterns of histopathological features of lupus lymphadenitis had been proposed, however they did not appear to be highly specific for SLE. The occurrence of variety of histopathological features poses diagnostic difficulty and should be differentiated from lymphoproliferative disorders. This patient had undergone bone marrow examination which was normal.

### Characteristics of intestinal-related lymphoid hyperplasia in children and its correlation with intussusception of children [^11f5c501]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary intussusception is a common disease in children. It is a characteristic disease of infants. The incidence gradually decreases with age and has an increasing trend at present. Its main manifestations are paroxysms of abdominal pain, sausage-like lump in the abdomen, jam-like bloody stools, and tree rings-like mass in the section of abdominal exploration by color doppler ultrasound. If the treatment is not timely, intestinal perforation, necrosis, and even life-threatening can be caused. Although it is a common disease, its pathogenesis is not well understood. In this paper, intestinal-associated lymphoid tissue refers to intestinal antigen-associated lymphoid tissue, which can be divided into two parts. One is intestinal wall lymphoid tissue, including submucosal mass lymphoid tissue and Peyer patches, also known as mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). The other is the lymphatic tissue in the mesenteric lymph nodes. They are closely related to the intestinal immune system. The solid antigenic substances in the intestinal lumen were transported into the submucosa by M cells swallowing the antigenic substances in the intestinal mucosa. They met with specific cloned B and T lymphocytes entering the submucosa from the blood via high columnar endothelial venule (HEV). With the assistance of macrophages, dendritic cells and T helper cells, T and B lymphocytes proliferated, resulting in submucosal lymphoid tissue hyperplasia. On the other hand, intestinal antigens that entered the submucosa through M cells and activated T and B lymphocytes can also enter mesenteric lymph nodes through lymphatic transport and output channels, and lymphocyte proliferation causes mesenteric lymph node proliferation. The two parts of the intestinal lymphatic tissue are closely related to the immune response to intestinal antigens. They work together to generate an immune response to intestinal antigens. The same intestinal antigens stimulate both to induce an immune response and develop lymphoid tissue hyperplasia. Lymphoid hyperplasia in the submucosal lymphoid tissue of the intestinal wall and mesenteric lymph nodes should co-occur. Measuring the hyperplasia degree of mesenteric lymph nodes can also indirectly reflect the hyperplasia of intestinal submucosal lymphatic tissue. The right lower abdominal mesenteric lymph node mainly drains intestinal antigens and lymphocytes from the ileocecal bowel, and The periumbilical lymph node mainly drains intestinal antigens and lymphocytes from the intestinal canal except the ileocecal intestinal canal. The hyperplasia of lymph nodes in the mesentery of the right lower abdomen is more likely to reflect the hyperplasia of submucosal lymphoid tissue in the ileocecal terminal ileum. According to articles, primary intussusceptions in children are closely related to mesenteric lymph node enlargement and lymphoid hyperplasia of the intestinal wall, especially submucosal lymphoid hyperplasia of the terminal ileum. Since it is challenging to detect hyperplasia of submucosal lymphoid tissue at the terminal ileum by current non-invasive detection methods, most cases are from case reports or excised ileocecal specimens, thus resulting in the lack of systematic studies on this theory. Moreover, most articles have not clarified the correlation between the two parts of lymphoid tissue in children’s pathogenesis of primary intussusceptions. Due to the synchronous hyperplasia between intestinal submucosal lymphoid tissue hyperplasia and mesenteric lymph nodes hyperplasia, we can indirectly predict the degree of intestinal wall lymphoid tissue hyperplasia by measuring the degree of mesenteric lymph node hyperplasia by ultrasound, then analyze and observe its correlation with intussusceptions. Some literature used the measurement of mesenteric lymph node length diameter > 1 cm and the ratio of length diameter to transverse diameter > 2 as the basis for the existence of mesenteric lymph node hyperplasia, but it is not easy to quantify. In our study, we will use a new quantifiable method to characterize the degree of mesenteric lymph node proliferation. This method measures the number and volume of each visible mesenteric lymph node in a specific region around the umbilicus and right lower abdomen by ultrasound. After that, we add them together to obtain the total volume of mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower abdomen (RLTMLNV)and the total volume of mesenteric lymph nodes in the periumbilical area (PTMLNV). They can reflect the extent of mesenteric lymphoid tissue hyperplasia.

### How I approach: the workup and management of patients with progressive transformation of the germinal center [^ec526a26]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Progressive transformation of the germinal center (PTGC) is a common and underrecognized cause of pediatric lymphadenopathy. PTGC may be associated with numerous systemic medical conditions that require further workup and management, including malignancy, autoimmune conditions, lymphoproliferative conditions, immunodeficiency, and infection. Given the breadth and rarity of the associated conditions, workup should be tailored to the individual patient and occur in a tiered approach. Patients with PTGC require ongoing follow-up, given their long-term risk of malignancy and recurrent PTGC.

### Axillary lymphadenopathy in the COVID-19 era: what the radiologist needs to know [^b0fde34a]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Axillary lymphadenopathy caused by the high immunogenicity of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines presents radiologists with new diagnostic dilemmas in differentiating vaccine-related benign reactive lymphadenopathy from that due to malignant causes. Understanding axillary anatomy and lymphatic drainage is key to radiologic evaluation of the axilla. US plays a critical role in evaluation and classification of axillary lymph nodes on the basis of their cortical and hilar morphology, which allows prediction of metastatic disease. Guidelines for evaluation and management of axillary lymphadenopathy continue to evolve as radiologists gain more experience with axillary lymphadenopathy related to COVID-19 vaccines. General guidelines recommend documenting vaccination dates and laterality and administering all vaccine doses contralateral to the site of primary malignancy whenever applicable. Guidelines also recommend against postponing imaging for urgent clinical indications or for treatment planning in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Although conservative management approaches to axillary lymphadenopathy initially recommended universal short-interval imaging follow-up, updates to those approaches as well as risk-stratified approaches recommend interpreting lymphadenopathy in the context of both vaccination timing and the patient's overall risk of metastatic disease. Patients with active breast cancer in the pretreatment or peritreatment phase should be evaluated with standard imaging protocols regardless of vaccination status. Tissue sampling and multidisciplinary discussion remain useful in management of complex cases, including increasing lymphadenopathy at follow-up imaging, MRI evaluation of extent of disease, response to neoadjuvant treatment, and potentially confounding cases.

### Clinical characteristics and resource utilization in children presenting to the pediatric emergency department with neck swelling [^2cac2018]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to describe patient characteristics, diagnostic imaging rates, and resource utilization in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with neck swelling.

Methods

We conducted a single-center retrospective cross-sectional chart review study of children <18 years seen in a pediatric ED in the United States between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018, with a discharge diagnosis related to neck swelling. The primary outcome was neck imaging performed in the ED. We used descriptive statistics to describe clinical characteristics and odds ratios to compare resource utilization between ED encounters with and without imaging.

Results

We studied 680 ED encounters with neck swelling, 32.4% (n=220) of which involved imaging. When imaging was ordered, ultrasound, computed tomography, or plain film radiography was ordered in 79% (n=180), 18.4% (n=43), and 4.7% (n=11) of encounters, respectively. Patients with fever (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.15), recent antibiotic use (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.6), and neck tenderness on physical examination (OR: 3.01, 95% CI: 2.11, 4.3) had increased odds of undergoing imaging. A subanalysis demonstrated that 15.4% (n=37) of patients with reactive lymphadenopathy and 32.9% (n=71) of patients with adenitis were imaged, despite over 95% of these patients being discharged home. Among all patients discharged home (n=570), median [IQR] ED length of stay was 3.6 [2.7, 5.4] hours in encounters with imaging and 1.9 [1.1, 3.4] hours in encounters without imaging (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.3-1.5).

Conclusions

Historical characteristics and physical examination findings vary among children presenting to the ED with neck swelling, including among those who undergo imaging. Children diagnosed with reactive lymphadenopathy and adenitis are typically discharged home from the ED, whether or not imaging was performed, suggesting that imaging may not always be necessary in these patients. Future studies are needed to understand which presenting signs and symptoms should lead to neck imaging and which imaging modality is best.

### Can ultrasound elastography be used as a new technique in the differentiation of undescended testes and reactive lymph nodes in children? [^8323fac3]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine the diagnostic performance of ultrasound elastography in the differentiation of reactive lymph nodes and undescended testes in children.

Materials and Methods

Seventy-two undescended testes and 34 reactive lymph nodes were prospectively examined with the elastography technique. Four elastographic patterns were used for classification based on the distribution of the blue area. The strain ratios and elasticity patterns of the undescended testes and reactive lymph nodes were evaluated independently by two radiologists. Interobserver agreement and diagnostic performance were analysed.

Results

Thirty of the 34 reactive lymph nodes were classified as exhibiting high-strain elastographic patterns (considered Type 1 or Type 2, with blue areas in ˂50% of the tissue) by both observers; in contrast, 67 and 71 of 72 undescended testes were classified as exhibiting low-strain elastographic patterns (considered Type 3 or Type 4, with blue areas in >50% of tissue) by radiologists 1 and 2, respectively. The respective mean strain ratios measured by the two radiologists were 0.60±0.03 and 0.62±0.02 for the reactive lymph nodes and 0.25±0.08 and 0.25±0.09 for the undescended testes. There were significant differences in the elasticity patterns and strain ratios between the reactive lymph nodes and the undescended testes (p<0.001). The interobserver agreement was excellent for the four elasticity patterns with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.872. The concordance of the strain ratios between the observers was excellent in the present study (intra-class correlation score: 0.988).

Conclusions

In the majority of cases, conventional two-dimensional ultrasound could be used to differentiate undescended testes from reactive lymph nodes with acceptable accuracy. Although the incremental value of elastography is limited, this technique might have a role in some specific cases.

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^64a525be]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

### Clinical and metagenomic characteristics of lymphadenopathy related to fever of unknown origin in children [^245ec617]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we investigated discrepancies in the clinical manifestations of different kind of diseases in children who had both an unresolved fever for more than 1 week and lymphadenopathy. A total of 168 patients were enrolled in our study. Considering the prolonged fever resistance and the necessity of clearly determining the etiology of their disease because previous treatments were unsuccessful, pathological examinations were carried out on abnormal lymph nodes. In our study, diagnoses were determined from clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, radiographic examinations, and pathological examination, which is the gold standard. Patients were divided into five different disease groups: infectious diseases, non-infectious inflammatory diseases, neoplastic diseases, miscellaneous diseases, and undiagnosed diseases. Six undiagnosed patients were eliminated when comparing the differences in clinical manifestations. Subacute necrotizing lymphadenitis accounted for the largest proportion of cases, and acute bacterial lymphadenitis was the most common infectious disease, followed by viral infection. In Elisabetta Venturini’s research,EBV and nontuberculous mycobacteria were the most common etiological agents of lymphadenopathy, whereas only half of the patients reached a specific diagnosis through the use of one or more methods; serological, microbiological, biomolecular or histological investigations; or even surgical sample analyses. Our inclusion criteria may have led to the largest proportion of patients having necrotizing lymphadenitis, although infectious diseases also accounted for a relatively large proportion of the patients.

### Lymphadenopathy and malignancy [^696ad3cb]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with peripheral lymphadenopathy have easily identifiable causes that are benign or self-limited. Among primary care patients presenting with lymphadenopathy, the prevalence of malignancy has been estimated to be as low as 1.1 percent. The critical challenge for the primary care physician is to identify which cases are secondary to malignancies or other serious conditions. Key risk factors for malignancy include older age, firm, fixed nodal character, duration of greater than two weeks, and supraclavicular location. Knowledge of these risk factors is critical to determining the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy. In addition, a complete exposure history, review of associated symptoms, and a thorough regional examination help determine whether lymphadenopathy is of benign or malignant origin. Unexplained lymphadenopathy without signs or symptoms of serious disease or malignancy can be observed for one month, after which specific testing or biopsy should be performed. While modern hematopathologic technologies have improved the diagnostic yields of fine-needle aspiration, excisional biopsy remains the initial diagnostic procedure of choice. The overall evaluation of lymphadenopathy, with a focus on findings suggestive of malignancy, as well as an approach to the patient with unexplained lymphadenopathy, will be reviewed.

### Spectrum of [ F ] FDG-PET / CT findings in benign lymph node pathology [^f3edd657]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

Infectious Etiologies

HIV

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus that causes progressive immunodeficiency through the gradual destruction of CD4 + T-lymphocytes, resulting in the development of opportunistic infections, malignancies, and other complications. Currently, in the USA, there are 16,350 yearly deaths from AIDS-related illnesses.

Lymphadenopathy is one of the more common manifestations of HIV and can occur as a direct effect of HIV itself or secondarily from opportunistic infections and/or HIV-related malignancies. In tuberculosis-endemic regions, mycobacterial infections are the most frequent cause whereas reactive lymphadenopathy is more common in non-endemic regions. Reactive HIV adenopathy—or persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL)—is the result of a series of nodal histologic changes that the virus induces, characterized by concurrent reactive follicular hyperplasia and lysis early on with subsequent follicular regression and finally lymphocyte depletion. PGL is seen in up to 50–70 % of HIV patients. Lymph nodes are typically symmetric and painless and most commonly involve cervical, submandibular, and axillary chains. Mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and inguinal lymph nodes may be involved as well. Significant hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is rare.

PGL does not have a characteristic imaging appearance. Lymph nodes are discrete, homogeneous, and less than 1.5 cm in size. Calcifications, perinodal infiltration, and nodal necrosis are uncharacteristic. Lymph nodes appear isodense to muscle on non-contrast CT and homogeneously enhance with contrast (Fig. 2a). On MRI, they are T1-hypointense, T2-hyperintense, and similarly enhance to those on CT.

### Using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging-derived radiomics to classify cervical lymphadenopathy in children [^bf85b6f3]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy is a common clinical finding with diverse causes varying from benign to malignant. The lymphatic system undergoes rapid development during childhood and reaches its peak at puberty. Consequently, the lymph nodes may enlarge under physiological conditions. It is reported that around 28% of healthy school children have palpable lymph nodes in the neck. Furthermore, childhood is a stage at which respiratory tract infections are more likely to occur, and cervical lymph nodes enlarge in response to bacterial or viral infections. Notably, head and neck malignancies account for 12% of all pediatric malignancies ; common types include lymphoma, thyroid carcinoma, and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with persistent enlargement of lymph nodes as an early warning sign. Kikuchi disease, also referred to as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, which shows a growing trend among Asian children, is also characterized by enlarged cervical lymph nodes and is a benign and self-limiting process, but is easily confused with lymphoma clinically and histologically.

However, the differential diagnosis of pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy is quite challenging due to their overlapping non-specific manifestations, and pathological confirmation by biopsy is considered the gold standard. Currently, there is still no consensus on indication and timing of biopsy; parents are hesitant because of the invasive nature of the surgery, and their concerns include the impact general anesthesia has on children’s developing brain, risk of incision infection, and surgery costs.

For this reason, non-invasive imaging tools are becoming more and more valued. With the advantage of superior soft tissue contrast, multi-angle scanning, and no radiation damage, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might outperform ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) to some extent. T2-weighted imaging is one of the essential components of neck MRI, and is useful for detecting pathology such as inflammation, abscesses, and tumors. Some previous studies report that benign and malignant lymph nodes have different features on T2 sequences, but these features are still mainly morphological and the characterization of the internal structure is still limited. Radiomics offers an insight into the quantification of lesion characteristics that are imperceptible to human eyes but may be related to pathological changes. Recently, MRI-based radiomics models have been applied in the field of head and neck imaging, showing good performance in prediction of lymph node metastasis, extra-nodal extension status, and outcome prediction in patients with malignancy. To our knowledge, benign cervical lymphadenopathy is not covered in current MRI-based radiomics models, and studies on pediatric patients are lacking.

### Benign TdT-positive cells in pediatric and adult lymph nodes: a potential diagnostic pitfall [^8b29bee4]. Human Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Benign terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-positive cells have been documented in a variety of nonhematopoietic tissues. Scant data are, however, available on their presence in nonneoplastic lymph nodes. This study is aimed to (1) characterize the presence/distribution of benign TdT-positive cells in pediatric and adult reactive lymph nodes and (2) define the phenotype and nature of such elements. This retrospective study considered 141 reactive lymph nodes from pediatric and adult patients without history of neoplastic disease. TdT-positive cells were characterized by immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses, and their presence was correlated with the clinical-pathological features. The nature of TdT-positive cells was investigated by (1) double immunostaining for early lymphoid cell markers and (2) assessment of TdT expression in fetal lymph nodes. Sparse TdT-positive cells were documented in all pediatric cases and in most (76%) adult lymph nodes. TdT-positive cell density was higher in children than adults (15.9/mm 2 versus 8.6/mm 2 ; P < .05). TdT positivity did not correlate with any clinical or histological parameter, and double immunostaining disclosed a phenotype compatible with early lymphoid precursors (positivity for CD34 and CD10, and variable expression of CD7). A very high TdT-positive cell density (802.4/mm 2 ) was reported in all fetal lymph nodes. In conclusion, TdT-positive cells are a common finding in pediatric and adult lymph nodes. The interstitial distribution and low number of such cells allow for the differential diagnosis with precursor lymphoid neoplasms. The high density in fetal lymph nodes and the phenotype of such cells suggest their belonging to an immature lymphoid subset gradually decreasing with age.

### Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia mimicking acute appendicitis in children: a retrospective analysis of 259 cases [^cf730957]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) is a benign condition that may clinically resemble acute appendicitis in children. Although it can present with abdominal pain and non-specific imaging findings, definitive diagnosis requires histopathological confirmation. In stable patients with low inflammatory markers and inconclusive imaging, conservative management may be considered with caution.

While some RLH patients developed chronic or immune-related conditions during follow-up, this association remains observational. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify the clinical significance and natural history of RLH. A multidisciplinary approach and routine histopathological examination of appendectomy specimens are essential for accurate diagnosis and optimal care.

### Acute idiopathic scrotal edema in children – revisited [^37207eca]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Acute idiopathic scrotal edema (AISE), a self-limiting acute scrotal edema and erythema that resolves without sequela, was first reported by Qvist in 1956.

Methods

Thirty eight patients with AISE seen in the authors' department over the last 10 years were reviewed, comprising 44 episodes, most occurring in children under 10 years of age. The average age at presentation was 6.2 years. No past history of allergy was elicited.

Results

Unilateral involvement predominated (90.1%). None of the patients was found to have a primary source of scrotal, perineal, or perianal infection. Scrotal discomfort; scrotal, perineal, and inguinal swelling; and erythema were the most common findings. Laboratory and ancillary examination findings were normal, except for the occasional eosinophilia. Characteristic ultrasonographic findings, such as marked thickening of the scrotal wall, with heterogeneous and edematous appearance, increased peritesticular blood flow, mild reactive hydrocele, and enlarged inguinal lymph nodes were found. Treatment was conservative in 92.1% of the patients. Resolution of all episodes occurred within 1 to 4 days. Recurrent episodes were observed in 4 patients (10 episodes), which were clinically more severe than the original episode.

Conclusion

Clinical experience, good judgment, and color Doppler ultrasound scan can reliably identify those children with an acute scrotum who require exploration and spare those with AISE, where surgery is not indicated.

### Characteristics of intestinal-related lymphoid hyperplasia in children and its correlation with intussusception of children [^02e62284]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary intussusception in children is a common acute abdominal disease. The cause of this disease is still not fully understood. Many articles have reported that children with intussusception are often accompanied by hyperplasia of mesenteric lymph nodes and submucosal lymphoid tissue of the terminal ileum. Therefore, hyperplasia of intestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (mesenteric lymph nodes and submucosal lymphoid tissue of the intestinal tract) may be one of the main causes of intussusception. However, the characteristics and differences of intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues in healthy children and children with intussusception at different ages have not been reported. In addition, the relationship between mesenteric lymph nodes and intestinal submucosal lymphatic tissue also needs to be further understood.

Methods

73 patients with intussusception during the recovery phase who were treated in our hospital from October 2019 to October 2021 were collected as the observation group, while 101 children with healthy physical examination or diseases unrelated to intestinal lymphoid hyperplasia were collected as the control group. They were divided into different age groups of 1-6 months, 7-12 months, 13-18 months, 19-24 months, 25-36 months, 3-4 years, 5-6 years, and 7-8 years old. Ultrasonography was used to explore and scan mesenteric lymph nodes in fixed areas of the right lower abdomen and around the umbilicus. The size (cm 3 ) and number (n) of detectable lymph nodes in each region were recorded and calculated, and the total mesenteric lymph node volume (cm 3 ) of the right lower abdomen (RLTMLNV) and periumbilical region (PTMLNV) was calculated, respectively. The total mesenteric lymph node volume of each region in different ages of the two groups was analyzed.

Results

(1) There were significant differences between the control group and the observation group in the right lower abdominal total mesenteric lymph nodes volume (RLTMLNV) and the periumbilical total mesenteric lymph nodes volume (PTMLNV) (P=0.001). The mesenteric lymph nodes in the observation group showed severe hyperplasia. (2) Children with intussusceptions are usually accompanied by severe mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia. The mean volume value of RLTMLNV was greater than that of PTMLNV. Especially within 2 years of age, the mean value of RLTMLNV was significantly higher than that of PTMLNV with statistical significance (P<0.05). (3) In normal children (control group), lymph nodes in the right lower abdomen and periumbilical area showed low hyperplasia, and there was a significant difference between age groups of <2 years old and 2-8 years old (p=0.001). In the children with intussusception (observation group), the hyperplasia of mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower abdomen and around the umbilicus was severe. There was no significant difference in the proliferation of mesenteric lymphoid tissue among different age groups in the right lower abdomen (P=0.834). There was also no significant difference in hyperplasia of periumbilical mesenteric lymphoid tissue among different age groups (P=0.097).

Conclusions

Our research shows: (1) The occurrence of primary intussusception in children is related to the hyperplasia of intestinal-associated lymphoid tissue. (2) Children with intussusceptions were usually accompanied by severe mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia. The mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia was more evident in the right lower abdominal ileocecal area than in the periumbilical area before 2 years of age. RLTMLNV has better predictability of intussusception than PTMLNV. The occurrence of intussusceptions was more closely related to the hyperplasia of intestinal-associated lymphoid tissue in the right lower abdomen. (3) Normal children showed a low degree of mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia before 2 years old, moderate hyperplasia after 2 years old, and mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia in the right lower abdominal ileocecal area was basically the same as the periumbilical area. The lymphatic tissue of the right lower abdomen and periumbilical mesentery in children with intussusceptions showed severe hyperplasia, and there were no significant differences among different age groups.

Introduction: In juvenile onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) neuropsychiatric manifestations are most commonly seen. Isolated lupus headache is a known clinical feature of Neuro Psychiatric - SLE (NP-SLE) however it is more common in adults.

Objectives: To present a 10 years old girl who presented with chronic headache as the initial manifestation of NP-SLE.

Methods: 10 years old female presented to us with recurrent headache for last 6 months. Initially she was treated as migraine. However, the headache persisted. Thereafter, she started having intermittent episodes of fever and there was left cervical lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsy was done outside which was suggestive of reactive lymphocytes with epitheloid granuloma. The tuberculin sensitivity test, chest X ray were non-contributory. Antitubercular therapy was started. She then started complaining of weakness of both lower limbs and had an episode of seizure and hence admitted

### Extrapulmonary involvement in pediatric tuberculosis [^1fcf66a3]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis in childhood is clinically challenging, but it is a preventable and treatable disease. Risk factors depend on age and immunity status. The most common form of pediatric tuberculosis is pulmonary disease, which comprises more than half of the cases. Other forms make up the extrapulmonary tuberculosis that involves infection of the lymph nodes, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, hepatobiliary tree, and renal and musculoskeletal systems. Knowledge of the imaging characteristics of pediatric tuberculosis provides clues to diagnosis. This article aims to review the imaging characteristics of common sites for extrapulmonary tuberculous involvement in children.

### Mycobacterium bohemicum and cervical lymphadenitis in children [^d7c44829]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Members of the genus Mycobacterium are well-established causes of granulomatous lymphadenitis in children. M. bohemicum was first described in 1998 in a patient with Down syndrome. The organism is characterized by a unique 16S rRNA gene sequence and has been isolated from humans, animals, and the environment. Published data on M. bohemicum are limited to the original species description and 5 additional case reports (–).

We report on 4 cases of cervical lymphadenitis caused by M. bohemicum that occurred in 4 children (2 boys, 2 girls) from Austria during 2002–2006. Age range of the children was 2.5–3.5 years (Table). Each child was admitted to the hospital with a history of 2–3 weeks of submandibular swelling that did not respond to oral antimicrobial therapy.

Table 
Characteristics of 4 children with cervical lymphadenitis caused by Mycobacterium bohemicum, Austria, 2002–2006*

*All patients had negative PCR results for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex; all patients recovered completely with no relapse. †Patient had history of psychomotor disorder after perinatal asphyxia.

Physical examination showed enlarged cervical lymph nodes under normal skin. Laboratory evaluation showed leukocyte and differential counts within normal limits and a negative result (<2 mg/L) for C-reactive protein. Ultrasonography demonstrated enlarged lymph nodes with heterogeneous echo and a central lacuna-like lesion.

Lymph nodes were excised from each patient. Histologic examination of the nodes demonstrated granulomatous and partly necrotizing inflammation (Table). PCR results for M. tuberculosis complex were negative. For 3 patients, the affected lymph nodes were completely removed and no antimicrobial therapy was prescribed. For the other patient, removal of the affected lymph node was incomplete, and clarithromycin and rifampicin for 3 months were prescribed. All patients remained healthy for >12 months after therapy.

Introduction: Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) are a group of disorders characterized by periodic or persistent activation of the innate immune system. About 50% of patients present with an undefined picture and represent a real diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

Objectives: To describe the clinical characteristics, laboratory assessment, genetic findings and treatment response in a cohort of patients with undefined systemic autoinflammatory disease (SAIDs) characterized by a diffuse lymphatic involvement.

Methods: Patients from our Pediatric Rheumatology unit with undefined SAIDs and diffuse lymphatic involvement were included. Demographic, clinical, instrumental and laboratory characteristics and therapeutic approaches were collected

Results: We described four patients with recurrent, unexplained, episodes of systemic inflammation. All patients presented with recurrent episodes of fever, with irregular pattern and duration, in the absence of triggering factors. Skin rash was frequent and in two out of 4 patients gastrointestinal involvement with diarrhea was detected. All cases presented with a significant involvement of the lymphatic system (hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy) radiologically detected (ultrasound, CT or MRI). Lymph-node biopsy was performed in three cases (75%) showing reactive histologic features. Blood exams revealed in all cases an increase of inflammatory markers during febrile episodes with a persistent hypergammaglobulinemia (IgG mean value 16.57). Immunological studies did not reveal abnormal values in lymphocyte subpopulations. Double negative T lymphocytes were normal and Oliveira's criteria for the diagnosis of ALPS were not satisfied in none of the patients. Interferon-gamma induced chemokines dosage showed a mild increase of values (CXCL9 mean value 545; CXCL10 mean value 786) suggesting a marginal involvement of this inflammatory pathway. Genetic tests, performed in all patients, did not revealed pathogenic variants associated with monogenic diseases. Glucocorticoid systemic therapy was effective in all cases but a quickly relapse of the disease was observed during tapering phase. We tried first line non-biological (Sirolimus) and biological treatments (Il-1 Inhibitors) with poor or incomplete response. In three out of 4 patients Il-6 Inhibitor (Tocilizumab) was started with good response, complete control of fever and partial regression of lymphatic involvement demonstrating a clear involvement of this inflammatory cytokine in this subgroup of “undefined” autoinflammatory diseases.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound of the small organs in children [^3e709cbf]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic performance of CEUS for the evaluation of superficial lymph nodes has not been reported in the pediatric literature. However, adult studies of IV CEUS with qualitative evaluation and, more recently, quantitative assessment of vascular flow kinetics derived from contrast injection have been performed to differentiate among reactive, inflammatory and metastatic superficial lymphadenopathy. These studies showed that CEUS improves the conspicuity of the nodal perfusion pattern compared to vascular flow assessment with color/power Doppler US. CEUS imaging of a normal lymph node in early arterial phase shows hilar enhancement with the artery entering the hilum and spreading centrifugally. At that point, the whole lymph node rapidly enhances intensely and homogeneously. Lymph nodes can have homogeneous or non-homogeneous enhancement and have various intranodal vascular patterns on CEUS, similar to the lymph node Doppler US descriptions. Lymph node architecture might be preserved early on in inflammation and lymphomatous infiltration. In lymphoma, new capillary circulation increases the blood flow to the node, producing a hyperenhancing CEUS appearance. Increased flow through normal hilar vessels in reactive lymph nodes results in hyperemia that can be difficult to distinguish from lymphoma.

### Using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging-derived radiomics to classify cervical lymphadenopathy in children [^1453b18e]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Distinguishing four different etiologies of lymph nodes

Model 2 was established on a basis of 147 Kikuchi disease’ lymph nodes, 131 reactive lymph nodes, 44 suppurative lymph nodes, and 97 malignant lymph nodes. Finally, the 16 most useful features were retained by LASSO including one first-order feature, one shape feature, six texture features, and eight higher-order features. Their coefficients are displayed in Fig. 6 and a detailed explanation of these features is shown in Table 2. For distinguishing each etiology (Kikuchi disease, reactive hyperplasia, suppurative lymphadenitis, and malignancy respectively), an AUC of 0.97, 0.91, 0.88, and 0.87, respectively was achieved in the training set, and an AUC of 0.96, 0.80, 0.82, and 0.82, respectively was achieved in the testing set. Radiomics features yielded the highest AUC value for the differentiation of Kikuchi disease from the other three etiologies both in the training and testing sets (Fig. 7). The detailed performance is shown in Table 4.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance and interpretation of diagnostic ultrasound of the thyroid and extracranial head and neck [^88ae1847]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cervical lymph node ultrasound evaluation—Sonographic examination of cervical lymph nodes may be comprehensive or focused, as appropriate for the clinical question and scenario. The size and location of abnormal lymph nodes should be documented, and suspicious nodal morphology including, but not limited to, calcification, cysts/ focal echogenic areas that are unrelated to a fatty hilum, and abnormal blood flow should be documented. Round shape and absence of echogenic hilum, although reported in malignant nodes, are findings with poor specificity in thyroid cancer. Location of abnormal lymph node(s) should be documented with annotations and/or enough visual information to describe the location according to the image-based nodal classification system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery, or in a fashion that allows the referring clinician to convert the location of abnormal nodes to that system. Node evaluation should be performed at centers with experienced personnel, and lymph node size varies with nodal compartment with node size often less important in malignancy assessment than nodal morphology. Enlarged cervical nodes can be seen in lymphoma and other malignancies but are often reactive and are seen in acute and chronic infections and inflammatory disease processes such as postviral syndromes and Hashimoto thyroiditis. In the pediatric population, cervical lymph node size, echotexture, vascularity, and potential nodal suppuration or abscess-formation evaluation are important in the evaluation of acute lymphadenitis.

Clinical presentation

The presentation of BPDCN is quite diverse and can involve the skin, BM, lymph nodes, and extra-nodal sites, including the CNS. Some pediatric patients have only BM involvement at diagnosis, but others can initially present with skin erythema and lymphadenopathy, which is often associated with fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), before rapidly developing BM and CNS disease. These presentations may vary within the pediatric age group, but this is difficult to define given the limited number of cases. In contrast to adult patients, pediatric patients often present with multiorgan involvement, DIC, and tumor lysis syndrome as demonstrated in our case review.

Cutaneous involvement

About 75–90% of BPDCN patients in all ages have cutaneous involvement at presentation. Cutaneous involvement typically includes solitary, localized, or generalized vascular plaques or tumors that commonly occur on the head and neck or upper trunk. Many of these lesions demonstrate a characteristic bruise-like violaceous hue owing to intratumoral hemorrhage. Although skin lesions can take longer to clear than disease noted in the PB, BM, and lymph nodes, these lesions can be used as an additional marker of treatment response. In previous reviews, pediatric BPDCN patients without cutaneous lesions had better clinical outcomes compared to those with cutaneous involvement. In contrast, survival outcomes did not differ significantly between adults with and without cutaneous involvement. In our review of the reported pediatric cases, 52 cases (80%) noted positive skin findings, in which the vast majority of cases explicitly documented skin exam at diagnosis. As compared to the literature in adult patients, this pediatric population had a slightly lower rate of skin-only presentations (25% vs 35% in pediatric and adult patients respectively, as noted in Table 1).

Hematolymphoid

Many BPDCN patients have cytopenias, reactive lymphadenopathy, and/or splenomegaly, and about half present with disease identified in lymph nodes. Hepatic involvement is more common in patients with extensive BM disease. These patients can present with significant coagulopathy and can develop life-threatening DIC. In our review of the available pediatric case reports, 43 (75.4%) and 15 (39.4%) cases had documented disease in BM and PB respectively. It is again important to note that only 57 (82.6%) and 38 (55%) of cases reported BM and PB at diagnosis, perhaps the latter being related to the belief that if the bone marrow is positive, the entire hematologic compartment is positive. This is slightly higher than presented adult data as noted in Table 1.

### Progressive transformation of germinal centers in children and adolescents: an intriguing cause of lymphadenopathy [^d99de1b8]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical implications of a diagnosis of progressive transformation of germinal centers (PTGC) in children are not well known.

Methods

To better understand this entity, we conducted a retrospective review of all patients aged 0-18 years diagnosed with PTGC at our center between 1998 and 2010.

Results

Twenty-nine patients were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 11.5 years, and median duration of follow-up was 2.8 years. Thirteen patients (45%) had a single episode of PTGC with no other associated features. Five patients (17%) had recurrent PTGC. Four patients (14%) had PTGC associated with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL): one preceding, two concurrent, and one subsequently developed HL. The most commonly associated HL was nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL. Seven patients (24%) had PTGC associated with immune disorders, including lupus, Castleman disease, and probable autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. Overall, 15 patients (52%) had more than one lymph node biopsy. The cumulative incidence of a second biopsy after a diagnosis of PTGC was 42.3% ± 12.2% at 4 years. PTGC was PET-avid in all four patients tested.

Conclusions

PTGC is a nonspecific manifestation of a variety of associated conditions. There is a small risk of subsequent HL, and a larger risk of requiring multiple biopsies for recurrent PTGC. The presence of an immune disorder should be considered in patients who present with generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, immune cytopenias, and/or progression to HL. Routine surveillance imaging may not be required. Future research should determine the optimal surveillance strategy for patients with PTGC and the indications for repeat biopsies.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^235ccf95]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The general approach to lymphadenopathy

Lymphadenopathy represents a major diagnostic challenge, because it may be observed in a variety of neoplastic, infectious and inflammatory diseases. The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in rheumatologic disorders is not straightforward: it may be the consequence of a primary immune activation and a benign aspect of the natural history of the immune-mediated condition, represent an infectious complication of immunosuppressive therapies, correlate to an unrelated immune process (i.e. vaccination), or indicate a lymphoproliferative transformation or metastasis from distant solid cancers requiring immediate management.

History should focus on the presence of localized signs or symptoms that may hint towards infection or malignancy (e.g. presence of a wound or a suspicious nodule, respectively), as well as on potential exposures associated with infection (e.g. contact with animals, undercooked food, risk factors). The presence of constitutional symptoms such as low-grade fever (i.e. <38°C), night sweats and unexplained weight loss are not differentiating. In contrast, high fever (i.e. >38°C) is most commonly associated with infections. An accurate drug history is also helpful because of medications potentially causing serum sickness. Finally, acute onset of lymph node enlargement is more suggestive of an infectious and iatrogenic cause, whilst subacute or insidious onset points towards malignant and inflammatory causes.

Physical examination

Localized swelling typically points towards an infectious condition in the area of node drainage, even though some systemic diseases [e.g. certain lymphomas and unicentric Castleman disease (CD)] may present with localized lymphadenopathy. On the other hand, generalized lymphadenopathy is associated with lymphoproliferative disorders and systemic rheumatologic conditions. Of note, supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy should raise particular attention, because they are frequent sites of tumour metastasis. The most important characteristics to evaluate during physical examination of enlarged lymph nodes are size, consistency, fixation and tenderness. ‘Red flags’ for malignancy are a diameter >1cm (2 cm for inguinal lymph nodes), hard consistency, fixation to subcutaneous tissue and absence of tenderness, even though these characteristics can also be found in inflammatory non-neoplastic diseases such as CD and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD).

### Quantitative vascular feature-based multimodality prediction model for multi-origin malignant cervical lymphadenopathy [^f83e8853]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical lymphadenopathy is a systematic disease with multiple etiologies, including reactive hyperplasia, tuberculosis, metastasis, lymphoma, and rare entities.The risk of malignancy increases with age, and the rate of such cases is as high as nearly 75% among patients older than 40 years.Malignant cervical lymphadenopathy may originate from different primary tumors, which reflects the biological tendency of primary cancer cells from different organs to disseminate through the lymphatic vasculature. Careful vigilance is warranted given that this situation indicates an unfavorable prognosis. Currently, nodal biopsy is commonly performed to clarify the nature of cervical lymphadenopathy.However, benign cervical lymphadenopathy accounts for up to 30.7% of cases involving biopsy for suspected malignant cervical lymphadenopathy.Additionally, biopsy is an invasive procedure, with potential risks of surgical complications and healthcare service burdens. Accordingly, a trustworthy method is needed for assessing cervical lymphadenopathy before biopsy.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^1b75a92f]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of pediatric thyroid nodules—fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and ultrasound (US) features: The 2009 adult guidelines indicate that FNA is not warranted for evaluation of a nodule < 1 cm in size unless the patient is considered high-risk or the nodule is associated with pathologic regional lymph nodes; in children, size alone does not predict malignant histology, so US characteristics and clinical context should be used to identify nodules that warrant FNA. Features more common in malignant lesions include hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, increased intranodular blood flow, microcalcifications, and abnormal cervical lymph nodes, and in all children with a suspicious nodule, US evaluation of the cervical lymph nodes should be performed.

### Normal mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes in children on multi-detector row chest computed tomography [^177b4d8f]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

In conclusion, when evaluating lymph nodes in the paediatric chest on multi-detector CT one has to realise that lymph nodes are common at many mediastinal and hilar locations and that the size of normal lymph nodes is, not surprisingly, smaller in young children than that quoted for adolescents and adults. This may aid the diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in childhood.

### Spectrum of [ F ] FDG-PET / CT findings in benign lymph node pathology [^2bfbff13]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diffuse lymphadenopathy has a long differential diagnosis that includes both malignant and benign causes. As part of the lymphadenopathy work-up, many patients undergo [ 18 F]FDG-PET/CT for purposes of ruling out malignancy. FDG-avid lymph nodes, however, are not specific for malignancy. This review will illustrate the spectrum of nodal findings on FDG-PET/CT with correlation to other cross-sectional imaging and clinical history in patients with representative infectious, inflammatory, and benign lymphoproliferative disorders. These findings are important for the nuclear medicine radiologist to understand, as they can represent common pitfalls in the work-up of lymphadenopathy. While FDG-PET/CT may be limited in ascertaining a definitive diagnosis in a disease process as the cause of lymphadenopathy, it can help to narrow this differential and rule out certain diseases in the correct clinical context.

These findings are important for the nuclear medicine radiologist to understand, as they can represent common pitfalls in the work-up of lymphadenopathy. While FDG-PET/CT may be limited in ascertaining a definitive diagnosis in a disease process as the cause of lymphadenopathy, it can help to narrow this differential and rule out certain diseases in the correct clinical context.

### The sonographic characteristics of nontuberculous mycobacterial cervicofacial lymphadenitis in children [^4492a1ad]. Pediatric Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a common cause of chronic cervicofacial lymphadenitis in young children. The differential diagnosis includes other infections, lymphoepithelial cysts and malignancies.

Objective

To assess the sonographic findings of NTM cervicofacial lymphadenitis in children.

Materials and Methods

We analysed the sonograms of cervicofacial lymph nodes of 145 children with microbiologically proven NTM lymphadenitis.

Results

The size of the involved lymph nodes ranged from 1.9 cm to 4.4 cm. Most of the NTM patients (85%) presented in a stage of lymph node fluctuation with violaceous skin discoloration. On sonography, marked decreased echogenicity was seen in all cases. In 133 of the patients (92%) liquefaction with intranodal cystic necrosis, nodal matting and adjacent soft-tissue oedema were present. 66 children received antibiotic treatment, and the other children underwent surgical excision of the involved lymph nodes. In 69% of the patients successfully treated with antibiotics, multiple intranodal calcifications were present on sonography after 1 year.

Conclusions

Sonographic findings can provide additional diagnostic clues for NTM lymphadenitis in childhood. A marked decrease of echogenicity in the early stages, with intranodal liquefaction in the advanced stages, are universal features, albeit not entirely specific. Multiple intranodal calcifications are rather characteristic of end-stage mycobacterial infection.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^d1a13ece]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphadenopathy is a common clinical finding and diagnostic challenge within general medicine and rheumatology practice. It may represent a primary manifestation of an underlying immune-mediated disease or indicate an infectious or neoplastic complication requiring differing management. Evaluating lymphadenopathy is of particular relevance in rheumatology, given that lymph node enlargement is a common finding within the clinical spectrum of several well-known rheumatologic disorders including RA, SLE and SS. In addition, lymphadenopathy represents a hallmark manifestation of rare immunological diseases such as Castleman disease and IgG4-related disease that must be considered in the differential diagnosis because effective targeted treatments can now impact the prognosis of these conditions. In this review we present an overview of the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in common and rare rheumatologic diseases and propose a practical approach to lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice. Differential diagnosis of Castleman disease and therapeutic options for this condition of increasing rheumatologic interest will be discussed in detail.

### Cervical lymph node characterization using point shear wave elastography in pediatric patients: initial experience [^fb0e5c55]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sonoelastography, also known as elastography, is a novel noninvasive imaging technique conducted using ultrasound equipment and used to indirectly evaluate tissue stiffness by measuring the speed of transverse wave propagation, or shear wave velocity, through the target tissue. Elastography is useful in diagnosing malignant lesions, which are stiffer than healthy tissue due to their high cell density.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the ability of elastography to differentiate between benign and malignant cervical lymph nodes.

Materials and Methods

Over a period of 2.5 years, we prospectively assessed the cervical lymph nodes of pediatric patients who visited the ultrasound department of our institution. In the course of a single procedure, participants underwent B-mode and color Doppler ultrasonography and point shear wave elastography (pSWE) of the cervical lymph nodes. The participants were divided into three groups: control (I), reactive lymph nodes (II), and malignant lymph nodes (III). A histological examination was performed in all patients with suspected malignancy, and mean shear wave velocity was compared across the three study groups.

Results

Significant differences in elastography measurements were found between the lymph nodes in group I (control group) and group III (malignant lymph nodes) (P<0.0001) and between group II (reactive nodes) and group III (malignant nodes) (P<0.0001). Lymph nodes from patients in group III had higher elastography values than those in groups I and II.

Conclusion

pSWE is useful in measuring cervical lymph node stiffness, showing promising results in distinguishing between benign/reactive and malignant nodes.

### Cervical lymphadenopathy in childhood epidemiology and management [^7ec8f5ff]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Cervical lymphadenopathy (CL) is common in childhood. The aim of this study is to evaluate the etiology, follow-up, and treatment of persistent CL. The authors studied retrospectively 50 children with CL, hospitalized at the Department of Pediatrics and Pediatrics Surgery. Patients underwent ultrasonography. Thirty-six percent presented abnormal ultrasonographic image and underwent excisional biopsy. Biopsies revealed 4 thyroglossal cysts, 3 branchial cysts, 1 hemangioma, 2 sebaceous cysts, 1 dermoid cyst, 5 occurrences of tuberculosis lymphadenitis, 1 occurrence of Bartonella henselae lymphadenopathy, and 1 case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In conclusion, CL is usually a benign finding; bacterial and viral infections are the most common causes. Ultrasonography help in etiology and follow-up of CL.

### Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and reactive lymphadenopathy in Uganda [^27db8531]. Human Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes Kaposi sarcoma and is also associated with primary effusion lymphoma, a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and multicentric Castleman disease. Because KSHV infection is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, we sought to identify cases of KSHV-positive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) and reactive lymphadenopathy in this region. One hundred forty-four cases (80 NHLs, 64 reactive lymph nodes) from the major pathology laboratory in Uganda were reviewed. One NHL was KSHV-positive, as indicated by staining for the viral latent nuclear antigen. This NHL was a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in a 5-year-old boy. The tumor was also Epstein-Barr virus-positive. In addition, 2 reactive lymph nodes, both classified histologically as follicular involution, stained KSHV latent nuclear antigen-positive and thus most likely represent multicentric Castleman disease. In all 3 KSHV-positive cases, a minority of cells expressed KSHV viral interleukin 6, a biologically active cytokine homolog. In conclusion, we show that KSHV is rarely associated with lymphoproliferative disorders in sub-Saharan Africa. We describe the first case of a KSHV-positive NHL from this region; this case is also the first reported pediatric lymphoma associated with KSHV infection.

Tuberculous lymphadenitis—recommended regimen and procedures: We believe a 6-month regimen is adequate for initial treatment of all patients with drug-susceptible tuberculous lymphadenitis. Affected lymph nodes may enlarge and new nodes can appear during or after therapy without evidence of bacteriological relapse. Therapeutic lymph node excision is not indicated except in unusual circumstances; aspiration of large fluctuant nodes has been reported by some experts to be beneficial although not examined systematically. Incision and drainage of cervical lymphadenitis has been associated with prolonged wound discharge and scarring, and in US children the majority of lymphatic mycobacterial disease is caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^99008ccf]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

IgG4-related disease

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding in the setting IgG4-RD, being reported in 30–55% of cases. Swollen lymph nodes are usually painless, with a diameter of 1–3 cm, though they can grow as large as 5 cm. In this context, lymphadenopathy may become symptomatic due to compression of adjacent structures (e.g. hydronephrosis due to ureter compression, lower limbs oedema due to inferior vena cava or iliac vein compression). Lymphadenopathy is frequently generalized and the most commonly involved lymph node stations are mediastinal, axillary, intra-abdominal, cervical and inguinal. Lymphadenopathy can be documented in IgG4-RD in four main clinical contexts. First, enlarged lymph nodes are incidentally found in the excision specimen of extranodal tissue demonstrating IgG4-RD features. Second, lymphadenopathy may be documented incidentally with physical examination or imaging during the diagnostic workup of extranodal disease. Third, lymphadenopathy may arise weeks to years after diagnosis of extranodal disease. Fourth, generalized lymphadenopathy may be the first presenting symptom of IgG4-RD, weeks to years before extranodal disease appears. Recently, IgG4-RD has been arrayed into four clinical phenotypes, based on the observation of patterns of clinical presentation. These groups are: (group 1) pancreato-hepatobiliary disease (31% of patients), (group 2) retroperitoneum and aorta (24%), (group 3) head and neck–limited (24%) and (group 4) Mikulicz’s syndrome with systemic involvement (22%). Lymphadenopathy is more frequently encountered in group 4, with 67% of frequency (second most common organ involved after submandibular gland). On the other hand, group 1 features the lowest frequency with 15%, while group 2 and 3 display lymphadenopathy in roughly 25% of cases. At the microscopic level, lymph nodes can express five types of histologic pattern, all characterized by increased accumulation of IgG4+ plasma cells and by a IgG4/IgG ratio >40% at immunohistochemistry. Pattern 1 is highly reminiscent of the plasmacytic histopathological subtype of MCD and is characterized by intact nodal architecture with hyperplastic follicles as well as follicles with some degree of germinal centre regression and possible penetration by venules. The interfollicular space displays increased high endothelial venules and abundant plasma cells. Pattern 2 shows a typical reactive follicular hyperplasia, encountered in other autoimmune diseases such as SLE and RA. Pattern 3 is characterized by normal or variably regressed follicles with marked expansion of the interfollicular space. This area is filled by prominent high endothelial venules, immunoblasts, small lymphocytes plasma cells and eosinophils. Pattern 4 is notable for the presence of ‘transformed’ germinal centres, two to four times larger than those of background follicles, which become ameboid or stellate shaped. Their follicles display a thickened mantle zone with inward protrusions into germinal centres. Pattern 5, known as ‘inflammatory pseudotumor-like’, is the least common and is characterized by replacement of the nodal parenchyma by sclero-hyaline tissue. Collagen fibers in this context may organize into a storiform pattern similar to that observed in other organ involved by IgG4-RD. Importantly, histological patterns may not be fully discriminating and specimens may contain more than one pattern at a time (Fig. 1).

### Cervical lymph node biopsies in the evaluation of children with suspected lymphoproliferative disorders: experience in a tertiary pediatric setting [^bed334d6]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the incidence of lymphoproliferative disorders in a cohort of patients requiring a biopsy at a tertiary pediatric center; and (2) to elucidate the demographic, clinical, laboratory and diagnostic imaging characteristics associated with a malignant diagnosis.

Methods

A retrospective review of pediatric cervical lymph node biopsies performed between 2012 and 2019 at a tertiary center was undertaken. Demographic data, clinical presentations, laboratory results, diagnostic imaging findings, and pathology results were compiled and analyzed to identify characteristics associated with a malignant diagnosis.

Results

Malignancy was identified in 49.5% of patients (55/111) subjected to a cervical lymph node biopsy. The median age of patients with a benign diagnosis was lower than malignant diagnosis (11.0 vs. 14.0 years, p < 0.01). Mediastinal lymphadenopathy based on chest radiography and/or computed tomography scan was identified in 37/49 malignant cases (75.5%) CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, 49.5% of biopsies performed at a tertiary pediatric setting yielded a malignant diagnosis. Traditional clinical characteristics such as weight loss, night sweats and nodal texture were not informative when derived retrospectively. The most valuable features identified were increased age, increased long and short axis measurements of the involved node(s), and the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound of the small organs in children [^2e43c8a5]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Qualitative CEUS adult studies coupled with time-intensity analysis have been performed in people with suspected metastatic lymphadenopathy, often in the setting of head and neck cancer. A variety of CEUS enhancement patterns for benign/reactive and malignant nodes have been described. In one study, intense but homogeneous enhancement was more commonly associated with reactive lymphadenopathy, whereas predominantly peripheral enhancement with perfusion defects or complete absence of enhancement were indicative of malignancy. An early study using color Doppler US classified the intranodal vascular patterns into eight categories ranging from straight longitudinal hilar vessels with or without peripheral branches to significant alteration of nodal angioarchitecture with distortion and curved course of vessels, presence of aberrant or subcapsular vessels and complete absence of enhancement. The greater the degree of vascular distortion, the higher the risk of malignancy. This classification system was later applied in a different study comparing CEUS to Doppler US in a cohort of adults with clinically enlarged superficial nodes scheduled for needle biopsy. In this study the addition of CEUS did not improve the diagnostic accuracy of Doppler techniques to detect more malignant lymph nodes. In clinical practice, lymphadenitis can be observed with serial US imaging, and metastatic disease and tuberculosis can be diagnosed after core-needle biopsy, whereas lymphoma requires histological evaluation following surgical excision. One study in adults suggested that the intranodal contrast enhancement pattern could guide selection of which nodes should be biopsied, excised or observed with serial imaging. This study demonstrated that CEUS can distinguish metastatic and tuberculous lymph nodes from lymphoma, which helps to guide the choice between biopsy and excision. Two enhancement characteristics on CEUS were more indicative for the diagnosis of tuberculous or metastatic lymph nodes: peripheral perfusion in the early arterial phase and inhomogeneous spotted/cycle-like enhancement in the equilibrium phase. In cases of tuberculosis or metastatic infiltration, these signs have sensitivity and specificity of 80.4% and 81.2%, respectively. On the contrary, progressive centrifugal enhancement pattern like a “snowstorm” in the arterial phase, with diffuse and uniform homogeneous enhancement in the parenchymal phase, was seen in the majority of patients with lymphoma.

### Clinical features and recurrence predictors of histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis in Chinese children [^ca9eb12f]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (HNL), also known as Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, is a rare and benign inflammatory condition of unknown etiology that mainly affects young adults and children of Asian origin. The incidence of HNL is not well established, but it is estimated to range from 0.3 to 4.6 cases per 100,000 population per year in different regions of the world, with higher rates in Asia and lower rates in Europe and America. The most common clinical manifestation of HNL is localized lymphadenopathy, often accompanied by fever and other systemic symptoms. The diagnosis of HNL is based on histopathological examination of lymph node biopsy. HNL usually has a self-limiting course and resolves spontaneously within a few weeks to months. However, some children may experience recurrence after achieving clinical remission. The risk factors for HNL recurrence in pediatric patients have been poorly studied, and the recurrence rates vary across different countries and regions. We retrospectively reviewed 181 pediatric patients with histopathologically confirmed HNL at Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University from January 2018 to May 2023. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the clinical features and recurrence predictors of HNL in children.

### Clinical characteristics and risk factors for recurrence of kikuchi-fujimoto disease in children: a case-control study [^834c575e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This study was a retrospective, single-center case-control study. The clinical data of children who underwent lymph node biopsy in the department of infectious diseases of Beijing Children’s Hospital from April 2018 to April 2022 were collected and analyzed. The children diagnosed with histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis by lymph node biopsy were classified as KFD group. At the same time, the children who were diagnosed as granulomatous inflammation of lymph nodes, reactive hyperplasia of lymph nodes, acute suppurative lymphadenitis, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma by histopathological biopsy due to lymphadenopathy were enrolled as the control group. The clinical characteristics of children with KFD and the control group were compared. The clinical characteristics of FANA (fluorescent antinuclear antibody) positive group and FANA negative group in children with KFD were compared. The children with KFD were divided into recurrence group and non-recurrence group, and the risk factors for recurrence of KFD were analyzed.

The gender, age, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory tests, the pathological results, antibiotic therapy, corticosteroid therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin and the recurrence status of the cases were collected by reviewing the electronic medical records and by telephone follow-up. The follow-up time point was April 2024. Corticosteroid tapering is done within approximately two months. Recurrence was defined as a recurring symptoms and signs ≥ 2 months after treatment and resolution of symptoms. Recurrent cases included either a clinical or pathological diagnosis of KFD after the initial pathological diagnosis.

Descriptive statistics were presented as mean or median for continuous variables and as frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed in the present study. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 software (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA).

### Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia mimicking acute appendicitis in children: a retrospective analysis of 259 cases [^eac8bfe2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and ethics approval

This retrospective study was conducted by reviewing the medical records of pediatric patients who underwent surgery for suspected acute appendicitis at our institution between January 2013 and January 2025. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Health Sciences, Ümraniye Training and Research Hospital (Approval No: 93, Date: 10.04.2025). Informed consent was waived by the committee due to the retrospective nature of the study. All procedures complied with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committees and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments.

Patient selection

A total of 3,469 pediatric appendectomy cases were screened. Histopathology reports were reviewed, and patients with no histological evidence of inflammation—defined by absence of neutrophilic infiltration—and a diagnosis of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) were included (n = 259). Exclusion criteria included surgeries for indications other than suspected acute appendicitis, or presence of additional pathological findings beyond RLH.

Data collection and variables

For the RLH group, the following variables were retrospectively retrieved from patient records and digital hospital archives:

Demographics (age, sex).
Presenting symptoms and their duration.
Laboratory results: white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP).
Imaging findings from ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Intraoperative surgical findings.
Histopathology reports.
Length of hospital stay.
Additional diagnoses during postoperative follow-up.

For laboratory evaluation, WBC > 10,000/mm³ and CRP > 5 mg/L were considered elevated based on widely used clinical thresholds in pediatric surgical practice. These cut-off values were not derived from statistical models such as ROC analysis and are acknowledged as a limitation. Imaging findings suggestive of appendicitis, such as appendix diameter ≥ 6 mm, presence of free fluid, lymphadenopathy, and increased mesenteric echogenicity, were recorded.

As this study focused solely on patients with histopathologically confirmed RLH, data from the remaining patients with confirmed acute appendicitis were not included in the long-term or comparative analysis. This observational design limits direct comparison between RLH and non-RLH patients, which is addressed as a study limitation.

### Spectrum of [ F ] FDG-PET / CT findings in benign lymph node pathology [^86ec93c5]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The differential for diffuse lymphadenopathy includes numerous malignant and benign etiologies, many of which demonstrate FDG avidity on PET/CT. Traditional quantitative PET/CT parameters, such as SUV max, have not been shown to be able to accurately distinguish among these benign and malignant causes, limiting its role in diagnosis and screening. However, when used in conjunction with other cross-sectional imaging and knowledge of the nodal distribution, extranodal findings, epidemiology, and clinical presentation, FDG-PET/CT can help considerably in narrowing this differential diagnosis. And while currently limited in practice, FDG-PET/CT has the potential to play an increasingly larger role in patients with known causes for diffuse lymphadenopathy in terms of assessment of disease extent and treatment efficacy as well as in regard to treatment planning.

### Diagnostic value of ultrasound in pediatric acute abdominal pain: a cross-sectional study from a tertiary center in Southern iran [^f2bd1c37]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2 
Characteristics of abdominal pain and associated symptoms in the study population

Out of the total study population, 115 patients (66%) had normal sonographic findings. Among the abnormal findings, abdominal free fluid was the most prevalent, observed in 13 patients (7.5%). Appendicitis was identified in 8 patients (4.6%), while renal stones and intestinal obstruction were each detected in 5 patients (2.9%). Intussusception was noted in 4 patients (2.3%). Less common findings included mesenteric lymphadenitis and reactive lymph nodes, each seen in 3 patients (1.7%). Cholecystitis, hydronephrosis, pseudo-kidney appearance, and inguinal hernia were each reported in 2 patients (1.1%). Rare sonographic findings, each present in one patient (0.6%), included mesenteric inflammation, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), right lower quadrant lymphadenopathy (RLQ LAP), urinary bladder distention, cervical lymphadenopathy, distended gallbladder with sludge, ileus, ovarian cyst, collection posterior to the urinary bladder, fatty liver, liver cyst, urinary bladder debris, intestinal infection, and kidney stasis. Although free fluid was the most commonly observed abnormal sonographic finding, none of the patients in this group were diagnosed with complicated appendicitis. These findings highlight the diversity of underlying pathologies in pediatric patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, emphasizing the diagnostic value of sonography in this clinical setting (Table 3).

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^07325d5e]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Lymphadenopathy is a frequent clinical finding in rheumatology practice and can often be interpreted as a clinical marker of disease activity. Moreover, lymphadenopathy can be the initial or more prominent manifestation of rare rheumatologic diseases, such as IgG4-RD and CD, the complications of which are potentially life-threatening. Early recognition and prompt treatment of these diseases may significantly impact on mortality and morbidity. Nevertheless, since rheumatologic patients are at higher risk of infectious and neoplastic complications, a careful differential diagnosis is of the utmost importance.

### Dermatopathic reaction of lymph nodes in HTLV-1 carriers: a spectrum of reactive and neoplastic lesions [^2104fc61]. Histopathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Dermatopathic reaction is a histopathological finding of lymph nodes that usually occurs in patients with inflammatory pruritic cutaneous lesions. However, it is sometimes seen in patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a T cell malignancy caused by infection with human T cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV‐1), which is frequently accompanied by cutaneous lesions. However, the detailed clinicopathological characteristics of the dermatopathic reaction of lymph nodes in ATLL patients and HTLV‐1 carriers, addressed in this study, remains to be clarified.

Methods and results

We retrospectively analysed 18 nodal lesions with dermatopathic reaction in HTLV‐1 carriers. Axillary and inguinal lymph nodes were the primary affected tissues. Three cases with atypical lymphoid cell infiltration were defined as ATLL with dermatopathic reaction (ATLL‐D), showing an abnormal T cell immunophenotype and T cell monoclonality. Two of the three ATLL‐D patients died 14 and 7 months after diagnosis (the third case had a very short follow‐up). The other 15 patients were indistinguishable from reactive lesions and were defined as HTLV‐1‐associated lymphadenitis with dermatopathic reaction (HAL‐D). They showed an indolent clinical course, with only one case eventually transforming to aggressive disease.

Conclusions

Lymph node lesions accompanied by dermatopathic reaction in HTLV1 carriers represent a spectrum that includes reactive and neoplastic conditions. HAL‐D should be distinguished from ATLL‐D, especially to avoid overtreatment.

### IgG4-related disease: what a hematologist needs to know [^00278d79]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

IgG4-RD can affect nearly any organ except synovial tissue. This “fibro-inflammatory” disease presents with tumefactive (puffy) inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis with a predilection for glandular tissue. Figure 1 illustrates the manifestations of IgG4-RD by organ system. The most common organ manifestations from two large cohorts, one Japanese and one American, are shown in Table 1. In patients presenting with the better-known features of IgG4-RD, such as autoimmune pancreatitis, orbital disease and major salivary gland involvement, the disease tends to be recognized and histologically confirmed earlier, but patients referred to hematologists may present with less obvious features of IgG4-RD, and a high index of suspicion is needed to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. Common reasons for referral to a hematologist include lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.

Figure 1. 
Manifestations of IgG4-related disease by organ system. The most common primary disease features are indicated in bold.

Table 1. 
Clinical characteristics of patients from two large published cohorts.

Lymphadenopathy

IgG4-related lymphadenopathy is one of the three most common manifestations of IgG4-RD, affecting 30-60% of patients with IgG4-RD in most large cohorts (Table 1). IgG4-lymphadenompathy may be generalized or localized (the latter typically contiguous with involved organs such as pancreas and lungs). Parallel enlargement of salivary, lacrimal and parotid glands is common. Five morphological subtypes, all of which display increased IgG4 + plasma cells, have been described (see Figure 2 for examples): – 
Multicentric Castleman disease-like: preserved nodal architecture with patent sinusoids and hyperplastic follicles; abundant mature plasma cells in interfollicular areas with some eosinophils, similar to lymphadenopathy in multicentric Castleman disease or autoimmune disease.
Reactive follicular hyperplasia: increased IgG4 + plasma cells in germinal centers and often in the interfollicular zones with some eosinophils present.
Interfollicular expansion pattern: expanded interfollicular zones with small lymphocytes, plasmablasts and mature plasma cells and eosinophils which may resemble lymphoma (e.g. angioimmunoblastic lymphoma). Examples are given in Figure 2A–C.
Progressive transformation of germinal center-like: scattered larger or transformed follicles containing plasma cells. An example is given in Figure 2D,E.
Inflammatory pseudotumor-like: lymph node partially effaced by a fibro-inflammatory infiltrate and storiform fibrosis; this subtype is considered most specific for IgG4-RD in lymph nodes. An example is given in Figure 2F.

### Retropharyngeal lymph nodes in children: a common imaging finding and potential source of misinterpretation [^17f0fca6]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The retropharyngeal lymph nodes are the least well-described portion of the Waldeyer ring. Originally described as occurring in medial and lateral groups, reports have described only the presence of lateral nodes in children. We have seen cases of MRI sleep studies in children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in which lateral and medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes are present and have been misinterpreted. Our purpose is to describe the frequency and appearance of retropharyngeal lymph nodes in children with and without OSA.

Materials and Methods

Axial and sagittal T2-weighted MRI scans were reviewed in 150 children with OSA and 150 control subjects without OSA, who underwent imaging for other indications. The presence, size, and location of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes were evaluated. Retropharyngeal lymph nodes were evaluated for frequency of medial nodes, frequency of lateral nodes, size as indicated by the anterior-to-posterior diameter, laterality (bilateral or unilateral), and superior-to-inferior location compared with the cervical vertebral body level. Analyses were performed using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test (for categorical data) and generalized linear model or two-sample Wilcoxon's Mann-Whitney test (for continuous data).

Results

Lateral retropharyngeal lymph nodes were common in both children with OSA (137/150 [91.3%]) and children without OSA (146/150 [97.3%]). Medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes occurred not uncommonly in both children with OSA (32/150 [21.3%]) and those without OSA (26/150 [17.3%]). Lateral retropharyngeal lymph nodes were more commonly bilateral (95% CI, 88.4-97.4%; p < 0.0001) and located at the skull base (C1) or C1-C2 level (99%; p < 0.0001). Medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes were more commonly unilateral (95% CI, 71.9-84.6%; p < 0.0004) and located at the C2-C3 level (95% CI, 78.13-84.62%; p < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of medial or lateral retropharyngeal lymph nodes in the OSA group compared with the control group.

Conclusion

Retropharyngeal lymph nodes are seen commonly in children in both lateral (95% CI, 91.3-97.3%) and medial (95% CI, 17.3-21.3%) locations. Media nodes are present more frequently than previously described. Such nodes occur almost equally frequently in populations with and without OSA. Retropharyngeal lymph nodes should be considered normal in children and not be interpreted as abnormal or misdiagnosed.

### Evaluation of peripheral lymphadenopathy in children [^ad871a22]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate children with lymphadenopathy and clinical approach to the suspicion of malignancy. The authors evaluated 457 patients with peripheral lymphadenopathy, less than 19 years of age, and referred to the Pediatric Oncology Department of Gazi University Medical School during the periods March 1996-April 2004. A total of 346 patients had benign disorders and 111 had malignant pathologies. Excisional biopsies were performed to 134 patients. A specific etiology could be found 39% in the benign group. Of the 457 patients, 218 were presented as acute, the rest as chronic lymphadenopathy. In the acute lymphadenopathy group, 98.2% of the patients had benign etiologies. The malignant disorders were mostly represented as chronic lymphadenopathy. Concerning the extension, 193 patients had localized lymphadenopathy and 264 had generalized lymphadenopaties. Cervical region was the most frequent site in both localized and generalized lymphadenopathy groups. Malignancies occurred as generalized lymphadenopathy. Supraclavicular area were involved only in the malignant group. Axillary involvement was predominant in BCG vaccine associated lymphadenitis and mycobacterium tuberculosis. All the lymph nodes less than 1 cm were due to benign causes. The malignant lesions were usually more than 3 cm in diameters. The following findings should alert the pediatrician for the probability of a malignant disorder: lymphadenopathy of more than 3 cm in size, of more than 4 weeks in duration, with supraclavicular involvement, and with abnormal laboratory and radiological findings.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, AAFP 2014 guidelines recommend to suspect common causes such as infection, inflammation, and stress response when evaluating a patient with leukocytosis. Obtain peripheral blood smear in patients with a WBC count > 20, 000/mcL and with associated anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes, or constitutional symptoms.

### Clinical characteristics and risk factors for recurrence of kikuchi-fujimoto disease in children: a case-control study [^0d802fc0]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare, benign, and self-limited disease that presents with cervical lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms. Histologic evaluation is often necessary to differentiate KFD from other entities. Severe KFD may be complicated by hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The pathogenesis of KFD is still unclear and may be related to genetic, infectious and autoimmune factors. The diagnosis of KFD can be challenging for nonspecific symptoms, laboratory or imaging findings. KFD is easy to be misdiagnosed as other lymphadenopathy or infection and often misdiagnosed as early empirical use of antibiotics, resulting in the abuse of antibiotics. In addition, the experience of recurrence of KFD is insufficient at present, so it is important to improve the understanding of KFD. This study aims to improve clinicians’ understanding of KFD in children by analyzing the clinical features and recurrence factors of KFD diagnosed by lymph node biopsy.

### Mediastinal lymphadenopathy in children with histoplasmosis [^14ddecff]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Mediastinal lymphadenopathy (ML) in children can arise from malignancy, infection, or rheumatic illness among others, and may be found incidentally on imaging or during workup for a variety of symptoms. Our aim was to describe the clinical presentation and natural history of histoplasmosis in children who present to a tertiary care center with ML in an endemic area of the country.

Methods

After institutional review board approval, a retrospective study of all children (aged < 21 y) presenting with proven (positive serologies) or suspected histoplasmosis (negative serologies, negative tuberculosis testing, and benign outcomes in follow-up) over a 5-y period was done. Seventy-four patients were tested; those with another diagnosis (n = 6) or without ML (n = 26) were excluded, for a total cohort of 44 patients. Demographics, clinical presentation, symptoms, laboratory data, treatment course, radiography studies, and inpatient and outpatient visits were examined.

Results

Of the 44 patients with ML, 27 had proven histoplasmosis, and 19 had suspected histoplasmosis. The median follow-up by imaging or clinical examination was 6.9 mo (0.3-73.2 mo). Sixteen patients received antifungal therapy with itraconazole, and 15 patients received at least one course of steroids, nearly all for respiratory symptoms; 11 patients (24%) received both. There was no difference in readmission rate (n = 5 versus 2, P = 0.7) or recurrence of symptoms (n = 2 versus 5, P = 0.4) between patients who received an antifungal and those that did not. Receiving steroid therapy was associated with airway narrowing and a higher readmission rate (n =6 versus 2 who were not treated with steroids, P = 0.04), but not with symptom recurrence. Nine lymph node or mass biopsies were performed; however, the pathology only confirmed nonspecific infection in three and was nondiagnostic in the remaining six patients. Twenty-seven patients had at least one confirmatory laboratory test positive for histoplasmosis. Thirty-nine of the 44 patients (84%) with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis (proven or suspected) were asymptomatic by 1-2 mo follow up, with the remainder having intermittent chest pain or reactive airway disease.

Conclusions

ML because of proven or suspected histoplasmosis is usually a self-limiting disease that can be managed with treatment of the child's symptoms. Antifungals and steroids are of unclear benefit and may not alter the natural course of the disease. Biopsies are rarely diagnostic in the setting of ML, and invasive procedures should be avoided.

### Pulmonary lesions in early response assessment in pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma: prevalence and possible implications for initial staging [^8d2a9101]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary nodules up to 10 mm in size of benign etiology are therefore a common occurrence in pediatric and adolescent patients with HL.

Most patients had only one newly developed nodule on ERA, but the distribution of patients with two to ten new nodules was relatively homogeneous, suggesting that the number of pulmonary nodules does not appear to be a reliable staging parameter for defining lung involvement. Location and border configuration of the nodules do not seem to be relevant parameters for distinguishing benign from HL related nodules since the benign nodules in our collective are evenly distributed in both lungs and all border configurations occur. The predominance of poorly defined borders is discussed in the limitation section.

In contrast to nodules, newly developed consolidations and ground-glass-opacities present a greater challenge in interpretation because information about antibiotic therapy was not recorded on all staging forms in these patients. In the study by Diederich et al. consolidations on CT before initiation of therapy were detectable in 27% of patients with lung changes in HL, a similar frequency as in our cohort on ERA. Consequently, it is possible for consolidations to be both the result of pulmonary metastatic disease and non-malignant confounders, mainly opportunistic infections. Unfortunately, we were not able to identify a distinguishing morphological feature in our cohort with benign consolidation and ground-glass opacities. Newly developed consolidations in ERA with most likely reactive lymphadenopathy were present in 4 out of 29 patients but hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy does not seem to be a reliable parameter for initial staging, as it is common in pHL. As a result, the inclusion of PET, laboratory, and clinical parameters is critical for differentiation.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^884e959e]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of children with thyroid nodules—biopsy thresholds and sonographic risk features: “The 2009 adult guidelines indicate that FNA is not warranted for the evaluation of a nodule < 1 cm in size unless the patient is considered high-risk, most commonly with a history of exposure to ionizing radiation, or the nodule is associated with pathologic regional lymph nodes.” In pediatrics, “A size criterion is more problematic in children because thyroid volume changes with age and the size of the nodule alone does not predict malignant histology (110–112). Therefore, US characteristics and clinical context should be used more preferentially to identify nodules that warrant FNA.” Malignancy-associated sonographic findings include that “US features such as hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and increased intranodular blood flow are more common in malignant lesions (110,113),” and “the presence of microcalcifications and abnormal cervical lymph nodes increase the likelihood of malignancy (110,113).” Accordingly, “In all children with a suspicious nodule, US evaluation of the cervical lymph nodes should be performed.” The document also notes, “The 2009 adult guidelines indicate that the FNA is not warranted for the evaluation of a hyperfunctioning nodule in the adult.”

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and granulomatous lymphadenopathy [^417abb32]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Generalized lymphadenopathy along with fever is commonly encountered in pediatric clinical practice. Infections, malignancy and connective tissue diseases are diverse groups of illnesses causing generalized lymphadenopathy with fever. The majority of these are infectious in origin and may be self limiting. Although not included in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), generalized lymphadenopathy is frequently observed in children with SLE and may be the presenting feature in the absence of other clinical manifestations. This may pose a diagnostic dilemma, and therefore a lymph node biopsy is warranted in this subset of patients.

The exact etiology of SLE is still unclear, although multifactorial interaction with genetic and environmental factors has been implicated. It is characterized by the formation of autoantibodies to various components of the cell nucleus leading to inflammation, vasculitis and immune complex deposition. Immune complex deposition along with complement activation has been postulated for various manifestations of SLE including lupus nephritis, which is also demonstrated by frequent association of hypocomplementemia and signs of vasculitis at the sites of active SLE.

Few early reports have described non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas in necropsy specimens of serous membranes, lung, lymph node, and spleen as well as pleural biopsy specimen of a patient with SLE. Granuloma formation in SLE is rare and the pathogenesis is unclear. Here in, we report an adolescent south Asian female presenting with generalized lymphadenopathy with granulomatous features with a final diagnosis of SLE.

### Cat scratch disease in pediatrics: who has systemic involvement? [^870c3ff0]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bartonella henselae is the agent responsible for cat scratch disease (CSD). Although lymphadenopathy is typically the defining symptom, some patients develop potentially severe systemic compromise. It is unknown why some patients progress to systemic disease. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical, epidemiologic and laboratory characteristics of children with CSD and to analyze the differences between systemic versus localized infections.

Methods

Patients were identified by a retrospective review of medical records at a tertiary pediatric care hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from January 2012 to July 2021. A CSD case was defined as any patient who presented compatible clinical findings with a positive serologic test (IgG >1/64 or IgM immunofluorescence) for B. henselae.

Results

A total of 197 patients were identified, with a median age of 8 years (range: 1-17.4 years). The most frequent clinical symptoms were fever and lymphadenopathy. Systemic involvement was present in 34.5% (n = 68) of patients and the most common presentation was splenic abscess (n = 51), followed by liver abscess (n = 23), chorioretinitis (n = 9), osteomyelitis (n = 5) and pneumonitis (n = 3). Patients with invasive disease more frequently presented with fever (79.4% vs. 50.3%) ( P <0.001) and had higher C-reactive protein levels (24.9 vs. 6.7mg/L) ( P <0.001). Antibiotic therapy was administered to 95.9% (n = 187) of patients and most with systemic disease (77%) used combination treatment. Most patients recovered fully, and there were no reported deaths.

Conclusions

CSD must be considered a potential cause of lymphadenopathy. Patients with fever and elevated C-reactive protein should be evaluated to rule out systemic compromise.

### Intrathoracic tuberculous lymphadenopathy in children: a guide to chest radiography [^5373971c]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Making the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children can be difficult because microbiological confirmation is not often achieved. Diagnosis is therefore often based on clinical features in combination with chest radiograph findings. Chest radiographs can demonstrate lymphadenopathy of the hilar and para-tracheal regions on the anteroposterior view, and subcarinal lymphadenopathy on the lateral view. However poor interobserver agreement has been reported for radiologist and clinician assessment of lymphadenopathy. This might reflect the lack of standardised imaging criteria for diagnosis as well as radiologists’ objectives for achieving sensitivity rather than specificity. In this paper the authors provide a pictorial aid of chest radiographs in children with culture-confirmed tuberculosis to help clinicians identify lymph node enlargement in primary pulmonary tuberculosis. This collection of images comprises chest radiographs accompanied by schematics and either CT or MRI scan confirmation of pathological lymph node enlargement at the positions commonly affected in tuberculosis.

### Ultrasonography of thyroid nodules: a pictorial review [^8bdd58d9]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Lymph node assessment

Lymph node involvement is most common in papillary thyroid cancer. In 20% of patients with papillary thyroid cancer, a symptomatic cervical lymph node is one of the main complaints. In addition, nodal metastases have been reported in 50% of patients with papillary thyroid cancer on first presentation. In follicular thyroid cancer, metastases have a tendency to spread to distant organs. For medullary thyroid cancer, both cervical lymph nodes and distant organs can be involved.

Cervical lymph node assessment should be an integral part of the thyroid nodule examination. The neck should be thoroughly screened for any abnormal lymph nodes. Normal and reactive lymph nodes are usually oval with an echogenic hilum, and they are typically hypo-echoic relative to nearby muscle. On Doppler evaluation, there is normally colour flow at the hilum of a reactive lymph node, but it can also appear avascular. An abnormal lymph node would have lost one or a combination of these normal features in terms of shape, echotexture, fatty hilum, irregular contour and vascularity (Fig. 5e). The presence of an abnormal lymph node would result in a category of U5 regardless of any benign features of the thyroid nodule. Abnormal lymph nodes should undergo FNAC along with the nodule to facilitate accurate diagnosis and staging.

A thorough discussion of cervical lymph node evaluation is beyond the scope of this article. However, a number of studies have illustrated in detail the sonographic characteristics of neck lymph nodes, which the reader should find useful for guiding the ultrasound examination.

### Deep learning radiomics of dual-modality ultrasound images for hierarchical diagnosis of unexplained cervical lymphadenopathy [^7cf2265b]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervical lymphadenopathy (CLA) is a common disease occurring in patients of all ages, with an annual incidence of 0.6–0.7% for the general population. The most common etiologies are reactive hyperplasia (38–79%) and tuberculous lymphadenitis (4–34%) in benign cases and metastatic carcinoma (50–94%) and lymphomas (5–41%) in malignant cases. Referral patterns and treatment strategies for different types of CLA are all distinct; thus, accurate identification of the specific etiology is essential for subsequent medical management. However, the differential diagnosis of CLA is challenging, especially in patients without reliable medical history and characteristic symptoms, which is commonly seen in underdeveloped areas of developing countries. Due to the lack of a universally accepted protocol for the investigation of lymphadenopathy, some of these unexplained CLA may experience an average delay of 3 to 6 months from the initial presentation of symptoms to the diagnosis of malignancy. Recently, specialized lymph node diagnostic clinics have been established in several developed countries and advanced medical institutions to benefit unexplained CLA patients with rapid, agile, and scheduled systems, but same interventions are still impractical in many countries and regions with underdeveloped healthcare conditions, involving a huge population worldwide.

Imaging methods are the main tools for detection, diagnosis, and follow-up monitoring in unexplained CLA patients, including ultrasound imaging (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Compared with other imaging modalities, US is more convenient, economical, and radiation-free and has better resolution in characterizing cervical lymph nodes (CLNs). It consists of two basic modalities, B-mode ultrasound (BUS) and color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI), where BUS reliably shows the size, shape, borders, and internal echoes of the CLN, while CDFI is utilized to complement BUS by detecting blood vessels and assessing the vascular distribution of the CLN in real time. The importance of BUS and CDFI duplex ultrasound in patients with CLA is well recognized, and this method is recommended as the first-line diagnostic tool for unexplained CLA. However, the diagnostic performance of the dual-modality US strongly relies on the clinical and professional expertise of radiologists. Subjective image interpretation, lack of effective quantification, and persistent intra- and inter-observer variability remain the main dilemmas faced in US examinations. Consequently, a significant proportion of patients with unexplained CLA are frequently misdiagnosed and subsequently subjected to unnecessary investigations and inappropriate treatment.

### Imaging recommendations and algorithms for pediatric tuberculosis: part 2-extrathoracic tuberculosis [^747fd2fe]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment in recent years, tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health concern. Children are amongst the most vulnerable groups affected by this disease. Although TB primarily involves the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes, it can affect virtually any organ system of the body. Along with clinical history combined with physical examination and laboratory tests, various medical imaging tools help establish the diagnosis. Medical imaging tests are also helpful for follow-up during therapy, to assess complications and exclude other underlying pathologies. This article aims to discuss the utility, strengths and limitations of medical imaging tools in the evaluation of suspected extrathoracic TB in the pediatric population. Imaging recommendations for the diagnosis will be presented along with practical and evidence-based imaging algorithms to serve as a guide for both radiologists and clinicians.

### Temporary reactive response of axillary lymph nodes to COVID-19 vaccination onF-rhPSMA-7.3 PET / CT in patients with prostate cancer [^05f8f267]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Vaccine-associated lymphadenopathy (VAL) is a common finding on 18 F-FDG PET/CT examinations after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. However, data regarding VAL on 18 F-rhPSMA-7.3-ligand PET are currently lacking. This study assesses the prevalence, temporal response to vaccination, and characteristics of VAL. Methods: Two hundred thirty-three consecutive vaccinated and 41 unvaccinated patients with confirmed prostate cancer who underwent 18 F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET/CT were retrospectively analyzed. Size and uptake of the axillary lymph nodes were measured. Ratios of SUV max of ipsilateral to contralateral axillary lymph node (SUVratio) were determined. The characteristics of SUVratio in respect to the duration of PSMA avidity in the axillary lymph node after COVID-19 vaccination was analyzed. Results: The prevalence of VAL on 18 F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET was 45%. Up to a period of 8 wk after the last COVID-19 vaccination, SUVratio was positive (2.05±0.17). Thereafter, SUVratio dropped significantly (1.35±0.09) and approached the value of unvaccinated group (1.1±0.2). SUVratio of metastatic axillary lymph nodes was very high (>11) and can be easily detected visually or semiquantitatively. In 3 patients, we observed suspected development and consecutively confirmed involving metastasis of axillary lymph node with SUVratio between 4.0 to 6.6. Correlation between SUVratio and lymph node size ( r =0.93, P <0.0001) and lymph node size and duration after vaccine ( r =-0.88, P <0.0008) was found. Conclusion: Increased uptake of the PSMA ligand 18 F-rhPSMA-7.3 by axillary lymph nodes is common after COVID-19 vaccination and can persist for 8 wk. This finding should be considered in the interpretation of 18 F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET/CT examinations.

### Castleman disease of the parotid gland in a pediatric patient: a case report [^bbb688e1]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Castleman disease, also called angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by enlarged hyperplastic lymph nodes. Affected patients usually present with mediastinal lymphadenopathy; sometimes other groups of lymph nodes are involved, with or without associated systemic manifestations. We report a case of Castleman disease involving the intraparotid lymph node in a 15-year-old boy who presented with a 3-month history of a painless swelling of the right parotid gland. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the mass revealed only reactive hyperplasia. The diagnosis of Castleman disease was established on histopathologic examination of the resected mass. We discuss the clinical course, histopathologic features, radiologic characteristics, and management of Castleman disease of the parotid gland in a pediatric patient.

### Prediction of effective humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in healthy subjects by cortical thickness of post-vaccination reactive lymphadenopathy [^9c149457]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Data analysis confirmed statistically higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels in individuals previously diagnosed with COVID-19, regardless of the vaccine type used. When comparing the immune response between different vaccine protocols in both groups, we detected higher levels of antibody levels in patients vaccinated with the mix-and-match protocol. This is true for measurements conducted at 21 days, however, differences between the mRNA protocol and the mix-and-match protocol seem less dramatic at 90 days and at 180 days.

To evaluate the association between post-vaccine lymphadenopathy and the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine over time, we defined lymph nodes with a cortical thickness greater than 3 mm as morphological reactive because, following Bedi’s classification, this value supposes the change between normal lymph node appearance (Bedi’s grade 1 and 2) to a suspicious/reactive lymph node appearance (Bedi’s grade 3, 4, 5 and 6). Normally, this classification is used as a way to objectively classify the appearance of lymph nodes in oncologic staging and the likelihood of malignancy increases with each morphologic type. However, due to the lack of malignant risk factors in our cohort, axillary lymph nodes showing large cortical thickness were regarded as physiologic, reactive post-vaccine lymph nodes.
