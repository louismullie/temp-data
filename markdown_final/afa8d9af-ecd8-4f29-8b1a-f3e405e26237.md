## Question

How to medically relieve intussusception

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to medically relieve intussusception. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and assessing severity. Then, I should stabilize the patient and decide whether nonoperative reduction is appropriate. Next, I will choose between pneumatic and hydrostatic enema techniques, consider sedation and analgesia, and outline what to do if the first attempt fails. After that, I need to plan for recurrence, including the role of glucocorticoids in select cases. Finally, I should address adult-specific considerations and close with post-reduction care and a concise algorithm summary, making sure I verify each step against the best available evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and gauge severity, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with ileocolic intussusception and not a mimic or a different segment involved. Ultrasound is the preferred first-line modality in children due to high sensitivity and specificity and the absence of radiation, and it can also show vascular compromise or free fluid that would change urgency and approach, so I should double-check that the target sign is present and that the segment is ileocolic rather than purely small bowel or rectal intussusception [^114R6BKK] [^116RNdXc]. I should also assess for peritonitis, shock, sepsis, or perforation, because those are contraindications to enema and mandate surgery; if I see free air or peritoneal signs, I must not delay operative management [^114ciNzb].

> Wait, let me verify the stabilization steps before any intervention. I need to ensure adequate IV access, correct dehydration, and obtain baseline labs including electrolytes and hemoglobin, and I should arrange surgical consultation early even if I plan nonoperative reduction, because complications can occur and readiness for the OR matters. I should also confirm that the child has appropriate pain assessment and management in place, since undertreatment of pain is common in this population [^1177GB4U] [^114yEt6M] [^117NNYep].

> Now, I will examine candidacy for nonoperative reduction, and I need to ensure I am not overlooking a contraindication. In hemodynamically stable children without peritonitis, perforation, or signs of ischemia, image-guided enema reduction is first-line; however, I should be cautious in infants under 3 months due to thinner bowel walls and higher perforation risk, and in that subgroup I should maintain a lower threshold for surgery while still considering carefully selected enema attempts with strict pressure limits and real-time imaging guidance [^116RNdXc] [^1135QUFM]. Hold on, I should verify that the intussusception is indeed ileocolic or colocolic, because small-bowel intussusceptions often reduce spontaneously and may not be amenable to enema techniques anyway [^114826ry].

> Next, I should review the choice of enema technique, and I need to balance success, safety, and local expertise. Pneumatic (air) enema under fluoroscopy has higher success rates than hydrostatic liquid enemas in randomized data, but ultrasound-guided hydrostatic enema avoids radiation and allows repeated attempts; both are acceptable, and selection should reflect institutional experience and the ability to monitor safely, so I should confirm what my team is most facile with before proceeding [^114xBPPT] [^114R6BKK]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought hydrostatic might be categorically safer, but I should correct that: perforation risk is low with both and largely operator- and technique-dependent, so safety is comparable when performed correctly [^114R6BKK].

> I will now examine sedation and analgesia, and I need to ensure I am not perpetuating outdated fears. Historically, many centers withheld opioids due to concerns about masking surgical signs or reducing success, but large multicenter data show that neither fentanyl nor morphine is associated with failed reduction or perforation, and intranasal fentanyl is a practical, rapid-onset option when IV access is limited; shared decision-making with parents and local protocols are key, and I should double-check that we have age-appropriate pain assessment tools in place [^114xEzgK] [^117NNYep] [^113NQqCG]. Hold on, I should verify that sedation itself is not harmful; observational data suggest sedation does not worsen outcomes when performed with appropriate monitoring, though it requires trained personnel and airway readiness, so I must align with institutional capacity [^114xEzgK].

> Let me think about the technical execution and safety thresholds, because I need to ensure we do not over-pressurize the bowel. For pneumatic reduction, I should start at conservative pressures and titrate carefully, using a pressure-release valve and real-time imaging; for hydrostatic reduction, I should monitor the column height and stop if there is no progress or if the patient decompensates, and I should be prepared to decompress immediately if perforation is suspected, ideally with a surgeon available or rapidly accessible [^114R6BKK] [^114yEt6M]. I should confirm that we document the number of attempts and the endpoint clearly, because multiple attempts are acceptable if the child remains stable and the intussusceptum is moving, but I must not exceed safe pressure limits, especially in neonates [^113DWk66] [^1135QUFM].

> If the first attempt fails, I should double-check whether a delayed repeat enema is reasonable. In clinically stable children with partial reduction or persistent symptoms, a delayed repeat attempt after several hours can be successful and safe, and this strategy can avert surgery in a meaningful fraction of cases. I need to ensure continued observation, hydration, and readiness to pivot to the OR if deterioration occurs [^1128tfEX] [^113DWk66]. But wait, what if the child is deteriorating or the intussusception is not moving at all? In that case, I should escalate to operative management rather than persisting with repeated enemas [^116sHwg1].

> Next, I should review operative indications and the surgical approach, and I need to ensure I do not delay necessary surgery. Indications include failed enema reduction, perforation, peritonitis, shock or sepsis, suspected pathologic lead point, or persistent obstruction; laparoscopy is preferred when feasible for reduced trauma and faster recovery, but open surgery remains appropriate for instability, extensive bowel involvement, or when laparoscopy is not available, and I should confirm that the surgical plan addresses both reduction and evaluation for lead points [^116sHwg1] [^1128tfEX]. I should double-check for lead points intraoperatively if reduction is difficult or if recurrences occur, because identifying and treating the lead point reduces recurrence risk [^117ETLmk].

> I will now examine recurrence management, and I need to ensure I do not overreact to early recurrences. Recurrence after successful enema reduction occurs in roughly 7–20% overall, with early recurrence within 48 hours in about 2–7%, and most recurrences can still be managed nonoperatively; repeat enemas remain first-line, and I should consider a lower threshold for imaging to exclude a lead point after multiple recurrences or if the pattern suggests a pathologic driver [^111jyBVC] [^114LPy8s]. Hold on, I should verify whether glucocorticoids help in short-interval recurrences; emerging retrospective data suggest that in children with three or more episodes within five days, glucocorticoids may reduce recurrence, but the evidence is low quality and heterogeneous, so I should individualize and discuss risks and benefits with caregivers [^112EQvki] [^113e4C6e].

> Let me consider adult-specific issues, because I need to ensure I do not apply pediatric algorithms to adults. Adult intussusception frequently harbors a lead point and has a high malignancy rate in colonic involvement, so enema reduction is generally contraindicated and surgical resection without prior reduction is often recommended; for small-bowel intussusceptions without malignancy suspicion, reduction may be attempted, but I should confirm with imaging and intraoperative judgment before deciding [^111KJDJU] [^116oFqzF]. I should double-check that preoperative staging and oncologic principles are considered when malignancy is possible, because inappropriate reduction could have implications for dissemination [^111KJDJU].

> Finally, I should review post-reduction care and discharge planning, and I need to ensure safety netting is robust. After successful enema reduction, a 4–6 hour observation period in the ED with oral hydration challenge is reasonable for stable children, with admission reserved for those with concerning features or unreliable follow-up; I should counsel caregivers about recurrence signs and arrange timely follow-up, and I should confirm that pain control and parental presence during procedures improve comfort and satisfaction without compromising outcomes [^1128tfEX] [^116ykEk5] [^115fjH29]. Hold on, I should verify that we document clear return precautions and provide a direct line for urgent reassessment, because early recurrences, though uncommon, are typically manageable if recognized promptly [^116ykEk5].

> In summary, relieving intussusception hinges on rapid ultrasound diagnosis, hemodynamic stabilization, and image-guided enema reduction as first-line for stable children, with careful attention to technique, pressure limits, and the option of delayed repeat attempts. Analgesia and sedation should not be withheld solely due to fear of masking pathology, operative management is indicated for instability or failed reduction, and recurrence should be managed nonoperatively whenever feasible while evaluating for lead points in repeated episodes. Adult disease requires a surgical-first approach due to the high prevalence of lead points and malignancy, so I should tailor the pathway to age, anatomy, and clinical status at every step [^114R6BKK] [^114xEzgK] [^1128tfEX] [^111KJDJU].

## Diagnostic approach

Ultrasound is **first-line** [^114R6BKK] for its high sensitivity/specificity, lack of radiation, and ability to guide therapy [^116RNdXc]. CT is reserved for **equivocal cases** or suspected complications [^1174KRZi].

---

## Nonoperative management

### Enema reduction

- **Air enema**: Higher success and lower perforation risk than liquid enema [^114xBPPT] [^116RNdXc].
- **Hydrostatic enema**: Useful when air is unavailable or contraindicated [^114R6BKK].
- **Delayed repeat enema**: Safe and effective after partial reduction or recurrence [^113DWk66] [^111kTXhu].

---

### Sedation and analgesia

Sedation/analgesia is **safe and does not increase failure or perforation** [^114xEzgK] [^117NNYep]; **intranasal fentanyl** is favored for its rapid onset and minimal cardiovascular effects [^113NQqCG].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **failure of enema, perforation, peritonitis, or instability** [^114xz3yX]. Laparoscopic reduction is preferred when feasible [^1128tfEX]; **open surgery** is reserved for complex or unstable cases.

---

## Recurrence management

Recurrence is managed by **repeat enema** for stable patients without a lead point [^114LPy8s]; **surgery** is indicated for suspected lead points or failed repeat enemas [^114LPy8s]. Dexamethasone may reduce recurrence after enema [^114xBPPT].

---

## Adult intussusception

In adults, **surgery is first-line** because of the high malignancy risk [^111X5cd1] [^116oFqzF]; **reduction is avoided** when malignancy is suspected [^1174KRZi].

Discussion

The original global multicenter study of intussusception in children (PAINT) found that only a minority of patients (< 15%) received analgesia or sedation for reduction. In the present cross-sectional substudy, we found no association between either fentanyl or morphine and failed reduction. Our results suggest that fentanyl may be considered a safe therapeutic option to manage children's intussusception and subsequent reduction-related pain. In addition, current practice with morphine administration was considered safe, as we found no increased risk of failed reduction of intussusception associated with morphine administration. However, mounting evidence shows that morphine is associated with adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and respiratory depression. Fentanyl may be a better option than morphine because of greater potency, fewer adverse effects, and, specifically, minimal adverse cardiovascular effects. Moreover, fentanyl can be administered intranasally, making it ideal to quickly and effectively reduce pain in children undergoing reduction of intussusception in settings that lack adequate personnel and resources to sedate children.

In our sample, 15.20% of patients experienced a failed reduction, consistent with the published frequency of 6%-40%. Successful nonoperative reduction by hydrostatic or pneumatic enema can obviate the need for surgical intervention and its associated complications for most children. Our findings largely agree with prior reports in which children under 12 months of age were at increased risk for failed reduction. Consistent with prior literature, we also found that longer duration of symptoms was associated with failed reduction. The positive association between preexisting gastrointestinal anomalies and failed reduction was described in the original PAINT study. While prior studies have not described this association, 2 retrospective studies found that a pathological lead point increased the likelihood of failed reduction. The reason for these associations is not entirely clear but suggests the need for tailored approaches to management of intussusception for children at risk of failure of reduction, such as early surgical consultation and specifically for younger children, decreasing the time to reduction using care pathways for expedited diagnostic ultrasound. The latter has been shown to be beneficial in suspected pediatric appendicitis. In keeping with the original PAINT study, neither fentanyl nor morphine administration was associated with failed reduction in this substudy. Fentanyl is arguably a better choice because it is more potent and has a better adverse event profile. Further, it can be given through a variety of routes, including intranasal, which is becoming increasingly popular due to the desire to avoid painful intravenous administration.

### Management of intussusception in the pediatric emergency department: risk factors for recurrence [^112PtHLq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The standard treatment for intussusception is air reduction enema (ARE) with inpatient observation for 24 to 48 hours to monitor for recurrence. More recent but limited observations suggest that patients who have undergone successful ARE can safely be discharged after 4 to 6 hours of observation. Our primary objective was to identify risk factors associated with early recurrence. Our secondary objectives included validating risk criteria from prior studies and identifying risk factors for ARE failures.

Design/Methods

A retrospective cohort study of children discharged from a large urban quaternary hospital with a final diagnosis of intussusception (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 560.0) or who underwent ARE from 2005 to 2015 was identified. Demographic data, radiology images, and clinical course were recorded. Repeat visits, cases with incomplete medical records, and those with incorrect diagnoses were excluded.

Results

A total of 250 cases were identified. Two hundred cases were included for analysis. Fifty were excluded. Of the 163 who had successful reduction with ARE, 22 patients (13.5%) recurred, and 12 (7.3%) recurred within 48 hours. Fever (odds ratio, 4.25; P = 0.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–17.3) and female sex (odds ratio, 7.94; P = 0.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.82–34.6) were independently associated with early recurrence. No radiologic features were associated with early recurrence.

Conclusions

Early recurrence after successful ARE was low, although more frequent in girls and in those with fever over 100.4°F. We therefore advocate for prospective studies to validate these risk criteria to identify patients who are at low risk for early recurrence and may qualify for early discharge from the emergency department.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^112GunVK]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

The flowchart (Fig. 1) for the management of pediatric intussusception was performed in our hospital for 3 years. This retrospective study reviewed data of younger than 12 years from our hospital database who were diagnosed with intussusception and managed with cleansing enemas, air enemas, or B-ultrasound–guided hydrostatic enemas (B-USGHE) from January 2019 to December 2020. Children who were given a detailed B-ultrasound description of the ultrasound parameters of intussusception were categorized into 4 groups based on the reduction methods. The data extracted included demographic data (sex, age, date of onset, and date of birth), size of intussusception (transverse diameter and longitudinal length of the involved segment), treatment method, and effects. The diagnosis of intussusception was determined by high-frequency ultrasound, with a descriptive report given in our hospital that included transverse diameter, length of involved segment, number and location of the intussusception, but these data may lack in other hospitals. Single intussusception means that only 1 intussusception was found by B-ultrasound. Multiple intussusceptions refer to the discovery of more than 2 intussusceptions at a time. Recurrent intussusception refers to children with repeated attacks within an uncertain time, and age statistics were evaluated according to the time of first attack. Children with peritonitis and ileus and delayed symptoms for more than 48 hours were prohibited from undergoing any enema treatment.

### Functional results of laparoscopic resection rectopexy for symptomatic rectal intussusception [^111HQ6gf]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to assess the role of laparoscopic resection rectopexy for symptomatic rectal intussusception in patients who failed medical treatment. The functional outcomes of laparoscopic resection rectopexy were evaluated.

Methods

Patients who underwent laparoscopic resection rectopexy for rectal intussusception between July 1998 and November 2004 were identified. All patients with obstructed defecation failing medical treatment were included. Data were prospectively collected for the perioperative period. A follow-up questionnaire was used to assess functional outcome.

Results

Between 1998 and 2004, a total of 56 patients (53 females (95 percent); age range, 23–83 years) underwent laparoscopic resection rectopexy for rectal intussusception. The median operative time was 123 minutes. Morbidity was 7 percent, and there was no mortality. Fifty-two patients were available for follow-up, and of these 33 (63 percent) reported an overall improvement in their function after surgery. Of 28 patients suffering constipation, 15 (53 percent) reported an improvement in bowel frequency. Sixty-seven percent of patients incontinent before surgery improved. Symptoms of incomplete evacuation resolved in 38 percent of affected patients. Thirty-six percent of patients needing to strain at stool did not have this problem after surgery. Median follow-up was 44 (range, 15–92) months.

Conclusions

The management of patients with rectal intussusception and obstructed defecation failing medical treatment is challenging. Laparoscopic resection rectopexy is an option that might offer symptomatic relief and improved function. Further studies are required to define the selection criteria to optimize the outcome in this patient group.

### Intussusception. part 2: an update on the evolution of management [^113yzNgs]. Pediatric Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Children with symptomatic ileocolic or ileo-ileocolic intussusceptions can be successfully managed in one of a number of different ways. The nonoperative enema reduction technique has major advantages over surgical reduction and high success rates can be achieved using pneumatic or hydrostatic reduction techniques under fluoroscopic or sonographic guidance. This article highlights current concepts and some controversial issues related to management of intussusception, including patient selection for attempted enema reduction, the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, complications, the value of delayed, repeated reduction attempts, the role of imaging after attempted enema reduction, and recurrence of intussusception.

### Intussusception [^115wSkA2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children between 3 months and 6 years. Intussusception occurs when a more proximal portion of bowel invaginates into more distal bowel. These patients often present with a wide range of non-specific symptoms, with less than one quarter presenting with the classic triad of vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody stools. Thus, the diagnosis continues to rely on clinical suspicion. This review article discusses the clinical presentation of intussusception and the state-of-the art diagnostic and treatment options, as well as a review of the pertinent literature.

### Current radiological management of intussusception in children [^117QKtEF]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Intussusception is the most common abdominal emergency situation in infants and small children. There has been great progress in diagnostic and therapeutic management of intussusception. Ultrasound (US) has been shown to be the first-choice imaging technique in diagnosing intussusception for reasons of high accuracy, simultaneous exclusion of differential diagnoses, and disclosure of additional pathologies. Controversial opinions exist worldwide concerning the nonoperative treatment of intussusception in infants and children. Pneumatic reduction under fluoroscopic guidance and hydrostatic reduction under US monitoring are the preferred techniques. The aim should be a success rate of at least 90% in idiopathic intussusception. This review summarizes different types of intussusception and outlines diagnostic aspects as well as several treatment concepts.

### The role of glucocorticoids in recurrent idiopathic intussusception: a retrospective cohort study [^1147YKAi]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrence of intussusception after successful non-surgical reduction has been observed in 9–20% of cases, with approximately one-third of patients experiencing two or more episodes. In cases of intussusception characterized by frequent recurrence within a short period, effective preventive measures are lacking, and repeated enemas remain the primary treatment modality. Recurrent intussusception can be physically and emotionally distressing for children and parents. Furthermore, the persistent increase in intraluminal pressure elevates the risk of intestinal injury and perforation. Therefore, there is a pressing need to reduce the recurrence rate of short-term recurrent idiopathic intussusception.

The exact mechanism underlying intussusception recurrence remains elusive. Notably, several studies have previously identified lymphoid hyperplasia (hypertrophied Peyer patches) within the bowel wall as a potential trigger for idiopathic intussusception pathogenesis and recurrence. Glucocorticoids, owing to their potent anti-inflammatory properties, could mitigate the thickening of Peyer's patches and alleviate intestinal edema, thereby reducing the formation and recurrence of intussusception. Previous study has reported the use of steroids before reduction to improve success rates, as well as prophylactic use after reduction to reduce recurrence, and therapeutic use for case with multiple recurrences. However, the role of glucocorticoids in reducing recurrence rates remains controversial. Lin et al. and Essa et al. described that glucocorticoids reduced the risk of intussusception recurrence, whereas Efrati's retrospective analysis suggested a non-significant trend toward increased recurrence following the administration of dexamethasone alongside pneumatic reduction. The aforementioned studies have been conducted on general intussusception populations; however, short-term recurrence cases constitute only a subset of these cases. Given the potential complications associated with the administration of systemic glucocorticoids, it is more appropriate to target high-risk subgroups, such as those with short-term recurrent intussusception, for therapeutic intervention.

### Is sedation necessary for hydrostatic reduction in ileocolic intussusception? Evaluating procedural outcomes and parents' preferences [^113BMfe7]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intussusception is a condition in which a portion of the ileum slides into the colon, and it is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in children. It predominantly affects children between 4 months and 3 years of age, with 95% of cases occurring within the first 2 years. The overall incidence is estimated at 1%–4%. If left untreated, intussusception may lead to bowel necrosis, perforation, peritonitis, shock, or even death.

Hydrostatic or pneumostatic reduction is the preferred initial treatment, typically performed under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance. The choice of method often depends on physician preference and experience. Both methods have been intensively studied, and systematic reviews have demonstrated similar success and complication rates. Surgery is indicated in cases of perforation during reduction (1%–2%) or when reduction is unsuccessful, reported success rates for reduction range from 35% to 100%. A systematic review identified shorter symptom duration and the presence of abdominal pain as positive predictors of successful reduction. Conversely, factors such as age under 1 year, fever, rectal bleeding, and vomiting were associated with a higher likelihood of unsuccessful reduction.

In our experience, parents are primarily concerned with the comfort of their child during invasive procedures like hydrostatic reduction, especially in cases of recurrent intussusception. Worldwide, there is no consensus on the use of procedural sedation during hydrostatic reduction. A 2023 survey of the European Society of Pediatric Radiology members found that sedation or general anesthesia was used during reduction in 67% of European hospitals (35/52) and in 17% of non-European hospitals (2/12).

A recent systematic review (n = 3203) found that sedation can increase the success rate of reduction in children with ileocolic intussusception compared with no sedation, with no differences in complication or recurrence rates. Nonetheless, parental experiences and preferences need to be considered in the choice of sedation or no sedation for their child during reduction for ileocolic intussusception. However, to date, no studies have explored parental experiences and preferences. This study aimed to compare procedural outcomes with and without sedation, alongside parental preferences for sedation of their child during hydrostatic reduction.

### Intussusception: incidence and treatment-insights from the nationwide German surveillance [^117VSGk7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Intussusception (IS) is one of the most common paediatric emergencies, and the best mode of conservative reduction and its exact incidence remains unclear. For different reasons, availability of reliable incidence data are useful and additionally may be fundamental to monitor potential effects of recently introduced rotavirus (RV) vaccines.

Methods

We performed a prospective German nationwide surveillance between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, followed by separate collection of all IS cases in a random sample of 31 clinics for an unbiased estimation of underreporting. For case definition, the Brighton Collaboration (BC) criteria were applied.

Results

A total of 1200 children with at least 1 episode of IS were included. For children younger than 1 year the incidence was calculated to be 60.4/100,000 child-years. The risk for surgery increased 2-fold if the interval between onset of symptoms and first attempt of conservative reduction exceeded 5 hours (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–3.1). We also observed a 2.8-fold increased risk for surgery for hydrostatic (CI 1.2–6.4) and a 3.7-fold for barium enema reduction (CI 1.6–8.8) compared to pneumatic reduction. The level of specialisation of the hospital did not influence the success of conservative management.

Conclusions

For children with IS a fast attempt of pneumatic reduction seems to be the optimal management. Considering the current practice we estimated that approximately 104 (CI 46–161) surgical interventions would be preventable in Germany every year. Also, conduction of reliable postmarketing monitoring of the new RV vaccines is now possible based on the provided incidence data.

### Management of gangrenous intussusception in infants… [^112xdk5H]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

DISCUSSION continues at the present time as to the best means of dealing with the young child who has an irreducible or gangrenous segment of ileum or cecum resulting from intussusception. Three methods are employed and are still debated: primary resection and anastomosis; two-stage resection and anastomosis, and lateral anastomosis leaving the intussusception in situ. Primary resection and anastomosis is obviously the ideal method of treatment if it can be performed safely, but before accepting it as the routine treatment it is advisable to consider the problem in two ways:

1. The local hazard: the technical difficulties and risks involved in anastomosing the bowel immediately after excision of the infarcted or gangrenous segment.
2. The general hazard: the state of illness of the child. The first danger is not insuperable. The literature contains several accounts of single cases in which primary resection and anastomosis has succeeded BENTLEY FH.

Background

Intussusception describes the intussusception of a segment of intestine into the lumen of a more distant segment of the bowel and is one of the most common acute abdominal disorders in infancy. Intestinal intussusception occurs most frequently at the age of 6 months, and the incidence of intussusception in China during 2009–2013 was estimated to be 112.9 per 100,000 children aged < 2 years-old. Intussusception in children is a medical emergency that necessitates timely diagnosis and treatment. The main presenting symptoms of intestinal intussusception in children under 2 years of age include vomiting, abdominal pain and blood in the stools. The diagnosis of intussusception is most often made using ultrasonography, but other useful investigations include X-ray, computed tomography and barium/air enema. Management strategies include reduction by pneumatic (air) enema, hydrostatic (liquid) enema, laparoscopic surgery and open surgery.

### Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of children with acute intussusception: a case series [^116sHwg1]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound diagnosis is the preferred method for detecting intussusception in many institutions. Ultrasound can provide insight into the site of intussusception and allow observation of blood flow changes, intestinal dilatation, and ascites. It can also be used to observe the effect of reduction in real time. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography by experienced operators approach 100%.

Treatment options for intussusception include non-surgical and surgical treatment. The most commonly used non-surgical treatments include fluoroscopy-guided air enema reduction and ultrasound-guided hydraulic enema reduction. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, with hydraulic enema avoiding the exposure of children to radiation and air enema having the advantages of simplicity, rapidity, and high success rate of reduction. A meta-analysis showed that the success rate of air enemas is 83%, which is higher than the success rate of hydraulic enemas (70%). In this study, an air enema is the first choice for clinically stable children who had no evidence of intestinal perforation and shock. During the treatment, for children whose intussusception head moves but does not completely disappear with the initial enema and whose general conditions are stable, it may be considered to try again after some time (ranging from 30 min to several hours), which is called delayed repeated enema. Some children in whom surgical reduction is considered due to unsuccessful initial attempts of enema can thus avoid surgery, avoid the occurrence of intestinal adhesion after abdominal surgery, and reduce the economic burden of the children's family. As for children with advanced intussusception, especially those with poor general conditions or failed air enemas, surgery should be performed promptly. Laparoscopic intussusception reduction is chosen as the surgical method, which has the advantages of less trauma and faster recovery compared with open surgery.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^114826ry]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

What is the association between the diameter, length of intussusception and the successful reduction rate? Ultrasound has a high sensitivity of 95% to 100% and specificity of 78% to 100%. Spontaneous reduction of intussusception, which is usually limited to the small bowel, has been frequently found by high-frequency ultrasound. Ultrasound plays an important role in the management of intussusception. In the current data, the diameter and length were the factors affecting the success rate in the cleansing enema. One-way ANOVA showed that the diameter and length were not significant differences between spontaneous reduction, B-USGHE and cleansing enemas. So, the hydrostatic pressure were the factors affecting the success rate between B-USGHE and cleansing enemas. Intussusception with a diameter of approximately 20 mm was more easily reduced spontaneously. The cleansing enema was effective because the warm normal saline (35–40°C) used for it may play an important role, except for hydrostatic pressure, which helped intussusception to reduce spontaneously by relieving spasm of the intestinal smooth muscle. Therefore, cleansing enemas might exert therapeutic effects in both single and multiple intussusceptions. Some multiple intussusceptions might become single intussusceptions after cleansing enema in practice and then be reduced by air or B-USGHE. Length was not the factor affecting the success rate in the air enema and B-USGHE groups. Diameter was the factor affecting the success rate in the B-USGHE groups, but not in air enema. Although the mean diameter and length of intussusception in air enemas were larger than that in the B-USGHE, there may be a deviation because of the nature of the retrospective studies. A further prospective study is needed to confirm the observation and improve the evidence.

### Adult intussusception: a retrospective review [^113NWJbC]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Sarr et al. at the Mayo Clinic recently questioned the accepted notion that preoperative reduction of intussusception was not recommended because it was associated with malignant disease. Tumor cells are always flowing out of primary lesions, and the reduction of intussusception causes little damage to the intestinal mucosa. Patients with enteric and ileocolic intussusceptions do not have leading points, so there is no need for removal. Preoperative reduction serves several functions, including avoidance of emergency surgery, allowing radical surgery for cancer, and reducing the extent of the intestinal resection. It also allows time for preoperative preparation of the bowel. Careful radiologic or endoscopic evaluation can detect strangulated intussusception that is impossible to reduce preoperatively. These observations have resulted in a shift in the clinical paradigm for reducting the intussusception.

In this study, intussusceptions were reduced before surgery in 14 patients followed by preoperative examination. In another 14 patients, intussusceptions were reduced intraoperatively, thereby decreasing the extent of the resected intestine. We believe that the benefits of intussusception reduction are great unless the local lesion has signs of necrosis. In all, 28 patients (63.6%) underwent intussusception reduction preoperatively and intraoperatively using this policy. Two patients experienced a small perforation intraoperatively, but it did not result in postoperative complications.

### Adult intussusception: a six-year experience at a single center [^111X5cd1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

AI is an infrequent problem. The diagnosis of this condition can be difficult as symptoms are often non-specific and episodic. It is important to have a high index of suspicion as there is no 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Treatment usually requires resection of the involved bowel segment. Reduction can be attempted in small bowel intussusception if the segment involved is viable or malignancy is not suspected; however, a more careful approach is recommended in colonic intussusception because of a significantly higher chance of malignancy. In contrast to its pediatric counterpart, the treatment almost always is surgical.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Adult intussusception (AI) is a rare entity and differs from childhood intussusceptions in its presentation, etiology, and treatment
It requires a high index of suspicion

What the new findings are:

Small-bowel intussusceptions should be reduced before resection whenever possible if the underlying etiology is suspected to be benign or if the resection required without reduction is deemed to be massive
Large bowel should generally be resected without reduction because pathology is mostly malignant

### Management of recurrent intussusception: nonoperative or operative reduction? [^116yJLuc]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine how to manage children with recurrence of intussusception.

Methods

Medical records of patients treated for intussusception from 1976 to 2008 at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health were reviewed. Information on patients who developed recurrent intussusception was extracted to study patterns of recurrent attack and suitable management procedures. The statistical differences were analyzed by the χ² and the Student t test, with a P value < .05 considered significant.

Results

During the study period, 1340 patients were treated for 1448 episodes of intussusceptions, with an average of 40 cases per year. There were 108 episodes of recurrent intussusception in 75 patients (45 males and 30 females). The overall recurrence rate was 8%. Patient age at the first episode ranged from 3 months to 12 years (average, 14.9 months). The time interval before each recurrence ranged from 1 day to 3.2 years (average, 7.8 months). The number of recurrences ranged from 1 to 5 attacks. Recurrent intussusception occurred in 35 (15.8%) of 222 children following successful hydrostatic barium enema (BE) reduction and in 55 (11.4%) of 482 after successful pneumatic or air enema (AE) reduction. There was no statistical difference between the recurrence rates after the 2 nonoperative procedures (P = 0.08). Recurrent intussusception developed in 14 (3.0%) of 457 patients after operative manual reduction. Recurrence was not observed after intestinal resection for initial irreducible intussusception in 175 patients. The remaining 4 recurrent episodes occurred after spontaneous reduction. Of the 108 episodes of recurrence, BE and AE reductions were successful in 25 (96.2%) of 26 attempts and in 57 (92%) of 62 attempts, respectively. Seven patients had their first episode of intussusception treated surgically. All 7 when they recurred were successfully treated with either BE or AE reduction. Operative intervention was needed in 23 episodes of recurrent intussusception; 18 were reduced manually, and 5 required intestinal resection. Overall, 7 (9.3%) of the 75 recurrences had a pathologic lead point: colonic polyps in 4 cases and Meckel diverticulum in 3 cases. There were no deaths among the 75 patients with recurrent intussusception.

Conclusions

Recurrent intussusception should be initially treated by nonoperative reduction. Laparotomy is needed in cases with failure of BE or AE reduction, in cases with suspicion of a pathologic lead point, and in selected cases with several episodes of recurrence. The treatment of recurrent intussusception, in general, should be similar to that of primary intussusception.

### Air contrast enema reduction of single and recurrent ileocolic intussusceptions in children: patterns, management and outcomes [^111kTXhu]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no consensus as to when surgical intervention should be considered for recurrent ileocolic intussusceptions in a stable patient after previous successful air contrast enema.

Objective

To review the patterns of ileocolic intussusceptions, air contrast enema success rates, and pathologic lead point rates in patients with and without recurrence to evaluate whether treatment outcomes depend on the number and timing between episodes.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 683 children with air contrast enema performed for ileocolic intussusception between January 2000 and May 2018. Recurrent intussusceptions were separated into mutually exclusive categories: short-term only (≤ 7 days between episodes) and long-term (> 7 days between episodes) intussusceptions. Long-term recurrences included both long-term only and long- and short-term intussusceptions.

Results

Of the 683 patients, 606 (89%) had at least 1 successful air contrast enema. Of the 606, 115 (19%) had recurrent intussusceptions after successful reduction. The air contrast enema success rate for a single intussusception was 86% (491/568) and for recurrent intussusceptions was 96% (110/115) (P = 0.004). Single and recurrent intussusceptions had similar pathologic lead point rates (3.5% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.593). Short-term and long-term recurrences did not differ in air contrast enema success rates (96% vs. 95%). Long-term recurrences had higher pathologic lead point rate compared to short-term only (13% vs. 0%; P = 0.003). Of short-term recurrences, 99% (76/77) were ≤ 5 intussusceptions; 92% had successful air contrast enema without surgery.

Conclusion

The majority of recurrent intussusceptions were successfully treated by air contrast enema. Short-term recurrences have lower pathologic lead point rates, suggesting that a higher surgical threshold may be plausible relative to long-term recurrences. In the appropriate clinical context, repeat air contrast enemas are a safe option for short-term recurrences, which can be attempted at least five times, potentially precluding the need for surgical intervention.

### Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of children with acute intussusception: a case series [^115mocp9]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Phloroglucinol is a myotropic non-atropine non-papaverine antispasmodic for smooth muscles and selectively relieves smooth muscle spasms without producing a series of anticholinergic-like adverse effects and has no significant effect on normal smooth muscle. Currently, it is mainly used to treat acute spasmodic pain caused by dysfunction of the digestive system and biliary tract in adults, spasmodic pain of the urethra, bladder, and kidney, and gynecological spasmodic pain. The drug has no obvious toxicity, no obvious teratogenicity, or mutagenicity, which can ensure medication safety. Phloroglucinol has a significant relaxing effect on the intestinal canal with active peristalsis or spasm, relieving abdominal pain and other symptoms and calming the children. The application of phloroglucinol in treating children with acute intussusception is simple and feasible, which can reduce children's resistance to air enema and is also easily accepted by the parents. In this study, phloroglucinol was effective in managing children with acute intussusception with a depth within 3.9 cm. This study preliminarily suggests the feasibility of phloroglucinol for treating acute intussusception. The authors' plan is to carry out a clinical trial to apply phloroglucinol to all children with intussusception and use air enema as a salvage treatment if phloroglucinol fails. The relaxation of the intestine could also be conducive to improving the efficacy of air enema.

This study showed that about 16.8% of the children suffered relapses, and the age distribution of the children with relapse was approximately the same as the overall age distribution of the children with the disease. Some studies reported that about 10% of children would relapse after successful non-surgical reduction of intussusception, and the risk of relapse is higher in children > 1 year old. but is not related to the duration of the disease and the reduction technique used.

This study has some limitations. First, this study is a single-center retrospective study, limiting the generalizability of the results. Second, this study is retrospective, and there may be bias in data collection. In addition, the analyzable data are limited to those found in the charts. Therefore, a multicenter prospective study with a large sample is needed to provide a sufficient clinical basis in the future.

### Rectal prolapse and intussusception [^117VVSf4]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Rectal prolapse continues to be problematic for both patients and surgeons alike, in part because of increased recurrence rates despite several well-described operations. Patients should be aware that although the prolapse will resolve with operative therapy, functional results may continue to be problematic. This article describes the recommended evaluation, role of adjunctive testing, and outcomes associated with both perineal and abdominal approaches.

### Current methods for reducing intussusception: survey results [^1138djNb]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intussusception is a common pediatric abdominal emergency, treated with image-guided reduction. Available techniques include fluoroscopic and ultrasonographic monitoring of liquid and air.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine current practices and establish trends by comparing our findings with reports of previous surveys.

Materials and Methods

This study is based on an e-mail survey sent to all 1,538 members of the Society for Pediatric Radiology. It included questions about demographics, presence of parents/surgeon during procedure, patient selection/preparation, use of sedation, preferred methods of reduction and technical details, approach to unsuccessful reduction, and self-reported incidence of success/perforation.

Results

The 456 respondents (30%) reported attempting 3,834 reductions in the preceding 12 months. Of these, 96% use fluoroscopy and 4% use US guidance for reduction; 78% use air, 20% prefer fluid; 75% require intravenous access; 63% expect a surgeon to be present in hospital; 93% do not sedate. Although inflating a rectal balloon is controversial, 39% do so, and 50% employ a pressure-release valve. Seventy-two percent attempt reductions three times in the same position. In case of unsuccessful reductions, 64% wait and re-attempt later, 19% apply manual pressure, and 15% try again in left decubitus position. About 20% reattempt reduction after waiting 2 h or more.

Conclusion

By providing a better understanding of both trends in and diversity of current practice, we hope to increase the confidence with which the individual practitioner will approach each case.

### Opioid administration and reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^116PeHVu]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this global multicenter cross-sectional study add important new knowledge to the body of evidence characterizing specific factors associated with failed reduction of intussusception in children. Importantly, fentanyl, whether used as analgesia or a sedative adjunct, was not associated with failed reduction, suggesting that it should be considered for primary analgesia and, in settings where sedation may not be feasible, for pain management during reduction of intussusception.

### Intussusception: the use of delayed, repeated reduction attempts and the management of intussusceptions due to pathologic lead points in pediatric patients [^113DWk66]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The nonoperative management of intussusception continues to evolve and is the subject of ongoing debate. Our purpose was to assess our current enema reduction rate and to focus on two specific issues that have received little attention in the literature: first, the value and safety of using delayed, repeated reduction attempts and, second, the management of intussusceptions due to lead points.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of all intussusception cases seen at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, a tertiary pediatric hospital, from May 1999 to December 2002.

Results

There were 163 children with a total of 219 intussusceptions. Enema reduction was attempted in 211 (96%). Reduction rate with air enema was 90.2%. Delayed reduction attempts were used in 25 patients (15.3%) in 26 intussusceptions (12.3%) and were successful in 50% of the cases. Lead points were documented in 13 children (8%); sonography depicted the lead points in seven (53.8%) of the 13. The reduction rate of intussusceptions due to lead points was 63.6% (14/22).

Conclusion

Air enema associated with the use of delayed, repeated reduction attempts is a safe and effective approach for intussusception reduction with a high success rate. Delayed, repeated reduction attempts should be considered when the initial attempt manages to move the intussusceptum and the patient remains clinically stable. The management of intussusceptions due to lead points remains a challenge. Sonography does not depict all lead points, and the indication for other imaging studies should be tailored according to each particular patient. We recommend attempted enema reduction in all patients with lead points.

### Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of children with acute intussusception: a case series [^113FobsL]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Characteristics of the patients

Data are presented as n (%) or mean ± standard deviation

Among the 402 patients, 344 were treated with air enema reduction, and those not relieved by the initial enema were given repeat air enema. Those who still could not be reduced by delayed air enemas were considered as cases of reduction failure. The cases of reduction success were 335, with a success rate of 97.3%. There were nine cases of reduction failure, which were all successfully reduced by conversion to surgical reduction. Among them, one case of ileo-ileo-colic type and eight cases of ileo-colic type were found. No significant abnormalities were found during the intraoperative probing from the ileocecus to the proximal intestinal canal 1.5 cm in length. Fifty-eight patients were treated with intravenous phloroglucinol (2 mg/kg), and an ultrasound was reviewed 2 h later. The reduction was successful in 53 patients, with a success rate of 91.4%. There were five cases of reduction failure, all of which were successfully reduced after converting to air enema reduction (Table 2).

Table 2
Treatment Options and Outcomes

Data are presented as n (%)

The patients with a > 48 h delay between onset and treatment were due to the parents delaying visiting the hospital or due to travel time to reach the hospital. Still, their overall condition was stable, without high abdominal distension, obvious abdominal tenderness, or abdominal muscle tension, which are not absolute contraindications to air enema. Therefore, they were treated as other patients. Of these three patients, one was cured by air enema (1.5 cm), and two were cured by phloroglucinol (3.1 and 3.6 cm).

Among all successfully treated children, 65 cases suffered relapses, with a relapse rate of 16.8%. Among them, 33 relapsed twice, four relapsed three times, and seven relapsed more than four times. In the highest case, the child relapsed ten times within 2 years. Among those who relapsed more than four times, three were treated with fiberoptic colonoscopy, one had polyps in the terminal ileum, and two had no significant abnormalities.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^1128SnZW]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion, this study comprehensively summarizes the existing evidence on intussusception in adults. Current data remain of low quality because of the limited experience and rare presentation of this clinical entity. In the meantime, we propose an algorithm based on the present systematic review and institutional clinical practice to guide decision making when confronted with intussusception. In case of colic intussusception, a high degree of suspicion for an underlying malignancy is warranted, and in that regard, an oncological surgical resection without reduction is recommended. Enteric intussusception should be managed according to the length, clinical presentation, and interoperative findings of lead points.

### Management of childhood intussusception after reduction by enema [^117Rw4Nm]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to describe the utility of emergency department (ED)/outpatient management after enema reduction for childhood intussusception.

Methods

A retrospective medical record review of children aged 2 months to 6 years with confirmed intussusception who underwent enema reduction in a tertiary care academic children's hospital was performed. Subjects were analyzed with respect to location of care after reduction (ED/outpatient vs inpatient) and number, timing, and outcome of recurrences.

Results

One hundred seventeen patients were diagnosed with intussusception by contrast or air enema during the 15-year study period, and 56 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Ten patients (18%) were admitted to hospital after enema reduction. Mean length of stay was 33.7 hours in the hospitalized group and 7 hours in the ED group. Seven of the 56 patients had recurrences (12.5% recurrence rate). Two recurred while being observed in the ED (at 30 minutes and at 2 hours after reduction), 2 recurred at home (at 10 and 28 hours after reduction), and the other 3 recurred several months later. The early recurrence rate (recurring within 24 hours) was 5.3%. No patient had an adverse event (perforation, sepsis, bowel resection).

Conclusions

Outpatient management is used for the majority of patients with intussusception at our institution after enema reduction. The early recurrence rate is low, and patients with recurrence after discharge do well without adverse outcomes. Emergency department observation of patients after enema reduction appears to be safe and should be routine for uncomplicated cases of intussusception.

### Intussusception: a 14-year experience at a UK tertiary referral centre [^116uCgZ9]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Intussusception is the most common cause of acute intestinal obstruction in infants. First line management in uncomplicated cases at our centre is fluoroscopy guided air enema reduction. This study reports a 14 year UK single centre experience highlighting management and outcomes of intussusception in children.

Methods

All cases of intussusception (ICD 10-code K56.1) at a single tertiary referral centre from 2004 to 2017 were analyzed. Data evaluated included patient demographics, clinical presentation, treatment modality(s), complications and outcome(s).

Results

Two hundred ninety confirmed cases (69% male) of intussusception were identified during the study period. The median age at presentation was 9.5 months (range 4 days-15 years). One hundred eighty-six (64%) cases occurred in children who were transferred to Alder Hey from peripheral district hospitals. One hundred ninety-six cases (68%) proceeded directly to air enema reduction and successful reduction was achieved in 129 cases (66%). A single case (0.5%) of attempted air enema reduction was complicated by perforation. Early recurrence rate following air enema reduction was 9%. Operative management was indicated in 140 (48%) cases of which 66 required bowel resection (47%). There were no deaths.

Conclusions

We highlight one of the largest single centre UK studies defining practice outcomes for intussusception across the British Isles. Our centre has achieved a 66% success rate of non-operative reduction over 14 years in line with the British Society Pediatric Radiology (BSPR) recommendations and within 5% of the national median metric (71%). Moreover these outcomes were achieved with a very low complication rate (0.5%) from air enema reduction and no mortality in the series.

### Is sedation necessary for hydrostatic reduction in ileocolic intussusception? Evaluating procedural outcomes and parents' preferences [^115fjH29]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The necessity for procedural sedation during hydrostatic reduction for ileocolic intussusception in children is being debated. This study aimed to compare outcomes of procedures with and without sedation, as well as parental preferences.

Methods

This retrospective study (2019–2021) reviewed the medical records of children treated for ileocolic intussusception at two hospitals-one that did not provide sedation (non-sedation, NS) and one that did (with-sedation, WS) during hydrostatic reduction. The primary outcomes encompassed success rate, perforation, and recurrence. Parental satisfaction was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire.

Results

Data from 65 children were included: 42 in the NS group and 23 in the WS group. The hydrostatic reduction success rates were 79% (NS) and 74% (WS) (p = 0.670). One colon perforation occurred in each group (p = 0.661). Recurrence rates were 14.3% (NS) and 17.4% (WS) (p = 0.740). The questionnaire response rates were 48% (NS) and 57% (WS). Of the NS parents, 75% (15/20) were (very) satisfied with the procedure, compared with 85% (11/13) of WS parents (p = 0.196). Ten (50%) NS parents would have preferred sedation, while 46% (6/13) of WS parents would have preferred to be present during the procedure.

Conclusions

There were no significant differences in success rates, complications, or parental satisfaction between procedures performed with or without sedation during hydrostatic reduction. Effective pain management and a comforting approach are crucial for stress reduction. Shared decision-making with parents regarding the pros and cons of sedation is recommended.

### The frequency of postreduction interventions after successful enema reduction of intussusception [^111SjHU9]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to determine the frequency of postreduction, hospital-level interventions among children with successful reduction of ileocolic intussusception and identify factors that predict the need for such interventions.

Methods

This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of children who underwent successful enema reduction for ileocolic intussusception at a single emergency department. Hospital-level interventions were included if they occurred within 24 hours of reduction and were further classified as either major (recurrence or possible perforation) or minor (imaging for suspected recurrence or administration of parenteral narcotics or antiemetics). Binary logistic regression was used to identify predictors for hospital-level interventions.

Results

A total of 464 children underwent enema reduction. The median age was 1.7 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.8 to 2.5 years), and 66% were male. A total of 435 (94%) were hospitalized with a median hospital stay of 25 hours (IQR = 19 to 34 hours). Nineteen percent (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15% to 22%) needed postreduction interventions, including 6% (95% CI = 4% to 9%) who required major interventions. The median time to any hospital intervention was 9.9 hours (IQR = 6.3 to 16.4 hours). We identified two independent predictors for hospital-level interventions: duration of symptoms > 24 hours (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.4) and location of the intussusception tip at (or proximal to) the hepatic flexure (adjusted OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1 to 3.3); the latter factor was also a predictor of a major intervention. None of the children (95% CI = 0 to 1.0%) had an acute decompensation after an initially successful enema reduction.

Conclusions

Clinical decompensation is rare and recurrence is relatively low after an uncomplicated reduction of ileocolic intussusception. However, one in five children required hospital-level interventions after reduction. Children with the intussusception tip at (or proximal to) the hepatic flexure, and those with symptoms for longer than 24 hours, are more likely to require subsequent interventions. Although outpatient management appears safe after a period of observation, caregivers should be counseled about the risk of ongoing symptoms and recurrence.

### Sedation and analgesia for reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^114xEzgK]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Ileocolic intussusception is an important cause of intestinal obstruction in children. Reduction of ileocolic intussusception using air or fluid enema is the standard of care. This likely distressing procedure is usually performed without sedation or analgesia, but practice variation exists.

Objective

To characterize the prevalence of opioid analgesia and sedation and assess their association with intestinal perforation and failed reduction.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study reviewed medical records of children aged 4 to 48 months with attempted reduction of ileocolic intussusception at 86 pediatric tertiary care institutions in 14 countries from January 2017 to December 2019. Of 3555 eligible medical records, 352 were excluded, and 3203 medical records were eligible. Data were analyzed in August 2022.

Exposures

Reduction of ileocolic intussusception.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were opioid analgesia within 120 minutes of reduction based on the therapeutic window of IV morphine and sedation immediately before reduction of intussusception.

Results

We included 3203 patients (median [IQR] age, 17 [9–27] months; 2054 of 3203 [64.1%] males). Opioid use was documented in 395 of 3134 patients (12.6%), sedation 334 of 3161 patients (10.6%), and opioids plus sedation in 178 of 3134 patients (5.7%). Perforation was uncommon and occurred in 13 of 3203 patients (0.4%). In the unadjusted analysis, opioids plus sedation (odds ratio [OR], 5.92; 95% CI, 1.28–27.42; p = 0.02) and a greater number of reduction attempts (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.03–2.11; p = 0.03) were significantly associated with perforation. In the adjusted analysis, neither of these covariates remained significant. Reductions were successful in 2700 of 3184 attempts (84.8%). In the unadjusted analysis, younger age, no pain assessment at triage, opioids, longer duration of symptoms, hydrostatic enema, and gastrointestinal anomaly were significantly associated with failed reduction. In the adjusted analysis, only younger age (OR, 1.05 per month; 95% CI, 1.03–1.06 per month; P < .001), shorter duration of symptoms (OR, 0.96 per hour; 95% CI, 0.94–0.99 per hour; p = 0.002), and gastrointestinal anomaly (OR, 6.50; 95% CI, 2.04–20.64; p = 0.002) remained significant.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study of pediatric ileocolic intussusception found that more than two-thirds of patients received neither analgesia nor sedation. Neither was associated with intestinal perforation or failed reduction, challenging the widespread practice of withholding analgesia and sedation for reduction of ileocolic intussusception in children.

### Management of intussusception in infants and children… [^114xz3yX]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction Intussusception is the telescoping of a portion of the intestine into an adjacent segment of bowel. The occurrence of this in infants and children constitutes one of the commonest abdominal emergencies and is seen most frequently in the first two years of life. This telescoping of the intestine may occur at any level in the intestinal tract, but most frequently at the ileocolic junction. When the intussusception originates in the colon, ileocolic junction, or lower ileum, it may be reduced by air insufflation or enemata. When irreducible by conservative measures, or when the intussusception is proximal to the terminal ileum it constitutes a surgical emergency. At the time of operation, many of these intussusceptions can be reduced by manual taxis, as first advocated by Hutchinson. 1 However, a certain number will be found to be irreducible or gangrenous, and until the past decade these carried an exceedingly high mortality.

### Intussusception revisited: is immediate on-site surgeon availability at the time of reduction necessary? [^114yEt6M]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The American College of Radiology recommends that fluoroscopically guided intussusception reduction be performed with a surgeon readily available. At many institutions, this may not be feasible. The purpose of this study was to assess the utilization of immediate surgical services at the time of radiologic intussusception reduction.

Materials and Methods

All radiologic intussusception reductions at a tertiary care children's hospital from November 2007 through August 2012 were reviewed to determine method, complications, clinical status of the child, and time between unsuccessful reduction and operative intervention.

Results

Among 433 patients with intussusception referred for fluoroscopic reduction, 86.1% (n = 373) had successful reductions, and 13.9% (n = 60) had unsuccessful reductions. Five perforations represented 8.3% (5/60) of the unsuccessful and 1.2% (5/433) of the total reduction attempts. Six patients' conditions became hemodynamically unstable during attempted reduction (four perforations, two unsuccessful reductions without perforation), representing 10% (6/60) of unsuccessful and 1.4% (6/433) of total reduction attempts. Percutaneous needle decompression and cardiopulmonary resuscitation restored hemodynamic stability in all cases. The mean time to surgery after perforation was 1.3 hours, after unsuccessful reduction complicated by hemodynamic instability was 2.2 hours, and after unsuccessful radiologic reduction without complication was 4.3 hours.

Conclusion

In this series, complications requiring immediate medical or surgical attention were rare, occurring in 1.6% of cases (five bowel perforations, two cases of hemodynamic instability without perforation). On-site surgeon presence may not be necessary at the time of radiologically guided reduction attempts provided that the attending physician is facile with percutaneous needle decompression and management of hemodynamic instability and that ultimate surgical care can be arranged expeditiously.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^116oFqzF]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Adult intussusception is a rare clinical entity, representing 1%–5% of intestinal obstruction. Diagnosis is challenging, as symptoms may be acute or chronic and are often non‐specific. Because of the rarity of this disease, no clinical guidelines currently exist for its management, and randomized‐controlled trials are not feasible within realistic timeframes. As a result, debates continue regarding both surgical and conservative management, especially with the widespread use of CT scans for diagnosis. When surgery is indicated, debate remains about the type of procedure, the necessity of reduction, and whether resection should follow oncological standards.

The primary outcome of interest of this systematic review was the etiology causing the intussusception.

Even though considering a substantial risk of bias in this systematic review, especially due to publication and reporting bias, lack of etiological data in conservatively treated patients, and the predominance of large surgical series, the high percentage of malignancies in colocolic intussusceptions remains striking. Whereas the majority of intussusceptions are enteric and benign, malignancy was identified in 68% of colocolic intussusceptions. These finding are further supported by a multicentric retrospective study from Korea including 77 adult intussusceptions. In their cohort, the authors found that 61.5% of colonic intussusceptions had underlying malignancies and on multivariable analysis, colonic intussusception was found as an independent predictor of malignancy (OR 5.5, 95%CI 1.2‐24.3, p = 0.026) along with chronic symptoms (OR 4.6, 95%CI 1.2‐18.1, p = 0.031).

### Improving quality and efficiency for intussusception management after successful enema reduction [^115YYygr]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this project was to implement a protocol facilitating discharge from the emergency department (ED) after successful radiologic ileocolic intussusception reduction in a pediatric referral center.

Methods

A multidisciplinary team identified drivers for successful quality improvement including educational brochures, a standardized radiologic report, an observation period in the ER with oral hydration challenges, and follow-up phone calls the day after discharge. Patient outcomes were tracked, and quarterly feedback was provided.

Results

Of 80 patients identified over a 24-month period, 34 (42.5%) did not qualify for discharge home due to need for surgical intervention (n = 9), specific radiologic findings (n = 11), need for additional intravenous hydration (n = 4), or other reasons (n = 7). Of 46 patients who qualified for discharge, 30 (65.2%) were successfully sent home from the ED. One patient returned with recurrent symptoms that required repeat enema reduction. Sixteen patients were observed and discharged within 23 hours. Adherence with discharge from the ED improved over time. Discharge from the ED was associated with cost savings and improved net margins at the hospital level for each encounter.

Conclusions

A sustainable multidisciplinary quality improvement project to discharge intussusception patients from the ED after air-contrast enema reduction was successfully integrated in a high-volume referral center through education, standardized radiologic reporting, and protocoled follow-up.

TABLE 2
Size Comparisons of Single Intussusceptions

There were 51 episodes of multiple intussusceptions, and the number of intussusceptions was 105 in total. For successful reduction, the mean diameter of single intussusception was 22.45 ± 7.15 mm and that of multiple intussusceptions was 20.60 ± 4.96 mm. There was a significant difference between them (P = 0.002). The mean length of single intussusception was 33.41 ± 11.95 mm and that of multiple intussusceptions was 32.12 ± 10.17 mm. There was no significant difference between them (P = 0.467).

Recurrent Intussusception and Surgery

Fifty-three (7.53%) children, with 117 (14.96%) episodes, had recurrent intussusception, and all of them were following successful reduction enemas. The age of 53 patients at the first intussusception ranged from 10 months to 8 years (median, 33.06 ± 17.86 months), and the interval between attacks ranged 1 day to 21 months. Thirty-one (3.40%) episodes were found to have spontaneously reduced. Five patients (0.7%) underwent surgery after the failure of an air enema or B-USGHE. There was neither perforation nor mortality (Table 1).

### Lactic acid level as an outcome predictor in pediatric patients with intussusception in the emergency department [^111eFsrk]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Intussusception, an abdominal emergency, is one of the most frequent causes of bowel obstruction in the pediatric population. Its treatment involves reduction, using an air or barium enema, or, in some cases, surgical reduction. If intussusception is not relieved, the bowel vascular supply becomes compromised, causing intestinal ischemia progression and a risk of perforation. Therefore, identifying the conditions that increase the risk of a poor outcome (e.g. recurrence or difficult-to-relieve cases) is important. Previous studies have described the risk factors for recurrent intussusception, including age, presence of pathological leading points, and symptom duration. However, the association between specific laboratory findings and outcomes has not been investigated.

Elevated lactic acid levels occur secondary to tissue hypoperfusion/hypoxia or to causes unrelated to tissue hypoxia. Hypoperfusion-driven cases include all forms of shock, post-cardiac arrest, and regional ischemia. Interestingly, reversible or irreversible intestinal ischemia develops following intussusception, potentially causing elevated lactic acid levels. In this study, we evaluated the association between lactic acid levels at the time of intussusception diagnosis and outcomes.

### Management of intussusception in children: a systematic review [^1128tfEX]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The goal of this systematic review by the American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Evidence-Based Practice Committee was to develop recommendations for the management of ileocolic intussusception in children.

Methods

The ClinicalTrials.gov, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases were queried for literature from January 1988 through December 2018. Search terms were designed to address the following topics in intussusception: prophylactic antibiotic use, repeated enema reductions, outpatient management, and use of minimally invasive techniques for children with intussusception. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Consensus recommendations were derived based on the best available evidence.

Results

A total of 83 articles were analyzed and included for review. Prophylactic antibiotic use does not decrease complications after radiologic reduction. Repeated enema reductions may be attempted when clinically appropriate. Patients can be safely observed in the emergency department following enema reduction of ileocolic intussusception, avoiding hospital admission. Laparoscopic reduction is often successful.

Conclusions

Regarding intussusception in hemodynamically stable children without critical illness, pre-reduction antibiotics are unnecessary, non-operative outpatient management should be maximized, and minimally invasive techniques may be used to avoid laparotomy.

### The role of glucocorticoids in recurrent idiopathic intussusception: a retrospective cohort study [^112EQvki]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Based on a large-sample study, the results of the present study demonstrated that glucocorticoid therapy effectively reduced the recurrence rate in patients with short-term recurrent idiopathic intussusception, despite variations in the types of glucocorticoids administered. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the role of glucocorticoids in the treatment of intussusception, with some studies supporting their use while others have reported no significant benefit. Notably, these studies exclusively enrolled patients with intussusception. The present study focused on children with short-term recurrent idiopathic intussusception, demonstrating that glucocorticoid treatment effectively reduced recurrence rate in this population.

Short-term recurrent idiopathic intussusception requires a more radical therapeutic approach. Herein, when intussusception recurred three times within five days, the risk of subsequent recurrence was as high as 46.6%. Similarly, an earlier study reported recurrence rates of 46.6% and 52.5% after three and four intussusception episodes without additional treatment, respectively, which were markedly higher than the recurrence rate in all pediatric intussusception cases (9–20%). Another retrospective study involving 686 children with intussusception also suggested that the risk of recurrence after the third and fourth enema reductions was 68.4% and 100%, respectively. Of note, prolonged elevated intestinal pressure can increase the risk of intestinal damage and perforation. Moreover, repeated enema reductions can be distressing for both children and parents, necessitating further intervention.

### Intussusception… [^1177GB4U]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Signs and symptoms Children with intussusceptions suddenly develop severe abdominal pain with vomiting at frequent intervals. During the episodes of pain, they may draw their knees up to their abdomen while crying. They may appear well in between episodes of pain. If the intussusception is not treated, symptoms can worsen to include bilious vomit and bloody stool. Diagnosis A history of intermittent severe abdominal pain with vomiting and bloody diarrhea is highly suggestive of an intussusception. On physical examination, the doctor may feel a sausage-shaped mass in the area of the abdomen that corresponds to the small or large intestine. An abdominal ultrasound can confirm a case of intussusception. The doctor may see evidence of bowel telescoping on itself. On an ultrasound, this is called a target sign. Treatment Once an ileocolic intussusception is diagnosed, it should be treated as soon as possible.

Physicians often check electrolyte and hemoglobin levels in the child's blood and may give intravenous fluids. A radiological reduction of the intussusception is usually attempted first. This involves a contrast enema. Using a catheter, the doctor pushes air or contrast material into the bowel through the child's rectum. This forces the affected segment of intestine out and into a normal position. Surgery is performed when a contrast enema is unsuccessful or the doctor is concerned about damage to the intestines. Surgery may involve reducing the intussusception or removing the involved intestine. The appendix is often also removed during this operation. Prognosis Early recognition and treatment of intussusception are important to reduce the risk of damage to the intestine. Children who have had an intussusception are at higher risk of having a recurrence soon after reduction.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^111wSAQE]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

3.4 Management

Operative management was performed in 65% of intussusceptions (1581/2432 intussusceptions, 2330 patients, based on 37 studies). Excluding studies including only surgically operated patients, conservative management was performed in 851/1683 intussusceptions (51%). Data regarding surgical access through open or minimally invasive surgery were available in 14 studies for 778 patients. Most patients (n = 564, 72%) underwent open management, whereas 214 (28%) underwent minimally invasive surgery. Data regarding surgical management of the intussusception were heterogenous and poorly reported (available in only 23 studies). En bloc resection without prior reduction was carried out in 676/1063 intussusceptions (64%), reduction and resection were performed in 206/972 (21%), and reduction alone was performed in 66/1063 (6%). Regarding spontaneously reduced intussusceptions, 31 studies reported whether they had negative findings upon exploratory surgery. This was the case in 214/1250 intussusceptions (17%).

Data regarding conservative and surgical treatment can be found in Table 1, whereas Table 3 summarizes the details of surgical management.

Operative management.

3.5 Treatment Algorithm

Based on the results of this systematic review, we propose a pragmatic treatment algorithm for management of intussusception (Figure 2). Because of high malignancy rates for both ileocolic and colocolic intussusceptions, these types were grouped under "large bowel".

### Management of the child after enema-reduced intussusception: hospital or home? [^116ykEk5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Standard practice has been to admit children for an observation period after enema-reduced intussusception. However, the utility of such routine practice has not been clearly justified.

Study Objectives

The main objective was to determine the rate and timing of recurrent intussusception after successful enema reduction and describe any associated complications.

Methods

The study was a retrospective chart review identifying children with enema-reduced intussusception during a 7-year period from 2002 through 2008. Subjects were children ages 0 to 17 years presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary care, free-standing children's hospital with confirmed and uncomplicated enema-reduced intussusception.

Results

During the study period there were 98 children with successful enema reduction of intussusception. There were 10 episodes of recurrence in 7 patients, for an overall recurrence rate of 7.1%. Three patients had two recurrences each, and the remainder had single recurrences. Two patients had early recurrences (< 48 h) at 3 and 5 h, for an early recurrence rate of 2.0%. The late recurrence rate (> 48 h) was 5.1%. No adverse events were noted in any of the recurrences.

Conclusions

Given the low early recurrence rate for enema-reduced intussusception and the minimal risk of adverse outcomes, ED observation for a 6-h period seems to be a safe alternative to inpatient management. These results support previous work and suggest that these patients can be managed on an outpatient basis.

### Intussusception among Japanese children: an epidemiologic study using an administrative database [^113zHSLa]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction among infants and young children, and can also affect older children and adolescents. Improvements have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception; however, poor outcomes can still occur, even in developed countries.

In 1999, Rotashield (the first-generation rotavirus vaccine licensed in the United States) was withdrawn from the market because of a potential increased risk of intussusception. Two recent studies investigated whether the second-generation Rotavirus vaccine was also associated with an increased risk of intussusception, and revealed conflicting results. One post-marketing survey reported a small but statistically significant increased risk, while the other study found no evidence of an elevated risk of intussusception. The potential risk of intussusception among vaccinated children has motivated researchers to estimate the baseline risk of intussusception. In the last several years, a growing number of studies have been published focusing on the incidence of intussusception. Several surveys have also been published regarding the incidence of intussusception in Eastern Asia including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vietnam. However, the results vary, ranging from 70 to 300 cases per 100,000 children, suggesting that there are regional differences in the incidence of intussusception.

The primary goal of our study was to describe the epidemiology of childhood intussusception in Japan, including patients' demographic characteristics, management, and outcomes, and to estimate the baseline incidence of infantile intussusception before the introduction of the Rotavaccine program.

### Clinical entity and treatment strategies for adult intussusceptions: 20 years' experience [^116uAaVr]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Intestinal intussusception in adults is rare and the optimal management of this problem remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the causes of intussusceptions in adults and to assess their treatment.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients older than aged 18 years who were diagnosed with intestinal intussusception at Tri-Service General Hospital between July 1984 and July 2004 was conducted.

Results

During the 20-year period, there were 292 patients with intussusception, 24 (8.2 percent) of which were adults. Abdominal pain was the most common presenting complaint (79.2 percent). The diagnosis of adult intussusception was made preoperatively in 18 cases (75 percent) and intraoperatively in 6 cases (25 percent). Of the 24 patients, 20 (83.3 percent) had a defined lesion; 11 (55 percent) lesions were benign and 9 (45 percent) were malignant. In eight patients (33.3 percent), the intussusception was reduced; perforation occurred in one patient (12.5 percent). Segmental resections were performed on 14 patients (58.3 percent), right hemicolectomies on 6 patients (25 percent), laparoscopic low anterior resection on 1 patient (4.2 percent), appendectomy on 1 patient (4.2 percent), and diverticulectomy on 1 patient (4.2 percent). Intraoperative colonoscopy was performed on three patients (12.5 percent) before reduction (lipomas were noted in 2 of the patients (66.7 percent) with limited resection of the ileum and preservation of the antireflux ileocecal valve. There was one perioperative mortality (4.2 percent) and seven postoperative morbidities (29.2 percent).

Conclusions

Adult intussusception is an unusual and challenging condition and is a preoperative diagnostic problem. We discuss our 20 years of experience in treatment strategies for dealing with such unusual problems.

### The role of glucocorticoids in recurrent idiopathic intussusception: a retrospective cohort study [^113e4C6e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included patients with intussusception who visited the Emergency Center of Beijing Children's Hospital from January 2015 to January 2024. The study was performed in accordance with the ethical principles detailed in the Declaration of Helsinki and followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University (Number: [2024]-E-142-R).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria were as follows: a diagnosis of ileocolic intussusception, recurrent episodes within a short term, and treatment with fluoroscopy-guided air enema (FGAE). Recurrent episodes in the short term were defined as three occurrences within five days following successful reduction, which was also defined as a recurrent intussusception event (RIE). The diagnosis of ileocolic intussusception and recurrent intussusception was based on typical clinical manifestations and ultrasound findings. Successful reduction was defined as the disappearance of the abdominal mass and radiographic confirmation of the entry of gas into the small intestine during air enema.

Exclusion criteria included the identification of a pathologic lead point (PLP) by ultrasound or FGAE, surgical reduction, glucocorticoid administration after two intussusception episodes, glucocorticoid administration for other medical conditions, and missing or incomplete imaging data. A PLP was defined as a pathologic abnormality serving as the lead point for intussusception, other than lymphoid follicle hyperplasia at the ileal end.

Treatment groups

After the third episode within 5 days, with successful FGAE and resolution of dehydration, a fasting abdominal ultrasound was performed to check for the presence of a PLP. Some children received glucocorticoids in the absence of a PLP (intervention group), while the remaining children maintained their current treatment without glucocorticoids (control group). The study flow is depicted in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Inclusion Flowchart

Administration methods

Glucocorticoids used in this study comprised dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisone acetate, administered at doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day, 2.7 mg/kg/day, and 1.7 mg/kg/time, twice daily, respectively. Dexamethasone and methylprednisolone were intravenously administered for 1 to 4 days, whereas prednisone acetate was orally administered. The glucocorticoid administration regimen was determined at the discretion of the surgeon responsible for the patient's treatment at the emergency center, based on the patients' feasibility of accessing outpatient, emergency, or observational treatment.

### Management of adult intussusception – A case series experience from a tertiary center [^1141iJEw]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of intussusception is controversial. Clinical presentation, with the aid of imaging modalities, enables a better selection of patients for the appropriate treatment algorithm. Conservative management versus surgical intervention with bowel resection is considered accordingly.

Methods

Retrospective review of a computerized database of patients who were admitted with intussusception between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020, in a single tertiary center in Israel. Patients who were treated conservatively were compared to those who underwent surgery. Patients who underwent bowel resection were compared to those that had surgery without a resection.

Results

A total of 76 patients were diagnosed with intussusception, and 49 were operated. Bowel resection was performed in 32 cases. 20/76(26%) were successfully managed conservatively. Patients with a lead point (OR = 5.59) and colonic involvement (OR = 13.72) had a higher likelihood for resection. The likelihood of bowel resection was found to be significantly lower with proximal small bowel intussusception (OR = 0.071).

Conclusion

Young patients presenting with intussusception may be treated conservatively when adequate criteria are met in order to avoid unnecessary surgical interventions.

### Management of recurrent ileocolic intussusception [^114LPy8s]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aims of this study were to evaluate the need for surgical intervention for patients with recurrent ileocolic intussusception (RICI), especially for multiple recurrences, and to investigate whether early and late recurrence patterns were associated with surgery.

Methods

Patients with ileocolic intussusception (ICI) during the years 2007–2019 were included. Demographic data, recurrences, and outcomes were analyzed. Early RICI was defined as recurrence within 48 h.

Results

Overall, 604 episodes of ICI were confirmed in 491 patients. The recurrence rate was 13.8%, with 113 episodes in 68 patients. There were no statistically significant differences in age, reduction success rate, operation, or pathological lead points (PLPs) between the recurrence and non-recurrence groups. There was no significant association between the number of recurrences and the presence of a PLP or between the number of recurrences and whether the recurrences were early or late. The presence of PLPs was not significantly associated with age or recurrence, but the reduction success rate was significantly lower (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Each recurrence should be managed as a first episode, regardless of early or late recurrence. Operative reduction should be considered when nonoperative reduction fails, a PLP is suspected, or there are signs of peritonitis.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^117ETLmk]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The recurrence rate of intussusception varies greatly, with reported rates of 2% to 20%. The incidence of pathological lead point (PLP) in all children with intussusception was 3.9% to 10%. PLP was present in 14% of the children who had 2 or more recurrences compared with 4% of those children who had only 1 recurrence.– There is universal consensus that PLP is a risk factor for recurrence. Instead, some documents think that the rates of PLP among children with 1 or more episodes of intussusception is similar, and there is no association between recurrent intussusceptions and PLP. The enema success rate of recurrent intussusceptions was 96% to 100%. In the current data, 53 (7.53%) children had recurrent intussusception within the age from 10 months to 8 years, all of which were after successful enema or conservative treatment. Nonoperative treatment was still the first choice, regardless of which treatment they have previously received.

Nonoperative reduction should be attempted in most patients with acute primary intussusception. Air enema reduction under fluoroscopy or B-USGHE has been the main procedure. The reduction success rate based on published literature achieved at least 80% and even as high as 100%.– In our data, there was a cleansing enema for intussusception reduction that was initially used for intestinal preparation before an air enema. We occasionally found that some intussusceptions were reduced after cleansing enema on repeat B-ultrasound. For single intussusception, the success rate of cleansing enema was 65.25%, that of air enema was 95.80% and that of B-USGHE was 96.04%, meanwhile, the success rate of cleansing enema was 43.90%, the of air enema was 75.00% and that of B-USGFE was 57.60% for multiple intussusceptions. There was no difference in success rate between the air enema group and the B-USGHE group. Although the success rate in the cleansing enema group was lower than that in the air enema and B-USGHE groups, it had great significance in protecting some children from radiation exposure and avoiding unnecessary suffering.

### Sedation and analgesia for reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^117GUKqi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The frequency of failed reduction in our sample (15.2%) is consistent with previous reports. The findings of a recent systematic review that included 1434 children who underwent sedation reported a success rate of 86.9% under sedation. Our finding that neither analgesia nor sedation was associated with failed reduction is in line with evidence that sedation actually improves the success rate of both hydrostatic, and pneumatic enema reduction. For reasons that remain uncertain, in the adjusted analysis, we found that older age and shorter duration of symptoms were associated with an increased odds of failed reduction. Importantly, the strength of these associations was very weak and future prospective studies should control for factors, such as clinician experience, length of intussusception, and duration of symptoms.

Our findings provide preliminary evidence that neither opioid analgesia nor sedation is associated with perforation or failed reduction. Although this may inform the decision to consider analgesia and sedation, there are no studies that have rigorously characterized the pain and distress associated with reduction of intussusception. Clinicians must also weigh the potential benefit of sedation for patient comfort with the need for specialized equipment, monitoring, and personnel trained in pediatric resuscitative maneuvers outside the acute care setting. Nevertheless, our work lays the foundation for future interventional studies that may provide definitive evidence of distress during reduction of intussusception and evaluate the risks and benefits of providing analgesia and sedation, while controlling for risk factors for perforation and failed reduction, such as age and clinician experience.

In our study, the magnitude of intussusception admission was 2.38% of all admissions, and it had an increasing trend. A recent systematic review estimated that the annual incidence of hospital admissions for intussusception ranged from 34 to 90 per 100 000 children under 1 year of age. There has been recent concern about the increased incidence of intussusception due to vaccination against rotavirus. However, it has been suggested from a modeling analysis based on 135 countries that rotavirus vaccines had a favorable benefit–risk profile in LMICs. We could not analyze the impact of rotavirus vaccination during the increasing trend in our series because vaccination was not recorded. Moreover, it is difficult to comment on whether the increase in the number of cases in our series was an actual rise of patients or occurred due to an increase in number of patients seeking medical advice.

### Intussusception: past, present and future [^113eo5LU]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Intussusception is a common etiology of acute abdominal pain in children. Over the last 70 years, there have been significant changes in how we diagnose and treat intussusception, with a more recent focus on the role of ultrasound. In this article we discuss historical and current approaches to intussusception, with an emphasis on ultrasound as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality.

### Delay of ileocolic intussusception reduction is safe and may confer benefit [^112CCc2B]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of ileocolic intussusception has evolved through the years. This retrospective observational study examined the relationship of time to initial reduction on outcomes and the implementation of a guideline standardizing selective, delayed repeat imaging and fluoroscopic reduction.

Materials and Methods

All ileocolic intussusception encounters 5 y prior to and 21 mo after practice guideline implementation (June 2022) were identified. Outcomes included spontaneous reduction, need for surgery, type of surgery (laparoscopy versus laparotomy), need for bowel resection, 30-d emergency department visits, 30-d readmission rate, and administration of intravenous pain medication (a guideline compliance metric).

Results

Among 243 included encounters (181 preguideline and 50 postguideline implementation), 164 patients had an initially successful fluoroscopic reduction. Twenty-two patients had a partially successful initial reduction (18 preguideline and 4 postguideline). Neither delay of initial ileocolic reduction attempt nor guideline implementation for selective repeat reduction attempt was associated with need for operation, need for resection, 30-d emergency department visits nor 30-d readmission rate. More patients received intravenous pain medication postguideline.

Conclusions

Neither increased time to initial fluoroscopic reduction of ileocolic intussusception nor guideline implementation for selective repeat delayed reduction attempt are associated with poor patient outcomes and may confer benefit as it allows for spontaneous reduction. The need for surgical intervention among patients with initial partial fluoroscopic reduction of intussusception can frequently be obviated using delayed repeat ultrasound and repeat fluoroscopic reduction attempts.

### Adult intussusception: diagnosis and clinical relevance [^1174KRZi]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Intussusception is relatively rare in the adult population and differs substantially from pediatric intussusception. Most adult intussusceptions identified at surgery are caused by a definable structural lesion, a substantial proportion of which are malignant, particularly in the colon. Small bowel intussusceptions, however, have a lower prevalence of malignancy. Diagnosis of adult intussusception can be made reliably with noninvasive imaging techniques. CT is now widely regarded as the modality of choice for diagnosing intussusception in adults, but ultrasound and MR imaging have also been used effectively. Determination of the presence of a malignant lead point remains problematic because an edematous or hemorrhagic intussuscipiens may mimic a mass on each modality. Markers for bowel viability have been described but are not precise. Treatment of the persistent symptomatic intussusception in which neoplasia is suspected is surgical, and preoperative reduction is contraindicated. Transient relatively asymptomatic enteric intussusceptions discovered by imaging may not require intervention.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic constipation [^116zJgFL]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Defecatory disorders — evaluation and testing: Patients who fail to improve with dietary changes, fiber therapy, and osmotic laxatives should be evaluated for outlet dysfunction. Anorectal physiology testing or dynamic imaging by fluoroscopic defecography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) defecography, or dynamic ultrasound may help identify functional or structural causes related to an evacuation disorder. Strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence. Evacuation disorder or outlet dysfunction are accepted terms for inability to satisfactorily expel stool and are the most common cause of medically refractory chronic constipation; further evaluation is indicated after failure of first-line therapies. The balloon expulsion test (BET) is a widely used, easily performed direct test in which a patient requires to expel a 50 mL water-filled balloon; although it is reproducible, specific, and can predict biofeedback response, it has a low sensitivity of 50% and does not delineate the underlying cause of an evacuation disorder. Anorectal manometry and sensation testing are indirect tests that can clarify functional causes and, together with BET, are used by the London protocol classification of defecatory dysfunction: 1) disorders of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex; 2) disorders of anal tone and contractility; 3) disorders of rectoanal coordination; and 4) disorders of rectal sensation. Defecography is the only direct test of evacuation and evaluates anatomical and functional causes; a systematic review of 63 studies (7519 barium defecographies; 668 MRI defecographies) in chronic constipation found pathological high-grade (Oxford III and IV) intussusception in 23.7%, large (> 4 cm) rectoceles in 15.9%, enterocele descent in 16.8%, and perineal descent in 44.4% of patients. Although MRI is performed in the supine position, fluoroscopic defecography, performed in the seated position, is considered the evacuation examination with the most construct validity.

### Clinical manifestation and treatment of intussusception in children aged 3 months and under: a single centre analysis of 38 cases [^1135QUFM]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The applicability of conservative treatment for acute intussusception in infants younger than 3 months remains a topic of debate. A single-center retrospective analysis suggests that cautiously operated pneumatic reduction as the primary diagnostic and therapeutic approach should be considered for small infants. However, some studies suggested that surgical intervention should be more readily considered for this age group, often due to the higher incidence of pathological changes associated with small bowel intussusception and the risks of failed reduction and bowel perforation stemming from the thinner intestinal walls and lower tolerance. Meckel's diverticulum and intestinal duplication are among the most common pathological factors. In our study, secondary factors were identified in 5 cases, representing an incidence of 13.2% (5/38), which is not considered high. In this study, enema reduction was performed in 27 cases (71.1%), yielding 13 successful attempts and a success rate of 48.1% (13/27). Although the success rate of enema reduction is not high in young infants, it still provided considerable clinical benefits compared to surgical reduction in all cases. The only adverse event that occurred during the enema procedure involved a 3-day-old neonate, who developed a bowel perforation. Based on our findings, we recommend surgery as the most reliable option for neonatal intussusception due to the fragility of neonatal intestines and the high risk of strangulation and perforation. For stable small infants without dehydration, shock, or signs of peritoneal irritation, cautious hydrostatic enema reduction can be attempted, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Partial reduction may assist in locating the intussusception head, guiding surgical incision. Continuous monitoring of symptoms, imaging findings, and enema pressure is essential to minimize complications. Diagnostic pressure should start at 8 kPa and be carefully increased, not exceeding 13.3 kPa (10 kPa for newborns), with real-time imaging guidance.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^113ayuy5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The mean diameter of single intussusception was larger than that of multiple intussusceptions. This means that multiple intussusceptions may be mainly small intussusceptions. Park et alreported that the mean diameter was 16.8 ± 5.2 mm with small bowel intussusception and 27.4 ± 4.3 mm with ileocolic intussusception. Demirel et alreported that the mean length of spontaneously reduced intussusception was 23 ± 3.02 mm, and the median length of successful hydrostatic reduced intussusception was 45 mm (range, 27–160 mm). Rajagopal et alreported that the mean diameter of intussusception requiring surgical reduction was 33 mm (range, 29–54 mm), and the length was 56 mm (range, 23–78 mm). The mean diameter of transient small bowel intussusception was 12 mm (range, 8–23 mm), and the length was 22.5 mm (range, 18–45 mm). The assessment of the intussusception size by B-ultrasound examination may be useful in the management of intussusception.

There is not much evidence to support that air enemas may be more effective than hydrostatic enemas for reducing intussusception in children. The greatest advantage of B-USGHE is that it does not involve radiation exposure in children; therefore, reduction can be attempted repeatedly and patiently. The successful reduction rate is determined by local management patterns, selection criteria, and the skill of operators. In the current data, only 5 (0.7%) children underwent emergency surgery after failed reduction, and we did not determine how many children underwent surgery due to underlying causes in a later period of time by follow-up.

### Reduction of intussusception: defining a better index of successful non-operative treatment [^113LQCSA]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The reported non-operative reduction rate for intussusception is usually the proportion of attempted non-operative (radiological) reductions that succeed, which we term the "selective reduction rate". This value shows wide variation that may result from selection bias that is difficult to quantify because data regarding primary operative treatment are frequently lacking. The proportion of patients with late clinical presentation or pathological lead points can also distort the apparent efficacy of non-operative treatment. We found no definitions of outcome measures in the literature or practice guidelines to inform analysis. Based on analysis of our own audit data we derived a "composite reduction rate" from first principles that can account for variations in radiological and surgical treatment thresholds that might bias other measures of successful non-operative treatment. This index is the proportion of intussusceptions not requiring resection that are successfully reduced non-operatively. We propose that the composite reduction rate be used as a key component of standardised multidisciplinary outcome reporting for intussusception rather than the selective reduction rate. The reduced bias and confounding would allow fairer comparisons and lead to better outcome standards.

### Clinical management and recommendations for children with more than four episodes of recurrent intussusception following successful reduction of each: an institutional review [^112WVYfJ]. Clinical Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To describe patterns and risk factors of multiple recurrences to optimise management for pediatric patients with more than four episodes of intussusception.

Materials and Methods

Following IRB approval, all sonographic evaluations for intussusception in patients < 18 years over a 6-year period were reviewed. Data extracted included age at onset of first intussusception, gender, presenting symptoms, symptoms upon recurrence, presence of pathological lead points, and surgical findings.

Results

During a 6-year period, five cases had four or more instances of recurrence after enema reduction attempts. All patients were male with an average age of 16 months. Two of the five cases resolved after the fourth enema reduction and no lead points were identified. Two other cases involved surgical reduction with intraoperative findings of Meckel's diverticulum and juvenile polyp. The final case had five recurrence episodes and six separate enema reductions. Ultimately, lymphoid hyperplasia was discovered on colonoscopy and the patient never recurred after being treated with steroids.

Conclusion

Given the favorable reduction rate in re-recurrent cases and complete lack of perforation observed, up to four attempts at enema reduction is recommended before considering an alternative strategy. If recurrence continues past the fourth reduction attempt, computed tomography (CT) is recommended to identify a lead point. If CT remains inconclusive, then consider exploratory laparotomy.

Recurrent intussusception is defined as an occurrence of intussusception of a bowel loop in a patient with a prior resolution of intussusception, either spontaneously or with an intervention. It is not rare to develop a subsequent episode after a successful reduction of intussusception. We report the cases of 2 children who presented to the emergency department with recurrent intussusception and review the pertinent literature.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^111KJDJU]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Intussusception is defined as the telescoping or invagination of one segment of the gastrointestinal tract into an adjacent segment. This condition can lead to various complications, such as bowel obstruction, ischemia, and even perforation. It is most commonly observed in children, where it is typically primary and benign, often resolving with nonoperative reduction using a water‐soluble contrast enema. In contrast, intussusception is rare in adults, accounting for approximately 5% of all cases of intussusception and accounting for approximately 1%–5% of intestinal obstructions. Pediatric intussusception is characterized by the classic triad of abdominal pain, a palpable mass, and 'red currant jelly' stool, although this triad is present in only a minority of cases. In adults, diagnosis is more challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, which can be acute or chronic and often require further diagnostic work‐up, such as imaging or endoscopy. Whereas nonoperative management represents the initial treatment strategy in pediatric intussusceptions; adult intussusceptions involve a lead point in up to 92% of patients, potentially related to a malignant tumor and therefore requiring different management. Whereas surgery is often required to determine the underlying etiology, the optimal surgical strategy remains a subject of debate. Although surgical reduction may prevent unnecessary bowel resection, it carries risks, including intraluminal seeding or venous tumor dissemination in cases of malignancy, or spillage in cases of perforation. Currently, there are no established guidelines for the surgical management of intussusception in adult patients, with most available data derived from individual institutional case series.

With advancements in technology and the widespread use of CT‐scans in both emergency and elective settings, the detection rate of incidental or small intussusceptions is increasing. This has further fueled debate concerning their treatment and the possibility of conservative management.

For these reasons, the primary objectives of this study were to conduct a systematic review of the literature on adult intussusception and secondly to propose a management algorithm to guide surgeons in their daily practice.

### Intussusception among young children in Europe [^117S13ZZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Intussusception, a potentially lethal condition with poorly understood etiology, is the most common cause of acute intestinal obstruction in children younger than 5 years old. In some cases, the condition has been associated with administration of the first licensed rotavirus vaccine, the reassortant rhesus-human tetravalent rotavirus vaccine (RRV-TV; RotaShield). No such association has to date been reported from large phase III safety trials with new rotavirus vaccines. As 2 new, live-attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines are currently under review for approval by the European Union regulatory authorities, a review of the clinical, etiologic and epidemiologic aspects of intussusception in Europe is urgently needed. We conducted a review of Medline literature, published from 1995 onwards on intussusception in the World Health Organization's European Region. The results are compared with data from previous reviews and other regions. The classic triad of intussusception symptoms (abdominal pain, abdominal mass, bloody stools) was present in 29–33% of patients according to the medical literature reviewed. Conservative treatment (barium, air or saline enema) was the rule (81% of cases), and few complications were observed during treatment. Treatment outcome was generally favorable, with recurrence occurring in approximately 1 in 10 patients, and only 1 death reported. Structural lead points were seen in 3% of patients; no other reliable data on the etiology of intussusception were found. The incidence of acute intussusception in young children in Europe, according to 6 heterogeneous hospital-based studies, ranged from 0.66 to 2.24 per 1000 children in inpatient departments and from 0.75 to 1.00 per 1000 children in emergency departments. Peak incidences were found in children 3–9 months of age. There are still gaps in our knowledge of intussusception with respect to its etiology and especially by which mechanisms RRV-TV might have caused it to occur. Data from regions outside Europe showed that rotavirus infection and disease are not associated with intussusception. As new rotavirus vaccines become available for use in Europe, postlicensure surveillance for intussusception is indicated and may be instrumental in further understanding the epidemiology of this condition and in further assessing the safety of future vaccines.

### Management of intussusception [^115yhbA4]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Intussusception represents the most common abdominal emergency in infancy. The classical clinical triad, consisting of abdominal colics, red jelly stools and a palpable mass, is only present in approximately 50% of cases, 20% of patients are symptom free at clinical presentation. Primary imaging modality of choice is ultrasound scanning, which enables the diagnosis or exclusion of an intussusception at a sensitivity of 98–100%, specificity of 88% and a negative predictive value of 100%. In emergency cases, additional plain films are necessary to detect potential intestinal perforation, to identify intestinal obstruction or other diseases mimicking the clinical presentation. Once the diagnosis of an intussusception is established, non-surgical reduction (NSR) is used. A surgical approach is chosen in patients with signs of perforation, shock or peritonitis. Depending on the choice of guiding imaging technique, different contrast media are used for NSR. Barium suspension or air with fluoroscopic guidance, or saline only or mixed with water-soluble contrast under sonographic guidance, has to be used. Regardless of the used contrast medium, NSR is an effective technique, being successfully employed in more than 90% of cases.

### Clinical manifestation and treatment of intussusception in children aged 3 months and under: a single centre analysis of 38 cases [^116kov25]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

FGPR is common treatment method for intussusception due to its high success rate proven effectiveness, and low complication rate. Eight of our cases were successfully treated using this method. However, UGHR has increasingly replacing FGPR in many institutions due to its lack of radiation, high success rate, and minimal complications. Since its implementation in our hospital in 2019, we have seen a higher success rate with UGHR compared to pneumatic enema, with 5 out of 6 infants successfully reduced. UGHR is particularly beneficial for infants under 3 months, as it it eliminates radiation exposure and can be performed in the ward, it facilitates easier management. It allows for continuous monitoring during reduction, offers better patient comfort and is safer than pneumatic enema, which requires transfer to the radiology department. Additionally, The pressure of the hydraulic enema is uniform, which reduces irritation of the bowel and minimizes complications such as potential aspiration or risk of bowel perforation.

### Comparative effectiveness of imaging modalities for the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception: a critically appraised topic [^116RNdXc]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to critically appraise and compare the diagnostic performance of imaging modalities that are used for the diagnosis of intussusception and methods used in the treatment of ileocolic intussusception.

Methods

A focused clinical question was constructed and the literature was searched using the patient, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) method comparing radiography, ultrasound, and computed tomography in the detection of intussusception. The same methods were used to compare pneumatic (gas) reduction and hydrostatic (liquid) reduction using saline, water-soluble contrast, and barium. Retrieved articles were appraised and assigned a level of evidence based on the Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine hierarchy of validity for diagnostic studies.

Results

The retrieved sensitivity for the diagnosis of intussusception using plain radiography is 48% (95% confidence interval [CI] 44%-52%), with a specificity of 21% (95% CI, 18%-24%). The retrieved sensitivity for the diagnosis of intussusception using ultrasound is 97.9% (95% CI, 95%-100%), with a specificity of 97.8% (95% CI, 97%-99%). Based on a good quality meta-analysis, the combined success rate of gas enema reduction was shown to be 82.7% (95% CI, 79.9%-85.6%) compared to a combined success rate of 69.6% (95% CI, 65.0%-74.1%) for liquid enema reduction.

Conclusions

The best available evidence recommends ultrasound as the diagnostic modality of choice for the diagnosis of ileocolic intussusception in children. In stable children without signs of peritonism, nonoperative reduction is the treatment of choice. Pneumatic (gas) reduction enema has been shown to be superior to hydrostatic (liquid) enema reduction.

### Opioid administration and reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^112pBBmH]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Ileocolic intussusception is the most common type of intussusception in infantsand children and is a leading cause of bowel obstruction. The mechanism involves a proximal segment of bowel invaginating into a distal segment. Nonoperative management with hydrostatic or pneumatic enema is the treatment standard. Although there is yet to be an objective quantification of children's pain and distress during reduction of intussusception, it is widely believed to be painful and distressing based on both adult and pediatric experience with colonoscopy, where the bowel is also distended with gas and sedation is routinely provided. Several national position statements have strongly emphasized the importance of adequate management of children's pain and distress during painful procedures. Unfortunately, sedation and analgesia for reduction of intussusception have traditionally been avoided by most US and European radiologists, in part due to a belief that opioid-related reduced gastrointestinal motility may reduce the rate of success for reduction of intussusception.

In the original global Pain Management and Sedation in Pediatric Ileocolic Intussusception (PAINT) study, members of our team demonstrated that neither analgesia nor sedation was associated with failed reduction or intestinal perforation. Intravenous morphine was provided to nearly 70% of patients. Intravenous fentanyl was the second most frequently administered analgesic in the PAINT study. Intranasal and intravenous fentanyl are increasingly being used in children as an alternative to intravenous morphine in acute care settings, due to their wide availability, ease of administration, tolerability, and rapidity of onset. Determining whether fentanyl is associated with failed reduction is crucial to enable clinicians to make evidence-based decisions in providing comfort to children undergoing reduction of intussusception, particularly in settings in which sedation is not feasible. With a large global sample, our primary objective was to determine whether fentanyl was associated with failed reduction of intussusception in children. Our secondary objectives were to determine whether other opioids and clinical factors were associated with failed reduction of intussusception.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^114tF6L9]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The present study has several limitations that need to be mentioned. Existing data is heterogeneous and derived from retrospective studies with inherent limitations. Although the level of evidence supporting the suggested treatment algorithm is low, it intends to serve as a general guide in day‐to‐day practice but should be adapted to the clinical scenario of every patient. There is a risk of selection bias as most of the included series were surgical or radiological cohorts, causing disparities in collected data and making comparison of these studies difficult. The majority of the patients in these studies had undergone surgery, inducing a potential selection bias with possible overestimation of malignancy rates. In that sense, this review might also be impacted by a publication bias: patients treated conservatively were less likely to be published in surgical series, whereas the opposite is true in radiological series. Furthermore, the lack of data on the success and timing of conservative treatment approaches hindered a more in‐depth analysis of different management strategies. Another potential selection bias may be related to the minimum requirement of 20 patients for study eligibility for this systematic review. The aim was to include more robust data, therefore excluding case reports and small case series that constitute most of the literature on this rare clinical entity. Moreover, the quality of data remains suboptimal, as all included studies were retrospective case series with highly heterogeneous data. Despite achieving a median score of 9/10 on the JBI critical appraisal tool for case series studies, the variability in the data impeded conducting a meta‐analysis of outcomes. However, the present study incorporates a comprehensive review of existing literature and presents succinctly the best published evidence to date. Prospective multicenter trials are required to refine management strategies, together with surgical studies providing in‐depth description of surgical management and related outcomes. In addition, the suggested pragmatic algorithm proposes standardized management to help clinicians with guidance of this rare pathology in their daily practice.

### Opioid administration and reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^1156wdNV]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Only a minority of patients received any opioid within 120 minutes of attempted reduction (13.38%). This finding may reflect a general reluctance to provide analgesia to young childrenfor painful and distressing procedures, a misconception that analgesia may mask the signs of a surgical condition, preverbal children's difficulty with expressing the need for analgesia, or clinician uncertainty with behavioral pain assessment, dosing, and adverse events. This is in sharp contrast to adults, who receive analgesia for a similar procedure (colonoscopy) that is often performed as a screening test for asymptomatic patients. In the context of our findings, there is now little rationale for withholding fentanyl for children with intussusception.

Both the American Academy of Pediatricsand Canadian Pediatric Societyhave recommended therapeutic approaches to reduce pain and distress in children undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, although none specifically discuss reduction of intussusception. Intranasal fentanyl has been shown to be equipotent to intravenous morphine for analgesia. Administration is well toleratedand can be performed by nurses, with little training required. An intranasal fentanyl protocol has even been shown to decrease time to analgesia administration in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics' recent clinical practice guideline for opioid prescribing in outpatient settings emphasized that management should involve a multimodal approach including nonpharmacologic strategies and nonopioids, with opioids administered on an as needed basis, and cited that reluctance to prescribe opioids has potentially led to undertreatment of children's pain. In settings that lack experience and resources to safely sedate children, fentanyl may be a viable option for reduction of intussusception, but it is critical that clinicians adopt multimodal approaches and develop practice parameters to optimize efficacy while minimizing the risk of adverse events. Future work should urgently focus on how to optimize routine pain assessments in young children using observational scales during clinical presentation and during reduction of intussusception, with a goal to quantify the efficacy of analgesics such as fentanyl.

### Practical imaging strategies for intussusception in children [^114R6BKK]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in young children. Radiology has a key role in its diagnosis and treatment. This systematic review summarizes the currently available evidence for best practices in radiologic management of pediatric intussusception. CONCLUSION. High diagnostic accuracy and lack of ionizing radiation make ultrasound (US) the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing intussusception. For intussusception reduction, fluoroscopy-guided pneumatic enema and US-guided hydrostatic enema are equally dependable and safe techniques. The areas that warrant further research in this field include the efficacy and safety of the US-guided pneumatic enema, potential benefits of sedation and general anesthesia for the reduction procedure, and the optimal management of intussusceptions potentially involving pathologic lead points.

### Sedation and analgesia for reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^112CmLgR]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this multinational cross-sectional study suggest that reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception can be successfully performed in most children with a very low risk of perforation. More than two-thirds of patients received neither sedation nor analgesia within 120 minutes of reduction. Our findings challenge the widespread practice of withholding analgesia and sedation and lay the foundation for future prospective studies exploring the benefits of sedation or analgesia for reduction of intussusception in children.

### Clinical manifestation and treatment of intussusception in children aged 3 months and under: a single centre analysis of 38 cases [^115Ub968]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intussusception is a pathological process in which a segment of bowel twists and retracts on itself into the adjacent intestine, resulting in an intestinal obstruction. Its the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants and young children, with a prevalence of 0.5 per 1,000 to 2 per 1,000, common in children aged 4 months to 24 months, with peak incidence at 4–9 months of age, with a very low incidence in infants under 3 months of age. The clinical presentation of intussusception in young infants is often atypical, with the disease typically being acute and rapidly progressive, frequently leading to severe complications such as intestinal necrosis, peritonitis, and even death.

Currently, the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception have been standardised, and ultrasound (US) diagnosis and non-surgical treatment with enemas have been widely accepted. However, there is still controversy as to whether conservative treatment with enemas is appropriate for small infants. The difficulty lies in the limitations of using low to medium pressure for enema reduction, which often fails to achieve complete reduction, as excessive or improper attempts may aggravate the condition and result in intestinal perforation. Intussusception in infants, especially those under 3 months of age, remains underreported in both domestic and international literature. Moreover, there is limited global consensus on the best management strategies for this age group, particularly in regions with variable healthcare infrastructure.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies for intussusception in small infants, so as to reduce the complication rate and improve the outcomes. The goal is to contribute to the global body of knowledge on this condition, highlight the challenges in its management, and offer insights into improving outcomes for affected infants.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^113siay6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This was a retrospective analysis of the epidemiological features of pediatric intussusception, the effects of different management strategies and the factors affecting successful reduction.

Methods

Using our hospital database, data on pediatric intussusception from January 2019 to December 2020 were extracted for analysis, including demographic data, size of intussusception, treatment method, and effects.

Results

The number of children diagnosed with intussusception was 726 (782 episodes). In all, 394 (54.27%) of these children were male. The male to female ratio was 1.19:1. The peak of the onset age was between 3 and 4 years. In the single intussusception group, the successful reduction rate of cleansing enemas was 65.25%, that of air enemas was 95.80%, and that of B-ultrasound–guided hydrostatic enemas (B-USGHEs) was 96.04%. In the multiple intussusceptions group, the successful reduction rate of cleansing enemas was 43.9%, air enemas were 75%, and B-USGHE was 57.6%. There were no significant differences between the air enema and B-USGHE groups. The diameter and length were related factors influencing successful reduction (P ≤ 0.05). Fifty-three (7.53%) children had recurrent intussusception within 4 years, and all of them were following successful enemas. Thirty-one (3.40%) episodes were found to have spontaneously reduced. Five patients (0.7%) underwent surgery after the failure of air enemas or B-USGHE.

Conclusions

Pediatric intussusception in our region showed a sex ratio difference and age difference of onset. For single intussusceptions and multiple intussusceptions, the successful reduction rate of cleansing enemas means that some children may avoid radiation exposure. The diameter and length of intussusception were related factors influencing successful reduction in cleansing enema. There were no significant differences in successful reduction between air enemas and B-USGHE. Most recurrent intussusceptions can still be reduced, avoiding surgery.

### Different management options for anaphylactoid purpura with intussusception: a case report [^11271nAM]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Intussusception is the most common surgical indication of anaphylactoid purpura. About 50% of cases are of the ileo-ileal type. Surgical intervention, rather than radiologic reduction, is preferable for older children suffering from anaphylactoid purpura with intussusception, where a lead point lesion is often found. The authors report a case of anaphylactoid purpura with intussusception with spontaneous reduction, and postulate that subsequent to relieving bowel-wall edema using antihistamine and steroid therapy, the ileo-ileal intussusception may spontaneously reduce.

### WSES consensus guidelines on sigmoid volvulus management [^117RwyX1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose and use of these guidelines

These guidelines are evidence-based, with the grades of recommendation based on the evidence. They do not represent the standard of practice, but are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and a consensus of experts. They do not exclude other approaches as being within a standard of practice. The treating clinician should determine the most appropriate action, after taking into account conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. The responsibility for the management and outcome rests with the engaging practitioners, and not the consensus group.

### Is sedation necessary for hydrostatic reduction in ileocolic intussusception? Evaluating procedural outcomes and parents' preferences [^112sw4yU]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

The necessity for procedural sedation during hydrostatic reduction for ileocolic intussusception in children is being debated. This study aimed to compare outcomes of procedures with and without sedation, as well as parental preferences.

Methods

This retrospective study (2019–2021) reviewed the medical records of children treated for ileocolic intussusception at two hospitals — one that did not provide sedation (non-sedation, NS) and one that did (with-sedation, WS) during hydrostatic reduction. The primary outcomes encompassed success rate, perforation, and recurrence. Parental satisfaction was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire.

Results

Data from 65 children were included: 42 in the NS group and 23 in the WS group. The hydrostatic reduction success rates were 79% (NS) and 74% (WS) (p = 0.670). One colon perforation occurred in each group (p = 0.661). Recurrence rates were 14.3% (NS) and 17.4% (WS) (p = 0.740). The questionnaire response rates were 48% (NS) and 57% (WS). Of the NS parents, 75% (15/20) were (very) satisfied with the procedure, compared with 85% (11/13) of WS parents (p = 0.196). Ten (50%) NS parents would have preferred sedation, while 46% (6/13) of WS parents would have preferred to be present during the procedure.

Conclusions

There were no significant differences in success rates, complications, or parental satisfaction between procedures performed with or without sedation during hydrostatic reduction. Effective pain management and a comforting approach are crucial for stress reduction. Shared decision-making with parents regarding the pros and cons of sedation is recommended.

### Intussusception in a child with COVID-19 in the USA [^117FGTmw]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in late 2019, has resulted in a global pandemic. COVID-19 was initially believed to occur less frequently in children with relatively mild disease. However, severe disease and varied presentations have been reported in infected children, one of such being intussusception. There have only been three reported cases of intussusception in the pediatric population infected with COVID-19. In this paper, we will discuss the management and treatment of a novel fourth case of COVID-19-associated intussusception. This case is the first reported in the USA and suggests that COVID-19 may be implicated in the development of intussusception. Pediatricians should consider the possibility of intussusception when a child with COVID-19 presents with abdominal pain.

### Sedation and analgesia for reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^1116Y7PG]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Data Collection

Data were deidentified before being entered into an electronic case report form hosted on Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)by a research assistant or coinvestigator at each site. One coinvestigator (D.M.) reviewed the data for accuracy. We collected demographics, symptoms, pain scores, analgesics and sedative medications, time to reduction, reduction parameters (pneumatic or hydrostatic reduction, insufflation pressure, personnel performing the procedure and training level, number of attempts, and success of reduction), sedation- and reduction-related adverse events, and operative management. Source documents included the medical record, anesthetic record, radiology, and operative reports. We defined analgesia as any pharmacologic nonsedative agent administered in the ED for pain management within 120 minutes prior to reduction (eg, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, opioids). We defined sedation as any pharmacologic agent with anxiolytic, sedative, dissociative, or anesthetic properties administered immediately prior to reduction (eg, ketamine, midazolam). Although some opioids (eg, morphine) have sedating properties, we elected to classify these as analgesics because we believed they were primarily used for this purpose. Time to reduction was measured from triage assessment to radiology department entry. A failed reduction was defined as all enema attempts failing to reduce intussusception as documented by the physician performing the procedure. Successful reduction was defined as such regardless of the number of enema attempts as documented by the physician performing the procedure. Adverse events were based on the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities, and recorded at any time during sedation or reduction from the physician or nursing anesthetic record.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were opioid analgesia within 120 minutes of reduction based on the therapeutic window of IV morphineand sedation immediately before reduction of intussusception. Exploratory outcomes included associations between opioid analgesia and sedation and intestinal perforation during reduction and failed reduction.

Sample Size Considerations

Based on an expected incidence of intussusception in children (56 of 100 000), the risk of perforation during reduction of 0.6%, and the risk of failed reduction of 13.1%, we believed our study period would capture 3000 to 3500 patient encounters and yield a sample size supporting a multivariable model with at most 2 factors for perforation and at most 32 factors for failed reduction in keeping with a general requirement of 10 to 12 covariates per outcome.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^111FEGRh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Pediatric intussusception in our region showed a sex ratio difference and age difference of onset. More and more intussusception in children with abdominal pain might be found by B-ultrasound examination. Not all pediatric intussusceptions must be reduced by air enema or B-USGHE. For single and multiple intussusceptions, the successful reduction rate of cleansing enemas with warm saline meant that some children may avoid radiation exposure and unnecessary suffering. The diameter and length of intussusception were related factors influencing successful reduction in the cleansing enema. There might be no statistically significant differences in the successful reduction between air enemas and B-USGHE. The length was not the factor affecting the success rate in the air enema and B-USGHE. Whether the diameter is a factor affecting intussusception reduction needs to be confirmed by a further prospective study. Most recurrent intussusceptions can still be reduced by nonoperative methods. This study was limited by the nature of retrospective studies and the single-center design.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^1148fMyw]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Influencing Factors of Intussusception Reduction

Of 782 episodes of intussusception, there were 570 episodes with a descriptive report that included the diameter, length of involved segment, and number of intussusceptions. Statistical analysis was performed on the relationship between the reduction rate and size of intussusception among the different groups (Table 2). There were 519 episodes of single intussusception that were categorized into 4 groups based on the reduction method, which included cleansing enema, air enema, B-USGHE, and spontaneous reduction groups. The mean diameter of intussusception with successful reduction was smaller than that with failed reduction in the cleansing enema group, air enema group, and B-USGHE group. There were significant differences between them in the cleansing enema group and B-USGHE group (P < 0.001), but not in air enema group (P ≤ 0.05). The mean length of intussusception with successful reduction was smaller than that with failed reduction in the cleansing enema group, air enema group, and B-USGHE group. There were significant differences between them in the cleansing enema group (P < 0.001), but not in air enema group and B-USGHE group (P ≤ 0.05). One-way ANOVA and t test showed that diameter, length, and different enema methods were related factors influencing successful reduction (P ≤ 0.05). There were no significant differences in failed reduction (P > 0.05). The mean diameter of air enemas with successful reduction was larger than that of cleansing enemas, B-USGHE, and spontaneous reduction, and there were significant differences between them (P ≤ 0.05). There was no significant difference in diameter between spontaneous reduction, B-USGHE, and cleansing enemas (P > 0.05). The mean length in air enemas with successful reduction was larger than that in cleansing enemas, B-USGHE, and spontaneous reduction, and there was a significant difference between them (P ≤ 0.05). There was no significant difference between cleansing enemas, B-USGHE, and spontaneous reduction (P > 0.05).

### Recurrence rates after intussusception enema reduction: a meta-analysis [^111jyBVC]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Reported rates of recurrence after enema reduction for intussusception are variable. Concerns for recurrence influence postreduction management. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate overall, 24-hour, and 48-hour recurrence rates after enema reduction in children.

Methods

PubMed, Cochrane Database, and OVID Medline were searched from 1946 through December 2011 using the search terms: intussusception, recurrence, and enema. Sixty-nine studies of patients age 0 to 18 years with radiographically proven intussusception reduced by enema that report the number of enema reductions and the number of recurrences were included. Extraction was done by the primary author (M.P.G.) with 10% of included studies independently audited to ensure concordance.

Results

Overall recurrence rates were 12.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.1%-14.4%, I2 = 28.8%) for contrast enema (CE), 7.5% (95% CI: 5.7%-9.8%, I2 = 52.4%) for ultrasound-guided noncontrast enema (UGNCE), and 8.5% (95% CI: 6.9%-10.4%, I2 = 50.1%) for fluoroscopy-guided air enema (FGAE). Recurrence rates within 24 hours were 3.9% (95% CI: 2.2%-6.7%, I2 = 47.0%) for CE, 3.9% (95% CI: 1.5%-10.1%, I2 = 0.0%) for UGNCE, and 2.2% (95% CI: 0.7%-6.5%, I2 = 59.8%) for FGAE. Recurrence rates within 48 hours were 5.4% (95% CI 3.7%-7.8%, I2 = 32.3%) for CE, 6.6% (95% CI: 4.0%-10.7%, I2 = 0.0%) for UGNCE, and 2.7% (95% CI: 1.2%-6.5%, I2 = 73.8%) for FGAE. Most included studies are retrospective and vary in quality of reporting. Few studies reported detailed patient characteristics including timing of recurrences.

Conclusions

The risk of early (within 48 hours) recurrence after enema reduction is low, suggesting outpatient management of well-appearing patients should be considered.

### Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of children with acute intussusception: a case series [^114ciNzb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The clinical features of intussusception may include any one or more among sudden, intermittent abdominal pain (every 10–15 min), palpable abdominal mass, usually in the right upper quadrant, bilious vomiting, the rectal passage of mucus or blood ("currant jelly" stools), and altered mental status including irritability, crying, lethargy, apathy and/or profound listlessness. The presence of normal bowel sounds does not exclude intussusception. Less common clinical features include painless intussusception, hypovolemic shock, visible peristalsis, diarrhea or constipation, tenesmus, fever, obstruction, sepsis, syncope, and transient hypertension.

Intussusception should be treated without delay due to the risk of bowel ischemia and perforation. Intravenous hydration should be given, and surgical consultation should be performed before any attempt. Image-guided pneumatic enema is the preferred first treatment in most cases of intussusception. Hydrostatic enema can also be used for both diagnosis and treatment. Delayed repeat enema can be indicated in cases where the patient remains clinically stable, and the initial enema partially reduces the intussusception, or the intussusception is recurrent. Surgical intervention is indicated in certain cases of intussusception, including peritonitis, free air, shock, sepsis, perforation, repeat enema failure, and persistent symptomatic small-bowel obstruction. Small bowel intussusceptions are not common in children and are often associated with a spontaneous reduction. The risk of mortality following successful treatment of intussusception is low. Recurrent intussusception occurs in up to 10% of cases following enema reduction and 1% of cases following surgical reduction. Repeat enemas are reported to be safe and effective for treating recurrent intussusception if the child remains clinically stable. A recurrence is seen within 48 h in 2.5% of the patients after initial successful air enema reduction.

### Is sedation necessary for hydrostatic reduction in ileocolic intussusception? Evaluating procedural outcomes and parents' preferences [^115E1nsU]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have failed t0 address patient and parental experiences, an aspect we believe is crucial in the management of intussusception. In our clinical practice, we observe that concerns about comfort are particularly pronounced among parents of older children. Therefore, factors such as the child's age should be considered when deciding whether to use sedation.

Before implementing sedation for reduction of intussusception, several challenges must be addressed. These include ensuring the availability (24/7) of a trained sedation or anesthesia team with appropriate expertise. Procedural sedation does carry risks, such as airway complications including aspiration, although these are rare and manageable with airway positioning and oxygen administration. The primary goal of procedural sedation is to enhance patient comfort and procedural success, while preserving basic reflexes such as spontaneous breathing and swallowing, which distinguishes it from general anesthesia.

Therefore, a standardized best-practice protocol should be developed in collaboration with pediatric radiologists, anesthetists, pediatricians, and pediatric intensive care clinicians. This is particularly important given that most patients are under 2 years of age and require age-specific expertise. In addition to addressing the child's needs, it is crucial to account for parental preferences when offering sedation. Our study revealed that while many parents preferred sedation, some also wished to be present during the procedure — both of which are key considerations when developing such a protocol.

In our experience, aspects such as adequate pain management before the procedure, parental presence during the procedure, careful step-by-step explanation of the procedure, and emphasizing the high likelihood of preventing surgery procedure if the hydrostatic procedure is successful are vital in comforting parents. If these conditions are fully met and parents still prefer sedation, counseling should include the following: sedation may be considered for older children or in cases of recurrence, while younger children can undergo the procedure without sedation, provided that adequate pain management and parental presence are ensured. We advocate for a shared decision-making approach, in which available options and clinical conditions are thoroughly discussed with the parents to ensure the procedure is performed in the best interest of the child, with adequate pain management and supportive care. Accordingly, we are updating our current protocol to include sedation when necessary and will prospectively evaluate its implementation, including parental satisfaction and overall experience.

### Management for intussusception in children [^114xBPPT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intussusception is a common abdominal emergency in children with significant morbidity. Prompt diagnosis and management reduces associated risks and the need for surgical intervention. Despite widespread agreement on the use of contrast enema as opposed to surgery for initial management in most cases, debate persists on the appropriate contrast medium, imaging modality, pharmacological adjuvant, and protocol for delayed repeat enema, and on the best approach for surgical management for intussusception in children.

Objectives

To assess the safety and effectiveness of non-surgical and surgical approaches in the management of intussusception in children.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8) in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to September 2016); Ovid Embase (1974 to September 2016); Science Citation Index Expanded (via Web of Science) (1900 to September 2016); and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to September 2016). We examined the reference lists of all eligible trials to identify additional studies. To locate unpublished studies, we contacted content experts, searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (September 2016), and explored proceedings from meetings of the British Association of Paedatric Surgeons (BAPS), the American Soceity of Pediatric Surgery, and the World Congress of Pediatric Surgery.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials comparing contrast media, imaging modalities, pharmacological adjuvants, protocols for delayed repeat enema, and/or surgical approaches for the management of intussusception in children. We applied no language, publication date, or publication status restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently conducted study selection and data extraction and assessed risk of bias using a standardised form. We resolved disagreements by consensus with a third review author when necessary. We reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis and evaluated the overall quality of evidence supporting the outcomes by using GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 822 participants. Two trials compared liquid enema reduction plus glucagon versus liquid enema alone. One trial compared liquid enema plus dexamethasone versus liquid enema alone. Another trial compared air enema plus dexamethasone versus air enema alone, and two trials compared use of liquid enema versus air enema. We identified three ongoing trials. We judged all included trials to be at risk of bias owing to omissions in reported methods. We judged five of six trials as having high risk of bias in at least one domain. Therefore, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for outcomes was low. Interventions and data presentation varied greatly across trials; therefore meta-analysis was not possible for most review outcomes. Enema plus glucagon versus enema alone It is uncertain whether use of glucagon improves the rate of successful reduction of intussusception when compared with enema alone (reported in two trials, 218 participants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.26; low quality of evidence). No trials in this comparison reported on the number of children with bowel perforation(s) nor on the number of children with recurrent intussusception. Enema plus dexamethasone versus enema alone Use of the adjunct, dexamethasone, may be beneficial in reducing intussusception recurrence with liquid or air enema (two trials, 299 participants; RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.60; low quality of evidence). This equates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 13 (95% CI 8 to 37). It is uncertain whether use of the adjunct, dexamethasone, improves the rate of successful reduction of intussusception when compared with enema alone (reported in two trials, 356 participants; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.10; low quality of evidence). Air enema versus liquid enema Air enema may be more successful than liquid enema for reducing intussusception (two trials, 199 participants; RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.49; low quality of evidence). This equates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 6 (95% CI 4 to 19). No trials in this comparison reported on the number of children with bowel perforation(s) or on the number of children with recurrent intussusception nor any intraoperative complications, such as bowel perforation, or other adverse effects. Only one trial reported postoperative complications, but owing to the method of reporting used, a quantitative analysis was not possible. We identified no studies that exclusively evaluated surgical interventions for management of intussusception.

Authors' Conclusions

This review identified a small number of trials that assessed a variety of interventions. All included trials provided evidence of low quality and were subject to serious concerns about imprecision, high risk of bias, or both. Air enema may be superior to liquid enema for successfully reducing intussusception in children; however, this finding is based on a few studies including small numbers of participants. Dexamethasone as an adjuvant may be more effective in reducing intussusception recurrence rates following air enema or liquid enema, but these results are also based on a few studies of small numbers of participants. This review highlights several points that need to be addressed in future studies, including reducing the risk of bias and including relevant outcomes. Specifically, surgical trials are lacking, and future research is needed to address this evidence gap.

### Sedation and analgesia for reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^1168MqXo]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Ileocolic intussusception refers to the invagination of the ileum through the ileocecal valve into the cecum. With a yearly incidence of approximately 56 of 100 000, ileocolic intussusception is an important cause of acute intestinal obstruction in children younger than 6 years. If untreated, intussusception can result in tissue ischemia, potentially leading to bowel necrosis, perforation, and shock. In countries with higher resources, case fatality is less than 1%, while it may be as high as 9% in nations with fewer resources. Transabdominal ultrasonography is the diagnostic modality of choice due to its high sensitivity (98%), safety, and availability. Emergent reduction of ileocolic intussusception using air or hydrostatic enema is the standard of care to prevent complications. Reduction involves inserting a French Foley catheter into the rectum and instilling water or air under pressure into the colon. No studies have objectively quantified pain during reduction, but it is believed to be painful based on analogies with colonoscopy, where the bowel is also distended with gas and children usually require sedation. In contrast, reduction of ileocolic intussusception is usually performed on awake children without sedation or analgesia. In the United States, only 7% of children with ileocolic intussusception receive sedation during reduction. The risk of bowel perforation during reduction is less than 1%.

Although some studies report that sedation improves the success of intussusception reduction, most American and European radiologists do not support this practice. This may be due to requirements for specialized equipment, personnel skilled in airway maneuvers, or the belief that sedation may increase the risk of perforation during reduction. The management and complications of reduction of intussusception vary considerably by country, highlighting the importance of a global perspective of practice patterns to evaluate the risks of perforation during reduction and failed reduction related to sedation and analgesia. Our objective was to characterize practice patterns surrounding opioid analgesia and sedation for the reduction of ileocolic intussusception in children and to assess their association with intestinal perforation and failed reduction in an exploratory analysis.

### Diagnosis and treatment intussusception-a surgical condition… [^115Q2UkA]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

THE gradual increase in the employment of hydrostatic pressure reduction of intussusception with the use of the barium enema has resulted in a gratifying decrease in the number of laparotomies performed. It can also be expected, on the basis of past experience, to result in a decrease of the number of resections required, since some resections have been done on bowel mistakenly thought to be non-viable, and in other instances resection has been required for bowel traumatized by the manual reduction itself. The other advantages of hydrostatic pressure reduction are familiar. If the possibility of intussusception is merely entertained, the diagnosis can be made with certainty and the treatment instituted at the same time by barium enema.

When immediate operation is the standard treatment for intussusception there may be an understandable tendency to delay operation until the clinical diagnosis has been made unequivocally. Specific lesions causing intussusception, such as polyps, Meckel's diverticula, etc., are not in themselves significant and occur in only 5 or 6% of cases of intussusception. Intussusceptions of long duration may still be totally reducible and, in any case, in practically all of them the intussusceptum is reduced around to the cecum so that if operation is required a right lower quadrant exposure is sufficient and one is spared the necessity of manipulating the bowel around from the left colon to the right colon. Finally, it has been shown in a number of series that, in children who have operative reductions of intussusception, there is a significant incidence of late mechanical intestinal obstruction due to adhesions resulting from the intra-abdominal manipulation.

### Adult intussusception: a retrospective review [^113WKcQo]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We reviewed the diagnosis and treatment of 44 adult intussusception patients. Historically, investigators have suggested that it is difficult to diagnose intussusception in adults because it is a subacute disease with nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms. However, current technology allows an easy diagnosis via US, CT, or endoscopy. In addition, the preoperative and intraoperative reduction of intussusception will likely become a standard approach because it offers greater benefits than traditional methods.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic constipation [^112mcb5f]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Rectal intussusception — operative management may be considered after failed nonoperative treatments. Repair of rectal intussusception may be considered in patients with severe obstructed defecation in whom nonoperative treatments were unsuccessful. Strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence. Outcomes include a Delorme series of 100 patients with improved Cleveland Clinic Constipation and ODS scores at 6 months compared to baseline (18.9 to 5 and 18.5 to 5, respectively; p < 0.0001) and a recurrence rate of 6%; early studies of ventral rectopexy report improvement in constipation in 80% to 95% of patients with a 5% recurrence rate; and a retrospective series of 40 patients undergoing ventral mesh rectopexy without sigmoid resection showed 65% cured and another 33% improved with a mean follow-up of 38 months.

### Sedation and analgesia for reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^117NNYep]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Only 9.6% and 14.9% of patients received analgesia at triage and within 120 minutes of reduction, respectively. Although abdominal pain is a frequent presenting feature of intussusception in children, the most likely explanation for not providing analgesia at triage was low pain scores. Fortunately, pain assessment was most often performed using the FLACC scale, an appropriate behavioral instrument validated in children younger than 5 years. However, less than 60% of patients had a documented pain assessment. Along with being mandated by The Joint Commission, the importance of consistent pain assessment using age-appropriate instruments cannot be overemphasized as these have been associated with a greater likelihood of receiving analgesia in the ED.

Several features of intussusception predispose to suboptimal pain management. First, intussusception primarily affects children younger than 5, and there is evidence that young children are less likely to receive analgesia than their adolescent counterparts. The reasons are multifactorial and include clinician uncertainty with medication dosing, concerns surrounding adverse effects, and the inability of young children to verbalize their needs. Second, children with abdominal pain (as opposed to musculoskeletal pain) are less likely to receive analgesia in the ED. This may be grounded in a historical misconception that analgesia may mask the signs of a surgical indication. Third, reduction often occurs in a radiology suite, where health care clinicians skilled in the assessment and management of pain and sedation are not always readily available. Fourth, the infrequency of sedation and analgesia for children with intussusception may also reflect the paucity of literature to inform clinical guidelines and medical directives. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended using physical, psychological, and pharmacological strategies to reduce pain and distress for children undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, there is no specific mention of the reduction of intussusception. Moreover, intussusception-specific guidelines from the United Kingdom do not mention analgesia. There have also been no published evaluations of the severity of pain and distress during intussusception. Interestingly, our lower rate of analgesia contrasted with the Yeoh et alsample where 61 of 73 children (83.5%) were administered analgesia prior to reduction. Australian practice patterns may reflect the development of hospital guidelines recommending analgesia as part of general management.

### Clinical outcomes following bowel resection versus reduction of intussusception [^116fnzrx]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intussusception is most commonly managed with air-contrast reduction. However, when this fails, emergent operation with resection or manual reduction is indicated. It is not known if there are advantages to resection compared with manual reduction.

Methods

A retrospective review of all patients receiving operative care for intussusception from February 2000 to December 2011. Patients undergoing intestinal resection were compared with those treated with manual reduction alone.

Results

Of 111 patients, 49 underwent resection and 62 underwent manual reduction. Mean (± SD) time to oral intake favored manual reduction (2.1 ± 1.2 versus 2.6 ± 1.2 d, respectively, P = 0.05). Manual reduction was associated with a greater need for repeat imaging (47% versus 18%, P = 0.002) and the only recurrences were with manual reduction (8% versus 0%, P = 0.1). Mean duration of stay was no different (P = 0.36), nor was the need for reoperation (P = 0.9).

Conclusions

Patients undergoing manual reduction have an increased number of radiographic imaging procedures. The surgeon should have a low threshold for resection for intussusceptions requiring operative management.

### Implementing ultrasound-guided hydrostatic reduction of intussusception in a low-resource country in sub-saharan Africa: our initial experience in Ethiopia [^111Pmk35]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Despite advances in non-invasive radiological techniques for the treatment of intussusception, management of the entity still remains exclusively surgical in many developing countries, including Ethiopia. Fluoroscopic units are rare or mostly dysfunctional. Ultrasound scanners are more commonly available. Ultrasound-guided hydrostatic reduction (USGHR) was recently introduced to the main referral hospital in Ethiopia, and subsequently has been adopted as the initial management option for intussusception.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience with USGHR in Ethiopia and measure the impact on patient care.

Methods

A prospective study was conducted between July 2014 and August 2015 on all pediatric patients, with US-confirmed intussusception, at the Tikur Anbessa Specialized Teaching Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. All patients, excluding those with signs of peritonitis, bowel ischemia, or symptoms lasting longer than 4 days, were selected to undergo USGHR.

Results

A total of 53 children were diagnosed with intussusception, confirmed via ultrasound. Following exclusion criteria, USGHR was attempted in 47 of the patients. Forty-one of the 47 patients (87.2%) had successful reduction, resulting in a 77% overall rate of successful non-operative management in all patients with intussusception.

Conclusion

The rate of operative reduction of intussusception decreased by 77% following the introduction of USGHR as the initial non-surgical intervention. Therefore, we believe USGHR should be fully implemented in our hospital, and recommend that this study serves as an example to other institutions in our country as well as in other developing countries facing similar challenges.

### The role of glucocorticoids in recurrent idiopathic intussusception: a retrospective cohort study [^1118uUPk]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Our center is a tertiary pediatric specialty hospital that performs over 1,000 air enemas annually for the management of intussusception, with a reduction success rate as high as 97.8%. Thus, the sample size of recurrent intussusception cases is considerable. However, to the best of our knowledge, studies investigating the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the prevention of intussusception recurrence are scarce, and high-quality evidence supporting a unified protocol remains lacking. Notably, clinical practice varies among on-duty surgeons at our center, especially concerning the type of glucocorticoid administered. However, it is worthwhile acknowledging that the treatment durations and dosages were similar. Therefore, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to explore the role of glucocorticoids in children with recurrent idiopathic intussusception, laying the foundation for randomized controlled studies investigating the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the management of intussusception.

### Small bowel intussusception-aetiology&management [^117Se4QS]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Adult small bowel intussusception (SBI) differs in incidence, symptomatology and management from the more commonly encountered paediatric intussusception. This review spans across the multitude of causes of adult SBI, and summarises the diagnostic work-up and management options according to recent literature.

Recent Findings

There has been an increase in use of small bowel capsule endoscopy and point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute adult SBI.

Summary

A high degree of suspicion of a malignant cause of SBI is required in the adult population. Alarm clinical features include weight loss, history of malignancy, and iron deficiency anaemia. CT remains the gold standard imaging technique as it may identify the lead point and thus aid in endoscopic or surgical management. If malignancy is excluded and no lead point is identified, serology and histology may be helpful to look for inflammatory, infective and autoimmune aetiology.
