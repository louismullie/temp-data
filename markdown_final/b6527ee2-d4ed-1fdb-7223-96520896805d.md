## Question

A 28-year-old woman presents 10 days postpartum with abrupt onset of hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior requiring inpatient care. No prior psychiatric history is documented. What ICD-10 code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10 code should be used for billing a 28-year-old woman who, 10 days postpartum, presents with abrupt-onset hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior requiring inpatient care, with no prior psychiatric history. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it meets criteria for postpartum psychosis. Then, I should verify how ICD-10 handles postpartum psychosis and whether there is a specific code. Next, I will check the timing rules and whether this case fits the postpartum window. After that, I need to consider the differential diagnosis and rule-outs that could alter coding. Finally, I will confirm the most appropriate ICD-10 code and ensure the documentation supports it for billing purposes.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. The abrupt onset of hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior within days after childbirth, with severe functional impairment requiring inpatient care, is classic for postpartum psychosis, which ACOG describes as a psychiatric emergency with typical onset 3–10 days postpartum and a broader postpartum window that can extend beyond 4 weeks in some contexts, though DSM-5 focuses on onset within 4 weeks for specifier use [^cadc332c] [^72d2a8b2] [^2fa504f2].

> Wait, let me verify the ICD-10 coding landscape before jumping ahead. Postpartum psychosis is not a standalone ICD-10 diagnosis; it is captured under F53.1, which is explicitly labeled "Puerperal psychosis", and this aligns with coding guidance that created F53.1 for puerperal psychosis and F53.0 for postpartum depression, reflecting the ICD-10 approach to postpartum-onset mental disorders [^f327f603].

> I need to check the timing rules to ensure this case qualifies. ICD-10's F53 category applies to mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium, and while some sources note a 6-week postpartum window for F53, clinical practice and obstetric guidance commonly recognize that postpartum psychosis can present within the first month and sometimes beyond, and here the onset at 10 days clearly falls within accepted postpartum-onset periods for coding and clinical management purposes [^e1517251] [^cadc332c] [^72d2a8b2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without considering the differential. Initially, I wondered if this could be a brief psychotic disorder or an acute and transient psychotic disorder, but wait, those would be less precise here because the trigger is childbirth and the presentation is best captured by the puerperal psychosis code; I should also remember to rule out organic causes and substance-induced psychosis, which would change coding to F06.x or F1x.5 respectively, but in the absence of such findings, F53.1 remains appropriate [^f327f603] [^5c32653a] [^8aa613bc].

> Let me consider the nosology one more time to avoid misclassification. Although DSM-5 does not list postpartum psychosis as a separate entity and instead uses a peripartum-onset specifier for mood or psychotic disorders, ICD-10 does provide a specific code for puerperal psychosis under F53.1, which is the correct billing code when psychotic symptoms arise in the postpartum period without a more specific primary psychiatric diagnosis established at the time of coding [^2fa504f2] [^f327f603].

> I should confirm the final code and ensure the documentation supports it. The most appropriate ICD-10-CM code is F53.1 for puerperal psychosis, with supporting documentation of abrupt-onset hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior 10 days postpartum requiring inpatient care, and with notation that medical and substance etiologies have been considered and excluded to justify F53.1 rather than an organic or substance-induced psychosis code [^f327f603] [^5c32653a].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a 28-year-old woman with abrupt-onset hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior 10 days postpartum, requiring inpatient care, is **F53.1** (Puerperal psychosis). This diagnosis applies to psychotic symptoms arising in the postpartum period and is the standard billing code for postpartum psychosis. If a more specific psychiatric diagnosis is established (e.g. bipolar disorder with psychotic features), use that diagnosis first and add F53.1 as a secondary code to indicate the postpartum onset [^f327f603].

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic criteria

Postpartum psychosis is characterized by the following:

- **Rapid onset**: Typically within the first 1–4 weeks postpartum, often within days [^cadc332c].
- **Severe symptoms**: Hallucinations, delusions, disorganized behavior, and mood disturbances [^cadc332c].
- **Impaired insight**: Patients often lack awareness of their condition, increasing risk [^cadc332c].
- **High risk**: Significant risk of suicide and infanticide, necessitating urgent intervention [^1ac6e1a2].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding for postpartum psychosis

The ICD-10-CM code for postpartum psychosis is **F53.1** (Puerperal psychosis). This code specifically denotes psychotic symptoms occurring in the postpartum period and is the appropriate billing code for this clinical scenario [^f327f603].

---

## Alternative diagnostic considerations

While F53.1 is the primary code, clinicians should consider alternative diagnoses and document them accordingly:

- **Bipolar disorder with psychotic features**: If a manic or depressive episode with psychotic features is diagnosed, use F31.x (bipolar affective disorder) as the primary diagnosis and F53.1 as a secondary code to indicate postpartum onset [^notfound].
- **Brief psychotic disorder**: If symptoms persist less than one month, consider F23 (brief psychotic disorder) [^c48a1d2a].
- **Substance-induced psychosis**: If substance use is suspected, use F1x.5 (substance-induced psychotic disorder) [^notfound].

---

## Documentation requirements

Accurate documentation is essential for appropriate coding and billing. The following elements should be included in the medical record:

- **Clinical presentation**: Detailed description of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior [^cadc332c].
- **Timing**: Clear documentation of the onset of symptoms relative to childbirth [^cadc332c].
- **Severity and functional impairment**: Documentation of the need for inpatient care and level of impairment [^ab0be013].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: Documentation of efforts to rule out substance use, medical conditions, or other psychiatric disorders [^5c32653a].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency requiring immediate intervention. Management typically includes:

- **Hospitalization**: Inpatient care is generally indicated for safety and stabilization [^ab0be013].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Antipsychotics, mood stabilizers (e.g. lithium), and benzodiazepines are commonly used [^d4ece0df].
- **Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)**: Considered in severe cases or when rapid stabilization is needed [^d2f94818].
- **Monitoring**: Close observation for suicide and infanticide risk is essential [^fe4b48cc].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence risk

With appropriate treatment, the prognosis for postpartum psychosis is generally favorable, with most patients achieving full remission within weeks to months. However, recurrence risk is high, particularly in subsequent postpartum periods, necessitating preventive planning and close follow-up [^4017c1a4] [^11b42f3a].

---

The appropriate ICD-10-CM code for a 28-year-old woman presenting with abrupt-onset hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior 10 days postpartum, requiring inpatient care, is **F53.1** (Puerperal psychosis). Accurate documentation and consideration of alternative diagnoses are essential for appropriate coding and optimal patient care.

Postpartum psychosis — incidence, timing, risk identification, and acute management are specified. Postpartum psychosis is rare, occurring in 1–2 per 1,000 pregnancies, and the DSM-5 specifies onset "within the first 4 weeks post-birth", with typical onset 3–10 days after birth and potential occurrence after 4 weeks postpartum. Most women admitted with postpartum psychosis do not have a known psychiatric history; if present it is most likely bipolar disorder, so early detection and ascertainment of a history of bipolar disorder specifically can help to identify individuals at risk. Individuals with bipolar I disorder and a history of postpartum psychosis have the highest recurrence risk, warrant specialty psychiatric care during pregnancy and postpartum, and should be seen by a psychiatrist; a prebirth planning meeting including supports and clinicians should be used to coordinate postpartum psychosis–prevention planning. For acute care, treatment while awaiting psychiatric evaluation and treatment is warranted, pharmacotherapy typically includes treatment with an antipsychotic and sometimes a benzodiazepine (such as lorazepam), and psychiatric hospitalization is generally indicated; continuous observation can be used until this transfer can occur.

Introduction

Postpartum psychosis (PPP) is a severe mental disorder with a dramatic and rapid onset of affective and psychotic symptoms in the immediate postpartum period. PPP is a psychiatric emergency that generally warrants acute inpatient care. Due to its severe and fluctuating nature, there is a significant risk to the mother and infant if left untreated, with potential for the tragic consequences of suicide or infanticide. With maternal suicide being the leading cause of direct maternal death occurring within the first postpartum year, early detection and management of postpartum mental illness is key to improving outcomes for the mother and her infant. Evidence indicates that PPP is a disorder on the bipolar spectrum in women with a vulnerability to the childbirth trigger. Although PPP is a discrete disorder on the affective disorder spectrum with a distinctive treatment profile, it is yet to be recognised as a separate nosological entity in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. The primary aim of this review is to provide an evidence-based algorithm for the treatment of PPP, taking into account the unique management challenges during this vulnerable period for the mother–infant dyad.

Bipolar II disorder — DSM-5-TR diagnostic criteria require at least one hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode, with no history of a manic episode; the episodes are not better explained by schizoaffective disorder or superimposed on schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, and the symptoms of depression or the unpredictability from frequent alternation between depression and hypomania cause clinically significant distress or impairment.

Discussion

PP is relatively a rare disorder that most commonly presents within the first 2–4 weeks after delivery, but can emerge as early as 2–3 days after childbirth. Rapid mood fluctuation is considered the hallmark; however, the rapid onset of paranoia, grandiosity, bizarre delusions, confused thinking and grossly disorganised behaviour may also be present. Insomnia, anxiety or depressed mood have been reported as early warning symptoms prior to PP.PP is a unique disease in that its trigger is definable: childbirth. Exact pathophysiology of the disease; however, has yet to be determined, with several theories ranging from hormonal change to immune dysregulation and circadian rhythm disruption. In this particular case, the patient's history of hypothyroidism and levothyroxine use during pregnancy gives credence to an autoimmune aetiology to her PP, with literature demonstrating a strong association between PP and autoimmune thyroiditis/thyroid dysfunction. Understanding of risk factors would facilitate timely and appropriate response from health professionals via heightened awareness and proper preventive measures such as lithium prophylaxis. These risk factors related to PP; however, are still poorly understood and rarely studied.

PP is a clinical diagnosis. The DSM-5 does not recognise PP as a distinct condition; rather, it adds a "with a postpartum onset" specifier if a woman met criteria for a brief psychotic disorder during or within 4 weeks post partum. Due to its similar presentation, bipolar disorder is an important differential diagnosis that must be considered, especially with prior history. Other psychiatric conditions that must be included, but are not limited to, are generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and postpartum depression, as well as organic causes of psychosis such as infection, recreational drugs and electrolyte disturbances to name a few. Notwithstanding the classification in DSM-5, PP is a psychiatric emergency that requires urgent evaluation, psychiatric referral and inpatient hospitalisation due to the gravity of consequences, such as suicide, infanticide, impaired mother–infant bonding, infant abuse and neglect. While the overall prognosis is positive for women who have sought help, screening protocols or treatment guidelines have yet to be established. Atypical antipsychotics, mood stabilisers and antiepileptics are common drugs of choice along with electroconvulsive therapy; however, there is a paucity of evidence to support their efficacy due to the difficulty of randomised trials.

Hypomanic episode — diagnosis requires a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood with increased activity or energy lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day; during this period three (or more) symptoms must persist (four if the mood is only irritable) and represent a noticeable change; the episode must be associated with an unequivocal change in functioning, be observable by others, not be severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupation functioning or to necessitate hospitalization, and if there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic; the episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition; a full hypomanic episode that emerges during the antidepressant treatment but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis, with caution that one or two symptoms are not sufficient.

Clinical presentation

PPP has a prevalence of 1–2 per 1000 births. A recent systematic review found the global prevalence of PPP to be 0.89–2.6 per 1000 births, although the data largely represented women from high-income countries. Another systematic review examined data from low- and middle-income countries and reported PPP prevalence rates of 1.1–3.2 per 1000 births, indicating a similar prevalence globally.

The onset of PPP is usually rapid (within hours), with most episodes beginning between days 3 and 10 postpartum. Early warning symptoms can include insomnia, anxiety, irritability or mood fluctuation, with elated or depressed mood, confusion, perplexity and disorganised behaviour emerging later. Persecutory delusions and delusions of reference are common. Visual hallucinations, disorientation and delirium-like symptoms are reported to occur more frequently in PPP than in non-postpartum psychotic disorders. Delusions and hallucinations can involve the infant and may sometimes be concealed due to a lack of insight or the presence of stigma.

Catatonia is common in PPP with prevalence rates ranging from 5% in a Dutch study of 130 women with PPP to 20% in an Indian study of 200 women with PPP. Mutism, withdrawal and negativism are the most prevalent features of catatonia in PPP. A longer duration of untreated catatonia in PPP has been associated with poor response to lorazepam in one study, highlighting the importance of early detection and treatment during this period.

Mental state can fluctuate in PPP, and insight is generally poor. High vigilance, robust social support and close monitoring are paramount in this period, particularly in women with risk factors for developing PPP. Given the rapidly changing mental state and risk to the mother and the infant, admission is indicated, ideally to a mother and baby unit (MBU) where available.

Box 2. Emergent psychiatric evaluation — criteria and immediate management: Emergent psychiatric evaluation is warranted for those with suicidal ideation with an intent and plan and for those who are unable to state reasons why they would not proceed with a suicide attempt. In patients for whom emergent consultation is warranted, pharmacotherapy and emergent care should be obtained as soon as possible and maintained until further psychiatric assessment is completed.

ACOG perinatal mental health — definition and scope: Perinatal mental health conditions are defined as conditions occurring in pregnancy or in the first 12 months after delivery, and the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) uses a peripartum-onset modifier rather than separate diagnoses; the American Psychiatric Association considers postpartum time within 4 weeks, whereas experts including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extend it to 12 months, inclusive of the "fourth trimester" and the full year assessed for maternal mortality. This guideline focuses on depression and anxiety for obstetric care clinicians and also includes recognition and initial management of bipolar disorder, postpartum psychosis, and suicidality, emphasizing additional support such as consultation and follow-up with mental health professionals.

PPP is rare at only 1 to 2 per 1000 women after childbirth, occurring in the first 4 weeks after childbirth with serious impairment that may include paranoia, mood shifts, hallucinations and/or delusions, and suicidal and/or homicidal thoughts, and PPP requires immediate medical attention.

Perinatal mental health — asking about unwanted or intrusive thoughts outlines that unwanted or intrusive thoughts, including those of harming the baby, are common (up to 70%) among postpartum women and that most women will not act on them because they are usually due to anxiety, depression, and obsessive/compulsive disorder rather than psychosis/delusions; clinicians can ask, "Have you had any unwanted thoughts?" and "Have you had any thoughts of harming your infant, either as an accident or on purpose?", and if the patient answers yes, follow up with, "How often do you have them?", "How recently have you had them?", "How much do they scare you?", and "How much do they worry you?".

Postpartum psychosis — initial pharmacotherapy and early supports: Initiation of short-term benzodiazepines or an antipsychotic medication is the first-line treatment for postpartum psychosis and can be administered by an obstetric care clinician while awaiting psychiatric consultation. Foregoing breastfeeding overnight as part of sleep preservation and support can also be helpful in the early phase of treatment and stabilization. If treated quickly and appropriately, full remission is usually achieved by 2 months postpartum.

Postpartum psychosis — mimics and recommended evaluation components: Other conditions that can mimic postpartum psychosis symptoms include delirium and intoxication with alcohol, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and cannabis, so an assessment for substance use should be included with the evaluation to rule out drug-induced psychosis. Once patient and infant safety are attended to initially, an extensive interview of the partner or family members present is also included as part of the psychiatric evaluation, diagnosis, and risk assessment of this condition. Psychiatric inpatient evaluation may also include a physical examination, head imaging, complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and ammonia level as part of the examination; some also consider lumbar puncture and electroencephalogram.

Symptoms and onset vary among women. Postpartum depression may start a few days after delivery or it may emerge 2–3 months later and is oftentimes indistinguishable from depression that is not associated with pregnancy and childbirth. There is no single cause for the extreme sadness, anxiety, fatigue, feelings of guilt, worthlessness, incompetence, and suicidal thoughts.

### Postpartum psychosis [^6618bc94]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that can affect the health and life of mothers, infants, and families. Postpartum psychosis (PPP) is distinct from non-postpartum psychosis in many ways, and it is crucial to study and understand PPP to identify, treat, and possibly prevent this condition. We therefore sought to review the latest research findings about PPP with the intention of updating readers about the latest evidence base.

Recent Findings

Multiple physiologic pathways have been implicated in the development of PPP, and further understanding these pathways may allow for early detection and treatment. Risk assessment and treatment should include consideration of the woman patient but also the mother-infant dyad and the larger family. It is our hope that this review of research updates in postpartum psychosis may inform clinical practice and promote specialized, evidence-based diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment.

Postpartum mood disorders — blues and psychosis — "Postpartum blues" is a transient state of increased emotional reactivity occurring in approximately 50% to 80% of mothers after labor and delivery; peak onset is 3 to 5 days after delivery and duration is days to weeks, psychiatric history, environmental stress, cultural context, and breastfeeding do not seem to be related, and mothers do not meet DSM-5 criteria for a mood disorder so treatment is generally supportive. "Postpartum psychosis" is a rare event with an estimated incidence of 2 in every 1000 deliveries; onset is often within the first 1 to 4 weeks of delivery, and in DSM-5 the "with peripartum onset" specifier is added if onset is within 4 weeks of delivery, with risk factors including personal and family history of bipolar depression and schizoaffective disorder.

### A review of postpartum psychosis [^a0d9f43a]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective is to provide an overview of the clinical features, prognosis, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of postpartum psychosis.

Methods

The authors searched Medline (1966–2005), PsycInfo (1974–2005), Toxnet, and PubMed databases using the key words postpartum psychosis, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, organic psychosis, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. A clinical case is used to facilitate the discussion.

Results

The onset of puerperal psychosis occurs in the first 1–4 weeks after childbirth. The data suggest that postpartum psychosis is an overt presentation of bipolar disorder that is timed to coincide with tremendous hormonal shifts after delivery. The patient develops frank psychosis, cognitive impairment, and grossly disorganized behavior that represent a complete change from previous functioning. These perturbations, in combination with lapsed insight into her illness and symptoms, can lead to devastating consequences in which the safety and well-being of the affected mother and her offspring are jeopardized. Therefore, careful and repeated assessment of the mothers' symptoms, safety, and functional capacity is imperative. Treatment is dictated by the underlying diagnosis, bipolar disorder, and guided by the symptom acuity, patient's response to past treatments, drug tolerability, and breastfeeding preference. The somatic therapies include antimanic agents, atypical antipsychotic medications, and ECT. Estrogen prophylaxis remains purely investigational.

Conclusions

The rapid and accurate diagnosis of postpartum psychosis is essential to expedite appropriate treatment and to allow for quick, full recovery, prevention of future episodes, and reduction of risk to the mother and her children and family.

Bipolar disorder — age of onset and obstetric relevance — typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, so individuals often have symptoms or a diagnosis for the majority of their reproductive years, and recognition of incident bipolar disorder is important in obstetrics because childbirth is one of the most potent precipitants of hypomania or mania.

Postpartum psychosis — relapse risk and preventive planning: Patients with a history of postpartum psychosis or mania have an overall relapse risk of 31% (95% CI 22–42) and those with a history of bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis have rates as high as 41–87%, and thus warrant specialty psychiatric care during pregnancy and postpartum. This should include being seen by a psychiatrist if possible, and a prebirth planning meeting including the patient, support person(s), mental health professionals, and the obstetric care team should be held to coordinate a postpartum psychosis–prevention plan, including pharmacology, observation and support, and discussion of adequate sleep strategies; among the various treatment options, lithium immediately after delivery has the strongest evidence for postpartum psychosis prevention for those at greatest risk.

Major depressive disorder — diagnostic criteria specify that Five (or more) symptoms must be present during the same 2-week period, with at least one being depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure; example symptoms include depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities nearly every day, insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or attempt. The symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment, the episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition, at least one major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder and is not superimposed on schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders, and there has never been a manic or hypomanic episode; this exclusion does not apply if all manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition.

Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a severe psychiatric disorder-with limited data or consensus on diagnostic criteria and clinical presentation-that affects thousands of people each year. The Massachusetts General Hospital Postpartum Psychosis Project (MGHP3) was established to: 1) describe the phenomenology of PP, and 2) identify genomic and clinical predictors in a large cohort. Results thus far point to a richer understanding of the heterogeneity and complexity of this often-misunderstood illness and its nature over time. Data are collected from those who experienced PP within 6 months of delivery and within the 10 years prior to the MGHP3 interview. Participants provide information via the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Psychotic Disorders Studies (MINI-PDS), MGHP3© Questionnaire (including assessment of episode onset, duration, symptoms, and treatment received), and other relevant history. This retrospective study uses validated diagnostic tools to evaluate psychiatric history across participants' lifetimes. Descriptive statistics (e.g., median values, frequencies) were conducted to describe the phenomenology of PP. As of November 3, 2022, 248 participants with histories of at least one episode of PP completed the MGHP3 interview. Most participants met criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with psychotic features (71.8%). During PP episode(s), participants reported odd beliefs or delusions (87.6%), persecutory delusions (75.2%), ideas of reference (55.8%), and visual (52.3%) and/or auditory (48.1%) hallucinations. The median time between delivery and symptom onset was 10 days (SD = 43.72). Most participants reported receiving medication (93.0%) and/or psychotherapy (65.9%). This report describes findings regarding the phenomenology of postpartum psychosis among the MGHP3 cohort, the largest cohort with validated PP studied to date. This ongoing effort to refine the phenotype of PP and to delineate underlying genetic determinants of the disorder will contribute to an enhanced understanding of this serious illness. It also underscores areas for further rigorous assessment using other research methods and sets the stage for translational reproductive neuroscience - including ongoing analyses of neuroimaging and genetic data from the MGHP3 cohort.

### Screening and diagnosis of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 4 [^0fdf5992]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Postpartum psychosis risk factors — The most significant risk factors for postpartum psychosis are bipolar disorder, a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, and a previous episode of postpartum psychosis. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported that ninety-eight risk or protective factors were eligible for analyses, with a significant association for most, but the majority were not amenable to intervention (examples listed include maternal age, paternal age, season of birth in the northern hemisphere, low birth weight, and birth length).

### Screening and diagnosis of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 4 [^d8b5b145]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Perinatal intrusive thoughts — risk assessment stratifies into LOW RISK (symptoms more consistent with depression, anxiety, and/or OCD), MODERATE RISK, and HIGH RISK (symptoms more consistent with psychosis). Low risk features include: "Thoughts of harming baby are scary"; "Thoughts of harming baby cause anxiety or are upsetting (ego dystonic)"; "Mother does not want to harm her baby and feels it would be a bad thing to do"; and "Mother very clear she would not harm her baby". Moderate risk features include: "Thoughts of harming baby are somewhat scary"; "Thoughts of harming baby cause less anxiety"; "Mother is not sure whether the thoughts are based on reality or whether harming her baby would be a bad thing to do"; and "Mother is less clear she would not harm her baby". High risk features include: "Thoughts of harming the baby are comforting (ego syntonic)"; "Feels as if acting on thoughts will help infant or society (e.g., thinks baby is evil and world is better off without baby)"; "Lack of insight (inability to determine whether thoughts are based on reality)"; "Auditory and/or visual hallucinations are present"; "Bizarre beliefs that are not reality based"; and "Perception that untrue thoughts or feelings are real".

### Screening and diagnosis of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 4 [^c33d0944]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Intrusive thoughts in the perinatal period — prevalence and risk implications: Intrusive thoughts can be confused with psychosis or delusional thoughts. Unwanted or intrusive thoughts, including those of harming the infant, are very common and are often related to fears of something happening. Intrusive thoughts can occur in the absence of a mental health condition; however, they are also associated with perinatal depression, anxiety, and OCD. Most women who find these thoughts distressing (ie, ego dystonic) will not act on them; as such, there is low risk of infant harm. In summary, intrusive thoughts not associated with psychosis are common and they most often do not indicate risk of actual harm to the infant, although they do merit further inquiry and evaluation.

### Hospitalizations and emergency department visits for psychiatric illness during and after pregnancy among women with schizophrenia [^4eb610df]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Almost 50% of women with schizophrenia become pregnant. Little is known about their psychiatric service use patterns during or shortly after pregnancy.

Methods

Using health administrative data, we identified 1,433 women in Ontario, Canada, with schizophrenia (ICD-9, ICD-10, or DSM-IV-TR) who had a live birth delivery from January 2003 through March 2011 and described their use of acute psychiatric care services including hospitalizations, emergency department visits not requiring hospitalization, and self-harm-related emergency department visits during pregnancy and in the first year postpartum. Incidence rates of psychiatric hospitalization during pregnancy, and also within 1 year postpartum, were each compared to the incidence rate of psychiatric hospitalization in the 1-year period before conception. Results are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Similar comparisons were made for psychiatric emergency department visits not requiring hospitalization, as well as for self-harm-related emergency department visits.

Results

About 12% of the women had at least 1 psychiatric hospitalization during pregnancy, and 19% in the first year postpartum. About 10% had at least 1 psychiatric emergency department visit without hospitalization during pregnancy, and 16% had at least 1 emergency department visit postpartum. Self-harm-related emergency department visits were rarer, affecting only about 1% of the women in each time period. Relative to that in the 1-year period before conception (50 per 100 person-years), the incidence rate of psychiatric hospitalizations was lower during pregnancy (25 per 100 person-years), which is equivalent to an IRR of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.43–0.60). While the IRR of psychiatric hospitalizations was lower over the entire 1-year period postpartum (0.66; 95% CI, 0.57–0.76), it was transiently higher in the first 9 days postpartum (3.59; 95% CI, 2.74–4.69) and then waned by days 10 to 29 postpartum (0.87; 95% CI, 0.56–1.24). Emergency department visits for psychiatric and self-harm reasons were consistently lower during pregnancy and postpartum compared to the year before conception.

Conclusions

Psychiatric hospitalizations and emergency department visits are not uncommon for women with schizophrenia during pregnancy and the postpartum period. However, except for a brief period after delivery, women with schizophrenia are at relatively lower risk of requiring acute psychiatric inpatient and emergency care during and 1 year after pregnancy compared to the 1-year period prior to conception. This is key prognostic information for women with schizophrenia, their families, and providers who counsel them regarding pregnancy, motherhood, and management of schizophrenia. Identifying women at risk of requiring acute psychiatric services in the perinatal period warrants further investigation.

### Postpartum psychosis in a woman with Graves' disease: a case report [^7ee77cb8]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Thyroid dysfunction is common during pregnancy and the postpartum period and is known to cause psychiatric disturbances. A woman with Graves' disease and psychosis in the postpartum period is described.

Methods

A 22-year-old woman with Graves' disease developed fluctuating orientation, catatonia, delusions of persecution and auditory hallucinations 3 days following childbirth.

Results

The report discusses the clinical presentation. Treatment of both conditions led to the resolution of symptoms.

Conclusion

Graves' disease with postpartum psychosis may present with delirium, catatonia and prominent auditory hallucinations and responds well to a combination of psychotropic and antithyroid drugs. Thyroid dysfunction should be assessed for and managed adequately in postpartum psychosis.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: an international perspective on key changes and controversies [^c48a1d2a]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The most important changes in the classification of psychotic disorders from the ICD-10 to ICD-11, based on evidence review and consensus of the Working Group, include the following:
The ICD-10 section entitled 'Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders' has been replaced by 'Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders'. The term 'primary' was intended to distinguish these disorders from bipolar and other mental or medical disorders that may include psychotic symptoms.
Accordingly, non-primary (i.e. 'secondary') psychotic disorders, such as psychotic disorders due to substance use or withdrawal and psychotic disorders in general medical conditions, are respectively placed in the sections of the mental disorders chapter corresponding to 'Disorders due to substance use' and 'Mental and behavioural disorders associated with disorders or diseases classified elsewhere'. However, the unique features of the ICD-11, including its fully relational and electronic development for complex coding, make it possible to cross-list substance-induced psychotic disorders and those associated with general medical conditions in the section on primary psychotic disorders as well, enhancing clinical utility while still retaining the ability to allocate and aggregate these disorders appropriately for public health reporting.
The overall structure proposed for the ICD-11 block on 'Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders' is as follows: ◦ Schizophrenia ◦ Schizoaffective disorder ◦ Acute and transient psychotic disorder (ATPD) ◦ Schizotypal disorder ◦ Delusional disorder ◦ Other primary psychotic disorders ◦ Unspecified primary psychotic disorders
Disorders in this section continue to be categorized on the basis of their psychopathological profile, duration, or course characteristics, as described in the Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines being developed for use by mental health professionals in clinical settings.
Similar to the DSM-5, in the ICD-11, the nine ICD-10 schizophrenia subtypes (paranoid, hebephrenic, catatonic, etc.) are now omitted because of their longitudinal instability and lack of prognostic validity, and have been replaced by a system of coded symptom and course qualifiers (see below). Although first-rank symptoms are somewhat deemphasized, a diagnosis of schizophrenia requires the presence of at least two of seven symptom categories, including at least one 'core' symptom. Core symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, experiences of influence, passivity or control, and disorganized thinking. Symptoms should have been clearly present for most of the time during a period of at least 1 month, hence retaining the ICD-10 duration requirement. If the symptom requirements for schizophrenia are fulfilled but the duration is less than 1 month, 'Other specified primary psychotic disorder' would be the appropriate diagnosis until the duration requirement is met.
In the ICD-11, a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder should be made only when the symptom criteria of schizophrenia and of a moderate or severe mood episode are fulfilled simultaneously or within a few days of each other. The total duration requirement is 1 month, including both mood and schizophrenic symptoms. According to long-term studies, 10% of persons with schizoaffective disorder have only a single episode, while decades-long, symptom-free intervals may occur between episodes among people who have had more than one episode.
For the category of 'acute and transient psychotic disorder' (ATPD), the ICD-11 places the diagnostic focus on sudden onset, brief duration and high variability/fluctuation of psychotic and affective symptoms (i.e. the 'polymorphic' clinical presentation). For simplification and due to a lack of empirical support for the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of the distinctions made in the ICD-10 among several subtypes of ATPD, only F23.0 'Acute polymorphic psychotic disorder without symptoms of schizophrenia' is retained as the core clinical category for ATPD, whereas F23.3 'Other acute predominantly delusional disorder' is incorporated into the revised category delusional disorder. F23.1 'Acute polymorphic psychotic disorder with symptoms of schizophrenia' and F23.2 'Acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder' are replaced by 'Other specified primary psychotic disorder' if the duration is less than 1 month, and should be diagnosed as schizophrenia if all diagnostic requirements are met.
ICD-10 categories F22 'Persistent delusional disorder', F23.3 'Other acute predominantly delusional psychotic disorder', and F24 'Induced delusional disorder', which is a very rare entity, are collapsed into a single diagnostic category of 'Delusional disorder', omitting the durational qualifier 'persistent' to adapt to its durational heterogeneity and also to simplify the classification system.
Schizotypal disorder remains largely unchanged in the ICD-11. As in the ICD-10, it is considered a validated member of the schizophrenia 'spectrum' as a potential precursor or subsyndromal variant of schizophrenia rather than a personality disorder and is therefore included in the section on primary psychotic disorders.
As an alternative to subtypes, coded qualifiers to describe the course of the disorder as well as symptom presentation are included in the section and can be applied to all primary psychotic disorders. Course qualifiers allow the differentiation of first- and multiple-episode cases, and between acute episodes with symptoms, full or partial remission, and a chronic course due to different prognostic implications. Symptom qualifiers include the presence of positive, negative, depressive, manic, psychomotor, and cognitive symptoms, each of which may be rated as mild, moderate, or severe. A qualifier for cognitive symptoms is intended to provide more diagnostic and therapeutic attention to cognitive symptoms as these are linked to functional outcome. The 'psychomotor symptoms' qualifier includes catatonic symptoms. In addition, catatonia is also included as a separate category in the ICD-11.

Regarding specific circumstances for catatonia, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients (postnatal period), BAP 2023 guidelines recommend to decide on the admission of patients with severe catatonia and a concurrent mental illness to an inpatient setting jointly by the psychiatric and obstetric team. Encourage contact between the mother and baby as much as possible and appropriate. Provide psychiatric care by a psychiatrist experienced in the management of perinatal mental illness.

### Stimulant-induced psychosis in the postpartum period: a case report [^8eb5b353]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Psychotic symptoms may emerge in up to 40% of people who misuse stimulants, with physiological changes in the perinatal period potentially contributing to the development of psychosis. In this report, we discuss the case of a woman presenting with stimulant misuse, psychosis, and obsessive compulsive disorder-like symptoms in the postpartum period. We describe the patient's symptoms at presentation, differential diagnoses, treatment course, and related challenges.

### Phenotypical characteristics of postpartum psychosis: a clinical cohort study [^dfe52cf5]. Bipolar Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Postpartum psychosis (PP) is known for its clear onset but its phenotype has never been clearly described in a cohort. The aim of this study was to describe PP symptomatology, and to identify subgroups of patients based on symptom profiles.

Methods

We prospectively assessed a wide range of symptoms in cases of PP in a cohort of women (N = 130) admitted to the Mother-Baby inpatient unit. Using a person-centered analytic approach, we distinguished mutually exclusive subgroups of women. Subgroups were related to demographic and clinical characteristics.

Results

The most prevalent symptoms of PP were irritability (73%), abnormal thought content (72%), and anxiety (71%). Suicidal and infanticidal ideation was present in 19% and 8% of patients, respectively. Delusions and hallucinations often had a negative content. Latent class analysis revealed three symptom profiles, a manic (34%), depressive (41%) and atypical (25%) profile, respectively. The manic profile is characterized by manic symptoms and agitation, the depressive profile by depressive and anxiety symptoms, and the atypical profile by disturbance of consciousness and disorientation. In women with a depressive profile, treatment was started 2 weeks later (P = 0.049), and more often voluntarily, than in manic and atypical women (P = 0.037).

Conclusions

We distinguished subgroups of PP patients with a manic, depressive, and atypical profile. Disturbance of consciousness, disorientation, and depersonalization/derealization were less prevalent than previously suggested in the literature. Instead, the depressive profile was the most prevalent, but the depressive profile can easily remain undetected, which could lead to treatment delay and risk of suicide/infanticide. Within the manic profile, irritability was highly prevalent and occurred more often than elevated mood.

### Psychiatric consultation to the postpartum mother [^577e7648]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The immediate postpartum period is a time of acute vulnerability to mental illness, which presents unique challenges for the psychiatric consultant. Because the postpartum hospital stay is typically brief, the consultant must have a working knowledge of postpartum physiology and the myriad forms of mental illness that may emerge in this vulnerable time, in order to quickly make a diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan. This review aims to characterize the most common reasons for postpartum consultation, review postpartum physiology and psychiatric conditions, and propose an evidence-based, practical approach to treatment. A literature search using the terms "postpartum", "obstetric", "consultation", and "psychiatry" yielded six studies that identified reasons for psychiatric consultation to the obstetrics and gynecology services. These studies informed the structure of the article such that we review the most common reasons for consultation and how to approach each issue. The most common reason for consultation is past psychiatric history, often in the absence of current symptoms. For each clinical situation, including depression, adverse birth events, and psychosis, we present a differential diagnosis, as well as risk factors, clinical signs, and recommended treatment.

### Screening and diagnosis of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 4 [^2083f8ea]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Perinatal bipolar disorder — epidemiology, relapse, hospitalization, and postpartum psychosis risk are quantified as follows: Bipolar disorder affects approximately 3% of the general population and 2% to 8% of the perinatal population, with one study noting rates as high as 18%, and pooled prevalence is 2.6% (95% CI 1.2–4.5%) with bipolar-spectrum mood episodes at 20.1% (95% CI 16.0–24.5%) in perinatal individuals. Risk of relapse is 37% (95% CI 29–45%) overall, with marked differences in those not treated with pharmacotherapy in pregnancy (66%, 95% CI 57–75%) compared with those in which pharmacotherapy is continued (23%, 95% CI 14–37%), and risk of psychiatric hospitalization is significantly greater in the postpartum period for patients with bipolar disorder than at any other points in their lives. Postpartum psychosis occurs in approximately 1–2 of 1,000 births; women with bipolar disorder have a markedly increased risk (7–17% or almost one in five deliveries), and those with prior postpartum psychosis have approximately one third (31%, 95% CI 22–42%) recurrence; in a meta-analysis, approximately half (43.5%) had isolated postpartum psychosis (36.1% total sample single episode; 7.1% postpartum-only recurrences) and the other approximately half (56.7%) experienced lifelong psychiatric conditions.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Is postpartum depression a homogenous disorder: time of onset, severity, symptoms and hopelessness in relation to the course of depression [^ce92d9f7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Although PPD is common, it is often missed by primary care teams. Moreover, mothers often face barriers to seeking help, such as an inability to disclose their feelings or to recognise the symptoms of depression; they also lack of knowledge about postpartum depression.

It is not easy to differentiate PPD from other psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders or to separate depressed mothers from healthy mothers. Patterns of appetite, especially loss of appetite, fatigue, and disrupted sleep related to infant care may be difficult to distinguish from the symptoms of depression. Sleep disturbances can also lead to negative consequences, such as dysphoric mood and impaired cognitive function, while persistent difficulty with concentration or cognitive tasks is indicative of a mood disorder. Substance abuse and medical causes of psychiatric symptoms, such as thyroid disorders, should also be considered. The "baby blues" is a transient mood disturbance that can affect as many as 70% of new mothers within ten days of delivery. It manifests as tearfulness, irritability, anxiety, and emotional liability, as well as interpersonal hypersensitivity, insomnia, and sometimes elation, but it does not impair function. Mothers with a rapid onset of intense mood disturbance, confusion, strange or delusional beliefs, hallucinations, and disorganised behaviour have symptoms of postpartum psychosis, which is most commonly a form of bipolar disorder. Other forms of bipolar I–II disorders should also be considered. Co-morbidity studies suggest that PPD is associated with generalised anxiety disorders, panic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. The incidence of personality disorders among PPD patients is greater than among non-PPD patients, and many symptoms are coloured by these disorders.

### Screening and diagnosis of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 4 [^d42425f7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar I disorder — manic episode diagnostic criteria state that bipolar I disorder requires meeting criteria for a manic episode, which may have been preceded by or may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary), during which three (or more) of the following are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior (four if the mood is only irritable): inflated self-esteem or grandiosity; decreased need for sleep (eg, feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep); more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking; flight of idea or subjective experience that thoughts are racing; distractibility; increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation; and excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (eg, engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features, and the episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis, and criteria A-D constitute a manic episode with at least one lifetime manic episode required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

### Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis [^7c6b31c4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Postnatal psychosis is a worldwide life-threatening condition that affects one to two in every 1000 new mothers. It has an abrupt onset within a month of childbirth. Affected new mothers rapidly develop frank psychosis, cognitive impairment, and disorganised behaviours. Factors that increase the risk of postnatal psychosis include primiparous mothers who are single, women who are older, or with a past psychiatric history and family history of affective psychosis, prenatal depression and autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. The risk of a future postnatal recurrence is 25% to 57%. Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis aim at identifying women with risk factors, early recognition of imminent psychosis through screening, and preventive drug therapy. Mood stabilisers, antipsychotic drugs and hormone therapy may be beneficial in the prevention of postnatal psychotic episodes in women at risk.

Objectives

To investigate the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postnatal psychosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in October 2012 using the search strategy of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials relevant to the prevention of postnatal psychosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors inspected all citations to ensure reliable selection. If we had included relevant trials, we planned to assess the methodological quality of identified trials using the criteria recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two review authors would have independently extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data, we planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and the number needed to treat to benefit/harm (NNTB/NNTH) on an intention-to-treat basis.

Main Results

There are no included studies in this review. The electronic search produced three relevant references, among which we identified two old planned trials that seem never to have started, and one which we excluded a study because it was a report of a case series.

Authors' Conclusions

This is not an empty review - it is a review full of unanswered questions. Despite growing interest in women's mental health, the literature in the area of postnatal psychosis is still very limited. It seems that clinicians have no choice but to continue with their current practices guided solely by varied clinical judgement. Women at risk of postnatal psychosis and their relatives are justified to be disappointed in the medical/research fraternity. A post hoc PubMed topic (not methodology-specific) search identified mainly case series. Policy makers have no trial-based evidence upon which to base their guidelines. Certainly, preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis are difficult to justify with confidence without well-designed, well-conducted, and well-reported randomised studies. Available publications suggest that such studies are possible and funders of research may wish to make this work a priority.

Major depressive episode — diagnosis requires five (or more) symptoms during the same 2-week period representing a change from previous functioning, with at least one being depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure; symptoms clearly attributable to a medical condition should not be included; responses to a significant loss may resemble a depressive episode, but the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response should also be carefully considered.

### Psychosis in pregnancy and the neonatal ripple effect [^eafe3c23]. NeoReviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum mood disorders including depression and psychosis are well documented conditions. However, new-onset psychosis in pregnancy is less common and less well studied with fewer reports available.

Clinical Case

A 36-year-old Gravida 6 Para 3113, non-English-speaking patient with no known history of mood disorder outside of pregnancy presented for her scheduled repeat cesarean delivery and was diagnosed with new-onset peripartum psychosis. She was admitted to the antepartum service and underwent an extensive workup to rule out organic causes, which all returned negative results. The patient was initially medically managed, and her mental status improved to where she was able to assent for her cesarean delivery while consent was obtained from the patient's next of kin. After delivery the patient and neonate continued to be managed with an interdisciplinary team to ensure the safety of mother and child. The neonate was transferred to the newborn nursey with supervised visits with the patient and was ultimately discharged home with the father. The patient was managed inpatient on the postpartum floor; however, she ultimately required transfer to an inpatient psychiatry unit where she received higher-level psychiatric care until she improved and was cleared to go home with close outpatient follow-up.

Conclusion

This is one of the few published cases of new-onset psychosis in pregnancy. It highlights the importance of addressing mental health concerns in our patients as well as the vital interdisciplinary team management to ensure the safety of our patients and their families. The paucity of data around these presentations is notable and there exists an opportunity for further investigation into mental health and reproductive psychiatry to help improve outcomes.

### Postpartum psychosis during delivery hospitalizations and postpartum readmissions, 2016–2019 [^a6bbfb0c]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Up-to-date data on population-level risk factors for postpartum psychosis is limited, although increasing substance use disorders, psychiatric disorders, autoimmune disorders, and other medical comorbidities in the obstetrical population may be contributing to the increased baseline risk of postpartum psychosis.

Objective

This study aimed to determine trends in and risk factors for postpartum psychosis during delivery hospitalizations and postpartum readmissions.

Study Design

Analyzing the 2016–2019 Nationwide Readmission Database, this repeated cross-sectional study identified diagnoses of postpartum psychosis during delivery hospitalizations and postpartum readmissions within 60 days of discharge. The relationship among demographic, clinical, and hospital-level factors present at delivery and postpartum psychosis was analyzed with logistic regression models with adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals as measures of association. Separate models were created for postpartum psychosis diagnoses at delivery and during postpartum readmission. Temporal trends in diagnoses were analyzed with Joinpoint regression to determine the average annual percent change with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Of 12,334,506 deliveries in the analysis, 13,894 (1.1 per 1000) had a diagnosis of postpartum psychosis during the delivery hospitalization, and 7128 (0.6 per 1000) had a 60-day postpartum readmission with postpartum psychosis. Readmissions with postpartum psychosis increased significantly during the study period (P = 0.046). Most readmissions with a postpartum psychosis diagnosis occurred in 0 to 10 days (43% of readmissions) or 11 to 20 days (18% of readmissions) after discharge. Clinical factors with the highest adjusted odds for postpartum psychosis readmission included delivery postpartum psychosis (adjusted odds ratio, 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 4.2–8.0), depression disorder (adjusted odds ratio, 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 3.3–4.2), bipolar spectrum disorder (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.3–3.5), and schizophrenia spectrum disorder (adjusted odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.1–4.0). In models analyzing postpartum psychosis diagnoses at delivery, risk factors associated with the highest odds included anxiety disorder (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 3.5–4.2), schizophrenia spectrum disorder (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.4), bipolar disorder (adjusted odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.6–2.1), stillbirth (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 3.1–4.2), and substance use disorder (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.6–1.9). In addition, chronic conditions, such as pregestational diabetes mellitus, obesity, and substance use, were associated with delivery and readmission postpartum psychosis.

Conclusion

This study determined that postpartum psychosis is increasing during postpartum readmissions and is associated with a wide range of obstetrical and medical comorbidities. Close follow-up care after delivery for other medical and obstetrical diagnoses may represent an opportunity to identify postpartum psychiatric conditions, including postpartum psychosis.

### First-onset psychosis occurring in the postpartum period: a prospective cohort study [^725acf4b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively characterize a cohort of patients for whom first lifetime episode of psychosis occurs in the postpartum period.

Method

Included in the study were 51 women admitted to an inpatient facility for postpartum psychosis and a population-based control group (n = 6,969). All patients received naturalistic treatment using the sequential addition of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and lithium. A clinician-administered questionnaire and parallel history provided information about obstetric history, pregnancy, delivery, breastfeeding, neonatal outcomes, and onset of the disease. Clinical remission was defined as the absence of psychotic, manic, and depressive symptoms for at least 1 week. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale. The study was conducted from 2005 to 2009.

Results

Compared to the general population sample, women with postpartum psychosis had a significantly higher incidence of primiparity (OR = 2.90; 95% CI, 1.49–5.67) but had no significant differences in delivery-related, lactational, or neonatal-related risk factors. The median onset of psychiatric symptoms occurred at 8 days' postpartum (interquartile range [IQR], 5–14), and median duration of episode was 40 days (IQR, 23–69). Patients with prominent depressive symptoms had a significantly later onset (P = 0.01) of psychosis and a longer duration of episode (P < .01) than patients without depressive symptoms. Psychotic symptoms were mood-incongruent in 64.7% of patients.

Conclusions

In contrast to other findings related to postpartum psychosis in bipolar patients, no delivery-related, neonatal-related, or lactational risk factors could be identified. Further, our findings of a delayed onset and mood incongruence of postpartum psychotic symptoms markedly contrasts with that of patients with a previous history of bipolar disorder. These results suggest that women with psychosis limited to the postpartum period might have a distinct risk profile and phenomenology.

Postpartum psychiatric disorders and a history of psychiatric disorders

Information on psychiatric diagnoses was retrieved from the Danish Hospital Register, the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register, and the Swedish Patient Registers (Additional file 1: Table S1). Our primary outcome was a first diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder (ICD 10: F00-F99) given as primary or secondary diagnosis in hospital inpatient or outpatient care in the first 90 days after delivery. We chose this period as it is the most vulnerable time after birth. To address concerns about statistical power and to consider that there was likely a lag between onset of symptoms and timing of diagnoses, we conducted analyses with a more widely defined postpartum period, i.e. the first 365 days postpartum as our secondary outcome. Each woman was followed from the date of delivery until a PPD, death, emigration, or 90/365 days postpartum, whichever came first. We further categorized PPDs as (1) postpartum depression (given its clinical relevance and prevalence) and (2) other PPD.

We defined a personal history of psychiatric disorders as having at least one record of psychiatric disorders in inpatient or outpatient care prior to delivery; the corresponding ICD codes used are shown in Additional file 1: Table S2. A family history of psychiatric disorders was also identified using the same strategy (i.e. based on biological parents identified in the Danish Civil Registration System and the Swedish Multi-Generation Register).

### Schizophrenia [^0626a492]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on schizophrenia:

- **Definition**: Schizophrenia is defined as a complex psychiatric condition characterized by symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and impaired cognitive functions.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of schizophrenia is unclear; however, in utero disorders (infections, obstetric complications, and fetal disturbances), and genetic and environmental factors (childhood trauma, social isolation, economic adversity, discrimination) have been implicated.
- **Epidemiology**: The annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US is 5.1 per 1,000 individuals.
- **Disease course**: Abnormalities (hypo/hyper) in neurotransmission of neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate), particularly dopamine results in either hyperdopaminergic function in the caudate nucleus or hypodopaminergic function in the frontal lobe, in addition to a complex interaction of nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, mesocortical, and tuberoinfundibular pathway leads to negative symptoms, positive symptoms, and cognitive deficits, in addition to detectable physical changes in the brain tissue.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: After 10-year follow up 80% of the schizophrenic patients require readmission after the first discharge. Non-adherence to anti-psychotic medication in the first year is associated with a 64% relapse rate while adherence during the first year is associated with a 27% relapse.

### Postpartum psychosis: two cohorts compared, 1875–1924 and 1994–2005 [^94bf4ee5]. Psychological Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There has been a long-standing debate as to whether postpartum psychoses are distinct from other psychoses. While the outcomes of postpartum psychosis are in general thought to be good, the disorder is linked to a high rate of suicide.

Method

We have utilized a database of 3872 admissions to the North Wales Asylum during the period 1875–1924 to extract data on the prevalence, course and clinical features of postpartum psychoses during this period. We have collected first admissions for postpartum psychosis between 1994 and 2005 in North West Wales to establish a current incidence rate for the disorder.

Results

The incidence of psychoses with a first onset in the postpartum period in North West Wales has fallen in the modern period, while the incidence of postpartum psychoses in women with a pre-existing mental illness remains the same. Some features of the clinical picture and course of postpartum psychoses differ from other psychoses, but may be gender rather than disorder linked.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that psychoses with their first onset in the postpartum period may be vanishing. If replicated, this would support claims that these disorders are distinct from other disorders. Alternately, if regarded as affective disorders, establishing the basis for the apparent decline in frequency of these disorders may have implications for other affective disorders.

### Genetic risk scores for major psychiatric disorders and the risk of postpartum psychiatric disorders [^f7784f5c]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Postpartum psychiatric disorders

We defined a postpartum psychiatric disorder either as (1) a treated psychiatric episode recorded in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register or (2) at least one redeemed prescription of psychotropic drugs recorded in the Danish National Prescription Registry within 12 months after delivery. Consequently, our case group consisted of moderate (prescription defined) and severe (treated in secondary health care and diagnosed by a psychiatrist) cases (Supplementary Table S1). We selected the time period of interest as one year after childbirth to account for a potential delay in seeking psychiatric care and to apply a widely used clinical definition. Prior work in these data showed similar familial risk of postpartum psychiatric disorders at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. A postpartum psychiatric episode may represent a new-onset disorder, a continuation or recurrence of a psychiatric disorder prior to childbirth, or a different psychiatric disorder after childbirth in a woman who had a prior psychiatric disorder.

The Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register contains information on inpatient contacts at psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric wards from 1969 onwards. Psychiatric outpatient treatment and emergency room contacts have been included since 1995. Treated psychiatric episodes included any psychiatric diagnosis (Primary diagnosis, ICD-10 codes F00–F99), excluding mental retardation and substance abuse (ICD-10 codes F10–F19 and F70–F79). The Danish National Prescription Registry was established in 1995, and contains information on all prescriptions dispensed at community pharmacies in Denmark. We included psychotropic drugs of Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification codes N05 (psycholeptics) and N06 (psychoanaleptics). Detailed diagnostic codes and categorization are described in the Supplementary Methods.

Personal and parental psychiatric history

We defined previous personal psychiatric history as one in-patient or out-patient treatment for the psychiatric disorders described above or one redeemed prescription for psychotropic medications before the date of delivery. We similarly defined parental psychiatric history as one in-patient or out-patient treatment for psychiatric disorders in a mother or father before the date of delivery. Note, as information on prescriptions only dates back to 1995, prescription data were not used to define parental psychiatric history.

### Postpartum catatonia treated with electroconvulsive therapy: a case report [^d2f94818]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Catatonia is a rare syndrome that occurs in mood and psychotic disorders, and general medical conditions. Postpartum depression affects 10%-15% of women within 6 months after delivery. Postpartum psychosis affects 0.1%-0.5% of women within weeks after delivery, though it can occur within hours; it carries risk for suicide and infanticide. There is limited evidence available to guide treatment. We review a case of postpartum psychosis that presented with catatonia and was resistant to medications, but responded to electroconvulsive therapy.

- Data are (%) within code classification; * 14,699 procedures were conducted for cohort 1, & 264,849 for cohort 2

When further examination of admission codes was conducted for maternal mental and behavioural disorders (Table 6), we again found statistically significant differences between groups (p ≤ 0.001). We found mood affective disorders; neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders; behavioural syndromes associated with psychological disturbances and physical factors; and personality and behaviour disorders more often occurred in cohort 1 than in cohort 2. This was most striking for mood affected disorders (5.4% vs 2.4%), behavioural syndromes (4.3% vs 1.2%), and neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (4.5% vs 1.8%).

With respect to any admission to a psychiatric facility, there were no statistically significant differences between cohort 1 and 2 (1.03% vs 1.09%, p = 0.44), however statistically significant differences were noted in regard to diagnosis types (p < 0.001, Table 7). Women admitted to RPS more often received a diagnosis of a mood affective disorder (50.0% vs 39.0%) and/or a disorder of adult personality and behaviour (33.5% vs 23.9%) when compared to women not admitted to RPS. However, women in cohort 1 less often had mental and behavioural issues arising as a consequence of psychoactive substance abuse (71.0% vs 89.0%) and schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorders (11.3% vs 19.1%). These differences are represented in Fig. 1, along with the findings for neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (p = 0.05). It was also interesting to note that over the 12-year study period, it was observed that there was an overall 7% increase in the number of women in cohort 1 having a psychiatric diagnosis noted on their RPS admissions (Fig. 2).

### Self-harm in pregnancy and the postnatal year: prevalence and risk factors [^c74f00e6]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We defined previous psychiatric history as a hospital contact for psychiatric disorders (ICD-8 codes 290–315; ICD-10 codes F00–F99) or one prescription for psychotropic medication (ATC codes N05 and N06), retrieved from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register and the Danish National Prescription Register. We categorized women with previous psychiatric history into six hierarchical groups (one being the highest), as described in Box 1. This hierarchical system reflects the organization of the ICD-10 diagnostic system and accounts for individuals with more than one recorded diagnosis. For example, if a woman has diagnoses of both schizophrenia and depression, schizophrenia would be defined as her diagnosis, as this is higher in the hierarchy. We defined parental psychiatric history as either parent having a hospital contact for a psychiatric disorder (any diagnoses within the F-chapter in ICD-10), prior to the index pregnancy. Antidepressant prescription within 2 years before pregnancy was defined as ATC code N06A recorded within the Danish National Prescription Registry.

### Perinatal psychiatric episodes: a population-based study on treatment incidence and prevalence [^cc8ab56d]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psychiatric episodes during pregnancy and following childbirth are complex, as the well-being of both the mother and infant must be considered in all treatment decisions. There is general consensus that childbirth triggers new postpartum episodes that can be on a spectrum of mild-to-severe presentation. The severe episodes affect 1–2 per 1000 new mothers, and have been described and quantified in a range of diverse studies using different data sources and study designs, for example, refs. Episodes requiring psychiatric hospitalization and specialist treatment in secondary and tertiary health-care systems are thought to be on the severe end of the spectrum. They are often characterized by severe depression with suicidal ideation, or as postpartum psychosis that has been closely associated with bipolar affective disorders, although it does not have a specific diagnoses. Adding to this, a proportion of more moderate postpartum psychiatric episodes will be treated in primary care with prescription drugs. Although the threshold for using pharmacological therapy is different in the perinatal period due to concerns about possible risks to the fetus and breastfeeding infant, antidepressants are used as one treatment option for perinatal depression, particularly non-psychotic moderate-to-severe depression. Antidepressant use in the perinatal period has increased over time, as it has for depression outside the perinatal period. Furthermore, the prevalence of antidepressant use in pregnancy varies significantly between countries and across studies: 3% in Denmarkand 13% in the United States, overall challenging direct comparisons across time periods and between studies. Adding to this, evidence suggests that some perinatal psychiatric episodes will be unnoticed and consequently untreated, with one recent study highlighting that pharmacological treatment is less likely to be prescribed in perinatal illnesses compared with other time points.

Together, postpartum psychiatric episodes comprise a range of different disorders and symptom severity, which subsequently are diagnosed and treated in a range of treatment settings. This poses a significant challenge to the investigation of incidence of postpartum psychiatric episodes, as the data from various settings are needed. An additional challenge is that the most available data in the field does not differentiate between first-time episodes vs recurrent episodes, which in epidemiological terms can be described as mixing incident and prevalent case groups. Finally, past diagnostic specifiers in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic systems vary in terms of defining postpartum onset ranging from 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, with the recent shift from DSM-4 to DSM-5 to also include psychiatric episodes in pregnancy as well as postpartum episodes.

### Screening and diagnosis of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 4 [^991038c2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder in the perinatal period — pharmacotherapy continuation and sleep planning: Continuation of effective pharmacotherapy for those with bipolar disorder is highly recommended to prevent exacerbation, relapse, and associated risks and negative outcomes, and a history of bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis merits close monitoring during the perinatal period, particularly in the third trimester and postpartum. If pharmacotherapy was not continued in pregnancy, recurrence risk can be reduced with initiation of a mood stabilizer postpartum. Because sleep dysregulation may be a potential trigger for illness exacerbation or recurrence in bipolar disorder, sleep planning with support persons, including at times foregoing an overnight feed or milk expression to preserve a longer stretch of nightly sleep than is usual with a newborn, can be considered.

### Screening and diagnosis of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 4 [^a7f4d765]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

ACOG Clinical Practice Guideline — Perinatal bipolar disorder screening and risks — The incidence of conversion from major depressive disorder to bipolar disorder in the perinatal period, especially postpartum, is greater than 7%, and bipolar disorder is the strongest predictor of postpartum psychosis (1–2/1,000 perinatal individuals) and infanticide (2–7/100,000 infants), with perinatal patients at increased risk for recurrence or exacerbation including depression, hypomania or mania, mixed episodes, psychosis, psychiatric hospitalization, suicide, and infanticide. In parallel with this change in practice, referral to a psychiatrist for further assessment, diagnosis, and longer-term treatment is paramount in patients with either recognized bipolar disorder or a high suspicion for this disorder, and critically, screening for bipolar disorder needs to be completed before initiating pharmacotherapy for depression and anxiety. ACOG suggests that everyone receiving prenatal and postpartum care be screened for bipolar disorder using a standardized, validated instrument. (CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION, MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE) Standardized, validated screening instruments for bipolar disorder include the MDQ (Mood Disorder Questionnaire; three questions, the first with 13 items, self-administered) and the CIDI.

### Perinatal psychiatric episodes: a population-based study on treatment incidence and prevalence [^54fb148e]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Childbirth as a trigger for psychiatric episodes

Our data confirmed that childbirth is a potent and highly significant trigger of severe psychiatric episodes. We identified a rapid increase of particularly inpatient-treated episodes shortly following childbirth, and the first postpartum months were associated with the highest risks of both first-time and recurrent episodes. More precisely, we found that in 0.64 per 1000 births, mothers experienced new psychiatric episodes necessitating treatment at inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities 0–3 months postpartum. This estimate is lower than previously reported incidences of postpartum psychosis/severe postpartum psychiatric episodes, 1 per 1000. We speculate that the reasons for this difference reflect changes across calendar time, as the number of available inpatient beds has decreased during the past decades, and possibly a subsequent shift toward treatment in outpatient clinic settings.

Applying an observation period of 3 months postpartum, we found that for every 1000 births the following numbers of psychiatric first-time episodes were treated: 0.64 inpatient psychiatric treatment, 1.63 outpatient psychiatric treatment and 7.72 primary care-treated moderate episodes treated with prescriptions of antidepressants/antipsychotics. This demonstrates that the majority of postpartum episodes are treated in primary care settings, but these numbers also reflect a difference in severity of the disorders, with inpatient admissions representing the most severe end of the spectrum.

Definition of postpartum depression and non-postpartum depression

We defined depression as a diagnosis of single and recurrent depressive disorders (ICD-8 codes: 296.09, 296.29, 298.09, and 300.49; ICD-10 codes F32–33) recorded in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register. The first depressive episode was defined as the date of first hospital contact for the above-mentioned diagnostic codes. Women were categorized as PPD cases if they were diagnosed with a first depressive episode within 12 months after delivery, and if contacts were outside the postpartum period, women were defined as MDD cases. We used the diagnosis of depression within 1-year postpartum to include all women with depression with postpartum onset, also women with a notable diagnostic delay between the onset of symptoms and the time of diagnosis, as recommended by the World Health Organization.

2.2 Procedures and diagnostic criteria

Participants were interviewed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), which provides detailed information about lifetime psychopathology. Psychiatric and general practice case-notes where available were also reviewed. Based on these data best-estimate lifetime diagnoses were made according to DSM-IV criteria and key clinical variables, such as age at onset and number of episodes, were rated. In cases where there was doubt, diagnostic and clinical ratings were made by at least two members of the research team blind to each other's rating. Inter-rater reliability was formally assessed using 20 cases. Mean kappa statistics were 0.85 for DSM-IV diagnoses and ranged between 0.81 and 0.99 for other key clinical categorical variables; mean intra-class correlation coefficients were between 0.91 and 0.97 for key clinical continuous variables. Team members involved in the interview, rating and diagnostic procedures were all research psychologists or psychiatrists.

Pregnancy and postpartum mood episodes were defined for each delivery according to the symptomatology and the time of onset. Depression was defined as an episode of DSM-IV non-psychotic major depression, while mania/psychosis was defined as an episode of DSM-IV mania or DSM-IV psychotic depression. In the current diagnostic systems for psychiatric disorders (DSM-IV and ICD-10), postpartum mood episodes are not separate nosological entities. The DSM-IV has an onset specifier that includes all mood episodes with an onset within 4 weeks after childbirth, while ICD-10 has a postpartum category for episodes with onset within 6 weeks, but this diagnosis should only be used for episodes that do not meet the criteria for disorders that can be classified elsewhere. Current diagnostic systems do not allow episodes in pregnancy or later in the postpartum to be linked to childbirth. However, rather than the 4 or 6 weeks cut-off, a 6 month or 1 year postpartum period is commonly used in clinical practice. Moreover, we have shown that the familiality for postpartum depression maximizes with a 6–8-week criterion of postpartum onset and thus the DSM-IV onset specifier may be to narrow. In this study we grouped the episodes with onsets: (a) in pregnancy; (b) in the first 6 weeks postpartum; and (c) between 6 weeks and 6 months after childbirth.

Several obstetric variables have been related to postpartum mood disorders, especially mania/psychosis, and therefore information on the sex of the baby, age at pregnancy and method of delivery was collected.

### Postpartum psychosis in a non-native language-speaking patient: a perspective on language barriers and cultural competency [^48d9cee9]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Postpartum psychosis is a condition characterised by rapid onset of psychotic symptoms several weeks after childbirth. Outside of its timing and descriptions of psychotic features, minimal research exists due to its relative rarity (1 to 2 per 1000 births in the USA), with greater emphasis on postpartum sadness and depression. With the existing literature, cultural differences and language barriers previously have not been taken into consideration as there are no documented cases of postpartum psychosis in a non–English-speaking patient. Correctly differentiating postpartum psychosis from other postpartum psychiatric disorders requires adeptly evaluating for the presence of psychotic symptoms with in-depth history taking. Here, we present a case of postpartum psychosis in a Japanese-speaking only patient, with an associated clinical course and culturally appropriate approach to treatment. A review of postpartum psychosis and language/cultural considerations are also discussed, with attention on the Japanese concept of 'Satogaeri bunben'.

### Screening and diagnosis of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 4 [^66c36fe8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Mental health conditions and associated diagnostic criteria — major depressive episode (DSM-5-TR) includes symptoms nearly every day such as depressed mood and markedly diminished interest or pleasure, with possible significant weight change defined as "a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month", and may include recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation/plan/attempt; symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment and the episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition; criteria A–C constitute a major depressive episode. Responses to a significant loss may resemble a depressive episode, and clinical judgment based on the individual's history and cultural norms is required in this context.

### Postpartum psychiatric admissions in the United States [^88fed14c]. American Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to assess risk for postpartum psychiatric admissions in the United States.

Study Design

This study used the 2010 to 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database to identify psychiatric admissions during the first 60days after delivery hospitalization. Timing of admission after delivery discharge was determined. We fit multivariable log-linear regression models to assess the impact of psychiatric comorbidity on admission risk, adjusting for patient, obstetrical, and hospital factors.

Results

Of 15.7 million deliveries from 2010 to 2014, 11,497 women (0.07%) were readmitted for a primary psychiatric diagnosis within 60days postpartum. Psychiatric admissions occurred relatively consistently across 10-day periods after delivery hospitalization discharge. Psychiatric diagnoses were present among 5% of women at delivery but 40% of women who were readmitted postpartum for a psychiatric indication. In the adjusted model, women with psychiatric diagnoses at delivery hospitalization were 9.7 times more likely to be readmitted compared with those without psychiatric comorbidity. Women at highest risk for psychiatric admission were those with Medicare and Medicaid, in lower income quartiles, and of younger age.

Conclusion

While a large proportion of psychiatric admissions occurred among a relatively small proportion of at-risk women, admissions occurred over a broad temporal period relative to other indications for postpartum admission.

### The psychopathology of NMDAR-antibody encephalitis in adults: a systematic review and phenotypic analysis of individual patient data [^b79b534a]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Before modelling the primary data formally, we filtered them as means of quality control to better understand the cases with very few lower-level features. We sorted the individual patient data by proxy markers of psychiatric involvement to account for a diversity of sources reporting the patients (reporting in a psychiatry specialist journal, psychiatrist authorship, department of psychiatry authorship). Patients with these markers were placed in the psychiatric-described subgroup and patients without these markers were in the non-psychiatric-described subgroup (appendix).

To develop an operationalised diagnosis classifier, two investigators (AAD and DO) independently compared 14 psychotic and mood disorder diagnoses with the 50 patient-derived lower-level features. They used ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for research throughout; for schizophrenia, the raters also used the DSM-5 classification to compare a unified schizophrenia concept (DSM-5) with subtypes (ICD-10). Because pregnancy and post-partum-associated cases were reported, post-partum psychosis was included as a comparator syndrome. Post-partum psychosis does not have its own category in either diagnostic system, and therefore a previously reported descriptive cohort was used to identify common lower-level features. To capture ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for research and DSM-5 inclusion and exclusion criteria (appendix), features were scored as 1 (unequivocally present), 0.5 (possible or transient), 0 (absent) and −2 (would exclude a diagnosis). A consensus categorisation was then finalised.

### Adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes complicated by psychosis among pregnant women in the United States [^d2080c96]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes among women with psychosis, particularly affective psychosis, has rarely been studied at the population level. We aimed to assess the risk of adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes among women with psychosis (schizophrenia, affective psychosis, and other psychoses).

Methods

From the 2007–2012 National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample, 23,507,597 delivery hospitalizations were identified. From the same hospitalization, International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes were used to identify maternal psychosis and outcomes. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained using logistic regression.

Results

The prevalence of psychosis at delivery was 698.76 per 100,000 hospitalizations. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, smoking, alcohol/substance abuse, and pregnancy-related hypertension, women with psychosis were at a heightened risk for cesarean delivery (aOR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.23–1.29), induced labor (aOR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02–1.09), antepartum hemorrhage (aOR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.14–1.31), placental abruption (aOR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.13–1.32), postpartum hemorrhage (aOR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.10–1.27), premature delivery (aOR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.36–1.46), stillbirth (aOR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.23–1.53), premature rupture of membranes (aOR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.15–1.29), fetal abnormalities (aOR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.38–1.61), poor fetal growth (aOR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.19–1.34), and fetal distress (aOR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.10–1.18). Maternal death during hospitalizations (aOR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.30–3.31) and excessive fetal growth (aOR = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.98–1.14) were not statistically significantly associated with psychosis.

Conclusions

Pregnant women with psychosis have elevated risk of several adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Efforts to identify and manage pregnancies complicated by psychosis may contribute to improved outcomes.

### Sleep loss and postpartum psychosis [^2d179e02]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Postpartum psychosis is a rare but severe psychiatric disorder. Its diagnostic status remains controversial, but several studies have shown that the majority of patients who develop psychosis immediately following childbirth suffer from bipolar disorder. The pathophysiology of postpartum psychosis is poorly understood, but factors such as primiparity, difficult labor, genetic predisposition, and hormonal changes have been suggested as etiological factors. This paper reviews the literature on the relationship of sleep disruption and postpartum psychosis. It is argued that sleep loss resulting from the interaction of various putative causal factors may be the final common pathway in the development of psychosis in susceptible women. Clinical significance of these findings, including strategies to prevent postpartum psychosis, are discussed and suggestions are made for future research directions.

### Postpartum rage attacks in a female with bipolar II disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder: diagnostic and treatment challenges [^76b789d3]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Message

Dysfunctional anger in the form of rage attacks may accompany bipolar disorder and obsessive‐compulsive disorder in the postpartum period. Women presenting with postpartum depression should be routinely asked about comorbid psychiatric disorders and rage attacks. For these individuals, antidepressants should be avoided, and preference given to medications effective for the treatment of bipolar disorder.

### Reproductive outcomes and risk of subsequent illness in women diagnosed with postpartum psychosis [^4017c1a4]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Women who experience postpartum psychosis (PP) seek guidance on further pregnancies and risk of illness; however, empirical data are limited. This study describes reproductive and mental health outcomes in women diagnosed with PP and examines clinical risk factors as predictors of further illness.

Methods

A retrospective cohort design was used; 116 women who experienced episodes of mania or depression with psychotic features within six weeks of childbirth were recruited. All subjects underwent clinical diagnostic interviews and medical case notes were reviewed.

Results

Only 33% of women had an antecedent history, of which 34% had bipolar disorder and 55% unipolar depression. Only 58% of those with PP in their first pregnancy had a subsequent pregnancy, and 18% of marriages ended following the PP episode. Clinical presentation at the time of initial episode did not influence the timing of the onset of symptoms, treatment, or recovery. Although 86% of patients received treatment within 30 days of onset, 26% of women reported ongoing symptoms at a year after delivery. The recurrence rate of PP was 54.4%; a longer duration of the index episode (p < 0.05) and longer latency between the index PP and next pregnancy predicted a subsequent PP. The rate of subsequent non-puerperal episodes was 69%, and all these episodes were bipolar.

Conclusions

Postpartum psychosis is difficult to predict in women with no antecedent history and is associated with a high rate of subsequent puerperal and non-puerperal illness. Risk of further illness needs to be conveyed in order to allow fully informed decisions to be made regarding future pregnancies.

### Adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes complicated by psychosis among pregnant women in the United States [^dd3ec396]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Database

The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), is the largest publicly available all-payer (including Medicare, Medicaid, other non-federal payers, and patients who are uninsured) inpatient health care database in the United States. Approximately 1000 hospitals that represent all types of health facilities are selected for the NIS. Five hospital characteristics — geographic region, ownership, location, teaching status, and bed size — are used for stratification to create a representative sample of US hospitalizations. Before 2012, a 20% stratified random sample of hospitals within the stratum defined by the aforementioned five hospital characteristics was drawn by the AHRQ. All discharges from sampled hospitals were included. Beginning with 2012, the NIS was redesigned to improve national estimates, and within each stratum, a 20% stratified random sample of discharges from all HCUP-participating hospitals was drawn by the AHRQ. Discharge-level sampling weights based on the sampling scheme are available to obtain national estimates. Approximately seven million unweighted discharges and 35 million weighted discharges nationally are recorded each year. The NIS does not allow linkage of patient's records. This study is exempt from review by institutional review boards given the data are publicly available and do not contain personal identifiers. Our study conforms to the Data Use Agreement for the Nationwide Databases from the HCUP.

Study population

Our analysis included pregnant women aged 12–55 years who were hospitalized for delivery during 2007–2012. The identification of delivery hospitalizations was predicated upon delivery-related International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis and procedure codes and Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes (Additional file 1: Table S1).

Variable specification

Exposure

We used the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes from the same delivery hospitalization to identify psychosis diagnoses. We included women with any (primary or secondary) discharge diagnosis codes for psychosis in the following groups: schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM: 295.**); affective psychosis (ICD-9-CM: 296.**), and other psychoses (ICD-9-CM: 297.** - 298.**). In a validation study, the set of diagnosis codes has demonstrated adequate sensitivity (91%) and positive predictive value (91%).

### Genetic risk scores for major psychiatric disorders and the risk of postpartum psychiatric disorders [^51bcf139]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Unique concerns and characteristics of investigating genetic etiology of postpartum psychiatric disorders

We applied a broad case definition of postpartum psychiatric disorders, comprising a spectrum of psychiatric diagnoses identified by hospital diagnoses and psychotropic prescriptions and occurring within the first year after childbirth. Although more heterogeneous, we applied a broad definition to ensure we were capturing cases that may be missed in hospital registries, examine similarities and differences with other psychiatric disorders, overcome sample size limitations, and provide a comparable definition to other studies.

Prior studies suggest the etiology of psychiatric episodes occurring immediately after childbirth may differ from later psychiatric episodes, and future work will investigate potential underlying genetic differences as sample sizes grow. Although the first year postpartum may not identify a specific etiologic cut-point, it is a commonly used clinical definition of postpartum psychiatric disordersand enables detection of women that may delay seeking care. Additionally, in our prior work in a similar cohort, we compared associations of family psychiatric history and postpartum psychiatric disorders at three, six, and twelve months after childbirth and found few differences among the time points, indicating it is reasonable to assess genetic and familial predictors of postpartum psychiatric disorders within the first year after childbirth in this setting. Including the entire first year postpartum can also improve statistical power. Although our sample was selected from a large population-based cohort, sample sizes of women who had given birth were still relatively small.

### Diagnosis and treatment of postpartum obsessions and compulsions that involve infant harm [^778de55e]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the postpartum period often include intrusive thoughts of harming the infant and rituals that result in avoidance of the baby. The differential diagnosis of women who develop these symptoms includes postpartum major mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis with infanticidal thoughts. The treatment of the most common diagnoses, mood disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder, includes serotonergic drugs, psychoeducation to help the patient understand that she is highly unlikely to harm her infant, and exposure with response prevention therapy. This intervention involves exposure of the patient to the feared situations, which are usually related to infant care, while simultaneously preventing the compulsive rituals.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^83a2fc00]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Definitions for early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) and childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS) — EOS is defined as onset before 18 years of age, with onset before 13 years of age often described as COS. Diagnosis follows DSM-5 criteria requiring two or more characteristic symptoms for at least 1 month (or shorter if successfully treated), with hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech present during the active phase, and evidence of the disorder for at least 6 months; International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision criteria are similar except that the total duration of illness required is at least 1 month. DSM-5 differs from DSM-IV-TR in that delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech are required for diagnosis, and commenting and conversing hallucinations and bizarre delusions are no longer accorded special diagnostic status.

### Severe maternal morbidity and mental health hospitalizations or emergency department visits [^7a26ac50]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Study Population

Individuals aged 18 to 55 years with a first recorded liveborn or stillborn delivery with pregnancy lasting between 20 and 43 weeks' gestation were included. Individuals who delivered after 43 weeks' gestation and those younger than 18 or older than 55 years at delivery were excluded to optimize the accuracy of obstetric codes; individuals younger than 18 or older than 55 years were also excluded to account for unique mental health experience among pregnancies at extremes of age. As the interest was in new-onset mental health visits related to SMM, the primary analysis excluded individuals with a previous mental health hospitalization or ED visit within 2 years before the index birth, an approach that has been used previously. Duplicate delivery records, delivery records with missing identifiers, and individuals with ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage were also excluded. Therapeutic abortions and out-of-hospital deliveries were not available in the data source, but out-of-hospital deliveries account for less than 2% of deliveries in Canada.

Study Exposure

Exposure to SMM was captured between 20 weeks' gestation and 42 days after delivery hospital discharge in the first recorded hospital birth; individuals without SMM were considered unexposed. SMM was defined using the validated Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System definition, which included 1 or more of the following diagnoses: severe preeclampsia or eclampsia; severe hemorrhage; cardiac complications (cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, resuscitation, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, and heart failure); complications of anesthesia; surgical complications; cerebrovascular accidents; acute kidney failure; embolism, shock, or disseminated intravascular coagulation; severe sepsis; uterine rupture; acute fatty liver or liver failure; cerebral edema; and coma. SMM also included critical illness interventions: urgent hysterectomy, dialysis, assisted ventilation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (eTable 1 in Supplement 1); SMM indicators are not mutually exclusive. Chronic HIV and prevalent hypertensive heart disease were excluded from our definition of SMM, as our interest was in the study of acute conditions with onset during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Acute psychosis was excluded from the SMM definition as this was a component of the primary outcome.

Study Outcomes

The primary outcome was a composite of mental health hospitalizations or ED visits occurring 43 days or more after the index birth hospitalization, defined by a primary or secondary coded diagnosis in the DAD for mood or anxiety disorder, substance-related or addictive disorder, schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder, or suicidality or self-harm event(eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Secondary outcomes were individual components of the primary outcome.

Methods

This cross-sectional study used the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for reporting observational studies. Informed consent was waived because this study used publicly available, deidentified data, and the institutional review board at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai deemed the study exempt from review.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of all obstetric discharges from January 1, 2014, to November 15, 2016, and subsequent ED visits (through December 30, 2016) by the same patient in New York State by linking the State Inpatient Database to the State Emergency Department Database. Obstetric discharges were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) (January 1, 2014, through September 30, 2015) and ICD-10 (October 1, 2015, through December 31, 2016) diagnosis and procedure codes that have previously been validated for use in administrative data sets.

Perinatal suicide risk assessment — EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire 9) self-harm responses guide next steps: when a patient "Reports thoughts of self-harm and/or self-harm question on the EPDS/PHQ-9 (any response other than "never")", proceed to "Follow EPDS/PHQ-9 self-harm with Patient Safety Screener to further stratify risk" and "Ask about thoughts of self-harm or wanting to die". To assess suicide risk, the figure instructs to ask four questions and then categorize risk as low, moderate, or high. Low risk includes: "Fleeting thoughts of death or wanting to die", "No current intent", "No current plan", "No history of suicide attempt", "Future-oriented (discusses plans for the future)", "Protective factors (e.g., social support, religious prohibition, other children, stable housing)", "No substance use", and "Few risk factors". Moderate risk includes: "Regular thoughts of death or wanting to die", "Has thoughts of possible plans yet plans are not well-formulated or persistent", "History of suicide attempt", "Persistent sadness and tension… ", "Sometimes feels hopeless/helpless", "Somewhat future oriented", "Limited protective factors… ", " ± Substance use", "Anxiety/agitation/impulsivity", "Poor self-care", and "Some risk factors". High risk includes: "Persistent thoughts of death/that life is not worth living", "Current intent", "Current well-formulated plan", "History of multiple suicide attempts… ", "History of multiple or recent psychiatric hospitalizations", "Hopeless/helpless all or most of the time", "Not future oriented… ", "No protective factors… ", "Substance use", "Not receiving mental health treatment", "Anxiety/agitation", and "Many risk factors".

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^8aa613bc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnoses

The early presentation of PPP can be similar to that of other psychiatric disorders occurring in the puerperium. Postpartum blues can initially have a similar presentation to PPP with mood swings, insomnia and anxiety, but these symptoms usually self-resolve within a few days. Symptoms of PPP tend to worsen over time, usually rapidly. Postpartum depression may also have initial features in common with PPP. Early postpartum onset may be seen in postpartum depression, although it is not typical, which may differentiate from PPP.

Medical causes for psychosis in the postpartum period should be ruled out following an assessment of the patient's history, physical examination and investigations, including full blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid profile, urine drug screen, serum calcium levels, B12, folate and thiamine. Early symptoms of fluctuating confusion can be similar to symptoms of delirium. Infections such as mastitis or endometritis, delirium induced by eclampsia, metabolic or electrolyte abnormalities, and postpartum thyroiditis should be considered among the differential diagnoses. Sheehan syndrome, a disorder of hypopituitarism resulting from postpartum haemorrhage, can lead to cognitive slowing and should be ruled out.

Immune system-mediated factors have been implicated in the onset of PPP. In one study, 19% of women with first-onset PPP had concurrent autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. If suspected, autoimmune thyroid dysfunction should be ruled out with the assessment of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Autoimmune encephalitis was reported in 4% of women with PPP, 2% of which had anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis. Autoimmune encephalitis should be ruled out with the evaluation of serum anti-NMDA antibodies and neuroimaging, especially in the presence of concurrent neurological symptoms. A recent study also showed that women with PPP were more likely to have elevated C-reactive protein, an overall marker of systemic inflammation, compared to healthy postpartum women.

Medication or other drug-induced psychosis should also be considered in the organic aetiology of PPP and ruled out with a urine drug screen in all women affected. Evidence on brain structural and functional correlates of PPP remains scant, and there is no evidence to date to support the use of neuroimaging as a routine investigation in this disorder.

### Depression and anxiety in the postpartum period and risk of bipolar disorder: a Danish nationwide register-based cohort study [^d0bf24c6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The first-onset affective episode requiring inpatient treatment in the postpartum period can be a marker of bipolar disorder, but it is unknown whether milder postpartum affective episodes are also indicators of underlying bipolarity. Therefore, we aimed to study whether women with a nonpsychotic postpartum affective episode treated with antidepressants have an increased risk of bipolar disorder.

Methods

A register-based cohort study was conducted in Denmark of 122,622 parous women without psychiatric history who received a first-time antidepressant prescription during 1997–2012. We compared women with a first-time antidepressant prescription, which was our indicator of a first-onset affective disorder, within 1 year postpartum to women with a first-time antidepressant prescription outside the postpartum period. Our outcome was psychiatric contact for bipolar disorder (ICD-10 criteria) during follow-up, and we estimated hazard ratios using Cox regressions.

Results

The risk of bipolar disorder among women with a postpartum affective episode was higher than that in women with an affective episode outside the postpartum period. The risk of bipolar disorder was 1.66 (95% CI, 1.12–2.48) for postpartum antidepressant monotherapy and 10.15 (95% CI, 7.13–14.46) for postpartum antidepressant therapy plus a subsequent prescription for anxiolytics when these therapies were compared to antidepressant monotherapy outside the postpartum period.

Conclusions

First-onset nonpsychotic postpartum affective disorder can be a marker of underlying bipolarity. Women who fill an antidepressant prescription following childbirth should be asked about hypomanic or manic symptoms and monitored long term. Clinically, when antidepressant monotherapy is ineffective or the individual woman experiences persistent and concerning symptoms, health professionals should consider a possible bipolar spectrum disorder.

### Investigating the association between metabolic syndrome conditions and perinatal mental illness: a national administrative claims study [^516a6cd4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Study design and population

We performed an observational study using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database (CDM) to follow women who delivered between January 1st, 2014 - December 31st, 2019. There were 781,677 pregnancies recorded in CDM from 2014 to 2019. Of those, there were 303,703 women and 372,895 deliveries that complied with our inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in our study. Majority of our sample included women with one delivery (n = 239,090, 78.72%). 19.83% of women in our sample had two deliveries and 1.45% women had 3 or more deliveries. The study cohort was defined as women (14–54 years of age) who had a hospital admission for labor and delivery using the International Classification of Disease codes (ICD-9/10) and procedure codes (see Chhabria et al. for detailed codes) (Chhabria K, Sudhakar S, Refuerzo J, Ganduglia Cazaban C: Risk of postpartum psychosis in women with obstetric complications: a population cohort based registry study. Forthcoming). Only those women with continuous enrollment one-year prior to and 1-year postpartum, with no more than 90 days of an enrollment gap, were included in the study. There were no exclusion criteria for this study. CDM is derived from a database of administrative health claims for members of large commercial and Medicare Advantage health plans. CDM utilizes medical and pharmacy claims to derive patient-level enrollment information, health care costs, and resource utilization information. The population is geographically diverse, spanning all 50 states and is statistically de-identified under the Expert Determination method consistent with HIPAA and managed according to Optum® customer data use agreements 1,2. CDM administrative claims submitted for payment by providers and pharmacies are verified, adjudicated and de-identified prior to inclusion. This dataset was accessed through the University of Texas (UTHSC-H) School of Public Health Center for Health Care Data (CHCD). The study was reviewed and approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston institution's review board (protocol number HSC-SPH-20-0073). The need for written informed consent was waived by the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston ethics committee due to the retrospective nature of the study. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

### Risk factors associated with peripartum suicide attempts in Japan [^1ad8da72]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Psychiatric Outcomes

The psychiatric outcomes included (1) admission with prepartum suicide attempt and delivery during the same hospital stay, (2) readmission to the same hospital of delivery for depression within 1 year post partum, and (3) readmission to the same hospital of delivery for suicide attempt within 1 year post partum. Information on suicide attempts was based on the hospitalization summary on admission. Information on suicide attempts was registered when a suicide attempt was confirmed as a trigger for hospitalization by the patients themselves, their family members or acquaintances, or attending paramedics. Based on the current ICD-10, postpartum depression can be incorporated into 1 of the following disease classifications: major depressive episode (ICD-10 code F32); recurrent depressive disorder (ICD-10 code F33); or mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium, or not elsewhere classified (ICD-10 code F53). To distinguish self-remitting postpartum emotional instability from postpartum depression, patients given the ICD-10 code F53 within the first week post partum were not considered to have postpartum depression. Furthermore, women with manic episode (ICD-10 code F30) or bipolar affective disorder (ICD-10 code F31) after childbirth were not regarded as having postpartum depression. Based on the current general agreement for the latest period to diagnose postpartum depression at approximately 12 months post partum, all episodes of readmission with depression or suicide attempt to the same hospital of delivery within 1 year post partum were considered as eligible outcomes.
