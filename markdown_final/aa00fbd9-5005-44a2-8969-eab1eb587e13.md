## Question

Common GI issues seen in clinic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to identify the most common GI issues seen in clinic, rank them by prevalence and clinical volume, and synthesize a triage and management framework that distinguishes functional from organic disease with alarm features and special populations in mind. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the population-level symptom burden to anchor what presents most frequently. Then, I should verify how these symptoms map to diagnoses, especially disorders of gut–brain interaction versus organic conditions. Next, I will outline how to distinguish functional from organic pathology using alarm features and minimal initial testing. After that, I'll rank conditions into tiers by frequency and acuity. Finally, I will consider special populations and close with practical, guideline-based management and referral principles.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic foundation so I don't over- or under-weight entities. The National GI Survey of 71,812 U.S. adults found that 61% had at least one GI symptom in the prior week; heartburn/reflux was most common (30.9%), followed by abdominal pain (24.8%), bloating (20.6%), diarrhea (20.2%), and constipation (19.7%), with less frequent but important symptoms like nausea/vomiting (9.5%), dysphagia (5.8%), and bowel incontinence (4.8%) anchoring what we actually see in clinic day-to-day [^115Le8R3].

> Hold on, I should verify how symptoms translate into diagnoses rather than assuming one-to-one mapping. Disorders of gut–brain interaction (DGBI) collectively affect a large proportion of the population, with global DGBI burden exceeding 40% and IBS prevalence near 4% using Rome IV, while functional constipation and functional diarrhea affect roughly 8% and 4–5%, respectively; this helps explain why abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits dominate primary care and GI clinics [^1132vca7] [^1139MaGE]. But wait, I need to ensure I don't conflate symptom prevalence with diagnostic prevalence; for example, constipation symptoms in surveys approach 20% weekly, whereas Rome IV functional constipation sits closer to 8%, so I should keep the distinction between symptom burden and case definitions clear when ranking conditions [^115Le8R3] [^1132vca7].

> Next, I should review how we distinguish functional from organic disease without overtesting. In primary care, a positive, symptom-based diagnosis of IBS using NICE-style criteria is recommended when alarm features are absent, reserving limited testing to exclude organic conditions; specialist referral is appropriate for diagnostic doubt, severe symptoms, or first-line treatment failure, reflecting BSG guidance for IBS and dyspepsia pathways [^1112SjBy] [^115ANtHt] [^112td9iD]. I need to check that my alarm features list is consistent: weight loss, GI bleeding, iron-deficiency anemia, nocturnal symptoms, dysphagia/odynophagia, age thresholds, persistent vomiting, and family history of GI cancer are the recurrent triggers to escalate evaluation, aligning with BSG and AAFP recommendations [^114jSGAh] [^117DbeBg].

> I will now examine organic conditions that frequently present. GERD remains the most common organic GI disorder across settings, and guidelines support a presumptive clinical diagnosis with typical symptoms and an initial PPI trial, escalating to endoscopy or physiologic testing when alarm features or refractory symptoms arise; Lyon 2.0 further refines objective criteria for "actionable GERD", including recognition of Los Angeles grade B esophagitis as conclusive evidence [^115p31Sp] [^111scUUW] [^1173WF74]. Wait, let me verify I'm not overstating diagnostic certainty based on symptoms alone; unproven GERD should undergo pH monitoring off therapy if testing is needed, whereas proven GERD with persistent symptoms benefits from pH-impedance on therapy to classify refractory phenotypes per the consensus update [^1173WF74] [^112vBmKr].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent investigation. Dysphagia is a red flag that warrants prompt upper endoscopy to rule out obstruction or mucosal disease, while persistent or severe lower GI bleeding follows ACG algorithms emphasizing rapid triage, resuscitation, and localization procedures; age-based thresholds for endoscopy apply in dyspepsia, with ≥ 60 years or any alarm symptoms prompting upper endoscopy for cancer exclusion in primary care and family medicine guidance [^115yiHSc] [^1175KzQd] [^117DbeBg].

> Let me synthesize a tiered clinical ranking, but I need to double-check I'm not mixing symptom prevalence with diagnostic labels. Tier 1 (seen daily in primary care by prevalence/volume): GERD given its leading symptom burden and high clinical throughput; IBS because even at ~4% prevalence it drives disproportionate visits; functional dyspepsia, which I initially recalled as ~5% of primary care visits — wait, that figure stems from older data and varies by setting, so I will anchor with recent BSG guidance noting frequent presentation and structured referral criteria while acknowledging the JAMA estimate carefully; functional constipation and chronic diarrhea track with high symptom prevalence but lower Rome IV diagnostic rates, still translating into heavy clinical volume [^115p31Sp] [^1132vca7] [^112td9iD] [^111fULgg] [^115Le8R3] [^112td9iD]. Tier 2 (frequent but higher acuity/specialist care): peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori dyspepsia, dysphagia requiring endoscopy, lower GI bleeding per ACG pathways, and IBD which, though less prevalent, carries major morbidity and resource use as reflected by symptom severity differentials versus IBS in PROMIS cohorts [^117DbeBg] [^115yiHSc] [^1175KzQd] [^111sQXZp]. Tier 3 (emerging/high-impact populations and entities): post-cancer therapy GI complications, post-bariatric surgery complications, celiac disease and eosinophilic GI diseases that require a high index of suspicion and timely referral given diagnostic delays and fibrostenotic risk in EoE [^111FEj6J] [^113DGeDi] [^1145tUBY].

> I should account for special populations that skew presentations and require tailored pathways. Cancer survivors frequently experience chronic diarrhea, bloating, bile acid malabsorption, SIBO, and malabsorption after chemo-radiation or surgery, and updated BSG practice guidance emphasizes structured assessment, multidisciplinary care, and high rates of under-referral that we should correct in our systems [^111FEj6J] [^113EoTKe]. Let me not overlook other groups: post-bariatric patients encounter strictures, marginal ulcers, and nutritional issues that often demand endoscopic management expertise, while patients with HIV may present with varied GI manifestations influenced by immune status and ART effects [^113DGeDi] [^1165xoSa]. COVID-19 adds a layer of acute and post-acute GI symptomatology that intersects with preexisting GI conditions and service delivery constraints [^1155utTe].

> Next, I should review diagnostic and management principles for functional disorders so I do not default to exhaustive testing. A positive clinical diagnosis using NICE-style criteria for IBS in primary care with limited testing and patient education is recommended, reserving Rome IV for research or subspecialty contexts; referral is appropriate for diagnostic uncertainty, severe symptomatology, or refractory cases, consistent with BSG IBS and dyspepsia guidance [^1112SjBy] [^115ANtHt] [^112td9iD]. Let me consider augmenting care delivery: digital health tools for symptom tracking, biofeedback, and remote support can improve longitudinal management of DGBI, complementing dietary, psychological, and pharmacologic strategies within a biopsychosocial model [^1175kgvM] [^1139MaGE].

> For organic diseases, I need to ensure first-line strategies are evidence-based and escalation pathways are clear. For typical GERD, an initial PPI trial with lifestyle measures is appropriate, with endoscopy or reflux testing for alarm features or treatment failure per ACG and Lyon 2.0 frameworks; I should double-check we employ objective testing when diagnosis remains uncertain or surgery is contemplated [^115p31Sp] [^111scUUW] [^1173WF74]. Chronic diarrhea warrants a structured workup guided by alarm features and differential (infection, IBD, malabsorption), using targeted stool, blood tests, and endoscopy as needed rather than indiscriminate panels, aligning with evidence-based algorithms [^113uFvCT]. Acute lower GI bleeding requires simultaneous hemodynamic assessment and etiologic triage per guideline, with urgent colonoscopic or radiologic management as indicated [^1175KzQd].

> But wait, what if symptom overlap muddies the waters. GERD and functional dyspepsia often co-occur, and distinguishing them can be challenging; focusing on response to acid suppression, endoscopic findings, and physiologic testing helps, while avoiding over-attribution to a single label when overlapping DGBI are present [^115xv1CR]. I should also keep in mind entities like eosinophilic GI diseases that are underrecognized and delayed in diagnosis, particularly in underserved populations, prompting a lower threshold for endoscopy with biopsies when clinical suspicion persists despite empiric therapy [^1145tUBY].

> In summary, the most common GI issues seen in clinic, by prevalence and clinical volume, are GERD, IBS, functional dyspepsia, functional constipation, and chronic diarrhea, with higher-acuity frequent conditions including peptic ulcer disease/H. pylori, dysphagia, lower GI bleeding, and IBD; accurate triage hinges on alarm features, a positive diagnosis for functional disorders in the absence of red flags, guideline-directed empiric therapy, and timely referral for severe, refractory, or diagnostically uncertain cases, while recognizing special populations such as cancer survivors and post-bariatric patients who need tailored pathways and multidisciplinary care [^115p31Sp] [^1132vca7] [^112td9iD] [^113uFvCT] [^115yiHSc] [^111FEj6J] [^113DGeDi] [^115ANtHt] [^115Le8R3].

Common GI issues seen in clinic include GERD [^115p31Sp], IBS [^1132vca7], functional dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, with **GERD and IBS** being the most prevalent. GERD is diagnosed by typical symptoms [^111scUUW] and managed with lifestyle changes and PPIs; IBS is diagnosed using Rome IV criteria [^1132vca7] and managed with diet, medications, and psychological therapies [^115ANtHt]. Functional dyspepsia is managed with PPIs, H. pylori testing, and dietary changes; constipation and diarrhea are managed with dietary changes, medications, and treating underlying causes [^113uFvCT]. Alarm symptoms [^112td9iD] require **further evaluation** [^117DbeBg] and referral to gastroenterology [^115ANtHt].

## Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

- **Prevalence**: GERD is one of the most common GI conditions, affecting approximately 20% of adults in Western countries.

- **Clinical presentation**: Typical symptoms include heartburn, regurgitation [^115p31Sp], and chest discomfort. Extraesophageal manifestations such as chronic cough, laryngitis, and asthma-like symptoms are also common [^111scUUW].

- **Diagnosis**: GERD is primarily diagnosed based on typical symptoms [^111scUUW]. Endoscopy is reserved for patients with alarm symptoms (dysphagia, weight loss, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding) [^1173WF74] or those refractory to initial therapy [^115p31Sp].

- **Management**: Lifestyle modifications (weight loss, dietary changes, head-of-bed elevation), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and H2 receptor antagonists are first-line treatments [^115p31Sp]. Surgical or endoscopic interventions are considered for refractory cases [^114st9zL].

---

## Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

- **Prevalence**: IBS affects approximately 4–5% of the global population [^1132vca7], with higher prevalence in women and younger adults.

- **Clinical presentation**: IBS is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea, or mixed) [^1132vca7], bloating, and distension.

- **Diagnosis**: IBS is diagnosed using the Rome IV criteria [^1132vca7], which require recurrent abdominal pain at least one day per week in the last three months, associated with two or more of the following: related to defecation, change in stool frequency, or change in stool form.

- **Management**: Dietary modifications (low FODMAP diet), pharmacological treatments (antispasmodics, laxatives, antidiarrheals, neuromodulators), and psychological therapies (cognitive-behavioral therapy, gut-directed hypnotherapy) are effective management strategies [^115ANtHt].

---

## Functional dyspepsia

Functional dyspepsia is **highly prevalent** [^111fULgg], accounting for approximately 5% of primary care visits. Symptoms include epigastric pain, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and nausea. Diagnosis is a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring a normal upper endoscopy and absence of alarm symptoms. Management includes PPIs, testing for H. pylori with eradication if positive, dietary modifications, and psychological therapies.

---

## Constipation

Constipation is a **common complaint**, affecting approximately 20% of the population [^115Le8R3]. Symptoms include infrequent bowel movements, hard stools, straining, and a sense of incomplete evacuation. Diagnosis is usually clinical, based on history, physical examination, and limited laboratory testing, with further investigation warranted if alarm symptoms such as weight loss, anemia, or rectal bleeding are present. First-line management consists of dietary fiber supplementation, laxatives, and lifestyle modifications. Biofeedback therapy is effective for pelvic floor dysfunction.

---

## Diarrhea

Chronic diarrhea affects **approximately 5% of the population** [^113uFvCT]. Clinical features include increased stool frequency, urgency, and loose stools. Initial evaluation includes history, physical examination, and limited laboratory testing, with stool studies and colonoscopy indicated when alarm symptoms are present [^113uFvCT]. Management includes dietary modifications, antidiarrheal medications, and treatment of underlying causes.

---

## Abdominal pain

Abdominal pain is a common reason for clinic visits, often associated with **functional gastrointestinal disorders** [^1139MaGE]. Patients typically report recurrent or chronic pain accompanied by bloating, nausea, or altered bowel habits. Diagnosis relies on detailed history, physical examination, and limited laboratory testing, with further investigation indicated when alarm symptoms are present [^114HA7ey]. Management is symptom-based, including dietary modifications and psychological therapies.

---

## Alarm symptoms and referral criteria

Alarm symptoms requiring further **evaluation and referral** to gastroenterology include [^112td9iD]:

- Dysphagia [^115yiHSc]
- Weight loss [^117DbeBg]
- Anemia
- Gastrointestinal bleeding [^1175KzQd]
- Persistent vomiting [^114jSGAh]
- Family history of GI malignancy
- Refractory symptoms despite initial therapy [^115ANtHt]

### Perceptions and practices of primary care providers in Europe and the US in the diagnosis and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A multinational survey [^1132vca7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), formerly known as a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID), characterized by abdominal pain associated with a change in defecation or bowel habits. Typical symptoms include constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal bloating or distention. The Rome IV diagnostic criteria specify that symptom onset should occur at least six months prior to diagnosis, and symptoms should meet the diagnostic criteria during the last three months.

A large-scale multinational internet study found that over 40% of people worldwide suffer from a DGBI, which negatively impacts their quality of life (QOL) and increases healthcare costs and utilization. The global prevalence of IBS based on Rome IV criteria is estimated at 4.1%, affecting individuals of all ages and ethnicities and is more common in women and younger adults. The prevalence of census-adjusted Rome IV DGBI is similar in the United States (US), Canada, and the United Kingdom (UK), with estimates for IBS ranging from 4.4% to 4.8%. Other prevalence estimates include 7.9%–8.6% for functional constipation, 3.6%–5.3% for functional diarrhea, 2.0%–3.9% for functional bloating or distention, 1.1%–1.9% for opioid-induced constipation, 7.5%–10.0% for unspecified DGBI, and 28.6%–31.7% for any Rome IV DGBI.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115p31Sp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to be among the most common diseases seen by gastroenterologists, surgeons, and primary care physicians. Our understanding of the varied presentations of GERD, enhancements in diagnostic testing, and approach to patient management have evolved. During this time, scrutiny of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has increased considerably. Although PPIs remain the medical treatment of choice for GERD, multiple publications have raised questions about adverse events, raising doubts about the safety of long-term use and increasing concern about overprescribing of PPIs. New data regarding the potential for surgical and endoscopic interventions have emerged.

In this new document, we provide updated, evidence-based recommendations and practical guidance for the evaluation and management of GERD, including pharmacologic, lifestyle, surgical, and endoscopic management. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to evaluate the evidence and the strength of recommendations. Key concepts and suggestions that, as of this writing, do not have sufficient evidence to grade are also provided.

Regarding the medical management of functional dyspepsia, particularly in the context of care settings, the BSG 2022 guidelines recommend referring patients with functional dyspepsia to gastroenterology in secondary care under the following circumstances:

- **Diagnostic doubt**: Direct referral to a specialist when the diagnosis is uncertain.
- **Severe symptoms**: Severe symptomology that warrants specialized intervention.
- **Symptoms refractory to first-line treatments**: When symptoms do not respond to initial treatment options.
- **Individual patient requesting a specialist opinion**: Patients specifically requesting an evaluation by a specialist.

### Chronic diarrhea: Diagnosis and management [^113uFvCT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; four weeks is a frequently used cutoff.

Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected based on history alone.

Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or when the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more tailored management strategies.

### Oesophageal dysphagia: A stepwise approach to diagnosis and management [^115yiHSc]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom in the general population, with incidence varying depending on the specific definition used. A good medical history is vital for distinguishing true oesophageal dysphagia from oropharyngeal dysphagia or other causes. Oesophageal dysphagia is considered a red flag alarm symptom that requires oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, even after investigations including oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (with biopsy), barium swallow, and oesophageal manometry, no obstructive cause may be found. This review suggests an algorithm of history-taking and investigation to identify the causes of non-obstructive dysphagia, including functional dysphagia. The review then discusses management strategies and outcomes for functional dysphagia.

### Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or not, and in whom [^112PKYUy]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Despite progress in knowledge and effective therapies for acid-sensitive problems, the indications for gastroscopy seem even more confusing than before. The primary care physician, faced with the patient with undifferentiated symptoms, is now less sure when to seek an endoscopy, which is actively discouraged in many healthcare settings. Management guidelines, based essentially on maximizing the yield from endoscopy, may define the direction of travel but do not sit comfortably in the consultation setting.

### Identifying and assessing benefit-risk in primary care — a family physician's perspective [^114pf772]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage related to NSAID use is often occult. Thus, treating physicians and patients cannot be reassured by the lack of abdominal symptoms. Although bleeding may be acute and catastrophic, it is more likely to be indolent and subtle, often resulting in a picture of iron deficiency anaemia. Furthermore, the onset of bleeding from NSAID-related GI damage can occur with even short-duration therapy. Both of these factors are clinically relevant — patients are still at risk despite short course NSAID therapy, with no overt GI symptoms. GI risk assessment should be independent of the duration of therapy or assumed tolerance.

The introduction of the selective Cox-2 inhibitors marked an important breakthrough in patient safety. This class of medications was found to be associated with less GI toxicity but similar efficacy to traditional NSAIDs (tNSAIDs). The use of this new class of medications became widespread, with early guidelines urging their use as first-line for patients who were at high risk of GI complications from tNSAIDs.

### Working together across international boundaries: Improving the primary-secondary care network [^116piXVH]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Much of the discussion in the international dyspepsia healthcare community has focused on the practicality of applying clinical guidelines and whether the division between primary care and certain aspects of secondary care can be adequately reconciled. This article reviews some of the recent concepts in dyspepsia management that have touched on primary care and examines the barriers to the worldwide implementation of these guidelines. Closer collaboration between gastroenterologists and general practitioners depends on overcoming these barriers and adapting guidelines to suit local circumstances, which differ across Europe with regard to economic, health service, and clinical factors.

### British Society of Gastroenterology practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and complications as a result of treatment for cancer [^111FEj6J]. Gut (2025). High credibility.

The last BSG practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer was published in 2012. This update was commissioned by the BSG. The development of this guidance adhered to the principles of the BMJ AGREE II reporting guidelines. This document covers a very broad spectrum of topics. There is significant heterogeneity regarding the level of evidence available for the different sections.

The authors were assigned to six working groups covering each topic and performed a structured literature search. Most of the recommendations are based on retrospective cohort studies, case series, clinical experience, and often expert consensus. Therefore, we did not attempt to list the totality of evidence or grade the level of evidence for each statement but, where relevant, provide an overview of the key literature. Clinical practice guidance statements relevant to each clinical domain were defined and subsequently voted on by all contributing authors using 'agree', 'disagree', or 'abstain' options. Statements were discussed individually and refined where there was disagreement, with two further rounds of voting taking place. Clinical practice guidance statements were included only if they reached 90% or more agreement (excluding abstentions).

- **Patient perspectives**: All patients should be informed about possible future side effects and how to access appropriate help at the end of their cancer treatment using a personalized care and support plan.

### The trials and tribulations of drug development for functional gastrointestinal disorders [^1138AoxR]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2008). Low credibility.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are common conditions seen in primary care and specialty practices, yet many affected individuals report a lack of satisfaction with available treatments. Despite the unmet need for more effective pharmacotherapy, drug development for these conditions can be challenging on many levels. This review discusses the rationale and challenges of drug development for FGID.

- **Reasons for development**: The conditions are highly prevalent, associated with significant economic and healthcare burdens, and there is a notable lack of satisfaction with current therapies.

- **Challenges in development**:
	- Lack of perception that FGID are legitimate disorders
	- Multidimensional and complex pathophysiology of FGID
	- Absence of a biological marker for diagnosis and treatment response
	- Heterogeneity of the patient population
	- Lack of consensus regarding the best outcome measures for clinical trials
	- Perceived increased risk-benefit ratio associated with drugs for FGID

Ongoing efforts aim to enhance the understanding of pathophysiology, illness severity, patient-reported outcome measures, and benefit-risk assessment. Improving education and communication among patients, clinicians, investigators, industry, and regulatory agencies is recommended, which will hopefully help optimize drug development strategies for FGID.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is necessary to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

### Higher prevalence of obesity among children with functional abdominal pain disorders [^111bAG2r]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are very common clinical conditions encountered in day-to-day clinical pediatric gastroenterology practice. Increased knowledge of the pathophysiology of FGID in the last decade has led to the design of a biopsychosocial model where genetic, physiological, and psychological factors interact. The diagnosis of FGID is clinical and based on the Rome diagnostic criteria, which have evolved over the last decades to form the newest set, the Rome IV criteria, issued in 2016. Several epidemiological studies using the Rome III and Rome IV criteria demonstrated that FGID related to abdominal pain are highly prevalent. According to the Rome IV criteria, the term "abdominal pain related functional gastrointestinal disorders" has been changed to "functional abdominal pain disorders", and it includes functional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), abdominal migraine, and functional abdominal pain not otherwise specified (functional abdominal pain NOS).

Childhood obesity is a serious and urgent public health problem associated with physical and psychological comorbidities. The bidirectional association between obesity and FGID has been described in previous studies. However, some of them are limited by a lack of control groups or outdated diagnostic criteria, and none of them was based on Rome IV criteria. The primary aim of this study was to define the association between obesity and functional abdominal pain (FAP) disorders in children according to the Rome IV criteria compared with a population control.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: Questions and answers for effective care [^117RzWTx]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions related to specific biologic and cellular abnormalities that are not fully understood. Psychological factors do not cause IBS, but many people with IBS also experience anxiety or depressed mood, have a history of adverse life events, or face psychosocial stressors. Physicians must understand the fears and expectations of patients and how they think about their symptoms, and should also respond empathetically to psychosocial cues. Anxiety related to the unpredictability of symptoms may have a greater effect on quality of life than the symptoms themselves.

Patients in generally good health who have ongoing or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormal stool patterns most likely have IBS or another functional gastrointestinal disorder. Patients who meet symptom-based criteria and have no alarm features may be confidently diagnosed with few, if any, additional tests. Patients may not completely understand the diagnostic process; asking about expectations and carefully explaining the goals and limitations of testing leads to more effective care.

There is no definitive treatment for IBS, and recommended treatments focus on symptom relief and improved quality of life. Trusting patient-physician interactions are essential to help patients understand and accept an IBS diagnosis and to actively engage in effective self-management.

### British society of gastroenterology practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and complications as a result of treatment for cancer [^112Msck2]. Gut (2025). Low credibility.

Survival rates following a diagnosis of cancer are improving. Poorly managed gastrointestinal (GI) side effects can interfere with the delivery of curative cancer treatment. Long-term physical side effects of cancer therapy impinge on the quality of life in up to 25% of those treated for cancer, and GI side effects are the most common and troublesome.

The aim of this guidance is to provide comprehensive, practical recommendations on the management of acute and chronic luminal gastrointestinal symptoms arising during and after treatment for cancer. A multidisciplinary expert group, including patients treated for cancer, was divided into working parties to identify and synthesize recommendations for the optimal assessment, diagnosis, and appropriate interventions for luminal GI side effects of systemic and local cancer therapies. Recommendations were developed using the principles of the BMJ AGREE II reporting.

A total of 103 recommendations were agreed upon. The importance of the patient perspective and what can be done to support patients are emphasized. Key physiological principles underlying the development of GI toxicity arising from cancer therapy are outlined. Individual symptoms or symptom clusters are poor at distinguishing the underlying cause(s), and investigations are required if empirical therapy does not lead rapidly to significant benefits. Patients frequently have multiple GI causes for symptoms; all need to be diagnosed and optimally treated to achieve resolution. Investigations and management approaches now known to be ineffective or of questionable benefit are highlighted.

### Burden of gastrointestinal symptoms in the United States: Results of a nationally representative survey of over 71,000 Americans [^115Le8R3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Digestive diseases account for over 100 million ambulatory care visits annually in the U.S. However, comparatively less is known about the true burden of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in the general U.S. population. The aim of this study was to use data from the "National GI Survey" — a population-based audit of GI symptoms in over 71,000 participants — to determine the prevalence and predictors of GI symptoms in community-dwelling Americans.

We conducted the National GI Survey using a mobile app called MyGiHealth, which employs a computer algorithm that systematically collects participants' GI symptoms. A nationally representative sample of Americans was recruited to complete the survey, which guided respondents through National Institutes of Health (NIH) GI Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) scales along with questions about relevant comorbidities and demographics. We measured the prevalence of GI symptoms in the past week and employed logistic regression to adjust for confounding factors.

Overall, 71,812 individuals completed the survey, of which 61% reported having had at least one GI symptom in the past week. The most commonly reported symptoms were heartburn/reflux (30.9%), abdominal pain (24.8%), bloating (20.6%), diarrhea (20.2%), and constipation (19.7%). Less common symptoms included nausea/vomiting (9.5%), dysphagia (5.8%), and bowel incontinence (4.8%). Females, non-Hispanic whites, and individuals who were younger, highly educated, and had medical comorbidities were more likely to report symptoms (all adjusted p < 0.05).

### Complications of bariatric surgery: What you can expect to see in your GI practice [^113DGeDi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Obesity is one of the most significant health problems worldwide. Bariatric surgery has become one of the fastest growing operative procedures and has gained acceptance as the leading option for weight loss. Despite improvements in the performance of bariatric surgical procedures, complications are not uncommon. There are a number of unique complications that arise in this patient population and require specific knowledge for proper management. Furthermore, conditions unrelated to the altered anatomy typically require a different management strategy.

As such, a basic understanding of surgical anatomy, potential complications, and endoscopic tools and techniques for optimal management is essential for the practicing gastroenterologist. Gastroenterologists should be familiar with these procedures and complication management strategies. This review will cover these topics and focus on major complications that gastroenterologists will be most likely to see in their practice.

### An update on common gastrointestinal emergencies [^114dbjsA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain often poses a diagnostic challenge due to the wide range of diagnoses. Surgical emergencies need to be rapidly identified and managed appropriately to minimize morbidity and mortality. Presenting symptoms, clinical examination, and laboratory findings can guide the selection of diagnostic imaging. This article reviews common surgical causes of abdominal pain in children.

### Complications of upper GI endoscopy [^117BmMh1]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

This document is part of a series discussing the utilization of gastrointestinal endoscopy in common clinical situations. The Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy prepared it. In the development of this guideline, a MEDLINE literature search was conducted, supplemented by references from the bibliographies of identified articles and recommendations from expert consultants. When well-designed prospective trials were lacking, emphasis was placed on the results from large series and reports by recognized experts. Guidelines for the appropriate utilization of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus. Further controlled clinical studies are needed to clarify aspects of this statement, and revisions may be necessary as new data appear. Clinical considerations may justify actions that differ from these recommendations.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^1173WF74]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

The Lyon Consensus provides conclusive criteria for and against the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and adjunctive metrics that consolidate or refute GERD diagnosis when primary criteria are borderline or inconclusive. An international core and working group was assembled to evaluate research since publication of the original Lyon Consensus, and to vote on statements collaboratively developed to update criteria. The Lyon Consensus 2.0 provides a modern definition of actionable GERD, where evidence from oesophageal testing supports revising, escalating, or personalising GERD management for the symptomatic patient.

- **Symptoms and likelihood**: Symptoms with a high versus low likelihood of relationship to reflux episodes are described.

- **Diagnostic strategies**: Unproven versus proven GERD defines diagnostic strategies and testing options. Patients with no prior GERD evidence (unproven GERD) are studied using prolonged wireless pH monitoring or catheter-based pH monitoring off antisecretory medication. In contrast, patients with conclusive GERD evidence (proven GERD) and persisting symptoms are evaluated using pH-impedance monitoring while on optimised antisecretory therapy.

- **Major changes**: The major changes from the original Lyon Consensus criteria include the establishment of Los Angeles grade B oesophagitis as conclusive GERD evidence, description of metrics and thresholds to be used with prolonged wireless pH monitoring, and inclusion of parameters useful in the diagnosis of refractory GERD when testing is performed on antisecretory therapy in proven GERD.

Criteria that have not performed well in the diagnosis of actionable GERD have been reconsidered to ensure accurate and effective patient care.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^116qok39]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

A proposed algorithm for the optimal diagnosis and management of functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) by physicians — considered by the expert panel to be appropriate for use in primary care — is presented in Figure 2. This algorithm is based on the definition of FACP and the management considerations outlined in the preceding sections. The starting point for the diagnosis is the core symptomatic manifestation of FACP: pain with cramping characteristics, which is generally considered to arise from primary gastrointestinal dysfunction.

To establish the diagnosis of FACP, the critical first step is the exclusion of a structural organic cause. This can be achieved through the recognition of alarm signals ("red flags") related to other symptoms experienced and/or the patient's family history of disease, and by considering the results of appropriate investigations conducted as indicated by such signals. The algorithm considers the likelihood of an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis in cases where FACP symptoms are associated with bowel habit alterations, thus emphasizing the distinction between IBS (as defined by the Rome IV criteria) and the definition of FACP proposed here. The algorithm also seeks to rule out abdominal pain of gynecologic or cardiac origin.

For first-line treatment, antispasmodics are recommended for patients whose symptoms fulfill the consensus definition of FACP and who lack signals of a potential differential diagnosis or other avoidable explanatory factors. Additional treatment options are suggested for patients who fail to achieve satisfactory symptom alleviation.

### Construct validity of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System gastrointestinal symptom scales in systemic sclerosis [^111aLTzR]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement is common in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) GI symptom item bank captures upper and lower GI symptoms, including reflux, disrupted swallowing, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, gas/bloating/flatulence, diarrhea, constipation, and fecal incontinence. The objective of this study was to evaluate the construct validity of the PROMIS GI bank in SSc.

A total of 167 patients with SSc were administered the PROMIS GI bank and the University of California, Los Angeles, Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium Gastrointestinal Scale (GIT 2.0) instrument. The GIT 2.0 is a multi-item instrument that measures SSc-associated GI symptoms. Product-moment correlations and a multitrait-multimethod analysis of the PROMIS GI scales with the GIT 2.0 symptom scales were used to evaluate convergent and discriminant validity.

Patients with SSc GI involvement had PROMIS GI scale scores 0.2–0.7 standard deviations worse than the US general population. Correlations among scales measuring the same domains for the PROMIS GI and GIT 2.0 measures were large, ranging from 0.61 to 0.87, with an average r = 0.77. The average correlation between different symptom scales was 0.22, supporting discriminant validity.

This study provides support for the construct validity of the PROMIS GI scales in SSc. Future research is needed to assess the responsiveness to change of these scales in patients with SSc.

### Rare, overlooked, or underappreciated causes of recurrent abdominal pain: A primer for gastroenterologists [^1119movR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Recurrent abdominal pain is a common reason for repeated visits to outpatient clinics and emergency departments, reflecting a substantial unmet need for timely and accurate diagnosis. A lack of awareness of some of the rarer causes of recurrent abdominal pain may impede diagnosis and delay effective management. This article identifies some of the key rare but diagnosable causes that are frequently missed by gastroenterologists and provides expert recommendations to support recognition, diagnosis, and management, with the ultimate aim of improving patient outcomes.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in individuals with ASDs: A consensus report [^117ELN9b]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are common and clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders. Gastrointestinal disorders and associated symptoms are frequently reported in individuals with ASDs; however, key issues such as the prevalence and optimal treatment of these conditions remain incompletely understood. A central difficulty in recognizing and characterizing gastrointestinal dysfunction in individuals with ASDs is the communication challenges faced by many affected individuals.

A multidisciplinary panel reviewed the medical literature with the aim of generating evidence-based recommendations for diagnostic evaluation and management of gastrointestinal problems in this patient population. The panel concluded that evidence-based recommendations are not yet available. The consensus expert opinion of the panel was that individuals with ASDs deserve the same thoroughness and standard of care in the diagnostic workup and treatment of gastrointestinal concerns as should occur for patients without ASDs. Care providers should be aware that problem behavior in patients with ASDs may be the primary or sole symptom of an underlying medical condition, including some gastrointestinal disorders.

For these patients, the integration of behavioral and medical care may be most beneficial. Priorities for future research are identified to advance our understanding and management of gastrointestinal disorders in persons with ASDs.

### Perceptions and practices of primary care providers in Europe and the US in the diagnosis and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A multinational survey [^114q5aPX]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

The presence of disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is associated with several negative outcomes. These include decreased mental and physical health-related quality of life (QOL), increased somatic symptom reporting, additional medical comorbidities, unnecessary medical testing in primary care settings, and a higher rate of abdominal surgeries. IBS significantly impacts productivity, leading to high rates of absenteeism and presenteeism. On average, individuals with IBS miss 13.4 days of work or school per year compared to 4.9 days for those without IBS. Additionally, 87% of individuals with IBS report reduced productivity at work in the past week, resulting in nearly 14 hours per week of lost productivity.

The economic burden of IBS is substantial. In the United States, direct medical costs attributed to IBS, excluding prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications, were estimated to be between $1.5 billion and $10 billion per year based on data published over a decade ago. In six European countries, the mean annual direct costs to healthcare systems per patient with IBS were estimated to range from €937.1 to €2108.0. When combining the costs to healthcare systems and patients, the total direct costs per patient ranged from €1421.7 to €2487.0.

Prior to the publication of the Rome IV diagnostic criteria for IBS in 2016, utilization of Rome criteria in clinical practice had been highly variable, as the criteria were developed for research rather than clinical purposes. Only recently have clinical criteria been established for clinical practices.

### Digital health for functional gastrointestinal disorders [^1175kgvM]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders are a common but challenging set of conditions to treat. Gastroenterology practices often struggle to meet the needs of patients with functional disorders given the need for careful monitoring, frequent communication, and management of stressors that occur outside of the clinical setting. In recent years, applications in digital health have created a new set of tools that can improve the care of these patients, including through improved symptom tracking, physiologic monitoring, direct provision of care, and patient support.

- **Purpose**: The purpose of this review is to evaluate how digital applications are being used to manage functional gastrointestinal disorders today, with several examples of relevant technologies and organizations. It also examines the shortcomings of treatment strategies and how they can be overcome.

### Functional gastrointestinal disorders in African American children in primary care [^116VAviS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in a primary care setting and to assess the usefulness of pediatric Rome criteria.

The methods involved administering the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms (QPGS), which assesses the pediatric Rome criteria, to 243 school-age children visiting a general pediatric clinic for annual school physicals. Pearson chi-square statistics were used to determine the association of various demographic factors with FGIDs.

Results indicated that all participants were African American, with 47.7% being girls. The mean age of the group was 10.7 years with a standard deviation of 3.9 years. The QPGS detected FGIDs in 52 children (21.4%). Diagnoses included aerophagia (6), abdominal migraine (1), cyclic vomiting syndrome (2), functional dyspepsia (2), functional abdominal pain syndrome (1), functional constipation (39), and functional fecal retention (1). A thorough clinical evaluation identified 47 children (19.3%) with FGIDs. Five children (2.1%) identified with FGIDs by the QPGS were not confirmed to have FGIDs by the examining physician.

Children with FGIDs did not differ from healthy children in terms of age, insurance, parental education, employment, or the number of children in the family. However, FGIDs were more common in girls (29 out of 47 girls, P = 0.028). Children with FGIDs tended to live in single-parent households and miss school more often than children without FGIDs (P = 0.08).

In conclusion, FGIDs are common among African American children and adolescents in a primary care setting, predominantly affecting girls.

### AGA Institute rapid review of the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of COVID-19, meta-analysis of international data, and recommendations for the consultative management of patients with COVID-19 [^1155utTe]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Multiple gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver enzyme abnormalities, have been variably reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This document provides best practice statements and recommendations for consultative management based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data on GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic literature search to identify published and unpublished studies using OVID Medline and preprint servers (medRxiv, LitCovid, and SSRN) up until April 5, 2020; major journal sites were monitored for US publications until April 19, 2020. We pooled the prevalence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver function test abnormalities, using a fixed-effect model and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework.

- **Results**: We identified 118 studies and used a hierarchical study selection process to identify unique cohorts. We performed a meta-analysis of 47 studies including 10,890 unique patients. Pooled prevalence estimates of GI symptoms were as follows: diarrhea 7.7% (95% confidence interval, 7.2%-8.2%), nausea/vomiting 7.8% (95% CI, 7.1%-8.5%), and abdominal pain 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%). Most studies reported on hospitalized patients. The pooled prevalence estimates of elevated liver abnormalities were as follows: aspartate transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.5%) and alanine transaminase 15%.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed, treated symptomatically, or if this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide, and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit.

We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with reviewing specific details of their history and physical examination that can provide clues about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered, along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. Furthermore, we review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### A 32-year-old woman with chronic abdominal pain [^111fULgg]. JAMA (2008). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a highly prevalent disorder that accounts for 5% of visits to primary care clinicians. It frequently coexists with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia, including epigastric pain, early satiety, and postprandial nausea, are nonspecific, making its diagnosis difficult.

Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder involving a number of different pathophysiologic processes, culminating in both gastrointestinal sensory and motor dysfunction. Although functional dyspepsia does not impart any increased risks to long-term health, it significantly affects both individuals and society. The economic burden of evaluating and treating functional dyspepsia is estimated to be at least $1 billion per year, and patients with functional dyspepsia experience a markedly reduced quality of life.

Using the case of Ms. C, we apply an evidence-based approach to highlight knowledge in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of functional dyspepsia.

### Practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer [^112Ln7Na]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

**Key facts**: There has been a threefold increase in the number of cancer survivors in the last 30 years. Chronic gastrointestinal side effects are a common cause of morbidity and reduced quality of life. Side effects of treatment are frequently missed or overlooked because the priority of cancer follow-up is to perform surveillance for cancer recurrence. Individual GPs are unlikely to have many patients with complex problems after cancer therapy and will therefore require guidance if these patients are to be optimally managed. Symptoms can often be alleviated or cured.

### British society of gastroenterology practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and complications as a result of treatment for cancer [^112ZXPyT]. Gut (2025). High credibility.

Survival rates following a diagnosis of cancer are improving. Poorly managed gastrointestinal (GI) side effects can interfere with the delivery of curative cancer treatment. Long-term physical side effects of cancer therapy affect the quality of life in up to 25% of those treated for cancer, with GI side effects being the most common and troublesome.

The aim is to provide comprehensive, practical guidance on the management of acute and chronic luminal gastrointestinal symptoms arising during and after treatment for cancer.

A multidisciplinary expert group, including patients treated for cancer, formed working parties to identify and synthesize recommendations for the optimal assessment, diagnosis, and appropriate interventions for luminal GI side effects of systemic and local cancer therapies. Recommendations were developed using the principles of the BMJ AGREE II reporting.

- **Results**:
	- The group agreed on 103 recommendations, emphasizing the importance of the patient perspective and what can be done to support patients. Key physiological principles underlying the development of GI toxicity from cancer therapy are outlined. Individual symptoms or symptom clusters are inadequate in distinguishing the underlying cause(s), necessitating investigations when empirical therapy does not quickly yield significant benefits. Patients often have multiple GI causes for symptoms, all of which need diagnosis and optimal treatment to achieve resolution. Investigations and management approaches now known to be ineffective or of questionable benefit are highlighted.

### Practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer [^111mETz8]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

The GI tract can only respond to pathological processes in a limited number of ways, so different pathological processes may produce identical symptoms. Many patients treated for cancer have other pre-existing illnesses and lifestyles which predispose them to cancer and also to chronic GI symptoms after cancer treatments. New incidental GI conditions may develop or manifest themselves coincidentally around the time the cancer is treated or thereafter. Patients may be taking medications or have made dietary changes affecting GI function.

There are ample data to suggest that symptom clusters often labelled as 'typical syndromes' — for example, 'bleeding from proctitis' or 'subacute obstruction due to adhesions' — are unreliable at predicting the true underlying cause of symptoms. Part of the reason for this is that many cancer treatments are systemic and do not respect conventional anatomical boundaries. One-third of symptoms confidently attributed to cancer therapy are found after investigation to be unrelated to the cancer treatment. A more valuable approach is to pay attention to the full clinical picture and consider all options.

GI side effects are underestimated in the literature and within clinical trials. Case notes frequently do not record side effects except when patients require surgery as part of their management. When prospective data are available, they are invariably based on symptom questionnaires rather than objective markers. Many questionnaires are inadequately sensitive and do not use reproducible methods.

### Practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer [^114ehA52]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, there has been no coordinated approach to improve the lot of this group of patients. Health professionals who regularly see these patients — medical and clinical oncologists, GI, urological and gynaecological surgeons, specialist nurses, and general practitioners — may not have the expertise to manage these patients' symptoms optimally. However, when they identify patients who need and want help — which, as suggested by Table 4, includes almost all patients who would benefit from help and can be identified with just three simple questions — they must have an established referral pathway for those patients. Most patients should be referred to gastroenterologists, but appropriate referral pathways, either to regional centres or locally, are best developed after discussion within the local cancer multidisciplinary team.

- **Managing symptoms**: A systematic approach to managing symptoms will only function usefully if a clinician can clearly elicit an accurate history from the symptomatic patient who has often undergone complex multimodal treatments. Many patients do not understand precisely the details of previous cancer treatments, which sometimes have gone on for years and may still be continuing. They are frequently frightened that any persistent symptom is a manifestation of recurrent cancer. Contacting the oncologists and surgeons at the cancer centre for precise details of previous treatments frequently changes management.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of irritable bowel syndrome [^1112SjBy]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for irritable bowel syndrome, specifically in relation to diagnosis, the BSG 2021 guidelines recommend using the NICE definition of IBS — characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, associated with an altered bowel habit for at least 6 months, and in the absence of alarm symptoms or signs — in primary care. This approach is preferred over using diagnostic criteria derived from patients in secondary care, such as the Rome IV criteria.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms among ambulatory HIV patients: Appropriate symptom management requires improved symptom recognition [^1165xoSa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are among the most frequent complaints in patients with HIV disease. Before combination antiretroviral therapy, it was suggested that 50–93% of all patients with HIV disease had marked GI symptoms during the course of their illness. Inflammatory changes, direct mucosal invasion of the GI tract by HIV, opportunistic infections, and neoplasms are well-recognized causative factors. GI manifestations of HIV disease may be debilitating and include anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal pain, anorectal disease, GI bleeding, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and GI tumors. Progressive immunosuppression is associated with an increasing prevalence of GI symptoms, and thus, the evaluation of specific GI complaints must be based on an assessment of the degree of immunosuppression. However, antiretroviral therapy may change the nature of HIV disease and can lead to improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms for patients with advanced immunosuppression.

Appropriate symptom management requires improved symptom recognition and should be an essential component of patient care at all stages of the disease worldwide. However, limited data exist regarding the incidence of various GI manifestations in HIV-infected patients in certain areas of the world, including the Caribbean. The paper by Thompson et al. in this issue of Annals of Gastroenterology investigated the prevalence of common GI symptoms in the ambulatory Jamaican HIV-infected population compared to those seen in a healthy population of blood donors not known to have HIV.

### Perceptions and practices of primary care providers in Europe and the US in the diagnosis and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A multinational survey [^113b5JKR]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

The majority of both US and European primary care providers (PCPs) agreed that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a diagnosis of exclusion, is underdiagnosed in primary care practices, and is difficult to diagnose with confidence. They reported confidence in diagnosing IBS in their patients most of the time or in less than half of encounters. US PCPs were more confident than their European colleagues in making a diagnosis of IBS, at least sometimes based solely on clinical symptoms.

Most participants in both groups reported needing normal endoscopy or imaging results at least sometimes to make a confident and accurate diagnosis of IBS. Both groups expressed the need for normal hematologic tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), and serologic chemistry tests, as well as normal serologic tests for celiac disease, like tissue transglutaminase IgA, to make a confident diagnosis. More US than European PCPs indicated that they would require a gastroenterology consultation to make a confident diagnosis of IBS. In contrast, European PCPs more commonly reported that they affirmatively state a diagnosis of IBS to their patients always or most of the time.

Relative to confidence in making an accurate diagnosis of IBS, most respondents in both the US and European PCP groups reported familiarity with the Rome IV criteria for IBS. However, just over half knew the specific diagnostic criteria needed to make the diagnosis. More US PCPs than European PCPs reported using the Rome IV criteria to diagnose IBS.

### Functional gastrointestinal disorders as a public health problem [^1168Xy7m]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2008). Low credibility.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are a heterogeneous group of chronic conditions that are important to public health due to their commonality, potential for disability, and significant social and economic burdens. Despite the Rome consensus process, the boundary between true abnormality and health is still imprecise. The notion that FGIDs lack pathological or biochemical correlates is evolving, with some candidate morphometric abnormalities, such as duodenal eosinophilia and colonic mastocytosis, being documented.

The quality of care for patients with FGIDs is not well understood, even though they frequently seek primary and specialty care. There are numerous symptom-based and disease-based co-morbidities common among FGID patients, which are not solely explained by coexistent somatization. The potential for preventing FGIDs post-infection remains unexplored, representing significant public health implications.

Defining disease severity is crucial for understanding the public health impact of FGIDs. Severity is likely affected by both intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms, psychological distress, and impacts on quality of life, although the interaction of these factors remains uncertain. Future research should focus on assessing the risk levels at which prescribing potentially dangerous medications becomes reasonable and stratifying patients with FGIDs who would benefit from such approaches using objective, well-validated criteria.

### Barriers to timely diagnosis of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases [^1145tUBY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Although eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, including eosinophilic esophagitis, have been described over the past two to three decades, barriers to diagnosis and treatment are common. These are compounded by issues related to social determinants of health, race, ethnicity, and access to care. These barriers contribute to delays in diagnosis, resulting in persistent inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, which can have significant consequences, including fibrostenotic complications in adults, failure to thrive in children, and decreased quality of life in all affected patients.

In this commentary, we summarize gaps in knowledge regarding the epidemiology of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases. We highlight barriers to diagnosis, discuss potential approaches based on best practices from other atopic and chronic gastrointestinal diseases, and provide recommendations for reducing barriers to timely diagnosis of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases in underserved populations.

### Quality improvement in gastroenterology clinical practice [^11548n3x]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

An emphasis on quality improvement (QI) is vital to the cost-effective provision of evidence-based health care. QI projects in gastroenterology have typically focused on endoscopy to minimize or eliminate procedure-related complications or errors. However, a significant component of gastroenterology care is based on the management of chronic disease. Patients with chronic diseases are seen in many different outpatient practices in the community and academia.

In an attempt to ensure that every patient receives high-quality care, major gastrointestinal societies have published guidelines on the management of common gastrointestinal complaints. However, adherence to these guidelines varies. We discuss common outpatient gastrointestinal illnesses with established guidelines for management that could benefit from active QI projects; these would ensure a consistently high standard of care for every patient.

### Gastroesophageal reflux, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal cancer: Clinical applications [^1143LZif]. JAMA (2002). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition commonly encountered in the primary care setting, is a risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Despite the ubiquity of the complaint, considerable uncertainty exists regarding several basic questions, including when to perform endoscopy in patients with chronic reflux symptoms and how to address the cancer risk associated with GERD. These clinical vignettes illustrate common clinical questions encountered in caring for patients with GERD, particularly as they relate to the issue of cancer risk. Applying data reviewed in the companion article, we propose practical answers to common clinical situations regarding the care of patients with reflux. We also present an algorithm for the treatment of patients with chronic GERD symptoms.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^112QDC5r]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

When diagnosing and investigating functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) in primary care, it is crucial to rule out any "red flags" that may suggest structural organic disease, which would necessitate a referral to a specialist.

- **Comments**: When a patient presents to primary care with symptoms of FACP, the initial priority is to exclude serious organic disease. Key red flag signs and symptoms that could indicate structural disease are provided in a separate detailed table. Patients presenting with any indicators of organic disease require referral to a specialist for further investigation.

- **Investigations and diagnosis**: A thorough evaluation should be conducted, including family history, medication reviews, and assessments of pain characteristics as well as eating and bowel habits. For selected cases, and based on the physician's discretion, additional examinations such as a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination), laboratory tests, and psychosocial assessments, may be warranted. Abdominal ultrasound investigations may be beneficial in these cases.

### Practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer [^113EoTKe]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

The number of patients with chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms after cancer therapies, which have a moderate or severe impact on quality of life, is similar to the number diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease annually. However, in contrast to patients with inflammatory bowel disease, most of these patients are not referred for gastroenterological assessment. Clinicians who do see these patients are often unaware of the benefits of targeted investigation (which differ from those required to exclude recurrent cancer), the range of available treatments, and how the pathological processes underlying side effects of cancer treatment differ from those in benign GI disorders. This paper aims to help clinicians become aware of the problem and suggests ways in which the panoply of syndromes can be managed.

A multidisciplinary literature review was performed to develop guidance to facilitate the clinical management of GI side effects of cancer treatments.

Different pathological processes within the GI tract may produce identical symptoms. Optimal management requires appropriate investigations and coordinated multidisciplinary working. Lactose intolerance, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and bile acid malabsorption frequently develop during or after chemotherapy. Toxin-negative Clostridium difficile and cytomegalovirus infection may be fulminant in immunosuppressed patients and require rapid diagnosis and treatment. Hepatic side effects include reactivation of viral hepatitis, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, steatosis, and steatohepatitis.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon Consensus 2.0 [^112vBmKr]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

The Lyon Consensus provides conclusive criteria for and against the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), along with adjunctive metrics that consolidate or refute GERD diagnosis when primary criteria are borderline or inconclusive. An international core and working group was assembled to evaluate research since the publication of the original Lyon Consensus and to vote on collaboratively developed statements to update the criteria.

The Lyon Consensus 2.0 offers a modern definition of actionable GERD, where evidence from oesophageal testing supports revising, escalating, or personalising GERD management for the symptomatic patient. Symptoms are described based on their high versus low likelihood of being related to reflux episodes. Unproven versus proven GERD defines diagnostic strategies and testing options.

Patients with no prior GERD evidence (unproven GERD) are studied using prolonged wireless pH monitoring or catheter-based pH or pH monitoring off antisecretory medication. Meanwhile, patients with conclusive GERD evidence (proven GERD) and persisting symptoms are evaluated using pH-impedance monitoring while on optimised antisecretory therapy.

The major changes from the original Lyon Consensus criteria include the establishment of Los Angeles grade B oesophagitis as conclusive GERD evidence, description of metrics and thresholds to be used with prolonged wireless pH monitoring, and inclusion of parameters useful in the diagnosis of refractory GERD when testing is performed on antisecretory therapy in proven GERD. Criteria that have not performed well in the diagnosis of actionable GERD have been revised for improved accuracy.

### Coronavirus disease-2019: Implications for the gastroenterologist [^1166UiQf]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted practicing gastroenterologists in several ways. Although the majority of COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms are also observed. COVID-19 has disrupted gastrointestinal endoscopy services in numerous ways, raising concerns about its effects on gastrointestinal cancer screening and the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. This review provides an overview of the implications of COVID-19 for practicing gastroenterologists.

COVID-19 patients can experience gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Separate from the management of COVID-19 patients, there has been a reduction in endoscopy volume worldwide, leading to a reduction or cessation of in-person clinic visits and increasing the use of telemedicine services. Additionally, patients with chronic conditions such as chronic liver disease or inflammatory bowel disease may experience worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gastroenterologists need to rapidly adapt to the challenges faced and implement both systems and practice-based changes to the endoscopy unit and outpatient clinic practices. They should stay updated with the rapidly evolving literature regarding gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients and its impact on chronic gastrointestinal illnesses.

### Diagnostic criteria in IBS: Useful or not [^116yxUU6]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

There are a number of reasons to establish the accurate diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): to relieve patient uncertainty, to avoid adverse effects of unnecessary medications or treatments, to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures and surgeries, to conserve limited healthcare resources, and, of course, to initiate the most appropriate treatment. However, making the diagnosis of IBS remains difficult because it is clinically heterogeneous, no biological marker to detect it exists, many other diseases share the same clinical manifestations, and it is often difficult for both physicians and patients to accept the uncertainty of a symptom-based diagnosis.

Different diagnostic criteria have been developed during the last four decades, but none have proved to be an ideal method of accurately diagnosing IBS. Just as importantly, physicians are frequently unaware of published guidelines or consciously ignore these diagnostic criteria. Most clinicians still believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion and not a positive diagnosis based on history, physical examination, the use of published diagnostic criteria such as the Rome III criteria, and the absence of alarm features.

In the sections to follow, we will address the inherent difficulties of diagnosing IBS, highlight the importance of symptom-based diagnoses to help rein in soaring healthcare costs, and discuss future strategies that may enable a more cost-efficient diagnosis of IBS.

### Patient journey in gastroesophageal reflux disease: Real-world perspectives from Italian gastroenterologists, primary care physicians, and ENT specialists [^1151s2dB]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the medical approaches employed by physicians from different medical specialties in managing patients with symptoms of GERD, and to analyze their characteristics. A multidisciplinary approach to patients suffering from GERD symptoms involves collaborative care from gastroenterologists, ENT specialists, dietitians, and GPs. This ensures a comprehensive strategy that addresses not only the diagnostic management, and treatment of symptoms and complications, but also includes the practical application of all the recommendations deriving from international guidelines.

We observed that patients commonly referred to gastroenterologists had more severe symptoms and worse endoscopic findings than those managed by GPs and ENT specialists. The medical literature is consistent with our findings, as a comprehensive survey revealed that gastroenterologists assist the highest percentage of patients experiencing reflux symptoms. In general, their patients exhibit more severe symptoms compared to those treated by other physicians. These findings highlight the pivotal role of gastroenterologists in managing GERD. They are particularly crucial in cases with more aggressive symptoms and complex clinical presentations, as they offer specialized expertise in diagnostic procedures such as endoscopy and pH-impedance monitoring, medication management, and, when necessary, balancing the risk and benefit ratio of surgical therapies.

### Does my patient still have reflux when PPI therapy does not work [^114st9zL]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition around the world. The management of this disease is less than satisfying given the complexity of patient presentation and suboptimal diagnostic testing when employed for those poorly responsive to acid suppressive therapy. In this mini-review, we discuss some new strategies employed for patients with suspected GERD to better understand disease pathophysiology. We compare the strategies and outline a clinically relevant approach for this difficult group of patients.

### Gastrointestinal symptom severity in irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease and the general population [^111sQXZp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients report similar gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, yet comparisons of symptom severity between groups and with the general population (GP) are lacking.

- **Methods**: We compared Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) GI symptom scales measuring gastro-esophageal reflux (GER), disrupted swallowing, diarrhea, bowel incontinence, nausea/vomiting, constipation, belly pain, and gas/bloating in: (i) USA GP sample, (ii) IBS patients, and (iii) IBD patients from tertiary care and community populations. Symptom severity scores were based on T-score metric with mean 50 ± 10 (standard deviation) relative to the GP.

- **Key results**: Of 1643 patients enrolled, there were 253 IBS patients (68% F, mean age 45 ± 15 years), 213 IBD patients (46% F, mean age 41 ± 14 years), and 1177 GP subjects (57% F, mean age 46 ± 16 years). IBS patients reported greater severity of GER, disrupted swallowing, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, gas/bloating, and constipation symptoms than their IBD counterparts (all p < 0.05). Compared to the GP, IBD patients had worse belly pain, gas/bloating, diarrhea, and bowel incontinence, but less severe GER and disrupted swallowing [all p < 0.05], and IBS patients had more severe nausea/vomiting, belly pain, gas/bloating, and constipation [all p < 0.05]. Women had more severe belly pain and gas/bloating than men, whereas men had more severe bowel incontinence [all p < 0.05].

- **Conclusion and inferences**: IBS and IBD are associated with more severe GI symptoms compared to the GP excluding esophageal symptoms.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111scUUW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and more specifically in relation to diagnostic criteria, the ACG 2013 guidelines recommend establishing a presumptive diagnosis of GERD in the presence of typical symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation.

### Treatment strategies for acid reflux: Encompassing practical solutions for primary care [^1134v8gY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). High credibility.

Despite a steady diet of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for over three decades, nearly all routine clinical decisions remain incompletely supported, or even totally unaddressed, by the burgeoning pile of RCT data. The biomedical literature tends to focus on explanatory RCTs that compare new agents with placebo. It is less common to find pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) that test the risks, benefits, and costs of competing active therapies within the context of usual practice settings.

In this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Moayeddi and colleagues report the results of the Encompass study — a novel PCT for the primary care management of reflux disease. In this editorial, the results of Encompass are discussed, and the study is highlighted as a model for investigators to follow as we continue to emphasize pragmatic trials that address everyday challenges in clinical care.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^114jSGAh]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

- **Definite referral criteria for urgent endoscopy**: People of any age with dysphagia and people aged ≥ 55 years with weight loss and any of the following: dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain, or reflux.

- **Probable referral criteria for non-urgent endoscopy**: People with haematemesis and people aged ≥ 55 years with treatment-resistant dyspepsia, dyspepsia with raised platelet count, nausea or vomiting, upper abdominal pain with low haemoglobin, raised platelet count, nausea or vomiting, reflux with raised platelet count, or nausea or vomiting. Nausea or vomiting with any of the following: weight loss, reflux, dyspepsia, or upper abdominal pain.

### Practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer [^117JbJHW]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

This guidance is designed to facilitate clinical practice by focusing on the physical causes of symptoms rather than the psychological aspects. Gastroenterologists are already adept at identifying psychological factors in gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. While patients may experience unique psychological stresses that can produce GI symptoms, robust data indicate that organic causes for these symptoms are frequently overlooked. Therefore, this guidance emphasizes when symptoms starting after cancer treatments can be interpreted similarly to other GI diseases and when clinicians should exercise caution.

The guidance provides principles of management where applicable and outlines future research priorities. There is a scarcity of level A (randomized controlled trial) or level B (outcomes research) evidence to define optimal management strategies or to establish definitive guidelines. In the absence of more robust evidence, the recommendations for practical approaches to treatment are primarily based on level C (case series) and level D (expert opinion, physiological and laboratory studies) data.

### Overlap of functional dyspepsia and GERD — diagnostic and treatment implications [^115xv1CR]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

GERD and functional dyspepsia are the two most prevalent upper gastrointestinal disorders. Gastro-oesophageal reflux is most commonly diagnosed using the cardinal symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation. Patients might also be diagnosed using a questionnaire, after empiric treatment with an acid suppressant, after upper endoscopy or by pH testing. Functional dyspepsia is best diagnosed using symptoms outlined by the Rome committee in conjunction with a normal upper endoscopy. Theoretically, distinguishing these two populations should be easy for all healthcare providers. In reality, however, carefully separating out these two populations can be quite difficult, as substantial overlap exists epidemiologically, symptomatically, and even diagnostically. This overlap renders precise diagnosis a challenge; given the limited treatment options, the primary goal is to identify those patients who will respond to acid suppressive therapy.

Despite the frequency with which functional dyspepsia and GERD overlap, remarkably few studies have investigated this overlap. Most recommendations are based on data derived from separate studies of functional dyspepsia and GERD. A further limitation of existing studies is their failure to differentiate between the various diagnostic categories into which the individual presenting with heartburn might belong.

### Practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer [^113zLQLV]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Substantial progress has been made in treating cancer. However, there are convincing and consistent data that a large number of people experience chronic physical morbidity post-cancer treatment, commonly affecting the gastrointestinal tract and adversely impacting daily activities. There is a professional obligation to systematically identify patients with such unmet needs and to develop appropriate referral pathways where they do not currently exist.

This multidisciplinary guidance is designed to assist clinicians in better understanding the underlying pathology and management options for physical symptoms. It is hoped that it may serve as a starting point for multidisciplinary team discussions to enhance patient care and for educational programs for trainees who need to learn how to manage these issues. Systematic education about the optimal management of severely symptomatic patients is sorely lacking. Despite this, the number of affected patients in the UK currently equals those diagnosed annually with primary inflammatory bowel disease and is increasing by 3% per year. This patient group can undoubtedly gain substantial benefit from a more coherent approach to managing their ongoing and often disabling and distressing symptoms.

### Gastrointestinal manifestations, diagnosis, and management of hereditary angioedema [^113P6HTS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common conditions in clinical practice and presents a challenging complaint to accurately diagnose due to the vast number of possible etiologies. When other health care providers cannot identify the cause of abdominal pain, gastroenterologists are often called upon to help solve the diagnostic dilemma. Consequently, it is incumbent upon gastroenterologists to be well-versed in the diagnosis and management of not only common but also rare causes of abdominal pain.

One such uncommon but well-described cause of abdominal pain is angioedema of the intestinal tract due to hereditary angioedema (HAE). Acute onset abdominal pain of varying severity is its most common presenting symptom. Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary surgical procedures and even death. The purpose of this review is to raise awareness among gastroenterologists about hereditary angioedema as a potential cause of recurrent, unexplained abdominal pain.

### ACG clinical guideline: Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^1175KzQd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically with respect to clinical assessment, ACG 2016 guidelines recommend eliciting a focused history, performing a physical examination, and obtaining laboratory evaluation at the time of patient presentation to assess the severity of bleeding and its possible location and etiology. It is advised to obtain initial patient assessment and perform hemodynamic resuscitation simultaneously.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: Basis of clinical management strategies [^116w3GnK]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are often described as challenging. The diagnosis of IBS can safely be made using the Rome II criteria in conjunction with a thorough physical examination and a limited number of diagnostic studies. Although the diagnosis is generally made with a high degree of accuracy, the pathophysiology of IBS remains elusive, and treatment can be frustrating for both patient and physician alike.

Important areas of research focus on the psychology of IBS, visceral hypersensitivity, motility abnormalities (e.g. heightened gastrocolonic response), and the "brain-gut axis". A multidisciplinary effort is often required to ameliorate symptoms and improve patients' quality of life. This review article will discuss the myriad of treatments available for patients with IBS and provide both a clinical and practical discussion of their use, offering evidence where available and clinical experience where it is not.

### Lower gastrointestinal tract disorders: Clinical updates in women's health care primary and preventive care review [^1119TaAf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and associated symptoms account for a large number of health care visits each year. Many women visit their obstetrician-gynecologists more often than their primary care physicians or use them as primary health care providers. Many gynecologic and lower GI disorders share symptoms, such as lower abdominal or pelvic pain and bloating. Some diseases are more common in women compared with men, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or warrant special consideration in women, for example, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

This monograph outlines the major diseases that affect the lower GI tract and reviews the epidemiology, pathology, presentation, and treatment of these diseases. Concerns specific to women are addressed, including reproductive issues, changes in GI physiology during pregnancy, and the management of lower GI disease during pregnancy.

### Meeting the need for women's health training in gastroenterology: Creation of a women's digestive disorders program at Brown University [^112fDriL]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

Despite training requirements, knowledge and self-efficacy in women's health issues remain inadequate in many fields. In gastroenterology, nearly 60% of patients are women, and many disorders are more common in women. Adequate training in gastrointestinal (GI) women's health is, therefore, critical for gastroenterologists.

- **Objectives**: (1) To create a core faculty in GI women's health, (2) to develop a GI women's health curriculum, (3) to provide didactic education and clinical experiences in GI women's health, (4) to produce self-efficacy in the evaluation and management of GI women's health issues, and (5) to develop academic gastroenterologists focused on GI women's health.

- **Methods**: We assembled a multidisciplinary group of GI women's health experts dedicated to training and mentoring GI fellows. We also held focus groups to determine the unmet needs in the management of the GI health of female patients in our community. Results from this needs assessment formed the foci of our program. In 2002, we introduced a 2-month rotation in GI women's health. Then, in 2005, we introduced a 3-year women's health pathway for trainees committed to academic careers.

- **Results**: Between 2002 and 2008, 13 fellows who participated in the rotation have graduated from the Brown GI fellowship program, and 1 has completed the track. Satisfaction with the program is high. Postgraduation survey results show that over 80% of graduates who participated in the rotation feel prepared to evaluate and treat GI disorders in pregnancy, and nearly 65% feel prepared to address general GI women's health issues.

### Functional gastrointestinal disorders: Advances in understanding and management [^1139MaGE]. The Lancet (2020). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are highly prevalent, but many people who have them will have no organic explanation for their symptoms. Most of these individuals are labeled as having a functional gastrointestinal disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, or functional constipation. These conditions affect up to 40% of the population at any given time, and two-thirds of these individuals experience chronic, fluctuating symptoms.

The pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders is complex. It involves bidirectional dysregulation of gut-brain interaction via the gut-brain axis, microbial dysbiosis within the gut, altered mucosal immune function, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal gastrointestinal motility. Consequently, these conditions are referred to as disorders of gut-brain interaction. Psychological comorbidity is common; however, whether this predates or is driven by symptoms remains unclear.

Patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders often feel stigmatized. Physicians frequently fail to communicate this diagnosis effectively or provide adequate education. Prompt identification and management of these conditions are crucial due to their considerable impact on health-care systems and society. This includes repeated consultations, unnecessary investigations and surgeries, prescription and over-the-counter medication use, and impaired health-related quality of life and work ability.

Symptom-based criteria are used to make a diagnosis, with judicious use of limited investigations for some patients.
