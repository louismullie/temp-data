Osteoporosis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing postmenopausal osteoporosis, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to diagnose osteoporosis and stratify fracture risk. Then, I should verify treatment thresholds and who needs pharmacotherapy. Next, I will select initial therapy based on risk category and patient factors, followed by sequencing and duration decisions. After that, I need to ensure monitoring and response assessment, including when to escalate or add therapy. Finally, I will address special populations, safety, and a practical algorithm summary, while double-checking key points against high-quality guidelines and meta-analyses throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and risk stratification. Osteoporosis is defined by a T-score of −2.5 or less at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip, or by the presence of a low-trauma fragility fracture regardless of T-score, and osteopenia spans T-scores between −1.0 and −2.5; importantly, more than 80% of fragility fractures occur in women with osteopenia, so absolute fracture risk, not T-score alone, should drive treatment decisions [^111STT5R] [^116Bx2YU]. I should double-check that FRAX is used to integrate clinical risk factors with BMD to estimate 10-year fracture probability, recognizing FRAX may underestimate risk in settings like multiple or recent fractures, secondary osteoporosis, or high fall risk, so clinical judgment is essential [^113oovCj]. Hold on, I should verify the bone loss trajectory too: rapid bone loss around menopause averages about 2% per year for several years, then slows to roughly 0.5% per year thereafter, which explains why early intervention can be impactful [^1154VrDt].

> Next, I should review treatment thresholds. Pharmacologic therapy is indicated for women with a T-score of −2.5 or less, those with a hip or vertebral fragility fracture, or those with osteopenia (T-score −1.0 to −2.5) and a FRAX 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk of 20% or higher or hip fracture risk of 3% or higher in the US-adapted model; I need to ensure I'm aligning with both Endocrine Society and AACE thresholds here, which I am [^113r3Juw] [^116ft9Ai]. Wait, let me verify the principle that once osteoporosis is diagnosed, the diagnosis persists even if treatment improves T-score; yes, that remains correct and guides lifelong management [^115iQsZF].

> Now, I will examine initial therapy selection by risk category. For most patients at high fracture risk, oral bisphosphonates are appropriate first-line therapy given broad-spectrum antifracture efficacy and favorable cost; alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronate are all options, with alendronate and zoledronate having the most robust hip data, and ACP also recommends bisphosphonates as initial therapy based on high-certainty evidence [^114AnY1s] [^1171HMRv]. I should confirm that denosumab is a reasonable alternative when oral bisphosphonates are contraindicated or not tolerated, and that SERMs like raloxifene are mainly for vertebral fracture risk reduction rather than hip or nonvertebral protection, which is accurate [^115Qpq3m] [^111JHsLY].

> For women at very high or imminent fracture risk, I need to ensure I prioritize anabolic-first strategies. Osteoanabolic agents such as teriparatide, abaloparatide, or romosozumab produce larger, faster BMD gains and superior fracture risk reduction versus antiresorptives in head-to-head and network meta-analyses, and should be followed by a potent antiresorptive to consolidate gains; romosozumab has a boxed warning for cardiovascular events, so I should screen and individualize accordingly [^116TaHEX] [^112H3udn] [^115mvWot]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially thought denosumab might match anabolics for clinical fractures, but the network meta-analysis suggests anabolics outperform denosumab and bisphosphonates for clinical and vertebral endpoints, reinforcing an anabolic-first approach in the highest-risk patients [^112H3udn].

> I should confirm the role of hormone therapy here. Systemic estrogen is FDA-approved for prevention, not treatment, of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and is most appropriate for women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause who have vasomotor symptoms; when used, it reduces fractures, but non-estrogen bone-specific therapies are preferred for treating established osteoporosis [^116L6LEC] [^112y11Uf]. Let me reconsider whether HT ever supplants antiresorptives or anabolics for treatment; no, guidelines consistently position HT for prevention or symptom-driven use, not as therapy for diagnosed osteoporosis [^116L6LEC].

> Next, I should review sequencing and duration. After 12 to 24 months of anabolic therapy, transition to a potent antiresorptive such as a bisphosphonate or denosumab is required to maintain BMD and fracture risk reduction; gains are greater when anabolic therapy precedes antiresorptive therapy rather than vice versa, and gains can persist for at least two years after transition [^115WDEPE]. For bisphosphonates, 3 to 5 years of initial therapy is typical, after which a reassessment at 5 years can inform a drug holiday in lower-risk patients, whereas high-risk patients should continue or switch; denosumab should not be interrupted beyond about 7 months without subsequent antiresorptive coverage due to rebound bone loss and vertebral fractures, so if stopped, bridge with a bisphosphonate [^114jtBQy] [^113t9bVB] [^115Qpq3m]. Wait, I should double-check the evidence base for holidays; FLEX and the zoledronic acid extension support residual effects after stopping, but vertebral protection wanes and decisions should be individualized by risk [^113oGcH7].

> I will now examine monitoring and response assessment. BMD by DXA should be repeated 1 to 2 years after initiating therapy and again at 5 years for those on bisphosphonates to guide holiday decisions; persistent losses or new fractures warrant evaluation for adherence, secondary causes, or medication change, and using the same DXA instrument improves interpretability [^113q6QQt]. Bone turnover markers can be used selectively; a robust early reduction in CTX or P1NP supports adherence and biologic effect, and lack of marker suppression by 3 to 6 months should prompt reassessment of adherence or secondary causes, though routine BTM monitoring is not universally required [^114ScA79] [^116RJGJ7]. Hold on, I should verify that BMD changes explain only a fraction of fracture risk reduction; yes, BMD gains account for less than 20% of antifracture benefit, so clinical outcomes and risk factors remain paramount [^116bWiwC].

> Let me consider escalation and nonresponse. If there is significant bone loss or new fragility fracture on therapy, I should verify adherence, screen for secondary causes such as hyperparathyroidism, malabsorption, or medication-induced bone loss, and consider switching to a more potent agent or adding sequential therapy; for example, moving from an oral bisphosphonate to denosumab or initiating an anabolic followed by antiresorptive consolidation in very high-risk patients [^116bWiwC] [^113t9bVB]. I need to ensure I do not conflate combination therapy with sequential therapy; concurrent use of two osteoporosis drugs is not recommended outside trials, whereas sequential therapy is evidence-based and standard in higher-risk care pathways [^112fw1St].

> Next, I should review special populations and safety. In chronic kidney disease, bisphosphonates require dose adjustment and caution, whereas denosumab is an option but mandates careful transition planning if discontinued; in older adults with high fall risk, emphasize fall prevention and consider agents with rapid fracture risk reduction, such as anabolics in the very high-risk subgroup [^113t9bVB] [^116aaDHq]. I should confirm rare adverse events: osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures are uncommon with antiresorptives but warrant vigilance, and romosozumab's cardiovascular signal necessitates screening and individualized risk–benefit discussion [^113WfNAn] [^115mvWot].

> I need to ensure foundational measures are addressed. Adequate calcium and vitamin D are recommended adjuncts to reduce hypocalcemia risk and support bone mineralization, with typical targets of 1000–1200 mg/day total calcium and 800–1000 IU/day vitamin D, while avoiding excessive supplemental calcium to mitigate nephrolithiasis risk; weight-bearing and resistance exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, and fall-risk mitigation should accompany all pharmacotherapy [^111Wwyny] [^1113vJVV] [^111GQpXR]. Wait, let me verify whether calcium/vitamin D alone reduce fractures broadly; evidence is mixed, with hip fracture benefit most apparent in institutionalized or deficient older adults, reinforcing their role as adjuncts rather than substitutes for antiresorptive or anabolic therapy [^116dPLEZ] [^111Wwyny].

> But wait, what if the patient is premenopausal or has secondary osteoporosis features? I should confirm that premenopausal management differs and often focuses on secondary causes, while postmenopausal primary osteoporosis care follows the above framework; referral to endocrinology is reasonable for recurrent fractures, continued bone loss on therapy, or complex secondary evaluations [^117B4S7Q]. Hold on, I should verify that fragility fractures at any site, not just hip or spine, establish the diagnosis of osteoporosis regardless of T-score; yes, that remains a core principle guiding treatment decisions [^111STT5R].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines. Screen and diagnose using DXA and FRAX, treat all with lifestyle and calcium/vitamin D, and initiate pharmacotherapy for those meeting thresholds; start with a bisphosphonate for most high-risk patients, consider denosumab when oral therapy is unsuitable, and use an anabolic-first sequence for very high-risk patients, followed by antiresorptive consolidation; monitor BMD at 1 to 2 years and reassess at 5 years for bisphosphonate holiday decisions, ensuring denosumab is never stopped without coverage; escalate or switch if bone loss or fractures occur, and individualize throughout using shared decision-making and local context [^113r3Juw] [^112sCzxD] [^113t9bVB] [^111uqZT9]. I should confirm that this approach reflects current living guidelines and meta-analytic data; yes, it aligns with ACP, Endocrine Society, NAMS, and recent network meta-analyses emphasizing anabolic-first benefits in the highest-risk strata [^1171HMRv] [^112H3udn].

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by **low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration**, leading to increased bone fragility and fracture risk. It is most common in **postmenopausal women** due to estrogen deficiency [^1149uAGN], but also affects men and can result from secondary causes [^1111Tuva]. Diagnosis relies on **DXA-measured BMD** (T-score ≤ −2.5) or a **fragility fracture** [^111STT5R]; FRAX is used to assess fracture risk and guide treatment [^113r3Juw]. First-line pharmacologic therapy is **bisphosphonates** [^1171HMRv]; anabolic agents (teriparatide, abaloparatide, romosozumab) are reserved for high-risk patients [^116TaHEX]. Therapy is individualized, with **lifelong management** [^1167Yxif] including calcium/vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise, fall prevention, and monitoring of BMD and adherence [^113q6QQt].

---

## Pathophysiology

Osteoporosis arises from **imbalanced bone remodeling**, with resorption outpacing formation [^notfound]. Key drivers include:

- **Estrogen deficiency**: Increases osteoclast activity, causing rapid bone loss after menopause [^1149uAGN].
- **Secondary causes**: Glucocorticoids, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, malabsorption, and chronic liver/kidney disease [^1165yLtr].
- **Genetic factors**: Family history and polymorphisms in estrogen receptor, vitamin D receptor, and collagen genes [^113oovCj].

---

## Risk factors

Risk factors include **non-modifiable** — age, female sex, menopause, family history, and ethnicity (white/Asian) [^113AjgVe] — and **modifiable** — low calcium/vitamin D intake, inactivity, smoking, excess alcohol, low BMI, glucocorticoids, and aromatase inhibitors [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Osteoporosis is often silent until fracture; **common sites** include:

- **Vertebral fractures**: Height loss, kyphosis, chronic back pain [^notfound].
- **Hip fractures**: Often require surgery, high morbidity/mortality [^112fHFeJ].
- **Wrist fractures**: Typical of low-trauma falls in older adults [^notfound].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on **DXA** — the gold standard (lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip; T-score ≤ −2.5 defines osteoporosis) [^111STT5R] — and on **FRAX**, which integrates clinical risk factors with or without femoral neck BMD to estimate 10-year fracture risk [^113r3Juw]. Laboratory tests include **CBC, CMP, 25(OH)D, TSH, and PTH** to exclude secondary causes [^notfound].

---

## Treatment

### Non-pharmacologic therapy

Non-pharmacologic therapy includes **weight-bearing and resistance exercise** to improve BMD and balance [^112fHFeJ]; **calcium 1000–1200 mg/day and vitamin D 800–1000 IU/day** to support bone health [^1113vJVV]; smoking cessation and alcohol moderation; and **fall prevention** with home safety, vision correction, and balance training [^116aaDHq].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

| **Drug class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Bisphosphonates | Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid | Antiresorptive | First-line; reduce hip, vertebral, nonvertebral fractures [^1171HMRv] |
| Denosumab | Denosumab | RANKL inhibitor | Alternative first-line; vertebral, nonvertebral, hip fracture reduction [^117FJg4Q] |
| SERMs | Raloxifene | Estrogen agonist/antagonist | Vertebral fracture reduction; breast cancer risk reduction [^111JHsLY] |
| Anabolics | Teriparatide, abaloparatide, romosozumab | Stimulate bone formation | High-risk patients; vertebral, nonvertebral, hip fracture reduction [^116TaHEX] |
| Hormone therapy | Estrogen ± progestin | Estrogen replacement | Prevention in early menopause; not treatment [^112y11Uf] |

---

Treatment duration is **3–5 years** for most agents, with reassessment; **bisphosphonates** may have a residual effect allowing a holiday in low-risk patients [^114jtBQy]. Combination therapy is not recommended due to limited evidence and increased adverse effects [^112fw1St].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up include **BMD testing** every 1–3 years to assess response and guide therapy [^116RJGJ7]; assessment of adherence and persistence, with counseling to improve adherence [^111uqZT9]; and vigilance for adverse effects, including atypical femur fractures, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and hypocalcemia [^113WfNAn].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **maximizing peak bone mass** in youth with adequate calcium/vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise, and avoiding smoking/alcohol [^113j9Tqk]; in adults, maintaining bone health with continued exercise, nutrition, and fall prevention [^111GQpXR]; and screening women ≥ 65 years or earlier with risk factors [^112fHFeJ].

---

## Complications

Complications include **vertebral fractures** with chronic pain, deformity, and reduced quality of life; **hip fractures** associated with high morbidity, mortality, and functional decline [^113WfNAn]; and substantial direct and indirect economic costs [^113ompxe].

---

Osteoporosis is a chronic disease requiring **lifelong management** [^1167Yxif]; individualized therapy, adherence, and monitoring are essential to reduce fracture risk and maintain quality of life [^116aaDHq].

### Long-term treatment strategies for postmenopausal osteoporosis [^117T3XHx]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Osteoporosis guidelines do not usually provide specific recommendations regarding what medication is most appropriate for individual patients. Generic oral bisphosphonates are often considered first-line treatment for osteoporosis, but treatment duration is limited, based on potential long-term safety concerns, and there is no consensus about what to do after 5 years. There are no recommendations concerning long-term management of osteoporosis over 30 or more years of postmenopausal life.

Recent Findings

This review attempts to specify medication choices and provide the best clinical management strategies for women at different stages of life and with different underlying disease severity. Because there is no evidence that considers the entire postmenopausal lifespan, much of the discussion here will be based on expert opinion. The review considers a role for estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators, oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, denosumab and the anabolic agents, teriparatide and abaloparatide.

Summary

Optimal sequential monotherapy, over an average of 30 postmenopausal years, should be able to minimize exposure to pharmacology while maximizing benefits on bone strength and minimizing imminent and long-term risk of fracture.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^111GQpXR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for the pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Conclusions

Evidence from clinical trials and insights from clinical experience with pharmacologic therapies for osteoporosis were critically evaluated in formulating this guideline for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Patient preferences, data on adherence and persistence, and risks and benefits from the patient and provider perspectives were also considered in writing committee deliberations. A consensus by the Writing Committee members was achieved for four management principles: (i) The risk of future fractures in postmenopausal women should be determined using country-specific assessment tools to guide decision-making. (ii) Patient preferences should be incorporated into treatment planning. (iii) Nutritional and lifestyle interventions and fall prevention should accompany all pharmacologic regimens to reduce fracture risk. (iv) Multiple pharmacologic therapies are capable of reducing fracture rates in postmenopausal women at risk with acceptable risk-benefit and safety profiles.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^112sCzxD]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Pharmacotherapy to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women — overall principles state that the primary objective of treating women with osteoporosis is to reduce the risk of fracture and that all drugs approved for osteoporosis treatment have been shown in RCTs to reduce fracture risk. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action and effectiveness, and combining therapies is not generally recommended to treat osteoporosis, although sequential therapies may play a role in preventing loss after certain therapies.

### Fracture risk reduction and safety by osteoporosis treatment compared with placebo or active comparator in postmenopausal women: systematic review, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis of randomised clinical trials [^112H3udn]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Advances in research have led to a more accurate assessment of the risk of fractures, and the range of treatment options available to prevent fractures has expanded. Algorithms on the risk of fractures that combine clinical risk factors and bone mineral density are now widely used in clinical practice to target treatment to individuals at high risk of fractures. Although drug treatments targeted at osteoporosis consistently improve bone mineral density, preventing fractures is the most relevant patient outcome. Heterogeneity has been noted for the magnitude of the reduction in the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral, hip, and clinical fractures between treatments. Few active comparator trials have directly compared the effects on fracture endpoints. Greater understanding of the differences in the effects of treatments across clinical trials would influence estimates of the benefits of treatment and should therefore be considered among the evidence base that drives guideline recommendations.

Moreover, most randomised controlled trials included patients with an estimated high baseline risk of fractures, but this varied between treatments and over time. Existing post hoc analyses indicate that the antifracture efficacy of some treatments for osteoporosis differ according to estimates of the baseline risk of fractures of individuals in the study, typically, but not exclusively, calculated with the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX). Therefore, factors such as history of fractures, age, bone mineral density, and body mass index, among others, might be potential effect modifiers.

In this analysis, we looked at several baseline risk indicators associated with the efficacy of drug treatments to assess the evidence of the effect and harms of available osteoporosis treatments on primary and secondary reduction of the risk of fractures among postmenopausal women. We also critically appraised the internal validity of the randomised controlled trials. We used meta-regression analyses to explore the evidence of the effect of antiosteoporosis drug treatments on the risk of fracture according to recognised baseline risk factors.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1149uAGN]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review evidence regarding osteoporosis screening, prevention, diagnosis, and management in the past decade and update the position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2010 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women as new therapies and paradigms have become available.

Design

NAMS enlisted a panel of clinician experts in the field of metabolic bone diseases and/or women's health to review and update the 2010 NAMS position statement and recommendations on the basis of new evidence and clinical judgement. The panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Osteoporosis, especially prevalent in older postmenopausal women, increases the risk of fractures that can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Postmenopausal bone loss, related to estrogen deficiency, is the primary contributor to osteoporosis. Other important risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis include advanced age, genetics, smoking, thinness, and many diseases and drugs that impair bone health. An evaluation of these risk factors to identify candidates for osteoporosis screening and recommending nonpharmacologic measures such as good nutrition (especially adequate intake of protein, calcium, and vitamin D), regular physical activity, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are appropriate for all postmenopausal women. For women at high risk for osteoporosis, especially perimenopausal women with low bone density and other risk factors, estrogen or other therapies are available to prevent bone loss. For women with osteoporosis and/or other risk factors for fracture, including advanced age and previous fractures, the primary goal of therapy is to prevent new fractures. This is accomplished by combining nonpharmacologic measures, drugs to increase bone density and to improve bone strength, and strategies to reduce fall risk. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, government-approved options include estrogen agonists/antagonists, bisphosphonates, RANK ligand inhibitors, parathyroid hormone-receptor agonists, and inhibitors of sclerostin.

Conclusions

Osteoporosis is a common disorder in postmenopausal women. Management of skeletal health in postmenopausal women involves assessing risk factors for fracture, reducing modifiable risk factors through dietary and lifestyle changes, and the use of pharmacologic therapy for patients at significant risk of osteoporosis or fracture. For women with osteoporosis, lifelong management is necessary. Treatment decisions occur continuously over the lifespan of a postmenopausal woman. Decisions must be individualized and should include the patient in the process of shared decision-making.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115yVtn7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — patient values and preferences reflect that there is consensus that calcium and vitamin D should be added to all osteoporosis treatment regimens to enhance mineralization and maintenance of bone mass in high-risk postmenopausal women; there is no direct evidence that adding calcium and vitamin D to other osteoporosis treatments reduces fracture risk in clinical trials, although there may be a small additional bone mineral density benefit for individuals on a prescribed osteoporosis medication.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1167Yxif]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — conclusions and general recommendation: Once diagnosed, patients with osteoporosis require lifelong management, and by individualizing treatment approaches and monitoring and adjusting those approaches if the clinical picture changes, the consequences of osteoporosis on a menopausal woman's activity and well-being can be minimized; encourage all postmenopausal women to employ lifestyle practices that reduce the risk of bone loss.

### Recommendations for measurement of bone mineral density and identifying persons to be treated for osteoporosis [^111S7VTX]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines exist for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women. These guidelines present a uniform set of recommendations. Unfortunately, studies have shown a low rate of screening and treatment, particularly in high-risk groups, such as patients who have experienced a fracture. It is hoped that quality improvement projects, such as that being conducted by the American Medical Association in conjunction with numerous specialty societies, will lead to an improvement in physician practices in this area that will result in a reduction in morbidity and mortality from osteoporotic fractures.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^117Bg992]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Target Population

Postmenopausal patients with primary osteoporosis.

Methods

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of two specialists in obstetrics and gynecology appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Gynecology and one external subject matter expert. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

Recommendations

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes updated recommendations on who should receive osteoporosis pharmacotherapy, the benefits and risks of available pharmacotherapy options, treatment monitoring and follow-up, and the role of calcium and vitamin D in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence.

### Postmenopausal osteoporosis: a review of latest guidelines [^113mgmFo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is characterized by increased bone turnover and reduced bone mass, leading to skeletal fragility and heightened fracture risk. It is a growing public health concern with expectations for a continued significant rise of fractures by 50% in 2030. Diagnosis is typically based on body mineral density with a T-score of -2.5 or lower indicating osteoporosis. Treatment duration varies, and is determined by careful monitoring of fracture risk and timing for potential drug holidays. Emerging therapies and ongoing research continue to evolve the landscape of osteoporosis management, aiming to reduce fracture risk and improve patient outcomes.

### Preventing osteoporosis in symptomatic postmenopausal women [^116z73Nw]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a common postmenopausal disease that has a substantial impact on the quality of life of older women and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There are various options for preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and all are associated with differing benefit-risk profiles. Estrogen therapy (in hysterectomized women) and estrogen/progestogen therapy (in nonhysterectomized women) are the most effective treatments available for the relief of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms in postmenopausal women and provide significant protection against osteoporotic fractures. Selective estrogen receptor modulators reduce bone loss and prevent vertebral fractures without endometrial or breast stimulation. Raloxifene, the only selective estrogen receptor modulator approved for osteoporosis prevention and treatment, significantly reduces vertebral but not nonvertebral or hip fractures. Bisphosphonates prevent bone loss and vertebral fractures; however, not all bisphosphonates have been shown to prevent nonvertebral fractures. Selective estrogen receptor modulators and bisphosphonates are not effective for menopausal symptoms. Hormone therapy should be considered as first-line therapy for preventing bone loss and fractures in early postmenopausal women who are symptomatic; other options include selective estrogen receptor modulators and bisphosphonates, especially in older, nonsymptomatic women. Future therapies are likely to include newer selective estrogen receptor modulators, combinations of estrogen with selective estrogen receptor modulators, and denosumab.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111JKrBo]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Evaluating patients for and with osteoporosis — background: osteoporosis is the most common bone disorder affecting humans and is characterized by compromised bone strength that predisposes to increased risk of fracture, most importantly of the spine and hip; serious fractures occur most commonly in older postmenopausal women and are often life-altering events, whereas wrist fractures in young postmenopausal women are important warning signs. The bone loss that results in osteoporosis is most marked during the menopause transition and early menopause. Persons with osteoporosis and high risk of fracture can be readily identified; both general and pharmacologic management strategies are available to slow or prevent bone loss and to reduce fracture risk, and skeletal health assessment should be a part of the routine evaluation of all postmenopausal women.

Estrogen and menopausal hormone therapy in postmenopausal osteoporosis — scope and regulatory status are as follows: Although once considered the treatment of choice for postmenopausal osteoporosis, estrogen was never specifically approved for this use, and estrogen is approved by the FDA for prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis with the caveat that "when prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, therapy should only be considered for women at significant risk of osteoporosis and for whom non-estrogen medications are not considered to be appropriate".

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^1119ZgPK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline development — GRADE framework and recommendation structure: The Writing Committee consisted of five content experts representing endocrinology and epidemiology, two members brought an international perspective, and a clinical practice guideline methodologist led the comparative effectiveness team performing the systematic reviews and meta-analyses and supervised application of the GRADE framework, including quality of evidence assessments and strength of recommendation designations. The development process combines elements of the GRADE framework with an approach for rare endocrine diseases when evidence is limited or nonexistent; the Society applies GRADE steps to questions with an ample body of knowledge of low quality or higher, and resulting recommendations are classified by quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. Where evidence is extremely limited and/or not systematically analyzed, recommendations are based on an expert review of the limited data, and some guidelines also include ungraded good practice statements. Guideline recommendations include the relevant population, intervention, comparator, and outcome, and when further clarification on implementation is needed, technical remarks are included.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113q6QQt]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — monitoring and follow-up: Bone mineral density (BMD) testing should be repeated 1 to 2 years after beginning osteoporosis therapy, with patients on bisphosphonates reassessed again at 5 years to determine whether a bisphosphonate holiday would be considered; routine use of bone turnover markers is not recommended and follow-up contact by an office nurse may be the most effective means to enhance adherence; depending on treatment, an appropriate interval for repeat BMD testing is 1 to 2 years after beginning treatment or when a change in therapy is considered, and initial dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and follow-up scans should ideally be performed on the same instrument using the same procedure, with careful attention to DXA quality control; if progressive loss of BMD or fractures occur on therapy, evaluate for reasons for suboptimal response, even when treatment increases T-score values above −2.5 ongoing management is required, and referral to bone specialists is recommended for women with very low T-scores, inadequate treatment response, or additional factors requiring special management.

Bone mineral density measurements — potential uses in postmenopausal women include screening for osteoporosis, establishing the severity of osteoporosis or bone loss in patients with suspected osteoporosis, determining fracture risk especially when combined with other risk factors for fractures, and identifying candidates for pharmacologic intervention; additional uses include assessing changes in bone density over time in treated and untreated patients, enhancing acceptance of and perhaps adherence with treatment, and assessing skeletal consequences of diseases, conditions, or medications known to cause bone loss.

Treat to target bone mineral density (BMD) — an alternative decision framework is described as "treat to target" BMD, where clinicians "choose therapy that will most likely achieve the target BMD, change to a more potent agent if the initial therapy is not achieving the BMD goal, and stop when fracture risk is at an acceptable low level", acknowledging that "Existing therapies, however, may not be potent enough to achieve the target or maintain the target BMD once it is stopped".

### Fracture risk reduction and safety by osteoporosis treatment compared with placebo or active comparator in postmenopausal women: systematic review, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis of randomised clinical trials [^116ZrYmf]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

The current available evidence indicates that, despite the varying quality of the reported studies, most approved treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis are beneficial for all types of fractures, with head-to-head trials favouring bone anabolic treatments over bisphosphonates in the prevention of clinical and vertebral fractures, and romosozumab followed by alendronate over alendronate in the prevention of hip fractures in patients at high risk of fractures. Overall, the nominal certainty in the evidence was rated down based on the GRADE criteria because of the serious risk of bias across all treatment combinations and outcomes. For the bone anabolic treatments, a risk of imprecision also existed because only a few studies were available.

The results of the meta-regression analysis showed that treatments were beneficial in reducing the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women, and the effect was mostly independent of baseline risk indicators. Treatment with bone anabolic agents effectively reduced clinical and vertebral fractures, irrespective of mean age and baseline risk, whereas antiresorptive treatments seemed more effective in older patients. Because bone anabolic treatments were more effective than bisphosphonates, irrespective of the baseline risk, no evidence from clinical trials exists supporting the view that bone anabolic treatment should be limited to patients at very high risk of fractures because of efficacy.

### Meta-analyses of therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis. V. meta-analysis of the efficacy of hormone replacement therapy in treating and preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [^114sQnxr]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women.

Data Source

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1966 to 1999, the Cochrane Controlled Register, citations of relevant articles, and proceedings of international meetings for eligible randomized controlled trials. We contacted osteoporosis investigators to identify additional studies, and primary authors for unpublished data.

Study Selection

We included 57 studies that randomized postmenopausal women to HRT or a control (placebo or calcium/vitamin D) and were of at least 1 yr in duration. Seven of these studies reported fractures.

Data Abstraction

For each study, three independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and abstracted the data.

Data Synthesis

HRT showed a trend toward reduced incidence of vertebral fractures [relative risk (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41–1.07; 5 trials] and nonvertebral fractures (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71–1.08; 6 trials). HRT had a consistent effect on bone mineral density (BMD) at all sites. The difference between HRT and control in the percent change in bone density at 2 yr was 6.76 (5.83, 7.89; 21 trials) at the lumbar spine and 4.53 (3.68, 5.36; 14 trials) and 4.12 (3.45, 4.80; 9 trials) at the forearm and femoral neck, respectively.

Conclusions

HRT has a consistent, favorable and large effect on bone density at all sites. The data show a nonsignificant trend toward a reduced incidence in vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.

Successful treatment and treat-to-target concepts — postmenopausal osteoporosis: Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments aim to prevent fractures, randomized trials have demonstrated a reduction in fracture risk in patients with stable or increasing BMD receiving pharmacologic therapy, particularly with bisphosphonates versus placebo, and the goal of treatment is prevention of fractures although no treatment can eliminate risk of fracture. A fracture during therapy is not necessarily a treatment failure and should trigger reconsideration of fracture risk factors and possible changes in treatment strategies; the risk of fracture is higher after a recent fracture and diminishes over time, and the number, severity, and recency of vertebral fractures are directly correlated with risk of future fractures. Response to therapy is not necessarily the same as achieving an acceptable level of fracture risk, leading to proposals for treat-to-target goals; an ASBMR/NOF task force was formed to review evidence and propose targets, but at this time treatment targets have not been identified. When treatment is initiated due to a low DXA T-score (such as −2.5 or lower), a higher T-score is an intuitive target, and when treatment is started due to high fracture probability with FRAX it is intuitive that fracture probability be reduced below the threshold for starting treatment; a change in BTMs is also a possible target, and challenges to defining targets include limited comparative effectiveness data, lack of consensus on acceptable risk, and limited effectiveness particularly for nonvertebral fractures.

### Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women [^1117ccbw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration, leading to increased fracture risk. Alendronate belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts (bone cells that break down bone tissue). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women at lower and higher risk of fracture, respectively.

Search Methods

We searched Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (which includes CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, two trial registers, drug approval agency websites, and the bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews to identify the studies included in this review. The latest search date was 01 February 2023. We imposed no restrictions on language, date, form of publication, or reported outcomes.

Eligibility Criteria

We included only randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of alendronate on postmenopausal women. Targeted participants must have received at least one year of alendronate. We classified a study as secondary prevention if its population met one or more of the following hierarchical criteria: a diagnosis of osteoporosis, a history of vertebral fractures, a low bone mineral density T-score (-2.5 or lower), and 75 years old or older. If a study population met none of those criteria, we classified it as a primary prevention study.

Outcomes

Our major outcomes were clinical vertebral, non-vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane risk of bias 1 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Based on the previous review experience, in which the clinical and methodological characteristics in the primary and secondary prevention studies were homogeneous, we used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis and estimated effects using the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. Our base case analyses included all eligible placebo-controlled studies with usable data. We selected the data available for the longest treatment period. We consider a relative change exceeding 15% as clinically important.

Included Studies

We included 119 studies, of which 102 studies provided data for quantitative synthesis. Of these, we classified 34 studies (15,188 participants) as primary prevention and 68 studies (29,577 participants) as secondary prevention. We had concerns about risks of bias in most studies. Selection bias was the most frequently overlooked domain, with only 20 studies (19%) describing appropriate methods for both sequence generation and allocation concealment. Eight studies (8%) were at low risk of bias in all seven domains.

Synthesis Of Results

The base case analyses included 16 primary prevention studies (one to five years in length; 10,057 women) and 20 secondary prevention studies (one to three years in length; 7375 women) which compared alendronate 10 mg/day (or 70 mg/week) to placebo, no treatment, or both. Indirectness, imprecision, and risk of bias emerged as the main factors contributing to the downgrading of the certainty of the evidence. For primary prevention, alendronate may lead to a clinically important reduction in clinical vertebral fractures (16/1190 in the alendronate group versus 24/926 in the placebo group; RR 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.84; absolute risk reduction [ARR] 1.4% fewer, 95% CI 1.9% fewer to 0.4% fewer; low-certainty evidence) and non-vertebral fractures (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; ARR 1.6% fewer, 95% CI 2.6% fewer to 0.3% fewer; low-certainty evidence). However, clinically important differences were not observed for the following outcomes: hip fractures (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.32; ARR 0.2% fewer, 95% CI 0.4% fewer to 0.2% more; low-certainty evidence); wrist fractures (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49; ARR 0.3% more, 95% CI 0.4% fewer to 1.1% more; low-certainty evidence); withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.18; ARR 0.2% more, 95% CI 0.9% fewer to 1.5% more; low-certainty evidence); and serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43; ARR 0.5% more, 95% CI 1.2% fewer to 2.8% more; low-certainty evidence). For secondary prevention, alendronate probably results in a clinically important reduction in clinical vertebral fractures (24/1114 in the alendronate group versus 51/1055 in the placebo group; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.73; ARR 2.7% fewer, 95% CI 3.5% fewer to 1.3% fewer; moderate-certainty evidence). It may lead to a clinically important reduction in non-vertebral fractures (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; ARR 2.8% fewer, 95% CI 5.1% fewer to 0.1% fewer; low-certainty evidence); hip fractures (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.96; ARR 1.0% fewer, 95% CI 1.5% fewer to 0.1% fewer; low-certainty evidence); wrist fractures (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.90; ARR 1.8% fewer, 95% CI 2.6% fewer to 0.4% fewer; low-certainty evidence); and serious adverse events (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; ARR 3.5% fewer, 95% CI 5.8% fewer to 0.6% fewer; low-certainty evidence). However, the effects of alendronate for withdrawals due to adverse events are uncertain (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.16; ARR 0.4% fewer, 95% CI 1.7% fewer to 1.3% more; very low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, the updated evidence for the safety risks of alendronate suggests that, irrespective of participants' risk of fracture, alendronate may lead to little or no difference for gastrointestinal adverse events. Zero incidents of osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fracture were observed.

Authors' Conclusions

For primary prevention, compared to placebo, alendronate 10 mg/day may reduce clinical vertebral and non-vertebral fractures, but it might make little or no difference to hip and wrist fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events. For secondary prevention, alendronate probably reduces clinical vertebral fractures, and may reduce non-vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures, and serious adverse events, compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of alendronate on withdrawals due to adverse events.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116TaHEX]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society 2021 — osteoanabolic therapies — These bone-building drugs stimulate bone formation and restore trabecular structure; because effects diminish over time, therapy with anabolic agents is limited to treatment intervals of 12 to 24 months. Bone mineral density is lost rapidly when osteoanabolic agents are discontinued, so to maximize benefits these therapies should always be followed by an antiresorptive drug. Osteoanabolic therapies are more effective than antiresorptive agents at increasing BMD and reducing fractures and should be the initial therapy for osteoporosis in women at very high or imminent risk of fracture.

We review the methodologic quality of the individual randomized trials and summarize the impact of different treatments on the risk of fractures and bone density. We present an estimate of the expected impact of anti-osteoporosis interventions on fracture incidence in prevention and treatment populations using numbers needed to treat. We also examine the relationship between changes in bone density and the relative risk reduction for vertebral and nonvertebral fractures using regression analyses drawn from the results of the systematic reviews. We also outline other important facets of the decision-making process regarding osteoporosis therapy, including attitudes toward uncertainty, circumstances, and patients' and societal preferences.

### Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis with pharmacological therapy: practice and possibilities [^113AFatP]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) is a common disease that will become more prevalent in the future, with costly implications for public health. Prevention of the disease and its consequences, namely fractures, is therefore, important for both the individual and society. This review discusses: the goals of PMO prevention; the identification of women at risk, including the use of bone mineral density and bone turnover markers; the relevance in the prevention setting of various current guidelines for PMO management; recent data on therapeutic options for the treatment and prevention of PMO, in particular bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy and several other new pharmacological agents. It concludes that it is crucial for PMO prevention to start before disease onset and that, in the light of recent evidence, the existing guidelines need updating if they are to continue to be relevant.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D and calcium supplementation: The IOM recommends 600 IU for women aged between 50 and 70 years and 800 IU daily for those aged older than 70 years, stating these intakes were sufficient to achieve serum 25-OHD levels of at least 20 ng/mL in most postmenopausal women, but meta-analyses report inconsistent fracture outcomes with most showing no benefit; in the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial bone health substudy, 2,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) daily for 24 months in healthy women (average age, 63 y; baseline serum 25-OHD 27.6 ng/mL) showed no effect overall or in those with baseline serum 25-OHD less than 30 ng/mL; salutary effects of vitamin D with calcium on fracture risk have been observed most often in institutionalized or vitamin D-deficient older adults; the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of daily vitamin D alone to prevent fractures and recommended against vitamin D supplements to prevent falls; women with osteoporosis do not require more calcium than those with normal bone mineral density (BMD), there is no convincing evidence that taking calcium and vitamin D supplements improves the effectiveness of osteoporosis drugs, and adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D are recommended when taking osteoporosis drugs to reduce the risk of treatment-induced hypocalcemia.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116L6LEC]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Osteoporosis key points — Hormone therapy prevents bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, with dose-dependent effects on bone density (Level I), and hormone therapy reduces fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal women (Level I). Hormone therapy is FDA approved for prevention of bone loss, but not for treatment of osteoporosis (Level I). In the absence of contraindications, in women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, systemic hormone therapy is an appropriate therapy to protect against bone loss (Level I). Unless contraindicated, women with premature menopause without prior fragility fracture or osteoporosis are best served with hormone therapy or oral contraceptives to prevent bone density loss and reduce fracture risk, rather than other bone-specific treatments, until the average age of menopause, when treatment may be reassessed (Level II). Decisions regarding initiating and discontinuation of hormone therapy should be made primarily on the basis of extraskeletal benefits (ie, reduction of VMS) and risks (Level III).

Public health impact of osteoporosis — burden and epidemiology in the U.S.: The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) estimates that 10.2 million Americans have osteoporosis and that an additional 43.4 million have low bone mass, and more than 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures occur annually in the U.S.; more than 70% of these occur in women. In the U.S., the costs of osteoporotic fracture are estimated to be more than $25 billion by 2025, yet less than 1 in 4 women aged 67 years or older with an osteoporosis-related fracture get bone density measured or begins osteoporosis treatment. The annual cost of caring for osteoporotic fractures exceeds the annual costs of caring for breast cancer, myocardial infarction, or stroke in women aged 55 years and older. By age 60 years, half of white women have low bone mass (osteopenia) or osteoporosis. The average femoral neck T-score by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for 75-year-old women is −2.5, and more than 20% of postmenopausal women have prevalent vertebral fractures.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — pharmacotherapy selection, sequencing, and duration: If the treatment goal is not achieved with bisphosphonates, switching to denosumab or an osteoanabolic drug should be considered, and if the treatment target is reached after 3 to 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy, discontinuation for an interval could be considered with plans to restart if bone loss or fractures occur; if raloxifene or denosumab therapy is stopped, switching to a bisphosphonate would be indicated to prevent rapid BMD loss and loss of fracture protection, and osteoanabolic therapy should always be followed by a bisphosphonate or by denosumab; bisphosphonates require caution in significantly impaired renal function, a holiday should be considered only in women at low fracture risk who no longer meet criteria, and for those remaining at high fracture risk after 3 to 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy, continue treatment or switch to another drug; denosumab is appropriate for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis including those at high fracture risk, there is no limit to its duration, and administration should not be delayed or stopped beyond 7 months without subsequent therapy to prevent bone loss and vertebral fractures; osteoanabolic therapies are most appropriately used in women at very high risk of fracture, including very low BMD (T-score below −3.0), and anabolic therapy should be followed by an antiresorptive agent, with bone mineral density gains greater when an anabolic drug is administered before an antiresorptive drug compared with the opposite sequence.

Role of BMD in diagnosis and clinical decision-making: For women without prior fragility fractures, BMD is the single best predictor of osteoporotic fracture risk, and for every 1–standard deviation decrease in age-adjusted BMD the relative risk of fracture increases 1.6 to 2.6-fold; the relationship between bone density and fracture risk is a continuum, without a clear fracture threshold.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115WDEPE]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Therapy considerations — osteoanabolic therapy results in larger, faster gains in BMD and better protection from fractures than do bisphosphonates; anabolic therapy should be followed by a potent antiresorbing agent to maintain gains in BMD, and gains are greater when the anabolic drug is administered before the antiresorbing drug compared with the opposite sequence. The best candidates are women at very high risk of fracture, including those with prior and especially recent fractures, very low BMD (T-score below −3.0), and those who sustain fractures or lose BMD while taking antiresorbing therapy. For sequencing, beginning therapy with an osteoanabolic agent followed by an antiresorbing drug is most likely to achieve osteoporosis treatment goals, and the increase in BMD and fracture protection achieved with 12 to 18 months of osteoanabolic treatment persists for at least 2 years after transition to a bisphosphonate or denosumab.

### Treat-to-target for osteoporosis: is now the time? [^111VUTnZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Current clinical practice guidelines identify patients at high risk for fracture who are likely to benefit from pharmacological therapy and suggest ways to monitor for effectiveness of therapy. However, there is no clear guidance on when fracture risk has been reduced to an acceptably low level. As a consequence, some patients at low risk for fracture may be treated for longer than necessary, whereas others at high risk for fracture may have treatment stopped when they might benefit from continuation of the same treatment or a change to a more potent therapeutic agent. The objective of this statement is to describe the potential clinical utility of developing a "treat-to-target" strategy for the management of patients with osteoporosis.

Participants

We recommend that a task force of clinicians, clinical investigators, and other stakeholders in the care of osteoporosis explore the options, review the evidence, and identify additional areas for investigation to establish osteoporosis treatment targets.

Evidence

Data from large, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled registration trials for currently available osteoporosis therapies should be analyzed for commonalities of correlations between easily measured endpoints and fracture risk.

Consensus Process

Osteoporosis experts, professional organizations, and patient care advocates should be involved in the process of developing consensus on easily measurable osteoporosis treatment targets that are supported by the best available evidence and likely to be accepted by clinicians and patients in the care of osteoporosis.

Conclusions

A treat-to-target strategy for osteoporosis offers the potential of improving osteoporosis care by reducing the burden of osteoporotic fractures and limiting adverse effects of therapy.

### Clinical practice. postmenopausal osteoporosis [^113WfNAn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Key Clinical Points Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Fractures and osteoporosis are common, particularly among older women, and hip fractures can be devastating. Treatment is generally recommended in postmenopausal women who have a bone mineral density T score of -2.5 or less, a history of spine or hip fracture, or a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score indicating increased fracture risk. Bisphosphonates (generic) and denosumab reduce the risk of hip, nonvertebral, and vertebral fractures; bisphosphonates are commonly used as first-line treatment in women who do not have contraindications. Teriparatide reduces the risk of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures. Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures have been reported with treatment but are rare. The benefit-to-risk ratio for osteoporosis treatment is strongly positive for most women with osteoporosis. Because benefits are retained after discontinuation of alendronate or zoledronic acid, drug holidays after 5 years of alendronate therapy or 3 years of zoledronic acid therapy may be considered for patients at lower risk for fracture.

### Risedronate for the prevention of fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis [^116S9q9M]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate current scientific literature regarding the efficacy of risedronate in the prevention of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Data Sources

Primary research articles were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-May 2001) and through secondary sources. Key search terms were risedronate, postmenopausal osteoporosis, and fractures.

Data Synthesis

Osteoporosis results in a reduction of bone mineral density, increased bone fragility, and increased risk of fractures. The goal of osteoporosis therapy is not only to increase bone mass, but also to reduce the rate of fractures. Risedronate is the newest bisphosphonate to be approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. An evaluation of clinical trials using risedronate in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was performed to determine its efficacy at decreasing fracture rates.

Conclusions

Risedronate is an effective and safe option for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Risedronate significantly decreases the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in women who have had ≥ 1 fractures in the past. More studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of risedronate in women without preexisting vertebral fractures.

ABSTRACT

Despite a high burden of osteoporosis and minimal trauma fractures worldwide, there is still a treatment gap in timely diagnosis and optimal treatment. There is also a lack of international consensus and guidelines on the management of bone fragility in premenopausal women. This review article provides an overview of the current understanding of factors impacting women's bone health across the adult lifespan, as well as dilemmas in the diagnosis, assessment and management of osteoporosis in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, premature ovarian insufficiency and bone health following breast cancer.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — bone loss trajectory is characterized by an average annual rate of bone loss of about 2%, beginning 1 to 3 years before menopause and lasting for 5 to 10 years, resulting in an average loss of bone mineral density (BMD) of 10% to 12% in the spine and hip across the menopausal transition; after this rapid phase, bone density decreases about 0.5% per year, and by age 80 years, women have lost, on average, approximately 30% of their peak bone mass.

### Treatment sequence for osteoporosis [^116YbzR7]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a chronic progressive disease that requires lifelong monitoring and treatment. Sequencing from one treatment to another at different ages and stages of disease is an approach that can maximize benefits and avoid potential risks from long-term treatment with a single agent.

Objective

This article reviews clinical trial data in postmenopausal women that evaluate the effects of antiresorptive agents followed by other antiresorptives, osteoanabolic agents followed by antiresorptives, and antiresorptives followed by osteoanabolic medications.

Methods

Literature review and discussion.

Results

When medications are discontinued, in the absence of sequential therapy, bone turnover rates return to baseline or above baseline, and bone loss occurs. The rate of bone loss differs for different treatments, with a very slow decline after stopping bisphosphonates and a particularly rapid decline after stopping denosumab. Careful attention to osteoporosis medication transitions can mitigate bone density loss and its consequences. For women who remain at high risk, switching from bisphosphonates to the more potent antiresorptive, denosumab, will result in further improvement in bone mineral density (BMD). When indicated, stopping denosumab can be accomplished safely by transition to an adequate bisphosphonate regimen. For high- and very-high-risk patients, treating with osteoanabolic agents first, followed by antiresorptive agents, produces substantially larger BMD gains than the reverse treatment sequence, with the biggest differences seen for BMD of the hip.

Conclusion

Awareness of the importance of treatment sequences can help improve osteoporosis care across the postmenopausal lifespan.

Optimal duration of treatment and drug holidays — "treatment of 3 to 5 years" with osteoporosis therapies is "highly beneficial with only minimal risk", but long-term decisions depend on medication type. For bisphosphonates, evidence "includes two randomized trials (one of alendronate and one of zoledronic acid)" and data "beyond 5 years", and "These studies support a residual effect of bisphosphonates after stopping, which support bisphosphonate holidays". In contrast, "for all other therapies… after discontinuation, benefits are quickly lost", so "these therapies must be continued indefinitely or followed with bisphosphonates or another type of therapy to retain the gains achieved".

Abstract

Objective

To review the comparative effectiveness of osteoporosis treatments, including the bone anabolic agents, abaloparatide and romosozumab, on reducing the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women, and to characterise the effect of antiosteoporosis drug treatments on the risk of fractures according to baseline risk factors.

Design

Systematic review, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis of randomised clinical trials.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library to identify randomised controlled trials published between 1 January 1996 and 24 November 2021 that examined the effect of bisphosphonates, denosumab, selective oestrogen receptor modulators, parathyroid hormone receptor agonists, and romosozumab compared with placebo or active comparator.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised controlled trials that included non-Asian postmenopausal women with no restriction on age, when interventions looked at bone quality in a broad perspective. The primary outcome was clinical fractures. Secondary outcomes were vertebral, non-vertebral, hip, and major osteoporotic fractures, all cause mortality, adverse events, and serious cardiovascular adverse events.

Results

The results were based on 69 trials (> 80 000 patients). For clinical fractures, synthesis of the results showed a protective effect of bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone receptor agonists, and romosozumab compared with placebo. Compared with parathyroid hormone receptor agonists, bisphosphonates were less effective in reducing clinical fractures (odds ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 2.00). Compared with parathyroid hormone receptor agonists and romosozumab, denosumab was less effective in reducing clinical fractures (odds ratio 1.85, 1.18 to 2.92 for denosumab v parathyroid hormone receptor agonists and 1.56, 1.02 to 2.39 for denosumab v romosozumab). An effect of all treatments on vertebral fractures compared with placebo was found. In the active treatment comparisons, denosumab, parathyroid hormone receptor agonists, and romosozumab were more effective than oral bisphosphonates in preventing vertebral fractures. The effect of all treatments was unaffected by baseline risk indicators, except for antiresorptive treatments that showed a greater reduction of clinical fractures compared with placebo with increasing mean age (number of studies = 17; β = 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 0.99). No harm outcomes were seen. The certainty in the effect estimates was moderate to low for all individual outcomes, mainly because of limitations in reporting, nominally indicating a serious risk of bias and imprecision.

Conclusions

The evidence indicated a benefit of a range of treatments for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women for clinical and vertebral fractures. Bone anabolic treatments were more effective than bisphosphonates in the prevention of clinical and vertebral fractures, irrespective of baseline risk indicators. Hence this analysis provided no clinical evidence for restricting the use of anabolic treatment to patients with a very high risk of fractures.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — risk communication and shared decision-making emphasize patient participation, with effective risk communication making clinician and patient privy to the same information and serving as the first step toward shared decision-making. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials found that most communication formats increased patients' understanding of the medical evidence, and understanding was enhanced when methods were individualized and/or interactive with decision aids. In a randomized controlled trial in primary care, presenting treatment benefit and harms using absolute risk estimates expressed by icon arrays with human figures and hip fracture risk calculated by FRAX led to greater treatment acceptance than presenting the same information as RRs. Another randomized trial in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density evaluated a decision aid — a tailored pictograph of 10-year fracture probability, absolute risk reduction with bisphosphonates, side effects, and cost — versus a standard brochure; the decision aid improved the quality of clinical decisions and may have improved adherence but did not affect rates of initiating treatment. Regular contact with a health-care professional after starting osteoporosis treatment appears to be one of the few interventions shown to improve adherence. Overall, the best available evidence suggests that communication skills can be learned, decision aids may be helpful, and that shared decision-making may improve clinical outcomes.

### Sequential therapy for the long-term treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^112K5AW6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic condition characterized by decreased bone mass, loss of skeletal integrity, and increased susceptibility to fracture. Drugs used to treat osteoporosis can be classified as those that block bone resorption (antiresorptive), stimulate bone formation (anabolic), or do both. While all currently approved medications reduce the risk of fragility fractures in high-risk populations, they are generally unable to fully restore bone strength in most patients with established disease. Thus, the majority of patients require disease management over many years. Unfortunately, the continuous use of a single drug has limitations, both in terms of efficacy and safety, and so sequential therapy is commonly required. Given the expanding list of pharmacological agents currently available, careful consideration needs to be given as to which drugs to use and in what sequence. This review will evaluate the differential effects of antiresorptive, bone-forming, and dual-acting drugs when used in specific sequences and will explore the current evidence favoring the initial use of bone-forming/dual-acting drugs followed by antiresorptive medications. This review will also examine the notion that long-term treatment with an antiresorptive drug may diminish the efficacy of subsequent treatment with a bone-forming/dual-acting drug. Finally, this review will explore the current evidence pertaining to the specific issue of how to best prevent the clinical ramifications of denosumab cessation.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — estrogen with progestin and fracture effects: When estrogen is prescribed for a patient with an intact uterus, a progestin should also be used, either daily or cyclically, to protect against endometrial stimulation. In the WHI, conjugated equine estrogen (0.625 mg daily), with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate, was shown to reduce the risk of fractures of the spine, hip, and nonvertebral sites in postmenopausal women. Current recommendations are to use estrogen for the relief of menopausal symptoms in the lowest dose necessary and for the shortest time possible.

Calcium and vitamin D are useful adjunctive therapies in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Peak BMD is optimally achieved with sustained optimal calcium and vitamin D intakes. Calcium and vitamin D intakes continue to be important after the third decade and into senescence. Although calcium and vitamin D are not therapies to be used alone to prevent early postmenopausal bone loss, they assume more prominent roles in late menopause and in the elderly to preserve bone health with advancing age. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is an important adjunctive therapy to use together with antiresorptive therapies.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis pharmacologic therapy — indications: Pharmacologic therapy is strongly recommended for patients with osteopenia or low bone mass and a history of fragility fracture of the hip or spine; for patients with a T-score of −2.5 or lower in the spine, femoral neck, total hip, or 1/3 radius; and for patients with a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 if the FRAX 10-year probability for major osteoporotic fracture is ≥ 20% or the 10-year probability of hip fracture is ≥ 3% in the U.S. or above the country-specific threshold elsewhere.

### Denosumab versus bisphosphonates for reducing fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: a meta-analysis [^115ejxyi]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There are multiple classes of pharmacologic agents approved for treatment of osteoporosis, but their costs vary widely, and systematic data on their efficacy compared with the traditional standard, bisphosphonates, for reducing fractures in postmenopausal women are lacking. The objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the efficacy of denosumab compared with bisphosphonates.

Methods

Researchers selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing denosumab to bisphosphonates that included information on clinical and/or osteoporotic fracture events over the follow-up period. Each clinical outcome was meta-analyzed using a fixed-effects analysis, with clinical and osteoporotic fractures as the outcomes of interest. A meta-regression was performed using change in bone mineral density (BMD) as the moderator variable.

Results

Seven RCTs were included. Denosumab was not associated with a reduction in clinical or osteoporotic fractures compared with bisphosphonates. There was no association between the change in BMD with denosumab and bisphosphonates and denosumab's effect on both osteoporotic and clinical fractures.

Discussion

Existing data do not support the use of the more expensive denosumab as a first-line agent over bisphosphonates for reduction of fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. One limitation in this study was each RCT was not individually powered for fracture incidences.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society guideline update [^115mvWot]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective is to provide an update of the 2019 Pharmacological Management of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for the pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women using romosozumab.

Conclusions

We reviewed findings from the meta-analysis and primary clinical trials assessing the efficacy of romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting sclerostin, for the prevention of fractures and concluded that this agent can be considered a treatment option for postmenopausal women at very high risk for osteoporotic fracture. The romosozumab label has a boxed warning, recommending careful consideration by the treating clinician as to cardiovascular risk profile in the individual woman who might receive this agent, since clinical trial data from an active comparator study show an imbalance in serious cardiovascular adverse events between romosozumab and alendronate.

### Osteoporosis: common questions and answers [^112fHFeJ]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis affects 10.2% of adults older than 50 years and is expected to increase to 13.6% by 2030. Osteoporotic fractures, specifically hip fractures, significantly affect morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Screening for osteoporosis with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry should be considered for all women 65 years and older or women who are postmenopausal with clinical risk factors. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation recommends screening men 70 years and older and men with clinical risk factors; however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force did not find sufficient evidence to support routine screening in men. Osteoporosis can be diagnosed by a T-score of -2.5 or less or the presence of a fragility fracture. All patients with osteoporosis should be counseled on weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and calcium and vita-min D supplementation. Treatment of osteoporosis is influenced by the patient's fracture risk, the effectiveness of fracture risk reduction, and medication safety. Patients at high risk of fracture should consider treatment with antiresorptive therapy, including bisphosphonates and denosumab. Anabolic agents such as teriparatide, abaloparatide, and romosozumab should be considered for patients at very high risk or with previous vertebral fractures.

### Denosumab, a RANK ligand inhibitor, for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^113AGmdT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for use of denosumab for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was conducted during January 2012, using the terms denosumab and osteoporosis, with index dates of 2000 to 2011. Additional information was gathered from Amgen and references cited in articles retrieved.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language articles including clinical trials involving denosumab for treatment of osteoporosis and review articles were reviewed. Articles using denosumab in males or as treatment for conditions other than osteoporosis or osteopenia were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Many clinical trials have supported the safety and efficacy of denosumab in postmenopausal women with bone loss. It has been shown to improve bone mineral density, decrease markers of bone turnover, and prevent new vertebral fractures. It shows improvement over placebo in studies and has at least similar efficacy to alendronate in measurements of bone mineral density, with less risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical fracture, but with an increased risk of infections and neoplasms. European cost-effectiveness studies have also demonstrated that denosumab is a cost-effective choice compared to risedronate and no treatment for fracture prevention for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

Conclusions

Denosumab has demonstrated efficacy and safety as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis in multiple clinical trials over at least 6 years. It may be most cost-effective for women who are unable or refuse to take bisphosphonate drugs.

### Osteoporosis [^1111Tuva]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Osteoporotic fractures are common and result in extensive morbidity and mortality. It is possible to decrease the risk of fracture in postmenopausal, male, and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis with appropriate screening and treatment. The assessment of fracture risk, for which bone densitometry is only 1 component, should be the main focus of patient evaluation. Epidemiologically derived risk-assessment tools such as World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) provide physicians with a way to determine the 10-year risk of osteoporotic fracture and effectively choose candidates for therapy. A number of potent skeletal antiresorptive and anabolic drugs have become available to treat osteoporosis and prevent up to 70% of fractures. Here, we provide a detailed update on clinical osteoporosis, the contribution of bone densitometry, and the approach to patients using risk assessment in the consideration of treatments. Progress in osteoporosis is an example of successful bench-to-bedside research benefitting populations worldwide.

Agents that inhibit bone resorption — mechanism, fracture protection timing, and safety are summarized as follows: Antiremodeling agents inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts, and secondarily, bone formation, with treatment resulting in increased BMD and skeletal strength and decreased fracture risk. These drugs do not repair deficits in trabecular architecture, and denosumab, the most potent inhibitor of bone remodeling, does reduce porosity in cortical bone. Protection from fractures occurs within 1 year of beginning therapy, persists as long as treatment is given, and wanes when treatment is stopped. Hypocalcemia has been reported with some of these agents, and low serum calcium should be corrected before beginning treatment.

Calcium and vitamin D — In postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density and at high risk of fractures with osteoporosis, we suggest that calcium and vitamin D be used as an adjunct to osteoporosis therapies. In postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture with osteoporosis who cannot tolerate bisphosphonates, estrogen, selective estrogen response modulators, denosumab, tibolone, teriparatide, and abaloparatide, we recommend daily calcium and vitamin D supplementation to prevent hip fractures.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^117JcT9i]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Prevention versus treatment approvals and treatment effects — drugs are approved by North American regulatory agencies for either preventing or treating osteoporosis or both, and although North American guidelines since 2008 have focused on reducing fracture risk and do not recognize preventing osteoporosis by halting postmenopausal bone loss, various oral and transdermal estrogen preparations (alone or with progestogens or bazedoxifene [BZA]), raloxifene, tibolone (in Mexico only), and four bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronate) have government approval for prevention of osteoporosis; bone density benefits persist while therapy continues but abate when estrogen-like drugs are discontinued, markers of bone turnover return to pretreatment within a few months and BMD falls to pretreatment within 1 to 2 years after stopping therapy, an effect prevented by switching to a bisphosphonate; a strong clinical argument can be made for prevention particularly in women entering menopause with low bone mass because on average women lose about one T-score unit (10–12%) of bone mass across a normal menopause transition with significant and irreversible deterioration in trabecular architecture that is preventable with estrogen and bisphosphonates; additional support comes from women with AIs for nonmetastatic breast cancer in whom bisphosphonates and denosumab prevented bone loss and denosumab reduced vertebral fractures by 50% within the first year of treatment, including in women with normal BMD at baseline.

### A comparison of US and Canadian osteoporosis screening and treatment strategies in postmenopausal women [^114U2J2M]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The optimal approach to osteoporosis screening and treatment in postmenopausal women is unclear. We compared (i) the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and Osteoporosis Canada osteoporosis screening strategies; and (ii) the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) and Canadian treatment strategies. We used data from the prospective Women's Health Initiative Observational Study and Clinical Trials of women aged 50 to 79 years at baseline (n = 117,707 followed for self-reported fractures; n = 8134 in bone mineral density [BMD] subset). We determined the yield of the screening and treatment strategies in identifying women who experienced major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) during a 10-year follow-up. Among women aged 50 to 64 years, 23.1% of women were identified for BMD testing under the USPSTF strategy and 52.3% under the Canadian strategy. For women ≥ 65 years, 100% were identified for testing under the USPSTF and Canadian strategies, 35% to 74% were identified for treatment under NOF, and 16% to 37% were identified for treatment under CAROC (range among 5-year age subgroups). Among women who experienced MOF during follow-up, the USPSTF strategy identified 6.7% of women 50 to 54 years-old and 49.5% of women 60 to 64 years-old for BMD testing (versus 54.4% and 60.6% for the Canadian strategy, respectively). However, the specificity of the USPSTF strategy was higher than that of the Canadian strategy among women 50 to 64 years-old. Among women who experienced MOF during follow-up, sensitivity for identifying women as treatment candidates was lowest for both strategies in women aged 50 to 64 (NOF 10% to 38%; CAROC 1% to 15%) and maximal in 75-year-old to 79-year-old women (NOF 82.8%; 51.6% CAROC); specificity declined with advancing age and was lower with the NOF compared to the CAROC strategy. Among women aged 50 to 64 years, the screening and treatment strategies examined had low sensitivity for identifying those who subsequently experience MOF; sensitivity was higher among women ≥ 65 years than among younger women. New screening and treatment algorithms are needed. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^113oGcH7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — long-term bisphosphonate treatment beyond 5 years shows persistent effects after discontinuation and agent-specific offsets. Two randomized, placebo-controlled extension trials form the primary evidence base (1099 and 1233 women) comparing 10 years vs 5 years of alendronate and 6 vs 3 years of zoledronic acid. In FLEX, BMD decreased gradually with discontinuation and at 5 years ~50% to 75% of initial BMD gains were lost; continued alendronate lowered vertebral fracture risk without significant reductions in nonvertebral or hip fractures. In the zoledronic acid extension, BMD fell and bone turnover markers rose more slowly after discontinuation, and fracture results were similar to FLEX with reduced vertebral fractures but no significant effects on nonvertebral fractures. In the TRIO study, 2 years of alendronate, risedronate, or ibandronate followed by 2 years of discontinuation (n = 57 women) showed no between-group differences in bone turnover markers or BMD after discontinuation, and preliminary data did not show that the offset after stopping ibandronate or risedronate differs from alendronate; a larger, longer study is needed.

### Indications and outcomes of osteoporosis and bone modulation therapies [^114xoHSi]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a disorder of bone strength that leads to an increased risk of fractures. It is most commonly seen in patients aged 50 or older, although it can sometimes occur at a younger age if there are other comorbidities present. The most common cause of osteoporosis by far is menopause, although it also occurs in men, usually with higher morbidity rates than those seen in women. There are many treatment options available, such as anabolics and antiresorptives, with many more currently being developed. However, osteoporosis remains grossly unrecognized and untreated, resulting in a significant strain on the American economy.

Monitoring during osteoporosis therapy — In postmenopausal women with a low bone mineral density and at high risk of fractures who are being treated for osteoporosis, we suggest monitoring the bone mineral density by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at the spine and the hip every 1 to 3 years to assess the response to treatment. Monitoring bone turnover markers (serum C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide for antiresorptive therapy or procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide for bone anabolic therapy) is an alternative way of identifying poor response or nonadherence to therapy.

Denosumab — initial treatment, dosing, monitoring, and discontinuation precautions: In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at high risk for osteoporotic fractures, we recommend using denosumab as an alternative initial treatment. The recommended dosage is 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months, and the effects reverse after 6 months if the drug is not taken on schedule; thus, a drug holiday or treatment interruption is not recommended with this agent. In women taking denosumab, we suggest that the fracture risk be reassessed after 5 to 10 years, and those who remain at high risk should either continue denosumab or be treated with other osteoporosis therapies; administration of denosumab should not be delayed or stopped without subsequent antiresorptive or other therapy to prevent a rebound in bone turnover and to decrease the risk of rapid bone mineral density loss and an increased risk of fracture.

### New and emerging treatments for osteoporosis [^116DLkdb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will focus on three new treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis which have either been recently released (intravenous ibandronate), or have completed (zoledronic acid) or are currently in (denosumab) phase III trials.

Recent Findings

A number of agents have demonstrated fracture risk reduction in randomized clinical trials, however, successful treatment of osteoporosis in the individual patient remains a challenge. Adherence to, and persistence with, all current osteoporosis medications are poor, being approximately 50% at 1 year for weekly bisphosphonates. Poor adherence to therapy makes it unlikely that the significant fracture reduction seen in clinical trials will be realized in clinical practice.

Summary

New therapies will not only have to demonstrate safety and efficacy, but also provide some advantage to patient persistence through either less frequent dosing schedules or elimination of gastrointestinal disturbances, the most common adverse effects encountered with bisphosphonates. This review will focus on three such agents that have either been recently released (intravenous ibandronate), or have completed (zoledronic acid) or are currently in (denosumab) phase III trials.

Pharmacologic therapy to prevent bone loss — several drugs with differing mechanisms have demonstrated the ability to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women and to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis; antiremodeling agents include estrogen, estrogen agonists/antagonists (EAAs), bisphosphonates, and denosumab, which inhibit bone resorption and to a lesser extent bone formation, maintain or improve BMD and reduce fracture risk but do not improve or repair disruption of trabecular structure; in contrast, osteoanabolic agents stimulate new bone formation, improve cortical and/or trabecular bone structure, induce large increases in BMD, and reduce fractures more quickly than antiremodeling drugs.

### New and emerging treatments for osteoporosis [^116nZj4E]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

A variety of new treatments for osteoporosis have become available within the last several years, and a number of emerging treatments remain in late clinical stage development. New and emerging treatments include more potent members, or more convenient formulations, of existing classes of therapy, but a number of the emerging treatments are first-generation compounds addressing specific therapeutic targets based on recent advances in understanding of basic bone biology. These new and emerging treatments include agents with anticatabolic effects, compounds with anabolic effects, and one agent possibly containing both anticatabolic and anabolic effects. The increasing variety of new and emerging treatments increases the possibility that effective therapy will be targeted to the specific needs of the individual patient.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — when to refer to a specialist: Referral to a clinical endocrinologist or other osteoporosis specialist may be important in patients with normal BMD and fracture without major trauma and in those with recurrent fractures or continued bone loss while receiving therapy without obvious treatable causes of bone loss; additional reasons include less common secondary conditions and unexpectedly severe or unusual features. Patients who experience fragility fractures should be evaluated and treated, and referral to an osteoporosis specialist or a fracture liaison team, if available, should be considered.

Osteoporosis pharmacotherapy — bone turnover marker (BTM) changes and monitoring in postmenopausal women: In postmenopausal women, alendronate reduces serum CTX and serum P1NP by 80% and 60%, respectively, with reductions becoming maximal within several months and remaining stable; with teriparatide, bone formation and resorption markers increase during the first 6 to 12 months then decline toward baseline. Monitoring requires attention to diurnal and food effects, with samples for bone resorption markers collected fasting in the morning, and changes should be compared only if the same assay is used. Least significant change estimates are ~56% for serum CTX and 38% for serum P1NP; by 12 weeks on oral bisphosphonates, between 70% and 90% of women are expected to respond, and the BTM response may account for 30% to 75% of the fracture risk reduction with standard treatments. Some experts recommend measuring BTMs before and 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and if the change exceeds the least significant change (~40%), then one goal has been met; a low risk of fractures while on treatment is associated with BTMs below the median of the reference interval for young women. If markers do not change, options include questioning medication compliance, considering secondary osteoporosis, or changing the medication or route of administration.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — communicating risk to patients: Risk communication has been defined as "the study and practice of collectively and effectively understanding risks", and in health-care interactions it is characterized as "one-to-one communication in which the intervention includes a stimulus to patients to weigh the risks and benefits of a treatment choice or behavioral (risk reducing) change". It is incumbent on the clinician to provide this information to each patient in a manner that is fully understood and to learn from patient beliefs and concerns. Estimation of fracture risk should consider that T-score must be combined with clinical risk factors, especially advanced age and previous fracture, and that absolute fracture risk is more useful than T- score in developing treatment plans.

Introduction

Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic skeletal disease characterised by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration in bone tissue, all of which increase bone fragility and risk of bone fracture. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported that 9.9 million American women aged 50 and older suffered from OP in 2010, and this number is expected to increase to 13.2 million by 2030. Data indicate that 20–30% of patients die within a year after developing hip fracture, and the direct annual cost of treating osteoporotic fractures is estimated to be in the range of USD 5000–6500 billion. A large number of patients with OP have a long survival duration following the initial diagnosis and require long-term treatment. The currently used treatments have poor clinical outcomes in some patients. Indeed, some still experience multiple fractures or loss of bone mineral density (BMD).

Currently, many guidelines recommend sequential treatments for patients with OP. However, there is uncertainty and hesitation surrounding the optimal sequential order of administering anti-resorptive agents (AR) and anabolic agents (AB). The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis (ESCEO) and the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) guidelines seems to support initiating anti-osteoporotic treatment with AB and following by AR. However, the recommendation of sequential treatment order in Chinese guidelines is still unclear.

Confronted with multiple sequential options, it is difficult to perform head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) between every two sequential regimens to determine the optimal treatment. Only one meta-analysis suggested that, unlike monotherapy, sequential treatments may increase BMD. Considering the inevitability of sequential treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) and the intricacy associated with sequential regimens, there is a need to search for reliable evidence to guide the clinical selection of different sequential treatments. Here, we conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) and revealed the differences in efficacy and safety among all types of sequential therapeutic regimens and their ranking probabilities, providing guidance framework for the rational use of drugs in OP treatment.

AACE/ACE postmenopausal osteoporosis — risk assessment and diagnosis recommend to evaluate all postmenopausal women aged ≥ 50 years for osteoporosis risk (Grade B; BEL 1, downgraded due to gaps in evidence). A detailed history, physical exam, and clinical fracture risk assessment with fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX®) or other fracture risk assessment tool should be included in the initial evaluation for osteoporosis (Grade B; BEL 1). Consider bone mineral density testing based on clinical fracture risk profile (Grade B; BEL 2). When bone mineral density is measured, axial dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) should be used (Grade B; BEL 2). Osteoporosis is diagnosed based on presence of fragility fractures in the absence of other metabolic bone disorders and even with a normal bone mineral density (T-score).

Bone mineral density categories and fracture risk — osteoporosis is defined by a T-score at or below −2.5 and osteopenia as a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and these criteria are useful for classification and risk stratification but are not intended as treatment thresholds. More than 80% of fragility fractures occur in women with BMD in the "osteopenia" range, and it is now recommended that treatment decisions include consideration of fracture probability; BMD results should be combined with other clinical risk factors, and FRAX® integrates the contribution of BMD and other clinical risk factors and calculates an individual's probability of fracture over 10 years.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — diagnostic criteria and treatment indications state that osteoporosis can be diagnosed if there is a low-trauma (i.e., fragility) fracture in the absence of other metabolic bone disease, independent of the BMD (T-score) value; a fragility fracture is usually from force similar to a fall from a standing position or less that would not have occurred in healthy bone excepting fractures of the skull, face, fingers, and toes; patients with a low-trauma (fragility) fracture of the spine, hip, proximal humerus, pelvis, or possibly distal forearm should be diagnosed with osteoporosis and considered for pharmacologic therapy; osteoporosis may also be diagnosed in patients with osteopenia and increased fracture risk using FRAX (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool) country-specific thresholds; patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should be treated; indications for pharmacologic therapy are low T-score, increased fracture risk based on FRAX®, or fragility fracture; and once the diagnosis of osteoporosis is made, the diagnosis remains even if treatment results in a T-score better than −2.5.

Therapy response and compliance — nonresponder considerations in osteoporosis: The definition of a "nonresponder" to therapy is complex and varies by therapy, and it is reasonable that a patient with significant bone loss or one or more new fragility fractures be evaluated for compliance, secondary causes of bone loss, and new medications or diseases that can cause bone loss. The change in BMD accounts for < 20% of the fracture risk reduction following antiresorptive therapy, and although BMD monitoring might improve patient compliance, adherence to therapy usually occurs early (after 6 to 7 months), before the second BMD would be performed.

Bone mineral density (BMD) testing — indications and role note that testing of BMD is useful for screening and monitoring therapy in people at high risk for osteoporosis if evidence of bone loss would result in modification of therapy, with examples including postmenopausal women, patients with hyperparathyroidism or other bone disorders, and those being treated with medications associated with bone loss (e.g., glucocorticoids). A list of indications for BMD testing is shown in Table 10. Testing of BMD is the gold standard in diagnosing osteoporosis; however, not everyone has access to BMD.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and treatment: a review [^116tjUTF]. Journal of Women's Health (2014). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, defined as low bone mass leading to increased fracture risk, is a major health problem that affects approximately 10 million Americans. The aging U.S. population is predicted to contribute to as much as a 50% increase in prevalence by 2025. Although common, osteoporosis can be clinically silent, and without prevention and screening, the costs of osteoporotic fracture-related morbidity and mortality will burden the U.S. healthcare system. This is a particularly relevant concern in the context of diminishing health care resources. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is the most widely used, validated technique for measuring bone mineral density (BMD) and diagnosing osteoporosis. Cost-effectiveness analyses support early detection and treatment of high-risk patients with antiresorptive medications such as bisphosphonates. Moreover, optimization of bone health throughout life can help prevent osteoporosis. Current guidelines recommend screening women by age 65 years, but because no guidelines for screening intervals exist, decisions are made on the basis of clinical judgment alone. Although the recent literature provides some guidance, this review further explores current recommendations in light of newer evidence to provide more clarity on prevention, screening, and management strategies for patients with osteoporosis in the primary care setting.

### Emerging therapeutic opportunities for skeletal restoration [^115NDKLt]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2011). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis, a syndrome characterized by thin bones and fractures, has become more prevalent in both women and men. Established therapies for treating this disorder consist primarily of drugs that prevent bone loss, such as the bisphosphonates and selective oestrogen receptor modulators. Although these drugs have been shown to reduce fractures in randomized trials, there is an urgent need for treatments that could lower fracture risk further without additional adverse effects. The introduction of parathyroid hormone (teriparatide), which significantly increases bone mineral density, albeit for a relatively short duration, raised expectations that drugs that stimulate bone formation might cure osteoporosis. After outlining current approaches for treating osteoporosis, this Review focuses on emerging therapeutic opportunities for osteoporosis that are based on recent insights into skeletal physiology. Such novel strategies offer promise not only for reducing age-related bone loss and the associated risk of fractures but also for restoring bone mineral density to healthy levels.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — calcium and vitamin D safety and dosing indicate that supplementation with vitamin D of up to 4000 IU/d is not associated with safety issues beyond hypercalciuria, but when combined with high amounts of supplemental calcium there is the potential for a greater risk of kidney stones; high-dose intermittent vitamin D (500,000 IU/y or 20,000 IU/wk) can lead to a greater risk of falls and fractures; the Institute of Medicine recommends 1000 to 1200 mg of calcium per day, and Writing Committee members prefer keeping calcium supplement intake < 1000 mg/d; most postmenopausal women in the United States now consume close to 1000 mg/day, an increase of > 200 mg/d from the late 1990s.

### How would you manage this patient with osteoporosis? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113Dhr5S]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength that increases the risk for fracture. Approximately 10 million men and women in the United States have osteoporosis, and more than 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures occur annually. In 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists issued the "Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis", and in 2017, the American College of Physicians issued the guideline "Treatment of Low Bone Density or Osteoporosis to Prevent Fracture in Men and Women". Both guidelines agree that patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should be treated with an antiresorptive agent, such as alendronate, that has been shown to reduce hip and vertebral fractures. However, there is no consensus on how long patients with osteoporosis should be treated and whether bone density should be monitored during and after the treatment period. In this Beyond the Guidelines, 2 experts discuss management of osteoporosis in general and for a specific patient, the role of bone density monitoring during and after a 5-year course of alendronate, and treatment recommendations for a patient whose bone density decreases during or after a 5-year course of alendronate.

Osteoporosis is a common systemic skeletal disorder resulting in bone fragility and increased fracture risk. Evidence-based screening strategies improve identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from drug treatment to prevent fracture. In addition, careful consideration of when pharmacotherapy should be started, choice of medication, and duration of treatment maximizes the benefits of fracture prevention while minimizing potential harms of long-term drug exposure.

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^114w1C29]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass in adults — this ACP guideline presents a focused update on clinical recommendations for pharmacologic treatments to prevent fractures in adults, based on the best available evidence of the benefits and harms of treatments and consideration of patient values, preferences, and costs. The population is adults (premenopausal and postmenopausal females and males) with low bone mass or primary osteoporosis as diagnosed in primary studies, and baseline risk assessment considers diagnosis of osteoporosis, history of osteoporotic fractures (clinical or incidental), multiple risk factors for fractures, or failure or intolerability of osteoporosis medications rather than scores from available tools. The recommendations are based on biological sex assigned at birth because most studies reported sex rather than gender and the majority enrolled only older females. Evaluated therapies include an analogue of human parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (abaloparatide), bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, zoledronate), a receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) ligand inhibitor (denosumab), recombinant human parathyroid hormone (recombinant PTH) (teriparatide), a sclerostin inhibitor (romosozumab), and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (bazedoxifene, raloxifene), with focus on effectiveness and harms of active drugs compared with placebo or bisphosphonates. The intended audience is all clinicians, and management of secondary osteoporosis in people with cancer and other serious illnesses is outside the scope. The Clinical Guidelines Committee developed this guideline according to ACP's guideline development process, used Evidence-to-Decision tables, and graded recommendations using the GRADE approach; it is planning to maintain this topic as a living guideline with quarterly literature surveillance and periodic updating, and may retire living status if it is no longer a priority, if conclusions are unlikely to change with new evidence, or if new evidence is unlikely to emerge. The guideline is based on an accompanying systematic review and network meta-analysis completed by the ACP Center for Evidence Reviews, and the accompanying review and Supplement Appendixes provide appraised evidence of benefits and harms of evaluated pharmacologic interventions.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — initial pharmacologic therapy selection: Agents with "broad-spectrum" antifracture efficacy should, in the absence of contraindications, be considered as initial options for most candidates; those with "high fracture risk" can be started on oral agents, while injectable agents (abaloparatide, denosumab, romosozumab, teriparatide, or zoledronate) can be considered for very high fracture risk or for patients with gastrointestinal (GI) problems or adherence challenges. Patients taking anabolic agents or denosumab are advised to transition to an oral bisphosphonate when therapy is complete, and anabolic/dual-action agents may be preferable for very high risk; raloxifene may be appropriate for high spine fracture risk and has a "side benefit" of reducing breast cancer risk.

Fracture risk assessment and treatment consideration — postmenopausal women aged 50 years or older with osteopenia (T-score between −1.0 and −2.5) who have a 10-year hip fracture probability ≥ 3% or 10-year major osteoporotic fracture probability ≥ 20% in the U.S. or above a country-specific threshold are recommended to consider osteoporosis treatment, and the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) incorporates clinical factors such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, prior fracture, parental history of hip fracture, glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, secondary osteoporosis, and femoral neck BMD while predicting the 10-year probability of hip and major osteoporotic fracture; however, FRAX underestimates risk in settings including multiple or recent fractures, lumbar spine BMD much lower than femoral neck BMD, secondary osteoporosis, and increased fall risk, and falls are not directly captured in FRAX and are a proximate cause of most fractures in older adults.

Calcium and vitamin D — dosing and safety note that "The amount of calcium supplementation in randomized trials ranges from 500 to 1500 mg/d". "Expert opinion currently recommends ≤ 1000 mg/d in the form of supplements", while "the overall recommendation from the National Osteoporosis Foundation and Institute of Medicine (for women > 50 years and men > 70 years of age) is a total calcium intake of 1200 mg/d". In the Women's Health Initiative, "the daily dietary intake in the active arm was ~1100 mg/d in addition to the 1000 mg of calcium supplementation, resulting in a total intake of ~2100 mg/d (109)", and "This intake led to a 17% increase in the development of renal stones (109)".

Clinical considerations for pharmacologic management — Clinicians should prescribe generic medications if possible rather than more expensive brand-name medications. Clinicians treating postmenopausal females with osteoporosis should encourage adherence to recommended drug treatments and healthy lifestyle modifications, including exercise, and counseling for evaluation and prevention of falls. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake should be part of fracture prevention in all postmenopausal females with low bone mass or osteoporosis. Clinicians should assess baseline risk for fracture based on individualized assessment of bone density, history of fractures, response to prior treatments for osteoporosis, and multiple risk factors for fractures in postmenopausal females with primary osteoporosis. Current evidence suggests that increasing the duration of bisphosphonate therapy to longer than 5 years probably reduced risk for new vertebral fractures but not risk for other fractures at the expense of increased risk for long-term harms. Therefore, clinicians should consider stopping bisphosphonate treatment after 5 years unless the patient has a strong indication for treatment continuation. The decision of a temporary treatment discontinuation (holidays) should be individualized and based on baseline risk for fractures, type of medication and its half-life in bone, duration of discontinuation, benefits and harms of discontinuation, and higher risk for fracture due to drug discontinuation. Females initially treated with an anabolic agent should be offered an antiresorptive agent after discontinuation to preserve gains and because of serious risk for rebound and multiple vertebral fractures. Older postmenopausal females with primary osteoporosis or low bone mass are at increased risk for falls and other adverse events due to polypharmacy and drug interactions need individualized treatment selection based on comorbidities and concomitant medications associated with higher risk for falls/fractures.

Bisphosphonates in young postmenopausal women — bone mineral density (BMD) effects and prevention-use parameters are described as follows: In young postmenopausal women, bisphosphonates increase BMD over 24 months by 3.1% to 6.0% in the LS and by 1.8% to 4.0% in the proximal femur, and doses of zoledronate and alendronate approved for prevention are 50% smaller than the doses approved for osteoporosis treatment. Bone mineral density decreases slowly on stopping alendronate or zoledronate. Bisphosphonates can be considered to prevent bone loss in early menopause if estrogen cannot be taken or when ET or raloxifene therapy is discontinued.

¿Qué es la osteoporosis. La osteoporosis es una enfermedad en los huesos "silenciosa" que se desarrolla cuando disminuyen la densidad mineral y la masa de los huesos, lo que provoca que sean menos resistentes. Los huesos afectados por la osteoporosis pueden debilitarse tanto que pueden producirse fracturas de forma espontánea o como consecuencia de una caída leve o de esfuerzos normales, como agacharse, levantar algo o toser. ¿Cuáles son las causas de la osteoporosis. En las mujeres, la osteoporosis suele ocurrir por la pérdida de masa ósea que se produce con los cambios hormonales propios de la menopausia. El estrógeno desempeña un papel importante en la formación y el mantenimiento de los huesos. Después de la menopausia, su cuerpo produce muy poco estrógeno. El riesgo de desarrollar osteoporosis es más alto si no se desarrollaron huesos fuertes durante la juventud.

La falta de actividad física, los trastornos alimentarios u otros problemas de salud pueden impedir la formación de masa ósea en una etapa temprana de la vida, lo que implica menos masa en el futuro. ¿Quiénes padecen osteoporosis. La osteoporosis es una causa frecuente de fracturas en las mujeres posmenopáusicas y en los hombres mayores. Afecta más a las mujeres que a los hombres. De los 10 millones estimados de estadounidenses con osteoporosis, más de 8 millones son mujeres. En Estados Unidos, la osteoporosis afecta a una de cada cuatro mujeres de 65 años o más, pero las más jóvenes también pueden padecerla. La osteoporosis afecta a personas de todas las razas y grupos étnicos, pero es más frecuente en las mujeres blancas no hispanas y en las mujeres asiáticas. Las niñas y las mujeres de todas las edades deben tomar medidas para proteger sus huesos. ¿Quiénes corren riesgo de tenerla.

Puede tener más probabilidades de padecer osteoporosis si: es mujer;
- tiene más de 50 años;
- fuma;
- tiene un cuerpo delgado y esbelto;
- tiene familiares que han tenido osteoporosis;
- no hace suficiente ejercicio en el que soporte su propio peso, como caminar;
- bebe alcohol;
- padece otras enfermedades o toma determinados medicamentos hace mucho tiempo.
