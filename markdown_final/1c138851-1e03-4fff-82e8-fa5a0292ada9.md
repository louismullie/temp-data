## Question

Patient is having left lower quadrant abdominal tenderness since starting medication. He is on cilacar, nitroglycerin since 1 month. He underwent coronary angiogram today which was normal. How i should proceed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage new left lower quadrant abdominal tenderness that began after starting cilnidipine and nitroglycerin, now with a normal coronary angiogram. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the coronary angiogram effectively excludes cardiac ischemia as the driver of abdominal pain. Then, I should verify the temporal relationship between medication initiation and symptom onset to assess causality. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential for left lower quadrant pain, including medication effects, diverticulitis, colitis, ureteral or gynecologic pathology, and mesenteric ischemia. After that, I need to outline immediate labs and imaging, including when CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is warranted. Finally, I will define management pathways for drug-induced pain versus diverticulitis and specify follow-up and red flags that would prompt escalation or admission.

> Let me first confirm the cardiac implications of a normal coronary angiogram. A completely normal invasive angiogram substantially lowers the likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease as the cause of abdominal pain, and importantly, pain localized to the left lower quadrant is anatomically discordant with typical myocardial ischemia, which is usually retrosternal and not below the umbilicus, so I should not anchor on a cardiac etiology here [^116oJVA1] [^112diTyM] [^1152j1Qz].

> Wait, let me verify the medication timeline and potential adverse effects. Cilnidipine is a calcium channel blocker and nitroglycerin is a nitrate, and both can cause vasodilation-related adverse effects including abdominal pain, nausea, and hypotension, with nitroglycerin specifically listing abdominal pain among common reactions, so a medication-induced visceral hyperemia or motility change is plausible if symptoms began within days to weeks of initiation and correlate temporally [^115ae1EM] [^115JUaJB] [^111NhqnK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Left lower quadrant pain has a broad differential, and I need to ensure I prioritize the most likely and most dangerous causes, including acute diverticulitis, infectious colitis, ischemic colitis, ureteral colic, gynecologic pathology in females, and mesenteric ischemia, while keeping medication effects in mind given the temporal association with new antianginals [^1147mvFJ] [^114TX2yA] [^1156zWCJ].

> I should confirm the clinical features that raise suspicion for diverticulitis. Localized left lower quadrant tenderness, absence of vomiting, and elevated CRP greater than 50 mg/L form a high-yield triad that can support a clinical diagnosis, but I need to remember that cross-sectional imaging improves diagnostic accuracy and changes management in a meaningful subset, so CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast remains the imaging of choice when diverticulitis is suspected or when red flags are present [^112VUYtq] [^114TX2yA] [^116hviAB].

> Next, I should review immediate diagnostics. I will obtain CBC with differential, CRP, and a comprehensive metabolic panel including renal function, and I will add urinalysis to screen for urinary sources, with pregnancy testing if applicable. Given the new left lower quadrant pain, I should obtain a CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast unless the patient is very low risk with mild symptoms and reliable follow-up, because CT clarifies alternative diagnoses and detects complications that alter management [^1147mvFJ] [^116hviAB].

> But wait, what if the pain is severe or the patient is systemically ill? I need to check for peritoneal signs, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, or marked leukocytosis, any of which would lower my threshold for emergent imaging and admission, whereas stable patients with mild symptoms and reassuring labs may be observed with close follow-up while I reassess medication causality [^1147mvFJ] [^114vc3RD].

> If CT confirms uncomplicated diverticulitis, I should initiate oral antibiotics targeting gram-negative and anaerobic organisms, ensure adequate hydration, and arrange close outpatient follow-up within 48 to 72 hours to confirm clinical improvement. If CT shows complicated disease with abscess, free air, obstruction, or peritonitis, I should consult surgery and admit for IV antibiotics and source control as indicated [^116hviAB].

> If no intra-abdominal pathology is found and the temporal profile strongly implicates medications, I should consider a cautious trial of nitroglycerin discontinuation while maintaining blood pressure control with the calcium channel blocker, monitor for symptom resolution over several days, and if pain persists off nitroglycerin, I should broaden the gastrointestinal workup to include stool studies and, if indicated, colon evaluation for colitis or other mucosal disease [^111NhqnK].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook mesenteric ischemia. Although less likely without risk factors or classic pain-out-of-proportion findings, any concern for severe pain with minimal exam or systemic toxicity warrants urgent CT angiography and vascular consultation, given the time-sensitive nature of therapy [^111gaibj] [^115Qc3Xq].

> Finally, I should double-check red flags that mandate escalation. Fever, hypotension, peritoneal signs, inability to tolerate oral intake, rising inflammatory markers, or diagnostic uncertainty should prompt admission, surgical or gynecologic consultation as appropriate, and repeat imaging if the clinical course deteriorates despite initial management [^113gnDzk] [^114vc3RD].

The most likely cause of left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal tenderness after starting cilnidipine and nitroglycerin is **medication-induced gastrointestinal side effects** (cilnidipine-related constipation or nitroglycerin-related abdominal pain) [^115ae1EM] or **diverticulitis** [^114TX2yA]. Given the normal coronary angiogram, cardiac ischemia is unlikely [^116oJVA1]. Immediate next steps are to **obtain a CBC, CRP, and an abdominal CT with contrast** [^1147mvFJ] to evaluate for diverticulitis or other intra-abdominal pathology [^116hviAB]. If CT is normal, consider medication effects and trial withdrawal; if diverticulitis is confirmed, treat with antibiotics and supportive care [^116hviAB].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Relevance to current presentation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Medication-related | - Cilnidipine-induced constipation <br/> - Nitroglycerin-induced abdominal pain | - Constipation <br/> - Bloating <br/> - Abdominal discomfort <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting | - Both medications can cause **GI side effects** [^notfound] <br/> - Cilnidipine commonly causes **constipation** [^notfound] <br/> - Nitroglycerin can cause **abdominal pain** [^115JUaJB] |
| Gastrointestinal | - Diverticulitis <br/> - Colitis <br/> - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) <br/> - Constipation | - LLQ pain <br/> - Fever <br/> - Leukocytosis <br/> - Altered bowel habits | - Diverticulitis is a common cause of LLQ pain [^114TX2yA] <br/> - Especially in older adults [^114mhPKH] |
| Genitourinary | - Urinary tract infection (UTI) <br/> - Kidney stones | - Dysuria <br/> - Hematuria <br/> - Flank pain | - Less likely given the absence of urinary symptoms |
| Gynecological (if female) | - Ovarian cysts <br/> - Ectopic pregnancy <br/> - Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) | - Pelvic pain <br/> - Menstrual irregularities <br/> - Vaginal discharge | - Less likely without gynecological symptoms |
| Other | - Mesenteric ischemia <br/> - Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) | - Severe abdominal pain <br/> - Hypotension <br/> - Pulsatile mass | - Less likely given normal coronary angiogram and absence of severe pain or hypotension |

---

Given the patient's recent initiation of cilnidipine and nitroglycerin, **medication-induced gastrointestinal side effects** are highly plausible [^115ae1EM]. However, **diverticulitis** remains a significant consideration given the classic presentation of LLQ pain [^114TX2yA].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for leukocytosis or anemia.
- **C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Assess inflammation levels [^116hviAB].
- **Basic metabolic panel (BMP)**: Evaluate renal function and electrolytes.
- **Urinalysis**: Rule out urinary tract infection or hematuria.

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging should include an **abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast**, the gold standard for evaluating LLQ pain — particularly for diverticulitis and other intra-abdominal pathologies [^113gnDzk] [^114mhPKH]. If CT is contraindicated, **abdominal ultrasound** is an alternative, though less sensitive for diverticulitis [^notfound].

---

## Management plan

### Medication-related abdominal pain

If medication-induced gastrointestinal side effects are suspected:

- **Trial discontinuation**: Temporarily discontinue cilnidipine and nitroglycerin under medical supervision.
- **Alternative medications**: Consider alternative antihypertensive and antianginal medications if symptoms resolve upon discontinuation.
- **Supportive care**: Provide symptomatic treatment for constipation or abdominal discomfort (e.g. laxatives, antispasmodics).

---

### Diverticulitis or other gastrointestinal conditions

If diverticulitis or another gastrointestinal condition is confirmed:

- **Antibiotics**: Initiate empiric antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole plus a fluoroquinolone or amoxicillin-clavulanate) [^notfound].
- **Supportive care**: Provide analgesics, antipyretics, and dietary modifications (clear liquids, gradual advancement to low-fiber diet).
- **Surgical consultation**: If complications arise (e.g. abscess, perforation, fistula) or if symptoms persist despite medical management [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Given the patient's recent initiation of cilnidipine and nitroglycerin, **medication-induced gastrointestinal side effects** are highly plausible [^115ae1EM]. However, **diverticulitis** remains a significant consideration given the classic presentation of LLQ pain [^114TX2yA]. Immediate next steps include obtaining a CBC, CRP, and an abdominal CT scan with contrast to evaluate for diverticulitis or other intra-abdominal pathologies [^1147mvFJ]. If CT is normal, consider medication effects and trial withdrawal; if diverticulitis is confirmed, treat with antibiotics and supportive care [^112RTbge].

Since initial reports over 4 decades ago, cases of patients with angina-like chest pain whose coronary angiograms show no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease and who have no structural heart disease continue to be a common occurrence for cardiologists. Many features of this patient population have remained constant with successive reports over time: a female predominance, onset of symptoms commonly between 40 and 50 years of age, pain that is severe and disabling, and inconsistent responses to conventional anti-ischemic therapy. Because patients may have had abnormal noninvasive testing that led to performance of coronary angiography, investigators have sought to show an association of this syndrome with myocardial ischemia. Abnormalities in coronary flow and metabolic responses to stress have been reported by several groups, findings consistent with a microvascular etiology for ischemia and symptoms, but others have questioned the presence of ischemia, even in patients selected for abnormal noninvasive testing. Despite considerable efforts by many groups over 4 decades, the syndrome remains controversial with regard to pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management.

What is the best way to make a diagnosis of ALCD?

In patients with suspected ALCD, we suggest a complete assessment of the patients using clinical history, signs, laboratorial inflammation markers, and radiological findings (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

In patients with suspected, ALCD we suggest against diagnosis based only on clinical examination (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

Clinical findings of patients having ALCD include acute pain or tenderness in the left lower quadrant that may be associated with increased inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Clinical diagnosis of ALCD usually lacks accuracy. In a prospective analysis conducted on 802 consecutive patients who presented with abdominal pain to the emergency department, positive and negative predictive values of clinical diagnosis were 0.65 and 0.98, respectively. Additional cross-sectional imaging had a positive and negative predictive value of 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. Additional radiology examinations improved the diagnostic accuracy in 37% of the patients, but changed the management in only 7%.

In 2010, using logistic regression analysis, Laméris et al. developed a clinical decision rule for diagnosis of ALCD, based on 3 criteria: (1) direct tenderness only in the left lower quadrant, (2) CRP > 50 mg/l, and (3) absence of vomiting. Of 126 clinically suspected patients enrolled in this prospective study, 30 patients had all 3 features (24%), of whom 29 had a final diagnosis of acute diverticulitis (97%; 95% CI 83–99%). Of the 96 patients without all 3 features, 45 (47%) did not have diverticulitis. In a quarter of patients with suspected diverticulitis, the diagnosis could be made clinically based on the combination of the three criteria.

Andeweg et al. in 2011, using retrospective data from 287 patients, developed a clinical scoring system for the diagnosis of ALCD with diagnostic accuracy of 86%. It was based on independent predictors of ALCD including age, a clinical history of one or more previous episodes, localization of symptoms in the lower left abdomen, aggravation of pain on movement, the absence of vomiting, localization of abdominal tenderness on examination in the lower left abdomen, and C-reactive protein of 50 mg/l or higher.

OVERDOSAGE

Signs and symptoms of overdose are generally similar to the described adverse reactions (see Adverse Reactions).

There is no specific antidote for overdose of nitroglycerin. The risk of overdose can be minimized by close monitoring during treatment.

Hemodynamic Effects:

The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death.

Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose.

No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which -if any- of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis.

No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary.

The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good.

In patients with renal disease or heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required.

Clinical introduction

A 49-year-old man presented to the emergency department following sudden onset chest pain with collapse. He was refurbishing his home when he collapsed on the floor with chest and abdominal pain. He awoke 1 hour later and called the emergency services due to persisting chest discomfort that worsened with inspiration. On arrival in the emergency department, his pulse was thready (88/58 mm Hg) with pulsus paradoxus on inspiration. High-sensitivity troponin I was elevated at 325 ng/L (normal range 1–34 ng/L). Fluid resuscitation was administered and contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed. (Figure 1).

### Evaluation of patients with chest pain and normal coronary angiograms… [^1121WjMQ]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

A, Right coronary angiogram in the 60° left anterior oblique view with mild midvessel narrowing. B, Severe midvessel spasm immediately following the administration of 0. 25 mg of intravenous ergonovine maleate. On the one hand, a potentially serious, yet manageable condition must not be overlooked. On the other hand, excessive anxiety over a problem that may not exist or may not be serious must not be created. Therefore, the finding of a normal angiogram in a patient with chronic chest pain in whom coronary disease was suspected prior to the procedure must lead to a thorough investigation. The pathophysiologic features, investigation, and treatment of chest pain in these patients are the subject of this review. A positive test result requires findings of a segmental reversible narrowing of at least a 75% diameter stenosis and chest pain. An example of angiographically documented spasm induced by the administration of 0.

25 mg of intravenous ergonovine maleate is shown in Figure
2. In controls, up to an 18% diffuse diameter reduction can occur without ST-segment shift or chest pain. 10 If there is no chest pain, one is less certain about the diagnosis. First, coronary vasospasm is a common cause of sudden death in patients with structurally normal hearts, and the risk can be reduced with appropriate calcium channel blocker therapy. 12 Second, there are therapeutic implications. β-Blockers may be ineffective and possibly even detrimental in patients with vasospasm, 13 presumably by unmasking α-adrenergic vasoconstriction. Calcium channel blocking drugs are the pharmacological approach of choice, and in patients with refractory vasospasm, more so than in patients with fixed coronary disease, therapy with a combination of calcium channel blocking drugs may be effective when a single agent has failed.
14. On first examination, the angiogram was read as normal.

However, on review there were 3 contentious areas that were clarified with IVUS imaging, and the final diagnosis was moderate coronary atherosclerosis, possibly with superimposed coronary spasm. Physiological assessment of borderline or angiographically obscure lesions or segments can also be performed using Doppler flow or pressure wires and pharmacological coronary arteriolar vasodilation to measure coronary flow reserve. 25 This has proven to be reliable in longitudinal studies in which coronary angioplasty was performed or withheld based on flow reserve measurements.
26. It is important clinically to detect mild to moderate atherosclerotic lesions on a coronary angiogram for at least 2 reasons. First, it has been clearly shown that it is often the mild or moderate lesions that are the most vulnerable to plaque rupture and account for up to two thirds of the cases of acute coronary syndromes.

27, 28 The milder lesions are often softer, lipid-rich plaques and more prone to disruption. Therapy with nitroglycerine may relieve esophageal spasm. The reproduction of chest pain with intravenous ergonovine, which was thought to be pathognomonic of coronary spasm, has now been shown to occur with esophageal motor disorders. 11 In addition, patients with documented coronary artery spasm often have esophageal spasm as well, suggesting a unifying mechanism, and both can be provoked by hyperventilation. 46 Cardiac and esophageal disease also share risk factors such as obesity and smoking. Acid reflux may reduce the angina threshold in patients with established coronary disease.
47. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a barium swallow and endoscopy. In more difficult cases, manometry, acid perfusion studies, ambulatory 24-hour pH monitoring, and provocative tests may be necessary.

The differential diagnosis for left lower quadrant pain is wide and conditions range from the benign and self-limited to life-threatening surgical emergencies. Along with patient history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, imaging is often critical to limit the differential diagnosis and identify life-threatening abnormalities. This document will discuss the guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging in the initial workup for patients who present with left lower quadrant pain, patients with suspected diverticulitis, and patients with suspected complications from diverticulitis. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint in the emergency department, comprising 8.8% of all visits. Despite advances in medicine and imaging, 20% to 30% of patients still leave the department without a definitive diagnosis, whichhis can be both distressing for patients and unsatisfying for providers. Diagnoses of exclusion can be perilous, and their application should be carefully considered in order to not overlook more emergent complaints. However, a working knowledge of diagnoses of exclusion can guide therapeutics and specialty referrals that can ultimately provide answers and relief to a patient population often at odds with available information and expectations.

Case presentation

We present the case of a 68-year-old male patient, Caucasian, living in an urban environment, who was admitted in emergency for epigastric pain. His personal history included duodenal ulcer 20 years ago, coronary heart disease, heart failure diagnosed 6 years ago, with PTCA and stent implantation in the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery 5 years ago, exertional angina pectoris, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension risk grade III, hypertensive cardiomyopathy, type 2 diabetes (controlled by oral therapy). The epigastric pain had set on suddenly 2 weeks before, after an intense physical effort (and with inadequate hydration) and radiated to the back. The pain had variable intensity during its evolution, initially described as being of great intensity, later as having an average intensity and was accompanied by anorexia and asthenia. The patient reported associated progressive exertional dyspnea and chest pain with angina characteristics when making intensive efforts.

The patient denied any history of gallstone disease and any high-fat, high-calorie intake or alcohol consumption. He was on a therapeutic regimen containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (Prestarium 5 mg once daily), beta blocker (Carvedilol 6,25 mg twice daily), antiplatelet (Aspirin 75 mg once daily), nitrate (Isosorbide mononitrate 40 mg once daily), statin (Rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily) and biguanide (Metformin 800 mg once daily); was compliant to this therapy. As a risk factor he was an ex-smoker, but did not present any familial risk factor.

Clinical findings on hospital admission: apyrexia; asthenia; no pulmonary findings; rhythmic heart sounds, heart rate = 56 beats/min, blood pressure = 140/85 mmHg; no peripheral swelling; abdomen with tenderness in the epigastric area and palpable pulsatile mass above the umbilicus, no defense or muscle stiffness, Murphy and Blumberg signs were negative; normal bowel movements; the diuresis was normal.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed in order to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, heartburn unrelated to meals, and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Adverse events

All 36 patients were included in the safety analysis set, of whom 33 (91.7%) had at least one treatment‐emergent AE (TEAE): 12 of 36 patients (33.3%) after the nitroglycerin priming dose in the screening visit (including decreased BP and headache, among further TEAEs in single patients), 22 of 24 patients (91.7%) in the vericiguat + nitroglycerin group, and 11 of 12 patients (91.7%) in the placebo + nitroglycerin group in the treatment phase (Table 3).

Table 3
Number of patients with TEAEs by treatment

SAEs occurred in three patients (Table 3): one patient in the placebo + nitroglycerin group had a myocardial infarction, one patient in the vericiguat + nitroglycerin group had a sinoatrial block of moderate intensity, and another reported acute painful constipation of moderate intensity leading to hospitalization. The latter patient had reported cephalgia and myalgia 2 days beforehand and abdominal pain and nausea 1 day before the event; the patient also had elevated alanine aminotransferase 1 week before the event.

The patient who experienced a sinoatrial block in the vericiguat + nitroglycerin group discontinued study participation; this was not considered to be related to treatment. Two patients in the placebo + nitroglycerin group discontinued study participation owing to TEAEs: one patient had orthostatic dysregulation, considered probably related to nitroglycerin, and one patient had postural dizziness that was, due to blinded assessment, believed to be related to vericiguat and nitroglycerin. Both TEAEs were related to the standing BP measurement procedure.

The percentage of patients with TEAEs within 24 hours after nitroglycerin administration was 66.7% for vericiguat + nitroglycerin as well as for placebo + nitroglycerin (Table 4).

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^113gnDzk]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing diverticulitis requires an approach that considers atypical presentations in older adults (Figure 2). The 2022 European multi‐society guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis in older adults provide recommendations for how to incorporate these differences into clinical practice. They suggest avoiding diagnosis based solely on exam findings or laboratory results, as this may lead to underdiagnosis. Instead, cross‐sectional CT imaging with IV contrast is suggested for all patients older than 65 years with suspected diverticulitis. Obtaining a CT scan in every patient over 65 with abdominal pain and suspected diverticulitis may not be feasible, and this may be omitted in select cases with mild local symptoms and reliable close clinical follow‐up. However, patients with any systemic signs, including atypical symptoms such as fatigue, renal insufficiency, chest pain, or syncope should be evaluated with CT imaging to rule out complicated disease that may require inpatient management or procedural intervention.

Case example part 1: A 78‐year‐old woman with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, prior stroke, obesity, COPD and one prior episode of diverticulitis presents to clinic with 3 days of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, loose stools, anorexia, and fatigue. Physical exam reveals tachycardia to 105 with an irregular rhythm, fever to 38°C, and focal left lower quadrant tenderness. Her white blood cell count is 13,000 and creatinine is 1.4. Other laboratory values are normal. Given her systemic symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, in addition to her elevated creatinine, a CT scan is obtained which demonstrate acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

She presented to the emergency department at our institution with severe left-lower-quadrant abdominal pain, cramping and anorexia. Physical examination revealed a soft abdomen, with localized left lower quadrant sharp tenderness, guarding and moderate rebound on examination. Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed bowel wall thickening and contrast-enhancement along a 45 mm portion of the medium-to-distal sigmoid colon. A marked increase in soft tissue density was also observed within the pericolonic fat, with evidence of a 23 mm paramedian fluid collection in the pre-sacral area. The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and antibiotic coverage was started together with analgesics. Symptoms resolved quickly, she was discharged home a week later with a diagnosis of self-limited diverticular microperforation, and an outpatient follow-up was scheduled for elective surgical planning.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

High-risk patients with severe abdominal pain and a paucity of physical findings should be undergo emergent imaging in a search for this disease. Improvements in laboratory tests and advances in imaging techniques may improve the ability to diagnose MI earlier in its course, before irreversible damage has occurred. Many treatment modalities are available and should be tailored to each individual case. By recognizing and preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury, the cycle of protracted complications may be broken. A decrease in the mortality from MI finally is occurring. Early recognition and aggressive treatment finally may allow clinicians to have a marked impact on patient survival.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis.

### Evaluation of abdominal emergencies [^114vc3RD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

Pre-test patient assessment for suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) — providers should identify patients with previously known CAD, defined as a prior MI, coronary revascularization procedure(s), or obstructive or nonobstructive CAD on prior angiography or coronary CTA; prior test results should influence current test selection and refine risk assessment; prior nongated chest CT and anatomical or ischemia tests should be reviewed for CAD burden and artifact severity; notably, a completely normal invasive coronary angiogram or coronary CTA performed within 2 years or a normal functional test performed within 1 year of presentation makes the presence of ACS and significant CAD unlikely, with the absence of coronary atherosclerosis on coronary CTA providing the highest NPV for future ACS and adverse events.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Angina pectoris — recommendation-specific supportive text — notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

### Case series: diverticulitis in the young [^114mhPKH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis has long been regarded as a disease of the elderly, but its incidence has been increasing in those under age 40. Younger patients with diverticulitis are more likely to be male and obese. They often have atypical presentations, and 25% may have right lower quadrant pain. Not surprisingly, the condition is often misdiagnosed, resulting in unnecessary surgery. An abdominal CT scan is the modality of choice for diagnosis, but the most important diagnostic step is simply to include diverticulitis on the differential diagnosis of a young person with lower abdominal pain.

### Quadrants and regions of abdomen… [^115o9hh8]. Wikipedia (2014). Low credibility.

The human abdomen is divided into quadrants and regions by anatomists and physicians for the purposes of study, diagnosis, and treatment. The division into four quadrants allows the localisation of pain and tenderness, scars, lumps, and other items of interest, narrowing in on which organs and tissues may be involved. The quadrants are referred to as the left lower quadrant, left upper quadrant, right upper quadrant and right lower quadrant. These terms are not used in comparative anatomy, since most other animals do not stand erect. The left lower quadrant includes the left iliac fossa and half of the flank. The equivalent in other animals is left posterior quadrant. The left upper quadrant extends from the umbilical plane to the left ribcage. This is the left anterior quadrant in other animals. The right upper quadrant extends from umbilical plane to the right ribcage. The equivalent in other animals is right anterior quadrant.

The right lower quadrant extends from the umbilical plane to the right inguinal ligament. This in other animals is the right posterior quadrant. The nine regions offer more detailed anatomy and are delineated by two vertical and two horizontal lines. Quadrants The left lower quadrant of the human abdomen is the area left of the midline and below the umbilicus. The LLQ includes the left iliac fossa and half of the left flank region. The equivalent term for animals is left posterior quadrant. Important organs here are:

- the descending colon and sigmoid colon
- the left ovary and fallopian tube
- the left ureter The left upper quadrant extends from the median plane to the left of the patient, and from the umbilical plane to the left ribcage. The equivalent term for animals is left anterior quadrant. Important organs here are:

- Stomach
- Spleen
- Left lobe of liver
- Body of pancreas
- Left kidney and adrenal gland
- Splenic flexure of colon
- Parts of transverse and descending colon The right upper quadrant extends from the median plane to the right of the patient, and from the umbilical plane to the right ribcage. The equivalent term for animals is right anterior quadrant. Important organs here are:

- Liver
- Gall bladder with biliary tree
- Duodenum
- Head of pancreas
- Right kidney and adrenal gland
- Hepatic flexure of colon The right lower quadrant extends from the median plane to the right of the patient, and from the umbilical plane to the right inguinal ligament. The equivalent term for animals is right posterior quadrant. Important organs here are:

- Cecum
- Appendix
- Ascending colon
- Right ovary and fallopian tube
- Right ureter. Regions Nine regions of the abdomen can be marked using two horizontal and two vertical dividing lines.

The vertical lines are the mid-clavicular lines taken from the mid-point of each clavicle. The upper horizontal line is the subcostal line taken from the inferior parts of the lowest costal cartilages. The lower horizontal line is the transtubercular line connecting the tubercles of the pelvis. The three main centrally positioned regions are the epigastric region, the umbilical region, and the hypogastric region also known as the pubic region. On the sides of the abdomen the other six regions are the left and right hypochondriac regions, on either side of the epigastrium; the left and right lumbar flank regions, on either side of the umbilical region, and the left and right iliac or inguinal regions on either side of the hypogastrium. and "gaster" means stomach.

### Appendicitis… [^116ehZ1E]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis. There is pain in the sudden release of deep tension in the lower abdomen. If the appendix is retrocecal, even deep pressure in the right lower quadrant may fail to elicit tenderness. This is because the cecum, distended with gas, protects the inflamed appendix from pressure. Similarly, if the appendix lies entirely within the pelvis, there is typically a complete absence of abdominal rigidity. In such cases, a digital rectal examination elicits tenderness in the rectovesical pouch.

Coughing causes point tenderness in this area, called Dunphy's sign. At this point, spontaneous recovery rarely occurs. As the occlusion of blood vessels progresses, the appendix becomes ischemic and then necrotic. As bacteria begin to leak out through the dying walls, pus forms within and around the appendix. The result is appendiceal rupture causing peritonitis, which may lead to sepsis and in rare cases, death. These events are responsible for the slowly evolving abdominal pain and other commonly associated symptoms. Diagnosis The physician will ask questions to get the health history, assess the patient's symptoms, do a complete physical exam, and order both laboratory and imaging tests. Appendicitis symptoms fall into two categories, typical and atypical.

Typical appendicitis is characterized by a migratory right iliac fossa pain associated with nausea, and anorexia, which can occur with or without vomiting and localized muscle stiffness/ generalized guarding. It is possible the pain could localize to the left lower quadrant in people with situs inversus totalis. The combination of migrated umbilical pain to the right lower quadrant, loss of appetite for food, nausea, unsustained vomiting, and mild fever is classic. Atypical histories lack this typical progression and may include pain in the right lower quadrant as an initial symptom. Irritation of the peritoneum can lead to increased pain on movement, or jolting, for example going over speed bumps. Atypical histories often require imaging with ultrasound or CT scanning. Signs During the early stages of appendicitis diagnosis, it is common for physical exams to present inconspicuous findings.

Signs of inflammation become noticeable as the disease progresses. These signs may include.
- **Dunphy's sign**: Increased pain in the right lower quadrant by coughing.
- **Hamburger sign**: The patient refuses to eat
- **Kocher's sign**: From the person's medical history, the start of pain in the umbilical region with a subsequent shift to the right iliac region. A C-reactive protein blood test will be ordered by the doctor to find out if there are any further causes of inflammation. The C-reactive protein/albumin ratio can be a reliable predictor of complicated appendicitis. The urinalysis is important for ruling out a urinary tract infection as the cause of abdominal pain. The presence of more than 20 WBC per high-power field in the urine is more suggestive of a urinary tract disorder. If the patient is a female, a pregnancy test will be ordered.

### Evaluating the patient with right upper quadrant abdominal pain [^115Az56X]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is among the most common complaints in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI causes for pain. Evaluation of patients requires a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging. This article details the anatomy and physiology of the right upper abdomen and approach to the history and physical examination of the most common diseases encountered in the emergency department. "Can't miss", non-GI diagnoses are discussed. Best practices of laboratory and imaging, and treatment of most common diagnoses of RUQ pain are reviewed.

### Effect of timing on endovascular therapy and exploratory laparotomy outcome in acute mesenteric ischemia [^1156zWCJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

The mean age was 65 ± 12.2 years and mean BMI was 25.8 ± 6.23 kg/m². Of the 33 patients, 60.6% were women, 78.8% were smokers, and 72.7% were taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication on admission. The most common comorbid conditions were all related to cardiovascular disease and included hypertension (84.9%), hyperlipidemia (63.3%), coronary artery disease (51.5%), peripheral vascular disease (48.5%), and diabetes mellitus (39.4%) (Table 1). Thirty-six percent of the patients had a history of chronic mesenteric ischemia and 48% had a prior CT scan that showed evidence of mesenteric vessel stenosis. The presenting symptoms of these patients were, in order of decreasing frequency, abdominal pain and tenderness (96.9% and 84.8%), nausea and vomiting (60.6%), and diarrhea (45.4%). The average CCI was 4.30.

Table 1
Demographics of patients with acute mesenteric ischemia undergoing mesenteric artery angioplasty

Technical success was high at 100% (33/33), similar to previously reported data. Stents were placed in 28/33. The remaining 5 patients who did not undergo stent placement were treated with angioplasty of an existing stent, embolectomy and/or nitroglycerin/papaverine therapy. Procedure-related complications were seen in 18% of patients (6/33); all these 6 patients had AMI due to thrombosis.

White blood cell counts were elevated (15.58 ± 6.2 × 10⁹/L), as were lactic acid levels on admission (2.59 ± 2.04 mmol/L) and before reperfusion (2.68 ± 2.46 mmol/L) (Table 2). Patients who survived had a significantly lower lactic acid level on presentation compared with patients who expired (2.19 vs. 3.82 mmol/L; P = 0.0344), as well as a significantly lower lactic acid level before reperfusion (1.74 vs. 4.18 mmol/L; P = 0.015). As for imaging data, the most common vessel occluded or narrowed was the superior mesenteric artery. Of the 33 patients, 60% underwent exploratory laparotomy (23.3% before reperfusion, 36.7% after). The median number of narrowed vessels seen on imaging was 2.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders, to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.
