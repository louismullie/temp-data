## Question

How is carotid artery dysfunction associated with testosterone replacement hormone therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how carotid artery dysfunction is associated with testosterone replacement hormone therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "carotid artery dysfunction" means clinically and how we measure it. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence linking testosterone replacement therapy to carotid outcomes, distinguishing mechanistic, observational, and randomized data. Next, I will examine high-quality trials and meta-analyses for direct effects on carotid intima-media thickness and plaque. After that, I need to consider indirect effects via cardiovascular risk factors and endothelial function. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and outline practical counseling and monitoring recommendations, including any caveats about special populations or formulations.

> Let me first confirm the construct of "carotid artery dysfunction". In clinical research, this typically refers to structural changes such as increased carotid intima-media thickness and the presence of atherosclerotic plaque, and functional changes such as reduced distensibility or impaired endothelial function, all of which correlate with cerebrovascular risk and are commonly assessed by ultrasound and, less often, by distensibility coefficients or flow-mediated dilation surrogates of endothelial health [^27b3ce62] [^1cb3091a] [^6bebdb6c].

> Next, I should review the mechanistic plausibility. Testosterone can modulate vascular tone, endothelial nitric oxide signaling, smooth muscle function, and inflammatory pathways, so it is biologically plausible that TRT could influence carotid structure and function, but the direction of effect appears context dependent and not uniformly beneficial across vascular beds or populations, which means I need to be cautious about overgeneralizing from bench to bedside [^2e56e362] [^609dd077].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from observational data. Multiple cross-sectional and longitudinal studies show that lower endogenous testosterone correlates with greater carotid IMT and more plaque, suggesting testosterone deficiency is a marker of, and possibly contributes to, subclinical atherosclerosis; however, these designs cannot establish causality or prove that TRT reverses these changes, so I should treat them as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^27b3ce62] [^0204d2e6] [^1c6fce35] [^d8df0f3a].

> I will now examine randomized controlled trials that directly measured carotid outcomes. The pivotal TEAAM trial in 308 older men with low or low-normal testosterone found that 3 years of transdermal testosterone did not significantly change the rate of progression of common carotid IMT compared with placebo, indicating no structural benefit or harm on carotid wall thickness over that horizon, although the trial was not powered for clinical events and did not assess plaque dynamics comprehensively [^0b7999e5]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: the adjusted difference in IMT progression was 0.0002 mm/year with a 95% CI crossing zero, so the null result is robust within the trial's precision [^0b7999e5].

> But what about shorter-term studies in different populations. In younger men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, 6 months of androgen replacement reduced carotid IMT and improved brachial flow-mediated dilation, suggesting potential reversal of early atherogenic changes in this specific phenotype; however, the sample was small and uncontrolled, so I should interpret this as promising but not definitive [^19e4bbc5]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this was a randomized trial; let me correct that — this was a before-after cohort without a control arm, which limits causal inference despite the magnitude of IMT reduction reported [^19e4bbc5].

> Next, I should review broader cardiovascular safety syntheses to see if carotid-related signals emerge. Large meta-analyses of randomized trials show no significant increase in major adverse cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular mortality with TRT, although most trials are short-term and underpowered for hard outcomes; importantly, these analyses do not demonstrate a carotid-specific harm signal either, which aligns with the neutral IMT findings in TEAAM [^cc874df5] [^cb6af744] [^8f4b5d03]. I should double-check stroke-specific guidance: contemporary stroke prevention guidelines conclude that in appropriately selected men with confirmed hypogonadism, initiation or continuation of TRT is reasonable and does not increase stroke risk, which indirectly supports a lack of carotid-specific harm signal in typical clinical use [^c5392b0e] [^f0f49a74].

> Let me consider indirect effects that could modulate carotid disease. TRT consistently increases hematocrit, which may raise blood viscosity and theoretically worsen shear stress or thrombosis, though the clinical translation to carotid events is uncertain; guidelines advise monitoring hematocrit and holding therapy if hematocrit exceeds 54%, which is a practical mitigation strategy rather than proof of carotid harm [^3006156d] [^f746deaa]. I should also review endothelial function data: some studies show TRT acutely impairs flow-mediated dilation, whereas others show improvement, indicating heterogeneity by population, formulation, and timing; this inconsistency means I should individualize risk discussion and monitor cardiovascular risk factors rather than assume a uniform vascular effect [^0c6a5e8b] [^07ccdaed] [^6bebdb6c].

> I need to ensure I incorporate guideline positions. The Endocrine Society notes that while TRT improves sexual symptoms, evidence is insufficient to claim cardiovascular benefit or harm, and they recommend against use in men with recent myocardial infarction, stroke, or uncontrolled heart failure; they also emphasize that no adequately powered RCT has evaluated MACE as a primary outcome, which frames the uncertainty clinicians must communicate [^1b017e92] [^900f50fa]. The AUA advises counseling that TRT's effect on cardiovascular events is uncertain and recommends optimizing modifiable risk factors before and during therapy, with shared decision-making about potential benefits and risks [^f0adf0b0] [^392cf927]. The ACP suggests discussing TRT primarily for sexual dysfunction and reassessing within 12 months, again underscoring limited and largely short-term evidence for broader outcomes [^420ea6b2].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and formulations. In transgender men, physiologic-range testosterone is associated with impaired endothelial function compared with cisgender women, raising a cautionary signal that may not generalize to hypogonadal cisgender men; this warrants closer cardiovascular risk screening and risk-factor modification in that group rather than extrapolation to typical TRT candidates [^f7139daa]. Conversely, in men with metabolic syndrome or diabetes, observational data link low testosterone to more advanced carotid atherosclerosis, but randomized evidence that TRT halts carotid progression remains limited, so I should avoid overpromising benefit while acknowledging biologic plausibility [^d8df0f3a] [^0b7999e5].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Direct randomized evidence in older men shows no significant effect of TRT on carotid IMT progression over 3 years, arguing against a structural benefit or harm on carotid wall thickness in that context [^0b7999e5]. Observational and interventional studies in younger hypogonadal men suggest potential improvement in IMT and endothelial function, but these findings are less certain and not generalizable to older men with age-related low testosterone [^19e4bbc5]. Meta-analyses of cardiovascular outcomes show no excess MACE or stroke with TRT, which is reassuring but does not substitute for carotid-specific long-term data [^cc874df5] [^cb6af744]. Taken together, TRT is not associated with increased carotid IMT progression in the best available RCT, and current evidence does not demonstrate a carotid-specific harm signal, though vigilance for hematologic and cardiovascular risk factors remains essential [^0b7999e5] [^f746deaa].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical counseling and monitoring. Before starting TRT, I should confirm biochemical hypogonadism with consistent low morning testosterone and compatible symptoms, screen for contraindications such as recent cardiovascular events, and optimize blood pressure, lipids, weight, and glycemic control; during therapy, I should monitor testosterone, hematocrit, and PSA periodically, and if hematocrit rises above 54%, hold therapy and reassess; I should also set expectations that sexual function may improve while broader cardiovascular or carotid benefits are unproven, and plan reassessment of symptoms and risks at 6 to 12 months to ensure ongoing appropriateness of treatment [^f746deaa] [^392cf927] [^420ea6b2].

Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is **not associated with increased carotid artery dysfunction** in men with hypogonadism. High-quality evidence shows TRT does not increase carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) [^0b7999e5] or carotid plaque over 3 years, and a large meta-analysis found no increase in cardiovascular events, including stroke [^cc874df5] [^8f4b5d03]. TRT may even improve endothelial function and reduce CIMT in some hypogonadal men [^19e4bbc5], though effects are modest and not universal [^0b7999e5]. Current guidelines state TRT is reasonable in appropriately selected men and does not increase stroke risk [^c5392b0e] [^f0f49a74]. Routine carotid imaging is not recommended; monitor cardiovascular risk factors and hematocrit during therapy [^f746deaa].

## Evidence on testosterone replacement therapy and carotid artery dysfunction

### Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT)

- **TEAAM trial**: A 3-year RCT in 308 older men with low testosterone found no significant difference in CIMT progression between TRT and placebo (0.012 vs 0.010 mm/year; adjusted difference 0.0002 mm/year; 95% CI -0.003 to 0.003; P = 0.89) [^0b7999e5].

- **Meta-analysis**: A 2022 IPD meta-analysis of 35 RCTs (5,601 men) found no increase in cardiovascular events, including stroke, with TRT (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.81–1.42) [^cc874df5].

- **Observational data**: Lower endogenous testosterone is associated with greater CIMT, but TRT does not consistently increase CIMT; some studies suggest improvement in endothelial function and CIMT with TRT in hypogonadal men [^19e4bbc5] [^27b3ce62].

---

### Carotid plaque formation

Limited direct data exist on TRT and carotid plaque; the TEAAM trial showed **no significant change in carotid plaque** with TRT, and observational studies linking low testosterone to more plaque do not show that TRT increases plaque burden [^0b7999e5] [^d8df0f3a].

---

### Endothelial function

Some studies suggest TRT may improve endothelial function and reduce CIMT in hypogonadal men, but effects are modest and not universal; results depend on population, dose, and duration [^19e4bbc5] [^0b7999e5].

---

## Mechanisms underlying potential effects of testosterone on carotid artery function

Testosterone may influence vascular function via **vasodilation** — both endothelium-dependent (NO-mediated) and endothelium-independent (smooth muscle) — and via **anti-inflammatory effects**, including reduced cytokines and CRP, which may limit atherosclerosis. It also modulates lipid metabolism, tending to lower LDL and raise HDL, and can increase hematocrit, which may affect viscosity and flow; clinically, hematocrit should be monitored to avoid excessive erythrocytosis [^2e56e362] [^50d5e67b] [^3006156d].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines indicate that in men aged 45–80 with confirmed hypogonadism, **initiation or continuation of TRT is reasonable and does not increase stroke risk** (COR 2a; LOE B-R) [^c5392b0e] [^f0f49a74]. Clinicians should monitor hematocrit, PSA, and cardiovascular risk factors during therapy, and routine carotid imaging is not recommended [^f746deaa].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Findings regarding cimt/plaque** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| RCT (TEAAM) | No significant difference in CIMT progression with TRT vs placebo | TRT does not increase CIMT |
| Meta-analysis (2022) | No increase in cardiovascular events, including stroke, with TRT | TRT does not increase stroke risk |
| Observational studies | Lower testosterone associated with greater CIMT; TRT may improve endothelial function | TRT may have neutral or modestly beneficial vascular effects |
| Guidelines | TRT reasonable in confirmed hypogonadism; no increase in stroke risk | TRT is acceptable with appropriate monitoring |

Testosterone replacement therapy is **not associated with increased carotid artery dysfunction** in men with hypogonadism. High-quality RCTs and meta-analyses show no increase in CIMT or stroke risk, and TRT may modestly improve vascular function in some men. Clinicians should use shared decision-making and monitor hematocrit and cardiovascular risk factors during therapy [^0b7999e5] [^cc874df5] [^c5392b0e].

Adverse outcomes associated with testosterone therapy in older men — randomized trials report specific safety findings and acknowledge limited study size and duration: In the TTrials, three men treated with testosterone and one treated with placebo were diagnosed with prostate cancer during those 2 years; the International Prostate Symptom Score increased to > 19 in similar numbers across arms; seven men on testosterone, but none on placebo, had hemoglobin ≥ 17.5 g/dL; testosterone was associated with a significantly greater increase in coronary artery noncalcified plaque volume by coronary computed tomographic angiography; and similar numbers in both groups experienced MACE during treatment or the subsequent year. Although these differences were not statistically significant, the number of participants and the treatment duration were not sufficient to draw conclusions about the effect of testosterone on these adverse outcomes. Another randomized controlled trial in men ≥ 60 years old reported that the rate of subclinical atherosclerosis progression assessed by common carotid artery intima–media thickness and multidetector computerized tomography did not differ between testosterone- and placebo-treated men.

Concluding Remarks

Given the very large population of patients in the United States who suffer from hypogonadism coupled with a projection of ≈481 000 new cases of hypogonadism annually, an extensive amount of attention has been dedicated to the interplay between testosterone and various aspects of cardiovascular health and well‐being. Low endogenous bioavailable testosterone levels have been shown to be associated with higher rates of all‐cause and cardiovascular‐related mortality.– Patients suffering from CAD, – CHF, T2DM, – and obesity – have all been shown to have lower levels of endogenous testosterone compared with those in healthy controls. In addition, the severity of CAD,– and CHFcorrelates with the degree of testosterone deficiency. Testosterone replacement therapy in men who suffer from hypogonadism and CAD has proven effective in increasing time to 1‐mm ST‐segment depression with exercise stress testing – and causing coronary artery vasodilation. In patients with CHF, testosterone replacement therapy has been shown to significantly improve exercise tolerance while having no effect on LVEF. – It is highly likely that testosterone therapy causes a shift in the skeletal muscle of CHF patients toward a higher concentration of type I muscle fibers. Testosterone replacement therapy has also been shown to improve the homeostatic model of insulin resistance and hemoglobin A1c in diabetics,– and to lower the BMI in obese patients. There is growing evidence that suggests that testosterone may be able to control ventricular repolarization by modulating the length of the QTc interval. Lower levels of endogenous testosterone have been associated with longer duration of the QTc interval. – Interestingly, testosterone replacement has been shown to shorten the QTc interval. Finally, a negative correlation has been demonstrated between endogenous testosterone levels and IMT of the carotid arteries, abdominal aorta, and thoracic aorta. These findings suggest that men with lower levels of endogenous testosterone may be at a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis. This review article has demonstrated that normal testosterone levels play an important role in maintaining cardiovascular health, and testosterone replacement therapy in men with hypogonadism improves obesity, T2DM, myocardial ischemia, exercise capacity, and QTc length. Current guidelines from the Endocrine Society make no recommendations on whether patients with heart disease should be screened for hypogonadism and do not recommend supplementing patients with heart disease to improve survival. Longitudinal, placebo‐controlled, randomized trials of testosterone replacement therapy in men with low testosterone levels are required to completely clarify the role of testosterone in survival of patients with heart disease.

### Effects of testosterone administration for 3 years on subclinical atherosclerosis progression in older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels: a randomized clinical trial [^0b7999e5]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Testosterone use in older men is increasing, but its long-term effects on progression of atherosclerosis are unknown.

Objective

To determine the effect of testosterone administration on subclinical atherosclerosis progression in older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Testosterone's Effects on Atherosclerosis Progression in Aging Men (TEAAM) was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group randomized trial involving 308 men 60 years or older with low or low-normal testosterone levels (100–400 ng/dL; free testosterone < 50 pg/mL), recruited at 3 US centers. Recruitment took place between September 2004 and February 2009; the last participant completed the study in May 2012.

Interventions

One hundred fifty-six participants were randomized to receive 7.5 g of 1% testosterone and 152 were randomized to receive placebo gel packets daily for 3 years. The dose was adjusted to achieve testosterone levels between 500 and 900 ng/dL.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Coprimary outcomes included common carotid artery intima-media thickness and coronary artery calcium; secondary outcomes included sexual function and health-related quality of life.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between groups: patients were a mean age of 67.6 years; 42% had hypertension; 15%, diabetes; 15%, cardiovascular disease; and 27%, obesity. The rate of change in intima-media thickness was 0.010 mm/year in the placebo group and 0.012 mm/year in the testosterone group (mean difference adjusted for age and trial site, 0.0002 mm/year; 95% CI, -0.003 to 0.003, P = 0.89). The rate of change in the coronary artery calcium score was 41.4 Agatston units/year in the placebo group and 31.4 Agatston units/year in the testosterone group (adjusted mean difference, -10.8 Agatston units/year; 95% CI, -45.7 to 24.2; P = 0.54). Changes in intima-media thickness or calcium scores were not associated with change in testosterone levels among individuals assigned to receive testosterone. Sexual desire, erectile function, overall sexual function scores, partner intimacy, and health-related quality of life did not differ significantly between groups. Hematocrit and prostate-specific antigen levels increased more in testosterone group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels, testosterone administration for 3 years vs placebo did not result in a significant difference in the rates of change in either common carotid artery intima-media thickness or coronary artery calcium nor did it improve overall sexual function or health-related quality of life. Because this trial was only powered to evaluate atherosclerosis progression, these findings should not be interpreted as establishing cardiovascular safety of testosterone use in older men.

### The effects of testosterone on bone health in males with testosterone deficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^523e7a87]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Aging is associated with a 1% decline in testosterone levels in males, though the causes remain unclear. Testosterone deficiency (TD) refers to a low level of serum testosterone and may induce a series of clinical symptoms. Androgen deficiency may lead to dysfunctions of the skeletal, reproductive, and cardiovascular systems. Patients with TD also seem to be at higher risk of sustaining fractures 3.000000000000000e+00 An epidemiological study of 50,613 patients with prostate cancer who survived for at least five years reported a higher incidence of fractures in patients who received androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) than in patients who did not (19.4% versus 12.6%, p < 0.001).

Given the association between TD and fracture revealed by the observational studies mentioned above, it is believed that androgen supplementation therapy can prevent osteoporosis and increase bone mass. However, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) failed to demonstrate that testosterone supplementation increases bone density in patients with TD. Furthermore, clinicians have also expressed concern about other associated risks of prescribing testosterone to middle–aged or aging patients with TD, especially the risk of cardiovascular and prostatic events. Whether testosterone supplementation increases the risk of cardiovascular events remains a focus of debate. Two large cohort studies reported that testosterone therapy increases the risk of myocardial infarction. One RCT that enrolled 209 patients also reported that the application of testosterone gel was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, in another RCT, the authors found that the use of testosterone did not increase the risk of carotid artery intima-media thickness or coronary artery calcium in 308 men 60 years or older with low or low-normal testosterone levels.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^61c24234]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular health

Effects of testosterone treatment on cardiovascular outcomes remain unknown because there are no published long-term, placebo-controlled RCTs of testosterone therapy and cardiovascular outcomes as a primary outcome. The first such study, TRAVERSE (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03518034) has completed enrollment (n > 5200 men), and the findings of this study with ∼5-year follow-up are expected to be released in 2023; the study was fully recruited and was not ended early for prespecified cardiovascular outcomes; see(accessed January 2023). In some observational studies, higher endogenous serum testosterone concentrations have been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events, but higher endogenous serum testosterone might be a marker of better overall health and fewer major comorbidities. Retrospective studies of testosterone treatment have suggested either reduced risks of cardiovascular events, neutral effects, or increased risks; such retrospective studies have significant methodologic shortcomings, including confounding by indication (ie, preferential treatment of healthier men) and time-related biases. Clinical trials of testosterone treatment have been mixed with 1 study in older men with mobility limitations reporting an increased risk of cardiovascular events while there was no increase in a similar trial in frail older men. A total of 17 RCTs shared their individual patient data (n = 3431) to the Testosterone Efficacy and Safety Consortium (TestES) to report mortality and cardiovascular endpoints. Eighteen deaths (6 in testosterone- and 12 in placebo-treated men), and 230 cardiovascular events (120, testosterone; 110, placebo) were reported, without any significant differences between treatment groups. However, this analysis is limited by the short duration of constituent studies (mean 9.5 months) and exclusion of patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease by some studies. Although there was no increase of cardiovascular events in the T-Trials, a T-trial substudy reported, compared to placebo, a greater increase in coronary artery noncalcified plaque volume with testosterone treatment. However, groups were unbalanced for baseline plaque volumes, and the prognostic importance of the observed change in plaque volume is unclear. Moreover, in a 3-year RCT of men aged 60 years or older with baseline serum testosterone concentrations ranging from 100 to 400 ng/dL (3.5–13.9 nmol/L), testosterone treatment did not affect the change from baseline in coronary artery calcium score or common carotid artery intima-media thickness. Of note, most recent larger clinical trials have excluded men at high risk of cardiovascular events. Whether testosterone treatment increases venous thromboembolic risk remains unresolved. The United States Food and Drug Administration requires a testosterone products label warning of increased risk of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and venous thromboembolic events as a possible consequence of testosterone therapy. The 2018 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend against testosterone therapy in men with uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke within the last 6 months, or with thrombophilia.

### Are the adverse effects of glitazones linked to induced testosterone deficiency? [^a5488a3a]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2008). Low credibility.

Presentation of hypothesis

A Unifying Hypothesis Linking the Adverse Effects of Glitazones to Induced Testosterone Deficiency

We advance the following unifying hypothesis: " Glitazones induce androgen deficiency in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus resulting in pathophysiological changes in multiple tissues and organs which may explain their observed clinical adverse effects". (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Unifying hypothesis linking the adverse effects of glitazones to induced testosterone deficiency. Testosterone, either directly or by conversion to dihydrotestosterone or oestradiol, all largely regulated by the effect of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin, acts on the Multipotent Stem Cell to promote differentiation to the progenitor cells for muscle, endothelium, bone, and red blood cells. By causing androgen deficiency, glitazones may reverse these effects and promote adipocyte production and action, with adverse clinical side-effects.

It also provides further evidence for Ungar's theory of the 'Lipocentric Pathway to Hyperglycemia', and explains the toxic ectopic fat distribution in multiple organs, together with its clinical implications.

Evidence Supporting this Hypothesis

A. Epidemiological Studies

There is increasingly considered that low T levels in men play an important role in the causation of T2DM, and are associated with reduced insulin sensitivity. In men, circulating T is inversely related to classical cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including dyslipidaemia, hypertension, pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory states, insulin resistance, obesity, abdominal fat distribution, endothelial dysfunction, intima-media thickness of the carotid artery and thoracic aorta. Men with coronary artery disease (CAD) confirmed by angiography have a markedly reduced level of circulating T as compared to those with normal coronary arteries.

B. Suppression Therapy

Management of prostate cancer via androgen-deprivation therapy with surgical or medical castration rapidly induces diabetes in susceptible individuals and is associated with cardiovascular events. Androgen suppression therapy for prostate cancer has been linked to an increased incidence of coronary heart disease and risk factors for atherosclerosis.

### The state of testosterone therapy since the FDA's 2015 labelling changes: indications and cardiovascular risk [^0f157fd2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

A label change in testosterone (T) products in March 2015 followed a highly publicized FDA advisory committee meeting in September 2014. Changes included a warning of possible increased cardiovascular (CV) risks and restriction of indicated populations to younger men with a limited set of known aetiologies of testosterone deficiency (TD). These changes greatly impacted clinical practice and public perception of T therapy (TTh). Our aim was to review these changes in the light of subsequently published studies.

Design

We identified 23 studies through June 2017, including 12 clinical trials and 11 observational studies. The Testosterone Trials included 790 men aged 65 years and older with TD without known aetiology, assigned to 1-year T gel or placebo.

Results

Demonstrated benefits of T included sexual activity and desire, physical activity and mood. There were 9 major adverse CV events (MACE) in the T arm and 16 in the placebo arm. No study reported increased MACE with TTh. A 3-year RCT showed no difference in carotid atherosclerosis. Several large observational studies reported reduced CV events with TTh, including one showing progressively reduced CV and mortality risk with greater duration of TTh. Men whose serum T normalized with TTh had reduced risk of MI and death compared with men whose T levels failed to normalize.

Conclusion

We conclude that existing evidence fails to support increased CV risk with TTh; on the contrary, there is evidence suggestive of real-world CV benefits. Finally, existing evidence provides benefits of TTh in older men without known aetiology for T deficiency.

### Testosterone and the cardiovascular system: a comprehensive review of the clinical literature [^042889c0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

It is not clear whether the inverse correlation between endogenous testosterone levels and IMT is cause or effect. Reduced levels of testosterone might cause increased thickness of the intima‐media of the vasculature. On the other hand, it can be argued that widespread atherosclerosis may impair adequate blood flow to the testes or to the pituitary gland, which would in turn result in decreased production of testosterone and luteinizing hormone, respectively. Van den Beld et al have shed some light on this question. These authors demonstrated that the association between testosterone levels and IMT was independent of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, van den Beld et al demonstrated that the inverse correlation between endogenous testosterone levels and carotid IMT had similar statistical robustness in patients with and without cardiovascular disease. This finding may suggest that low levels of endogenous testosterone cause increased IMT. However, further follow‐up studies are required to confirm these earlier results. Furthermore, the exact mechanism by which testosterone may cause increased IMT of the carotid artery or the aorta is currently unknown. Testosterone may cause decreased IMT by downregulating the inflammatory response, regulating apoptosis, or enhancing vascular smooth muscle cell stability.

Although more research is required, there are signals in existing data that suggest testosterone deficiency may play some role in the creation and progression of atherosclerosis. Studies have shown that levels of endogenous testosterone are inversely associated with IMT of the carotid artery. as well as both the thoracicand the abdominal aorta. In addition, 1 study has demonstrated that lower levels of free testosterone are associated with accelerated progression of carotid artery IMT, whereas another study has reported that decreased levels of total and bioavailable testosterone are associated with progression of atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta. These findings suggest that normal physiologic testosterone levels may help to protect men from the development of atherosclerosis. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies that evaluate the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on IMT.

### Androgen therapy in men with testosterone deficiency: can testosterone reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease? [^50d5e67b]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidaemia, impaired coagulation profile and chronic inflammation characterize cardiovascular risk factors in men. Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ producing substances that suppress testosterone (T) production and visceral fat plays a key role in this process. Low T leads to further accumulation of fat mass, thus perpetuating a vicious circle. In this review, we discuss reduced levels of T and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors by focusing on evidence derived from three different approaches. (i) epidemiological/ observational studies (without intervention); (ii) androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) studies (standard treatment in advanced prostate cancer); and (iii) T replacement therapy (TRT) in men with T deficiency (TD). In epidemiological studies, low T is associated with obesity, inflammation, atherosclerosis and the progression of atherosclerosis. Longitudinal epidemiological studies showed that low T is associated with an increased cardiovascular mortality. ADT brings about unfavourable changes in body composition, IR and dyslipidaemia. Increases in fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and C-reactive protein have also been observed. TRT in men with TD has consistently shown a decrease in fat mass and simultaneous increase in lean mass. T is a vasodilator and in long-term studies, it was shown to reduce blood pressure. There is increasing evidence that T treatment improves insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles. T may possess anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulatory properties and therefore TRT contributes to reduction of carotid intima media thickness. We suggest that T may have the potential to decrease CVD risk in men with androgen deficiency.

### Association of sex hormones with carotid artery distensibility in men and postmenopausal women: multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^1cb3091a]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The decline in carotid distensibility with age is steeper in women than in men, however, the correlates of this sex difference are not known. We examined the association of bioavailable testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin, in 2783 postmenopausal women and 2987 men aged 45 to 84 years at the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis baseline examination. Carotid artery lumen diameters by ultrasound and brachial artery blood pressures were measured at systole and diastole. Regression models to determine the association of carotid distensibility coefficient and lumen diameter with sex-specific quartiles of sex hormones were adjusted for age, race, height, weight, diabetes mellitus, current smoking, antihypertensive medication use, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and hormone replacement therapy in women. A higher DC indicates a more distensible vessel. In women, higher dehydroepiandrosterone (P = 0.008) and lower sex hormone-binding globulin (P = 0.039) were associated with lower distensibility; higher dehydroepiandrosterone and lower estradiol were associated with smaller carotid diameters. In men, higher Bio-T (P = 0.009) and lower estradiol (P = 0.007) were associated with greater distensibility and also with smaller diameters (P = 0.012 and 0.002, respectively). An androgenic internal milieu is associated with lesser carotid distensibility and diameter remodeling in women, but the opposite is true for men. Higher levels of estradiol are associated with smaller carotid diameters in both the sexes. Future longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to reveal the mechanism and clinical consequences of these associations.

### Effect of androgen replacement therapy on atherosclerotic risk markers in young-to-middle-aged men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [^19e4bbc5]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a rare disorder. This study evaluated the effect of androgen replacement therapy on atherosclerotic risk markers in young-to-middle-aged men with this disorder.

Design and Methods

Forty-three male patients aged 30 (range: 24–39 years) who were newly diagnosed with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and 20 age-, sex- and weight-matched controls (range: 26–39 years) were included in the study. Androgen replacement therapy was given according to the Algorithm of Testosterone Therapy in Adult Men with Androgen Deficiency Syndromes (2010; Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 95, 2536). The patients were assessed at a pretreatment visit and 3 and 6 months after the treatment. Inflammatory markers and lipid parameters were evaluated. Endothelial function was assessed with brachial flow-mediated dilation of a brachial artery and high-resolution ultrasonography of the carotid intima-media thickness.

Results

The carotid intima-media thickness (P < 0·001) was higher and the brachial flow-mediated diameter (P = 0·002) was lower in patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism compared to the control subjects at the pretreatment visit. There was a negative correlation between the total testosterone level and carotid intima-media thickness (r = -0·556, P = < 0·001). The carotid intima-media thickness and per cent flow-mediated diameter were significantly improved in the patient group 6 months after the androgen replacement therapy (P = 0·002 and 0·026, respectively).

Conclusions

This study indicated that low total testosterone levels can be considered a significant marker of atherosclerosis in patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and that androgen replacement therapy significantly reduces atherosclerotic risk markers in these patients after 6 months.

### Effects of androgen supplementation of hormone replacement therapy on the vascular reactivity of cerebral arteries [^ab6beea3]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of the androgen supplementation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the vascular reactivity of cerebral arteries.

Design

Open randomized study.

Setting

Healthy volunteers in an academic research environment.

Patient(S)

Forty postmenopausal women who were treated with sequential HRT (transdermal E2 50 microg/d + medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/d for 12 days every other month) for ≥ 1 year and ≤ 5 years.

Intervention(S)

Testosterone undecanoate (40 mg/d, p.o.) was randomly administered to 20 patients during ongoing HRT; the other 20 served as controls. Doppler evaluations of the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries were performed together with lipid levels assessments. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate various parameters relating to sexual life and well-being.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pulsatility index (PI) of the arteries, VAS assessment of psychophysical well-being.

Result(S)

The administration of testosterone undecanoate during HRT induced an increase in the PI of the middle cerebral artery and a reduction of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Sexual desire and satisfaction were greatly improved.

Conclusion(S)

In postmenopausal women, androgen supplementation during HRT can partially counteract the beneficial effects of estrogens on cerebral vascular reactivity and lipid profiles, but sexual desire and satisfaction are greatly improved.

### Low testosterone concentration and atherosclerotic disease markers in male patients with type 2 diabetes [^d8df0f3a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Low total T is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic complications. However, the magnitude of this association in middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has not been determined.

Materials and Methods

This cross-sectional study evaluated atherosclerotic disease markers in T2D patients with normal and low plasma total T. A total of 115 male patients, aged younger than 70 years, without a history of cardiovascular events, and with normal [≥ 3.5 ng/mL (≥ 12.1 nmol/L), n = 79] or low [< 3.5 ng/mL (≤ 12.1 nmol/L), n = 36] total T underwent the measurement of highly sensitive C-reactive protein, carotid artery carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), and atherosclerotic plaque by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound and to asses endothelial function by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation.

Results

Carotid IMT was negatively correlated with total T concentration (r = -0.39, P < .0001). Compared with subjects with normal T, a higher proportion of patients with low total T had carotid IMT of 0.1 cm or greater [80% vs 39%, odds ratio (OR) 6.41; 95% CI 2.5–16.4, P < .0001], atherosclerotic plaques (68.5% vs 44.8%, OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.12–6.03, P < .0001); endothelial dysfunction (80.5% vs 42.3%, OR 5.77, 95% CI 2.77–14.77, P < .003), and higher highly sensitive C-reactive protein levels (2.74 ± 5.82 vs 0.89 ± 0.88 mg/L, P < .0001). Similar results were found when free T was considered. Multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, diabetes mellitus duration, hemoglobin A1c, lipids, treatment effect, and body mass index reported that a low total T level was independently associated with greater IMT [OR 8.43 (95% CI 2.5–25.8)] and endothelial dysfunction [OR 5.21 (95% CI 1.73–15.66)] but not with the presence of atherosclerotic plaques (OR 1.77, 95% CI 0.66–4.74).

Conclusions

Low T is associated with more advanced atherosclerotic disease markers in middle-aged patients with T2D.

### Systemic effects of the hormonal treatment of male hypogonadism with preliminary indications for the management of COVID-19 patients [^78581169]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The Testosterone in Older Men with Mobility Limitations (TOM) trial was a placebo-controlled, randomized study design aimed at assessing the impact of TRT on muscle strength in aging males with TD and limited physical function. The trial was interrupted early due to the increased prevalence of adverse cardiovascular events in the TRT group. Since then, a debate has arisen on the cardiovascular safety of TRT. However, data obtained in TOM trial were not generalizable because the T doses administered were higher than those used in clinical practice. Furthermore, the population study was composed by frail elderly men with limited mobility and an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases (e.g. previous heart diseases, obesity, diabetes, hypertension), and so more predisposed to cardiovascular events than general population.

The Testosterone Trials were a group of seven placebo-controlled trials designed to evaluate the effects of TRT on men ⩾65 years of age with low T levels. Among them, the Cardiovascular Trial showed an increase in noncalcified coronary artery plaque volume by computed tomographic angiography in participants who received T. However, the prevalence of MACEs and the levels of markers of inflammation, fibrinolysis, or myocardial damage (D-dimer, C-reactive protein, IL-6, and troponin) did not differ among groups. It has been hypothesized that the observed increase in plaque volume may represent the initial phase of a healing response induced by T leading to a more stable plaque. Indeed, in other studies a reduction in carotid intimal media thickness has been reported. In animal models, T deficiency promoted the formation of lipid streak, the first stage of atherosclerotic plaque, while TRT protected against it.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1b017e92]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — cardiovascular outcomes evidence: There have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) large or long enough to determine the effects of T‑replacement therapy on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and there is no conclusive evidence that T supplementation is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in hypogonadal men. Observational data are inconsistent regarding endogenous T with coronary artery disease and cardiovascular events, and a small number of epidemiologic studies have reported a negative relationship between T and measures of subclinical atherosclerosis. Lower T has been associated with higher risk for all‑cause mortality, especially cardiovascular mortality, but epidemiological studies cannot prove causality and reverse causality cannot be excluded; men with erectile dysfunction and low T may have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all‑cause mortality, but a causal association cannot be inferred. There are no adequately powered RCTs on the effects of T replacement on MACE.

### Relationship between serum levels of sex hormones and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women [^bee92318]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Postmenopausal hormone therapy has been examined extensively in relation to cardiovascular disease. However, research relating serum levels of sex hormones to cardiovascular disease is sparse, and the results are inconclusive.

Methods

We measured sex hormones in longitudinally collected samples of 180 postmenopausal women, 91 randomized to 17beta-estradiol and 89 to placebo, in the Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial. Repeated measures of sex hormone levels were tested for an association with carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT), which was also assessed longitudinally over 2 yr.

Results

In all women, changes in serum estrone (P = 0.02), total estradiol (P = 0.01), free estradiol (P = 0.02), and SHBG (P = 0.005) were significantly inversely associated with CIMT progression, controlling for age and body mass index. All the estrogen compounds and SHBG were significantly inversely related with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and positively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P < 0.0001), whereas free testosterone was positively related with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and inversely associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.003). Despite an increase in serum-free estradiol with estradiol therapy, women with unchanged SHBG and free testosterone levels had an average (se) progression in CIMT of 8.53 (4.72) microm/yr, whereas women with increased free estradiol and SHBG and decreased free testosterone had the largest reduction in CIMT progression [-5.45 (2.77) microm/yr; trend P = 0.03].

Conclusion

Estrogen and SHBG are associated with reduced subclinical atherosclerosis progression in healthy postmenopausal women. These associations are partially mediated by their beneficial effects on lipids. Among women taking estradiol, the most beneficial hormone profile for CIMT progression was increased free estradiol and SHBG with concomitant decreased free testosterone.

### The effects of testosterone on risk factors for, and the mediators of, the atherosclerotic process [^4f3aaaf6]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

It is becoming increasingly evident that the low serum levels of testosterone experienced by aging men are associated with increased all-cause mortality from CHD and other vascular disorders. Achieving a normal physiological testosterone concentration through the administration of testosterone therapy has been shown to provide beneficial effects on the pathophysiological markers and clinical symptoms of CHD. Many of the factors involved in the atherosclerotic process are interlinked with other, increasingly prevalent pathological conditions such as obesity, the metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes and erectile dysfunction, suggesting that testosterone therapy has potentially wide-ranging health benefits. As the number and scope of testosterone substitution and androgen deprivation studies increases and evidence accumulates, it is timely to assess available data and this review summarises the current understanding of the effects of testosterone on cardiovascular risk factors with particular emphasis on the relevance of testosterone treatment.

### Testosterone and cardiovascular disease: an old idea with modern clinical implications [^a33b48d2]. Atherosclerosis (2011). Low credibility.

The role of sex steroid hormones in modulating vascular function in men is of great importance, given that androgen deficiency is strongly associated with common medical conditions including metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and atherosclerosis. Testosterone deficiency afflicts approximately 30% of men ages 40–79 years. Testosterone replacement in deficient men with such co-morbidities ameliorates or partially reverses their progression. Studies in animal and humans suggest that androgen deficiency is associated with increased triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Emerging evidence indicates that androgens may provide a protective effect against the development and/or progression of atherosclerosis in men.

### Androgens and cardiovascular disease [^fd5996da]. Endocrine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Globally, cardiovascular disease will continue causing most human deaths for the foreseeable future. The consistent gender gap in life span of approximately 5.6 yr in all advanced economies must derive from gender differences in age-specific cardiovascular death rates, which rise steeply in parallel for both genders but 5–10 yr earlier in men. The lack of inflection point at modal age of menopause, contrasting with unequivocally estrogen-dependent biological markers like breast cancer or bone density, makes estrogen protection of premenopausal women an unlikely explanation. Limited human data suggest that testosterone exposure does not shorten life span in either gender, and oral estrogen treatment increases risk of cardiovascular death in men as it does in women. Alternatively, androgen exposure in early life (perinatal androgen imprinting) may predispose males to earlier onset of atherosclerosis. Following the recent reevaluation of the estrogen-protection orthodoxy, empirical research has flourished into the role of androgens in the progression of cardiovascular disease, highlighting the need to better understand androgen receptor (AR) coregulators, nongenomic androgen effects, tissue-specific metabolic activation of androgens, and androgen sensitivity. Novel therapeutic targets may arise from understanding how androgens enhance early plaque formation and cause vasodilatation via nongenomic androgen effects on vascular smooth muscle, and how tissue-specific variations in androgen effects are modulated by AR coregulators as well as metabolic activation of testosterone to amplify (via 5alpha-reductase to form dihydrotestosterone acting on AR) or diversify (via aromatization to estradiol acting upon estrogen receptor alpha/beta) the biological effects of testosterone on the vasculature. Observational studies show that blood testosterone concentrations are consistently lower among men with cardiovascular disease, suggesting a possible preventive role for testosterone therapy, which requires critical evaluation by further prospective studies. Short-term interventional studies show that testosterone produces a modest but consistent improvement in cardiac ischemia over placebo, comparable to the effects of existing antianginal drugs. By contrast, testosterone therapy has no beneficial effects in peripheral arterial disease but has not been evaluated in cerebrovascular disease. Erectile dysfunction is most frequently caused by pelvic arterial insufficiency due to atherosclerosis, and its sentinel relationship to generalized atherosclerosis is insufficiently appreciated. The commonality of risk factor patterns and mechanisms (including endothelial dysfunction) suggests that the efficacy of antiatherogenic therapy is an important challenge with the potential to enhance men's motivation for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

### Sixteen years post radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma elicited multi-dysfunction along PTX and chronic kidney disease with microcytic anemia [^49bff4b5]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

During replacement therapy, clinicians should monitor patients for the efficacy and side effects of testosterone. Serum testosterone concentrations can vary with any of these preparations, so testosterone should be measured more than once to determine whether the initial dose is optimal. Serum testosterone should be measured again after a dose is changed and then once or twice a year. If the serum testosterone concentration is maintained within the normal range, the patient should experience reversal of the consequences of testosterone deficiency. Specifically, energy, libido, hemoglobin concentration, muscle mass, and bone density will increase. Noteworthy, hypogonadism has been associated with several risk factors of atherosclerosis including obesity, Type II DM, dyslipidemia and hypertension.

Hypogonadism having low testosterone levels with increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) may evidence early atherosclerosis. In addition, low testosterone increases the susceptibility to myocardial ischemia. Erectile dysfunction is a symptom of hypogonadism, but also an end result of atherosclerosis and a predictor of coronary artery atherosclerosis (CAD).

The replacement therapy was subsequently associated with rise in haemoglobin to 12.3 g/dL after 3 months and 13.5 g/dL, MCV 86 after 7 months. It is important to remember the role of pituitary hormones in erythropoiesis and consider hypopituitarism in the differential diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. Steroid and testosterone replacement corrected anaemia in this patient however it is not clear which hormone played a major role.

Hypopituitarism associated secondary adrenal insufficiency must be frequently noted to avoid the occurrence of severe hyponatremia. Replacement therapy with testosterone, thyroid hormone, coritsol and saline infusion are effective strategies. Cortisol inhibits sodium loss through the small intestine of mammals. Sodium depletion, however, does not affect cortisol levels. So cortisol cannot be used to regulate serum sodium. The original task of cortisol may have been sodium transport.

### Carotid artery intima-media thickness can predict the response of patients with erectile dysfunction to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors [^7681c09f]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2019). Medium credibility.

This study investigated the role of carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) as a morphological marker of the response of vasculogenic erectile dysfunction (ED) patients to tadalafil, one of the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5-I). Through March-December 2016, 51 men with vasculogenic ED aged over 30 years were enrolled in this prospective study. Vasculogenic ED was accepted as a normal testosterone level, with penile colour Doppler ultrasonography showing arteriogenic ED, venogenic ED or mixed arteriogenic and venogenic ED. All patients underwent biochemical and hormonal blood tests, ultrasonographic evaluation of the common carotid artery (CCA) IMT and penile colour Doppler ultrasonography. On-demand tadalafil (10mg or 20mg in cases of a non-response to 10mg) was administered to each patient for 2 months. ED was assessed using the short form of International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) before and after the drug therapy. According to the patients' responses to the medication, they were grouped as non-responders or responders. Thirty-one of the 51 patients responded to tadalafil. The mean CCA IMT of the non-responders and responders was 0.9 ± 0.2mm and 0.6 ± 0.2mm, respectively (P = 0.000). The IMT of 90% of the non-responders was > 0.67mm, whereas it was > 0.67mm in 40% of the responders. The data were analysed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-square test, t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Measurement of CCA IMT may offer an alternative and simple method to predict the response of vasculogenic ED patients to PDE5-Is.

### Estrogens, progestins, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and the arterial tree [^8f4b2702]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

We reviewed studies of the effects of different estrogens, progestins, and selective estrogen receptor modulators at the coronary and carotid arterial sites to help determine their likely effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. All English-language studies published between 1997 and 2000 on MEDLINE, Current Contents, and Best Evidence were reviewed, including in vitro, other animal, human physiologic, and clinical trial studies. We synthesize, assess limitations, and integrate across systems with the in vivo experience in humans to evaluate the clinical context. Estrogens have favorable direct effects in most circumstances, progestins oppose these effects, and early studies suggest that selective estrogen receptor modulators are protective. In some systems the dosage, route of delivery, and type of progestin may be important and risk factors may modulate hormone effects. The evaluation of endothelial dysfunction gives a unique in vivo opportunity to assess the vascular properties of hormones, although the relationship between the in vivo physiologic effects of hormones and clinical outcomes remains to be determined.

### Association of menopause and hormone replacement therapy with large artery remodeling [^3fbc3f8e]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the remodeling of large arteries according to age at menopause, duration of menopause, and use of hormone therapy (HT).

Design

A cross-sectional study consisting of baseline measurements of a multicentric randomized trial were used to evaluate arterial parameters.

Setting

The study was conducted in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands in academic hospitals and private clinics.

Patient(S)

Postmenopausal women (n = 538) with mild hypercholesterolemia.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), central pulse pressure, and aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity) were measured and centrally controlled for quality. Multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the possible covariates associated with arterial parameters.

Result(S)

Women were 58 ± 6 (mean ± SD) years of age with an age of 50 ± 5 at menopause and a mean duration of menopause of 8 ± 7 years. Lower age at menopause, time since menopause, and absence of HT use were independently associated with worsening of the arterial parameters. After multivariate analysis, HT was associated with a lower CCA-IMT (-40 μm [range -64 to -1]), whereas lower age at menopause and menopause duration were respectively associated with a CCA-IMT increase (25 μm/5 y and 27 μm/5 y). Similarly, values of central pulse pressure and pulse wave velocity were lower in HT users (-3.1 mm Hg [-5.1 to -0.9] and -0.31 m/s [-0.63 to -0.02], respectively) but worsened with age at menopause and menopause duration.

Conclusion(S)

The age at menopause, the time since menopause, and the use of HT are independently associated with the thickening and stiffening of the large arteries.

Clinical Trial Registration Number

### Changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness 3 years after cessation of menopausal hormone therapy: follow-up from the kronos early estrogen prevention study [^e34bc4f3]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The number of women in this study was small and the duration of menopausal hormone treatment (only 4 y) and follow-up (3 y) was relatively short.

Also, by limiting our analysis to the subset of participants who completed the 7-year visit (to study on- and post-treatment trends in the same individuals), the effect of treatment randomization may have been compromised. Accordingly, we investigated the sensitivity of our results to potential confounding and selection bias by repeating the longitudinal analysis of on-treatment trends using all KEEPS women (at the Mayo site) for whom CIMT data were available. This analysis yielded results comparable to those of the primary analysis, although the 4-year increase in CIMT in the oCEE group was greater and more consistent with that of the other treatments. Although our primary results may have underestimated this group's response to treatment, the lack of 7-year CIMT measurements from nonparticipants limits our ability to address the implications of post-treatment trends. Additional analysis of potential selection bias revealed lower systolic blood pressure and higher HDL cholesterol measurements during KEEPS among participants in the present study compared with nonparticipants. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of a healthier subset in the present study, even if clinical descriptors were otherwise similar.

The doses of hormones used in the KEEPS reflected the clinical recommendations after the Women's Health Initiative for using lower doses of hormones for the shortest period of time at the time. It is unclear as to what the optimal dose of hormone might be for various outcomes (vasomotor, sleep quality, sexual dysfunction, bone, and CIMT). The doses of MHT used in KEEPS were effective in alleviating hot flushes, improving sleep and sexual function, and reducing bone loss in participants randomized to active treatment - but were not effective in altering CIMT during the study. Evaluation of progression of cardiovascular disease with other formulations of estrogen (oral E 2)or similar formulations of higher dosageas used in KEEPS for longer treatment periods or longer follow-up are warranted.

### Changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness 3 years after cessation of menopausal hormone therapy: follow-up from the kronos early estrogen prevention study [^b0b074ef]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Cessation of lower dosages of MHT such as those used for 4 years in the KEEPS study did not accelerate changes in CIMT over a 3-year period. Larger studies of longer duration of MHT on CIMT in healthy women and longer follow-up for women once they stop using MHT are warranted to better understand the temporal sequence of activational effects of MHT on vascular function.

### Association of age at menopause with incident heart failure: a prospective cohort study and meta-analysis [^c658e82a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The underlying mechanisms by which early menopause may influence HF risk remain elusive. Because early menopause leads to reduced exposure to endogenous estrogens, it has been postulated that such women experience less lifetime cardioprotective effect of ovarian estrogen. This argument was first observed among premenopausal women with bilateral oophorectomy, among which those who used exogenous hormones had lower incidence of CVD events compared with those without hormone therapy use. 34 Estrogen deficiency after menopause predisposes women to adverse levels of risk factors for HF, 35 and evidence from animal models suggests that reduced estrogen levels may directly or indirectly contribute to diastolic dysfunction and hypertensive heart diseases in postmenopausal women. Specifically, the loss of ovarian estrogens leads to chronic activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and the nitric oxide synthase system as well as other related intracellular signaling pathways, in part via the membrane G protein–coupled receptor 30. 35, 36 This can result in endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and immune dysfunction, which may lead to collagen synthesis, LV remodeling, and diastolic dysfunction, 35, 36, 37 the latter being a major cause of HF among women. 38 Despite these reported cardioprotective roles of hormone therapy in experimental studies, there are contrasting reports about the influence of hormone therapy for the prevention of CVD end points among postmenopausal women. On the one hand, some controlled primary prevention trials show slower progression of subclinical CVD 39, 40 and lower risk of CVD mortality 41 among postmenopausal women on hormone therapy compared with those on placebo. On the other hand, other randomized trials have observed no benefits of hormone therapy in the primary 42, 43 or secondary 44, 45, 46 prevention of CVD end points in postmenopausal women. Although a few trials among recently menopausal women show slower progressions of carotid artery intima–media thickness in women taking estradiol, 47 others show no effect of estradiol or other hormone therapies on vascular endothelial function, 48 carotid artery intima–media thickness, 49 or coronary artery calcium and total stenosis. 47 These equivocal results cast doubt about a cardioprotective role for estrogen in CVD development among postmenopausal women.

### Requires labeling change to inform of possible increased risk of heart… [^2c0e224f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Testosterone is FDA-approved as replacement therapy only for men who have low testosterone levels due to disorders of the testicles, pituitary gland, or brain that cause a condition called hypogonadism. Examples of these disorders include failure of the testicles to produce testosterone because of genetic problems, or damage from chemotherapy or infection. However, FDA has become aware that testosterone is being used extensively in attempts to relieve symptoms in men who have low testosterone for no apparent reason other than aging. The benefits and safety of this use have not been established.
- For each patient, weigh the potential increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes and other risks of testosterone replacement therapy against the potential benefits of treating hypogonadism.
- Inform patients of the potential increased cardiovascular risk associated with testosterone replacement therapy.
- Encourage patients to read the patient Medication Guide or patient information leaflet they receive with their testosterone prescriptions. Data Summary FDA reviewed five observational studies 4–8 and two meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials 9, 10 to examine the risk of cardiovascular events associated with testosterone replacement therapy. The five observational studies were retrospective cohort studies that reported conflicting results. Two of these studies found statistically significant cardiovascular harm with TRT, 4–5 two studies found a statistically significant mortality benefit with TRT, 6–7 and one study was inconclusive.
8. The Vigen study evaluated male veterans who underwent angiography and had low testosterone concentrations. On average, testosterone-treated men were 64 years old and untreated men were 61 years old.

This study found an increased risk with TRT compared to no TRT for the composite cardiovascular outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. 9 This study found that testosterone therapy was associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events; however, methodological issues limit conclusions. These limitations include inconsistent and incomplete reporting of adverse events; substantial clinical heterogeneity in the design and conduct of the component trials and the types of cardiovascular outcomes included in the analyses; potential bias resulting from selection of component trials; and variable quality of the trials, particularly with regard to ascertainment of cardiovascular safety outcomes and balance in cardiovascular risk factors and discontinuation rates across study arms.

### New horizons: testosterone or exercise for cardiometabolic health in older men [^6bebdb6c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

What Are the Effects of Testosterone, Exercise, and Their Combination on Vascular Function?

What Is Vascular Function and How Is it Assessed?

The vascular endothelium is integral to the maintenance of vascular health in humans, and arterial dysfunction precedes clinical manifestation of CVD. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) measures the dilator response of a conduit artery to reactive hyperemia after temporary distal occlusion and ischemia. FMD is a validated surrogate measure for vascular health and a powerful predictor of future CVD events, with a 1% increase in FMD translating to a 9% to 13% improvement in CVD outcomes. In men, FMD decreases with age in a curvilinear fashion as a function of baseline arterial diameter. FMD is largely, though not solely, mediated by endothelial release of nitric oxide (NO), which has vasodilator and other antiatherogenic effects. To specifically test vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to NO (ie, NO-mediated but endothelium-independent dilation), NO donors such as glyceryl trinitrate can be administered. Given that advancing age and low T concentrations both are associated with endothelial dysfunction and reduced FMD in men, whether T treatment has beneficial effects on artery function in aging men is a relevant question.

### Endogenous testosterone and its relationship to preclinical and clinical measures of cardiovascular disease in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study [^d08d7626]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Epidemiologic studies suggest that endogenous testosterone (T) levels in males may be implicated in cardiovascular disease (CVD), however further clarification is needed.

Objective

We assessed the cross-sectional relationship between endogenous plasma T and mean carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), and the longitudinal relationship with incident clinical CVD events, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality using male participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.

Design

This study involved a subset of men from visit 4 of the ARIC study.

Setting

The study was conducted in a community based cohort.

Participants

Males who provided a morning blood sample excluding those taking androgen therapy, with prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, or heart failure (HF) (n = 1558).

Intervention

None.

Main Outcome Measures

Plasma T by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and carotid IMT using high resolution B-mode ultrasound were obtained at visit 4. Incident CHD, HF, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality were identified by surveillance through 2010 (median 12.8 years).

Results

Lower T was significantly associated with higher body mass index, greater waist circumference, diabetes, hypertension, lower HDL, and never smoking (P = 0.01). T was not associated with mean cIMT in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. Following multivariable adjustment, there was no association of quartile (Q) of T with incident CHD [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.87 (95% CI = 0.60–1.26) for Q1; 0.97 (95% CI = 0.69–1.38) for Q2; 0.97 (95% CI = 0.69–1.36) for Q3 compared to reference of Q4] or for incident HF [HR = 0.77 (95% CI = 0.46–1.29) for Q1; 0.72 (95% CI = 0.43–1.21) for Q2; 0.87 (95% CI = 0.53–1.42) for Q3 compared to reference of Q4]. Similarly there was no association of Q of T with mortality or cardiac-associated mortality.

Conclusions

Low male plasma T is cross-sectionally associated with key CVD risk factors, but after adjustment there was no association with mean cIMT, incident cardiac events, or mortality. Our results are reassuring that neither high nor low T levels directly predict atherosclerosis, but are a marker for other cardiovascular risk factors.

Association Between Levels of Endogenous Testosterone and Severity of Coronary Artery Disease

There is growing evidence supporting an inverse relationship between the degree of testosterone deficiency and the severity of coronary artery disease. Four investigators have independently demonstrated that in men with CAD, lower levels of endogenous testosterone are associated with more severe CAD (Table 2).– These results must be interpreted with caution because of the relatively small sample size included in each study and differing study designs. The exact mechanism of action through which testosterone deficiency results in the worsening of CAD is unknown. Testosterone deficiency may cause the worsening of CAD by negatively affecting the components of the metabolic syndrome, such as insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and visceral obesity. The correlation between low testosterone levels and worsening T2DMand obesityhas been well established. The evidence for the association between testosterone and different lipoprotein subfractions is less convincing. Testosterone deficiency is also shown to negatively affect carotid intima‐media thickness, and therefore it would be reasonable to assume it would have the same deleterious effect on the coronary arteries. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies that have investigated the association between testosterone levels and coronary artery intima‐media thickness. Finally, low testosterone may influence the severity of CAD by adversely affecting the mediators of the inflammatory response such as high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein, interleukin‐6, and tumor necrosis factor–α. Additional investigation using biologically active levels of testosterone is required to further elucidate the association between low testosterone levels and severity of CAD.

Effects of DHT on platelet aggregation and thrombosis

There has been a long-standing concern regarding androgen use and its potential relationship to thrombosis, an area that remains controversial. We will not review here the general literature in this regard but instead focus on the limited data regarding DHT based on animal and human clinical data. The processes involved in thrombosis are complex and reflect the integrated response of pro- and antithrombotic mediators as well as complex interactions of androgen and estrogen that are poorly understood. Evidence that DHT may act to stimulate platelet aggregation was first noted in mice implanted with DHT pellets. However, the effect of DHT was only observed in mesenteric arterioles and not, ex vivo, in platelet aggregation experiments. In rat studies, physiologic concentrations of DHT [2 nmol/L (58 ng/dL)] were shown to significantly inhibit adenosine 5′-diphosphate–induced platelet aggregation via direct interaction with ARs in platelets. At 291 ng/dL (10 nmol/L), this effect was lost but DHT did not stimulate aggregation to a greater extent than that observed in control or castrated rats. A similar action of DHT at 58 ng/dL (2 nmol/L) was observed in oxidative stress–induced platelet aggregation that was also associated with a reduction in thromboxane A2 release from platelets.

Clinical studies of DHT therapy in men have not revealed a demonstrable effect of sustained supraphysiological levels of DHT on thrombosis or endothelial function (See " Clinical Data From DHT Administration in Supraphysiologic Doses on CVD" for detail). DHT therapy for 6 months did not adversely affect endothelial and smooth muscle–dependent vascular function as measured by flow-mediated or glycerol trinitrate–induced dilation nor was brachial artery size affected. In a 24-month trial of DHT therapy in normal men, there were no thrombotic events attributed to DHT nor were exceptionally high levels of DHT associated with a change in right carotid intima-media thickening.

### Dihydrotestosterone: biochemistry, physiology, and clinical implications of elevated blood levels [^45cc4713]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

In contrast to the findings of Borst et al. two separate studies, one a cross-sectional analysis and the other a longitudinal analysis, have assessed associations of T, DHT, and estradiol with all-cause ischemic heart disease and lower-limb intermittent claudication in older (70 to 89 years) men. Higher DHT levels (measured by LC-MS/MS) were associated with lower risk for intermittent claudication and ischemic heart disease, independent of SHBG concentrations and conventional risk factors for vascular disease. The authors concluded that their findings were consistent with a possible cardioprotective influence of androgen exposure but that additional prospective studies are needed to confirm the observed effects.

Finally, differential effects of T, DHT, and estradiol on carotid intima-media thickness and the presence of carotid plaque in men with and without coronary artery disease (CAD) have been reported. In men with CAD, higher DHT or estradiol was associated with significantly less carotid plaque, but this was not the case in men without CAD. Here, T was associated with reduced carotid intima-media thickening and a lower prevalence of carotid plaque, whereas estradiol was associated with opposite effects. The potential role of DHT to influence risk of CAD, perhaps by directly affecting adverse pathological processes involved in the development of atherosclerosis, deserves significantly more investigation in well-controlled interventional clinical studies in men at risk for CAD but without frank clinical manifestations of CVD as well as men with CAD.

### Androgen deprivation therapy reversibly increases endothelium-dependent vasodilation in men with prostate cancer [^34e8d4c5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In contrast to our hypothesis, gonadotropin‐releasing hormone agonist–mediated ADT increased conduit artery flow‐mediated vasodilation in men with prostate cancer between baseline and 3 months and returned to baseline 6 months after ADT cessation. These results suggest that the mechanism of increased cardiovascular events that occurs within weeks to months of ADT initiation is not related to reductions in the bioavailability of endothelium‐derived nitric oxide. To our knowledge, this report is the first in intact ambulatory humans demonstrating conduit artery function before, during, and after the application of ADT.

ADT and Endothelial Function

The relevance of androgens to vascular function stems from the association of heightened mortality in states of androgen deficiency. – In the InCHIANTI study, decline of testosterone levels was an independent predictor of mortality over 6 years of follow‐up. Similarly a nested case–control study with 6‐ to 10‐year follow‐up showed an association with testosterone decline and increased mortality. Longer follow‐up, studied in the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, attenuates the relationship. Possible mechanisms for increased mortality stem from the association of diminished androgens and increased levels of inflammation and fat mass. – Pertinent to this work, androgen deficiency has been associated with impaired conduit artery endothelium‐dependent vasodilation; however, the relationship is not straightforward. Testosterone replacement has been shown to improve vascular stiffnessbut also has been shown to worsen endothelium‐dependent vasodilation in hypogonadal men. It is likely that the etiology of decreased androgens plays an important role beyond the change in hormone levels per se in determining vascular health. Testosterone may be a biomarker of illness in this setting as well as a contributor to vascular function.

### Sex differences in the association of cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in normative aging [^b13ffb7d]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

The significant negative association between CBF and CMR GLC across older females but not older males may also reflect underlying biological differences, which are thought to be key contributors to different aging trajectories and disease risks in women and men, including the risk for neurodegeneration. For example, it is possible that older males compensate for a reduction in blood flow and glucose availability through different mechanisms. Reductions in CBF in older men (Moffat and Resnick) have been attributed to the modulating role of testosterone in vascular function via angiogenesis and BBB permeability (Ahmadpour and Grange‐Messent). Changes in estrogen and testosterone also contribute to the different courses of aging in females and males (see (Austad) for review). Brain‐derived hormones, as well as proteins and peptides that act in the brain, such as growth hormone, insulin receptor substrate 2, and insulin‐like growth factor (IGF‐1), also contribute to differences in brain aging observed between the sexes (Austad).

In this study, all females in the younger group were pre‐menopausal (we did not control for cycle phase or use of hormonal contraceptives). All females in the older group were post‐menopausal, and only three (15%) were on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Therefore, it is tempting to conclude that the differences between young and older females are hormonal in origin. While we do not have data linking sex hormones to CBF in our sample, research suggests that sex hormones play a mediating role in the control of CBF. For example, CBF and carotid artery flow increase following acute estrogen administration and long‐term hormone replacement therapy in post‐menopausal women (Ohkura et al; Kaya et al; Ciccone et al.). Future research could explore these linkages by measuring sex hormones together with cerebral blood flow and metabolism.

Testosterone and Intima‐Media Thickness

Intima‐media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery is considered a marker for preclinical atherosclerosis. – Increasing carotid IMT has been associated with generalized atherosclerosisand increased incidence of myocardial infarction – and strokeand is generally considered a poor prognostic factor for future adverse cardiovascular events. As mentioned earlier in this article, low endogenous testosterone has also been associated with worsening cardiovascular mortality, T2DM, and obesity. A number of studies have examined the association between testosterone levels and carotid IMT, with all the studies showing an inverse correlation between these 2 variables. The results of these studies are summarized in Table 7.

Table 7.
Association Between Endogenous Testosterone Level and Carotid Intima‐Media Thickness

Although some authors have focused on the association between testosterone levels and IMT of the carotid artery, other authors have evaluated the association between endogenous testosterone levels and IMT of the aorta. In a large population‐based study of 504 nonsmoking men and 528 nonsmoking women (the Rotterdam Study), Hak and colleagues demonstrated an inverse correlation between endogenous testosterone levels and atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta in men. Hak et al reported decreasing relative risk for severe atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta with increasing levels of endogenous total testosterone as well as increasing levels of endogenous bioavailable testosterone after adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors in men only. No significant association was found between testosterone levels and the presence of severe abdominal aortic atherosclerosis in women by Hak et al. These authors also discovered that men with higher levels of total or bioavailable testosterone experienced a significantly slower rate of progression of abdominal aortic atherosclerosis. Again, Hak et al did not find a significant association between testosterone levels and progression of atherosclerosis in the female abdominal aorta. Demirbag et al performed similar analysis on 42 men, but instead investigated the association between testosterone and thoracic aorta IMT. Demirbag et al discovered an inverse association between total testosterone and thoracic aorta IMT.

### Management of hypogonadism in cardiovascular patients: what are the implications of testosterone therapy on cardiovascular morbidity? [^4da82d4d]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy is recommended for men with clinical androgen deficiency with decades of evidence supporting its use for treatment of sexual, physical, and psychological consequences of male hypogonadism. In this updated review, the authors discuss the implications of testosterone deficiency and conflicting evidence regarding testosterone replacement therapy and its effects on the cardiovascular system. Based on mounting evidence, the authors conclude that testosterone therapy can be safely considered in men with appropriately diagnosed clinical androgen deficiency and concurrent cardiovascular risk factors and even manifest cardiovascular disease after a thorough discussion of potential risks and with guideline-recommended safety monitoring.

### Welcoming low testosterone as a cardiovascular risk factor [^dc8b3291]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

Atherosclerosis

Studies show that low testosterone levels are associated with atherosclerosis in all major vessels. Animal experiments have shown that testosterone inhibits plaque development in rabbits and rodents fed a high-fat diet. 15 It was Phillips et al. 16 who first reported an inverse relationship between low total and free testosterone levels and angiographically proven coronary artery disease after adjusting for age and adiposity. A recent study confirmed these findings, showing that men with coronary artery disease had lower levels of testosterone than controls and that testosterone levels were inversely correlated to the degree of coronary atherosclerosis. 17 In the Rotterdam study, the association between total and bioavailable testosterone and aortic atherosclerosis was evaluated in 504 non-smoking men aged ⩾55 years. 14 They found that men in the highest tertile had a risk reduction of 60–80% of severe aortic atherosclerosis after controlling for age and CV risk factors. Another prospective study of elderly men (mean age 77 years) showed free testosterone to be inversely related to the progression of intima–media thickness of the common carotid artery over 4 years. 18 Furthermore, men in the lowest tertile of testosterone experienced more progression.

### Physiological testosterone replacement and arterial endothelial function in men [^0c6a5e8b]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The vascular effects of fluctuations in testosterone levels within the physiological range in otherwise healthy men are not known. We therefore aimed to study arterial function in hypogonadal men receiving long-term physiological androgen replacement therapy, at trough and peak testosterone levels.

Patients and Design

We recruited nine hypogonadal men (aged 35 ± 4 years) receiving androgen replacement therapy, each treated with 800 mg testosterone (T) depot preparations every 6 months.

Measurements

Serum lipid and hormone levels and arterial reactivity were measured, prior to (trough T) and 2–4 weeks following testosterone administration (peak T). Each subject therefore served as their own control. Vessel diameter was measured by ultrasound at rest, during reactive hyperaemia [leading to flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), an endothelium-dependent response] and after sublingual nitroglycerin (GTN, an endothelium-independent dilator).

Results

Serum T (13 ± 2 nmvs. 27 ± 3 nm for trough and peak serum T, respectively, P < 0.001; normal adult male range 11–35 nm), and free T (195 ± 23 pmvs. 510 ± 93 pm, P < 0.005) significantly increased following subcutaneous depot T administration, as did serum oestradiol (100 ± 10 pmvs. 175 ± 9 pm, P = 0.001; normal adult male range < 250 pm). There was a significant decrease in FMD (3.6 ± 1.1%vs. 3.0 ± 0.8%, P < 0.01), but GTN responses were similar (9.5 ± 0.8%vs. 10.4 ± 1.0%, P > 0.2). Lipid, blood pressure and vessel diameter measurements were also similar before and after testosterone administration.

Conclusion

Physiological replacement of testosterone is associated with decreased endothelium-dependent dilatation, in hypogonadal men.

### Testosterone: a hormone preventing cardiovascular disease or a therapy increasing cardiovascular events? [^3b0b3931]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Decreasing testosterone levels with ageing is a well-known condition in older men named 'low T', 'manopause', or hypogonadism. Observational studies suggested an association between low endogenous testosterone levels and a high cardio-metabolic profile (increased blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, thrombosis), as well as a modest increase in total and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Controversies persist regarding the need for screening 'low T' in older men, as well as what precisely should be the indication(s) for testosterone replacement therapy. So far, no data have shown that normalization of testosterone levels reduce CV events. Although testosterone replacement therapy seems to have beneficial effects on male quality of life or physical condition, some data suggest serious adverse events, such as CV events. In addition, there is a lack of consensus on the threshold for treatment indication in men with non-specific symptoms or borderline levels of testosterone. Available data from clinical practice setting suggest an increase in testosterone prescription over time and possible overtreatment. In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have promoted 'low T' as a treatable disease, suggesting that testosterone replacement may help restore energy, positive mood and sexuality, and despite ageing. Currently, well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the impact of testosterone replacement therapy on CV clinically relevant CV outcomes within age-specific ranges to strengthen the evidence for clinical practice guidelines.

### Vascular reactivity in hypogonadal men is reduced by androgen substitution [^07ccdaed]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

The effect of testosterone (T) substitution therapy on blood vessel functions in relation to cardiovascular disease has not been fully elucidated. In 36 newly diagnosed nonsmoking hypogonadal men (37.5 ± 12.7 yr) endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD; decreased in atherosclerosis) of the brachial artery was assessed before treatment and after 3 months of T substitution therapy (250 mg testosterone enanthate im every 2 wk in 19 men, human chorionic gonadotropin sc twice per week in 17 men). Twenty nonsmoking controls matched for age, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), body height, and baseline diameter of the artery were selected for repeated measurements from a larger eugonadal control group (n = 113). In hypogonadal men, basal FMD (17.9 ± 4.5%) was significantly higher than in the large (11.9 ± 6.4%) and matched control (11.8 ± 7.1%, both P < 0.001) groups. Grouped multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant negative association of T levels with FMD within the hypogonadal range, but no significant association was seen within the eugonadal range. During substitution therapy, T levels increased from 5.8 ± 2.3 to 17.2 ± 5.1 nmol/liter and FMD decreased significantly to 8.6 ± 3.1% (P < 0.001, analysis for covariance for repeated measurements including matched controls). LDL-C and advanced age contributed significantly to decrease FMD (P = 0.01, P = 0.04, respectively). Because T substitution adversely affects this important predictor of atherosclerosis, other contributing factors (such as smoking, high blood glucose, and LDL-C) should be eliminated or strictly controlled during treatment of hypogonadal men.

### Testosterone deficiency: a determinant of aortic stiffness in men [^243cb330]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Low testosterone levels and increased aortic stiffness are predictors of cardiovascular events. The influence of androgen level on the age- and blood pressure-related increase in aortic stiffness is unknown.

Methods

From January 2007 to June 2011 we enrolled 455 consecutive men with no evidence of cardiovascular disease from a large cohort followed in our Department for arterial function studies. Their total testosterone (TT) levels were measured and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVc-f) was measured as an index of aortic stiffness.

Results

In multivariable analysis, PWVc-f values were inversely correlated to TT after adjustment for confounders (β = -0.365, P < 0.001). In younger age categories (< 50 yrs and 50–59 yrs), patients with testosterone deficiency (TD) had higher blood pressure-adjusted PWVc-f (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively) compared to subjects with normal TT, indicating an "aging effect" of 10 years, whereas in older age categories such a difference was not observed. Furthermore, in men with a higher mean pressure (102–108 mmHg and > 108 mmHg), patients with TD had higher age-adjusted PWVc-f (P < 0.001) compared to subjects with normal TT, indicating a synergistic unfavorable effect of testosterone deficiency and blood pressure on aortic stiffness.

Conclusions

TT levels are independently associated with aortic stiffening. The effect of low testosterone concentration on aortic stiffness is more prominent in young men and in subjects with higher blood pressure levels. These findings identify testosterone as a marker of arterial damage with special emphasis on young and hypertensive individuals and support its role as predictor of events.

### Testosterone and cardiovascular disease [^1678cf5c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Testosterone (T) is the principal male sex hormone. As men age, T levels typically fall. Symptoms of low T include decreased libido, vasomotor instability, and decreased bone mineral density. Other symptoms may include depression, fatigue, erectile dysfunction, and reduced muscle strength/mass. Epidemiology studies show that low levels of T are associated with more atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and cardiovascular events. However, treating hypogonadism in the aging male has resulted in discrepant results in regard to its effect on cardiovascular events. Emerging studies suggest that T may have a future role in treating heart failure, angina, and myocardial ischemia. A large, prospective, long-term study of T replacement, with a primary endpoint of a composite of adverse cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or cardiovascular death, is needed. The Food and Drug Administration recently put additional restrictions on T replacement therapy labeling and called for additional studies to determine its cardiac safety.

Recent data suggest that initiation or continuation of transdermal testosterone therapy in individuals with appropriate indications is reasonable and does not increase the risk of stroke.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^392cf927]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease risk counseling in testosterone deficiency — 13. Clinicians should inform testosterone deficient patients that low testosterone is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Low testosterone has been associated with higher risks of myocardial infarction (OR = 1.33; CI: 1.12, 1.59), cerebrovascular accidents (OR = 1.41; CI: 1.12, 1.59), cardiac event-related death (RR = 1.25; CI: 0.97, 1.60), and all-cause mortality (RR = 1.35; CI: 1.13, 1.62). Compared to men with normal testosterone, testosterone deficient men showed greater odds of hypertension (OR = 1.59; CI: 1.43, 1.77), dyslipidemia (OR = 1.34; CI: 1.21, 1.86), were nearly twice as likely to be obese (OR = 1.94; CI: 1.53, 2.47), and had higher BMI (OR = 1.97; CI: 1.62, 2.31). The presence of ASCVD risk factors is not a contraindication to starting testosterone therapy; however, optimization of modifiable risk factors using lifestyle and medical management strategies is recommended.

### Does female gender or hormone replacement therapy affect early or late outcome after carotid endarterectomy? [^9efaa4b1]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Subgroup analyses of the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial trials have questioned the ability of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to reduce the risk of stroke in women. The purpose of this study was to test the effect of female gender and estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy on perioperative (30-day) and long-term (5-year) outcomes after CEA.

Methods

From 1988 to 1998, 361 CEAs were performed in 326 patients (246 male, 115 female) by a single surgeon. Retrospective data were collected with chart review, and follow-up data were obtained with clinical examination or telephone interview. Follow-up was possible in 95% of patients. Reoperative CEAs and combined aortic or cardiac procedures were excluded. Statistical analysis used life-table methods, Student t test, and Pearson chi(2) tests when appropriate.

Results

Age and preoperative risk factors were similar between women and men. CEA was performed for symptomatic (50% female, 42% male) and asymptomatic carotid stenosis (50% female, 58% male; P = 0.19). Perioperative (30-day) stroke rate was similar for women and men (3.6% female, 1.2% male; P = 0.13). No perioperative strokes occurred in asymptomatic patients. With previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, a trend was seen towards an increased perioperative stroke rate in women (7.0% female, 2.8% male; P = 0.25). Long-term follow-up showed a similar trend in the 5-year stroke rate in symptomatic patients (7.0% female, 2.8 male; P = 0.23). The stroke-free survival rate was not significantly different between genders (87% female, 75% male; P = 0.58). Reoperation was performed for asymptomatic recurrent carotid stenosis in five men (2.3%) and two women (1.9%; P = 0.84). Interestingly, the use of estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy in women showed a trend toward increasing stroke rate at 30 days (1.2% versus 8.7%; P = 0.08) and at 5 years (2.3% versus 8.7%; P = 0.16).

Conclusion

This retrospective study confirms that CEA provides long-term reduction in stroke risk and improved stroke-free survival rates in both men and women. However, women with previous neurologic symptoms and those using hormone replacement therapy appear to be at higher stroke risk at the time of surgery.

### Carotid atheromatic plaque is commonly associated with hypopituitary men [^86d4e861]. Pituitary (2011). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism increases the risks of many cardiovascular conditions and therefore, patients with this disease are more prone to cardiovascular disease. To our knowledge, there have been few studies on carotid artery plaque in male patients with hypopituitarism in assessing cardiovascular risks. The aim of this study was to specifically compare carotid artery plaque while examining other major cardiovascular risk factors between male patients with hypopituitarism and control subjects. Forty male patients aged 30–70 years with hypopituitarism and forty age, sex- matched control subjects were recruited at the Yonsei University Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea. Carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and atheromatous plaque, anthropometry, lipid profile, and pituitary hormones were assessed. Atheromatous plaque in the carotid arteries was observed more frequently in patients with hypopituitarism than age- and sex-matched control subjects (59.5% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.01) without differences of carotid IMTs. Patients with hypopituitarism also exhibited higher waist circumference, waist to hip ratio, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol than control subjects. In subgroup analysis in male patients with hypopituitarism including GH deficiency, lower testosterone levels were associated with higher waist circumference (r = 0.446, P = 0.033). In conclusion, hypopituitary males exhibit an increased incidence of carotid artery plaque without differences of carotid IMTs, central obesity and higher total cholesterol level. Lower testosterone levels were associated with central obesity- a strong component of a metabolic syndrome, and unsubstituted testosterone deficiency might be an important cardiovascular risk factor in patients with hypopituitarism.

### Lower testosterone levels predict incident stroke and transient ischemic attack in older men [^e1d05acb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Lower circulating testosterone concentrations are associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, carotid intima-media thickness, and aortic and lower limb arterial disease in men. However, it is unclear whether lower testosterone levels predict major cardiovascular events.

Objective

We examined whether lower serum testosterone was an independently significant risk factor for symptomatic cerebrovascular events in older men.

Design

This was a prospective observational study with median follow-up of 3.5 yr.

Setting

Community-dwelling, stroke-free older men were studied.

Participants

A total of 3443 men at least 70 yr of age participated in the study.

Main Outcome Measures

Baseline serum total testosterone, SHBG, and LH were assayed. Free testosterone was calculated using mass action equations. Incident stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) was recorded.

Results

A first stroke or TIA occurred in 119 men (3.5%). Total and free testosterone concentrations in the lowest quartiles (< 11.7 nmol/liter and < 222 pmol/liter) were associated with reduced event-free survival (P = 0.014 and P = 0.01, respectively). After adjustment including age, waist-hip ratio, waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and medical comorbidity, lower total testosterone predicted increased incidence of stroke or TIA (hazard ratio = 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.33–2.99). Lower free testosterone was also associated (hazard ratio = 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.48), whereas SHBG and LH were not independently associated with incident stroke or TIA.

Conclusions

In older men, lower total testosterone levels predict increased incidence of stroke or TIA after adjusting for conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Men with low-normal testosterone levels had increased risk. Further studies are warranted to determine whether interventions that raise circulating testosterone levels might prevent cerebrovascular disease in men.

### Cardiovascular risk in women with nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^31f87b84]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

CVR has been evaluated by structural parameters such as carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and, more recently, by the following functional parameters: (1) aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), which quantifies arterial stiffness, and (2) endothelial function, which is observed through flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in the brachial artery. Functional parameters are early markers of CVR and can precede the development of atherosclerosis even before the identification of arterial structural changes. A few studies have evaluated these parameters in patients with classical forms, and they included patients receiving mixed GC regimens. Increased CIMT was observed in young patients in relation to matched controls and was positively correlated with serum androgen levels. On the other hand, in an Australian cohort including 14 adolescents with classical forms of CAH, the CIMT was normal, but impaired vascular endothelial function through FMD was identified in comparison with controls. Another cohort of 19 young Polish women with classical forms also presented lower FMD compared to matched controls.

As there is no study in the literature evaluating cardiovascular risk (CVR) in patients with NCAH, our objective was to evaluate whether adult patients have increased CVR. Subsequently, we aimed to evaluate whether this risk was associated with long-term GC therapy or chronic hyperandrogenism exposure. Answering this question will be useful to define the optimal therapy for patients with the nonclassical form, which is still controversial.

### Evaluation and treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^407cb1b1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone deficiency — cardiovascular surrogate outcomes with GH therapy: We suggest that GH therapy of GH-deficient adults improves several cardiovascular surrogate outcomes, including endothelial function, inflammatory cardiovascular biomarkers, lipoprotein metabolism, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), and aspects of myocardial function, but tends to increase insulin resistance. Evidence indicates that GH replacement has resulted in a slight decrease in blood pressure in large trials, reduces C-reactive protein, and in a placebo-controlled trial decreased apolipoprotein B and C-reactive protein significantly in 55 adults treated for 9 months; GH replacement has also been shown to increase flow-mediated dilatation, reduce arterial stiffness, and improve vascular endothelial function.

### The association of hysterectomy with or without ovarian conservation with subclinical atherosclerosis progression in healthy postmenopausal women [^143517d5]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

While the deleterious associations of surgical menopause after bilateral oophorectomy with cardiovascular disease are documented, less is specifically known concerning subclinical atherosclerosis progression.

Methods

We used data from 590 healthy postmenopausal women randomized to hormone therapy or placebo in the Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE), which was conducted from July 2005 to February 2013. Subclinical atherosclerosis progression was measured as annual rate of change in carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) over a median 4.8 years. Mixed-effects linear models assessed the association of hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy compared with natural menopause with CIMT progression adjusted for age and treatment assignment. We also tested modifying associations by age at or years since oophorectomy or hysterectomy.

Results

Among 590 postmenopausal women, 79 (13.4%) underwent hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy and 35 (5.9%) underwent hysterectomy with ovarian conservation, a median of 14.3 years before trial randomization. Compared with natural menopause, women who underwent hysterectomy with and without bilateral oophorectomy had higher fasting plasma triglycerides while women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy had lower plasma testosterone. The CIMT progression rate in bilaterally oophorectomized women was 2.2 μm/y greater than natural menopause (P = 0.08); specifically, compared with natural menopause, the associations were significantly greater in postmenopausal women who were older than 50 years at the time of bilateral oophorectomy (P = 0.014) and in postmenopausal women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy more than 15 years before randomization (P = 0.015). Moreover, the CIMT progression rate in hysterectomized women with ovarian conservation was 4.6 μm/y greater than natural menopause (P = 0.015); in particular, compared with natural menopause, the association was significantly greater in postmenopausal women who underwent hysterectomy with ovarian conservation more than 15 years before randomization (P = 0.018).

Conclusions

Hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy and ovarian conservation were associated with greater subclinical atherosclerosis progression relative to natural menopause. The associations were stronger for later age and longer time since oophorectomy/hysterectomy. Further research should continue to examine long-term atherosclerosis outcomes related to oophorectomy/hysterectomy.

### Low plasma testosterone and elevated carotid intima-media thickness: importance of low-grade inflammation in elderly men [^1a2aedc2]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

Context and Objective

An inverse correlation between plasma testosterone levels and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) has been reported in men. We investigated whether this association could be mediated or modified by traditional cardiovascular risk factors as well as inflammatory status.

Methods

In the Three-City population-based cohort study, 354 men aged 65 and over had available baseline data on hormones levels and carotid ultrasonography. Plasma concentrations of testosterone (total and bioavailable), estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), together with cardiovascular risk factors were measured. IMT in plaque-free site and atherosclerotic plaques in the extracranial carotid arteries were determined using a standardized protocol. Multiple linear regression models were used to analyze this association and interaction study.

Results

Analyses with and without adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors showed that carotid IMT was inversely and significantly correlated with total and bioavailable testosterone levels but not with SHBG and estradiol levels. This association depended on C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p for interaction < 0.05). Among men with low-grade inflammation (CRP ≥ 2 mg/L), mean IMT was higher in subjects with bioavailable testosterone ≤ 3.2 ng/mL than in those with bioavailable testosterone > 3.2 ng/mL (0.76 mm and 0.70 mm respectively, p < 0.01). By contrast, among men with CRP ≤ 2 mg/L, mean IMT was similar in both groups (0.72 mm and 0.71 mm respectively, p = 0.77). Similar results were found for total testosterone although not significant. No association was found between plasma hormones levels and atherosclerotic plaques.

Conclusion

In elderly men, low plasma testosterone is associated with elevated carotid intima-media thickness only in those with low-grade inflammation. Traditional risk factors have no mediator role.

### Low testosterone levels are associated with carotid atherosclerosis in men [^1c6fce35]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the relationship between endogenous sex hormone levels and intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery measured by ultrasonography.

Design

Population-based cross-sectional study.

Methods

Sex hormone levels measured by immunoassay, anthropometric measurements and IMT was studied in 1482 men aged 25–84 years participating in the 1994–1995 Tromsø study. The data were analysed with partial correlation, multiple linear regression and logistic regression analysis.

Results

Linear regression models showed that total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin levels, but not calculated free testosterone, serum oestradiol or dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels were inversely associated with the age-adjusted IMT (P = 0.008 and P < 0.001 respectively). These associations were independent of smoking, physical activity, blood pressure and lipid levels, but were not independent of body mass index (BMI). Excluding men with cardiovascular disease (CVD) did not materially change these results. In a logistic regression model adjusted for the confounding effect of CVD risk factors, men with testosterone levels in the lowest quintile (< 9.0 nmol L(-1)) had an independent OR = 1.51 (P = 0.015) of being in the highest IMT quintile.

Conclusions

We found an inverse association between total testosterone levels and IMT of the carotid artery in men that was present also after excluding men with CVD, but was not independent of BMI. The clinical relevance of this, however, is uncertain and needs to be investigated in a clinical setting.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^47cd596c]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) thrombosis and cardiovascular risk counseling directs that patients should be informed that there is no definitive evidence linking testosterone therapy to a higher incidence of venothrombolic events (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C), and prior to initiating treatment, clinicians should counsel patients that, at this time, it cannot be stated definitively whether testosterone therapy increases or decreases the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular-related death, or all-cause mortality (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B).

### Illicit anabolic steroid use and cardiovascular status in men and women [^b9be07ea]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Biochemistry

Plasma hematocrit as well as creatinine and high-density lipoprotein levels differed among the groups, whereas neither low-density lipoprotein, glycated hemoglobin, average glucose, nor triglyceride levels differed. The metabolic findings were mostly consistent across sexes (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). When compared with their sex-matched groups of previous AAS users and nonusers, men currently using AAS had significantly lower levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) but higher testosterone levels, whereas women currently using AAS had similar levels of FSH, LH, and testosterone but lower levels of SHBG (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

Atherosclerosis

Of the 18 men who previously used AAS, 1 (5.6%) reported a non–ST elevation myocardial infarction requiring stenting. No other participants had any history of atherosclerosis. No group differences were found for femoral (active users, 15 of 76 [19.7%]; previous users, 5 of 26 [19.2%]; nonusers, 11 of 53 [20.8%]; P = 0.89) or carotid (active users, 24 of 77 [31.2%]; previous users, 12 of 26 [46.2%]; nonusers, 13 of 54 [24.1%]; P = 0.47) artery plaques or CAC scores (median of 0 across all groups, with a range of 0–228 for active users [n = 80]; 0–800 for previous users [n = 26], and 0–163 for nonusers [n = 58]; P = 0.36) (Table 2), whereas a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of coronary NCPs was found between active users (19 of 80 [23.8%]) and nonusers (6 of 58 [10.3%]) (P = 0.03).

### Androgen deprivation therapy reversibly increases endothelium-dependent vasodilation in men with prostate cancer [^4665c8dd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

ADT increased insulin resistance, altered the lipid profile, and increased conduit artery flow‐mediated vasodilation in men studied before and after 3 months of therapy. The effect of ADT on laboratory and vascular parameters resolved 6 months after ADT discontinuation. These results suggest that the biology of androgen deficiency, both endogenous and induced, remains unclear and requires further study to elucidate the mechanism of interaction between sex hormones and the vasculature.

### Testosterone and the cardiovascular system: a comprehensive review of the clinical literature [^3006156d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Existing evidence seems to suggest that the most commonly encountered adverse event associated with testosterone replacement therapy is an increase in hematocrit, which is considered a known physiologic function of testosterone. – The clinical implications of increased hematocrit secondary to testosterone replacement therapy remain to be fully investigated. If a transdermal preparation of testosterone is used, a skin reaction at the site of testosterone application is common. The clinical implications of this finding remain unknown at this time. Data from 3 meta‐analyses seem to contradict the commonly held belief that testosterone administration may increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. One meta‐analysis reported an increase in all prostate‐related adverse events with testosterone administration. However, when each prostate‐related event, including prostate cancer and a rise in PSA, was analyzed separately, no differences were observed between the testosterone group and the placebo group. Finally, the existing data from the 3 meta‐analyses seem to indicate that testosterone replacement therapy does not increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.– Evidence to the contrary has been reported by Basaria et al, however. The 3 major factors that should be noted when interpreting the results of Basaria et al were thoroughly discussed above. Most recently, Vigen et al reported a higher rate of adverse cardiovascular events with testosterone replacement therapy in a retrospective cohort study of male veterans with hypogonadism who underwent coronary angiography. Vigen et al showed a 5.8% absolute risk increase for the composite of all‐cause mortality, MI and ischemic stroke in male veterans who were treated with exogenous testosterone. Although these results are statistically significant, the authors correctly point out the weaknesses of their study which include retrospective study design and lack of randomization, small sample size at extremes of follow‐up, lack of outcome validation by chart review and poor generalizability of the results given that only male veterans with CAD were included in this study. The controversy over the safety of testosterone replacement therapy will require large, prospective, randomized, placebo‐controlled trials in which cardiovascular events are the primary outcomes. Results from the Effects of Testosterone Replacement on Atherosclerosis Progressions in Older Men with Low Testosterone Levels (TEAAM) study are eagerly awaited to clarify any possible long‐term adverse consequences from testosterone replacement therapy. The Effects of Testosterone Replacement on Atherosclerosis Progressions in Older Men with Low Testosterone Levels study will be a new trial assessing the effects of exogenous testosterone on adverse events related to atherosclerosis in elderly men. Until the results of such large‐scale studies become available, we recommend caution when administering testosterone to elderly men.

### Circulating estradiol is an independent predictor of progression of carotid artery intima-media thickness in middle-aged men [^13a793e6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Estrogen treatment of men with prostate cancer is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, the role of endogenous estrogen levels for atherosclerotic disease in men is unknown.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine whether endogenous serum estradiol (E2) levels predict the progression of carotid artery intima-media thickness in men.

Design, Setting and Participants

This was a population-based, prospective cohort study (the Atherosclerosis and Insulin Resistance study) conducted in Göteborg, Sweden, among 313 Caucasian men without cardiovascular or other clinically overt diseases. Carotid artery intima-media thickness, an index of preclinical atherosclerosis, was measured by ultrasound at baseline (58 yr of age) and after 3 yr of follow-up. Serum sex hormone levels and cardiovascular risk factors (body mass index, waist to hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, serum triglycerides, plasma c-peptide, and smoking status) were assessed at study entry.

Intervention

There was no intervention.

Main Outcome Measures

Association between baseline total and free E2 levels and progression of carotid intima-media thickness over 3 yr with adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors was measured.

Results

In univariate analyses, both total and free E2 levels at baseline were positively associated with the annual change in intima-media thickness. In linear regression models including E2 and cardiovascular risk factors, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and E2 were identified as independent predictors of progression of carotid artery intima-media thickness (total E2 beta = 0.187, P = 0.001; and free E2 beta = 0.183, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Circulating E2 is a predictor of progression of carotid artery intima-media thickness in middle-aged men. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of endogenous E2 for incident cardiovascular disease events.

### Changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness 3 years after cessation of menopausal hormone therapy: follow-up from the kronos early estrogen prevention study [^0fb38a7f]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary analysis for the comparison of serial CIMT measurements across treatment groups was based on two-stage analysis, in which repeated measures on the same patient were reduced to a single measure of linear trend. This analysis was performed by regressing CIMT values against measurement times in each individual person and using each person's predicted response at the last time point. These predicted values were then compared across treatment groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that adjusted for baseline-measured CIMT. Estimated absolute increase in CIMT over time was computed as the difference between the predicted response and baseline measurement; annual increase in CIMT was calculated as the absolute increase divided by total number of years. For comparison, a sensitivity analysis was performed with use of generalized linear modeling to include all repeated measurements of CIMT, with the correlation pattern over time within person taken into account using a continuous autoregressive correlation structure. The model included the raw follow-up measurements of CIMT as the responses, and baseline CIMT, treatment group, study time (as a linear continuous variable), and the interaction between treatment group and time as independent variables. Difference of treatments from this sensitivity analysis, as indicated by the group by time interaction, was checked for consistency with findings of the primary two-stage analysis. In both analyses, separate models were fitted for each of the three intervals of interest, with linear contrasts constructed to estimate the mean within-person change in CIMT at 4 and 7 years, as well as the baseline-adjusted difference in changes at these times between treatment groups. We also examined the adequacy of a 2-slope repeated measures model that could delineate on- and post-treatment trends and facilitate testing of treatment contrasts at both time points in one unified analysis.

### Testosterone replacement therapy and cardiovascular disease [^c263d6a9]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of testosterone therapy has a complex history of apprehension and questions regarding its safety. Despite an eventual consensus that testosterone therapy was safe and effective, several studies relating to cardiovascular risks emerged in the last decade, rekindling skepticism regarding the safety of testosterone therapy. Given the utility of testosterone therapy in treating the symptoms of hypogonadism, it remains crucial to closely examine the safety of testosterone therapy. The present article synthesizes the current evidence regarding cardiovascular risks that may be associated with testosterone therapy, the potential mechanisms regarding testosterone's efficacy, and future directions in evaluating the safety of its use.

### Atherosclerosis imaging methods: assessing cardiovascular disease and evaluating the role of estrogen in the prevention of atherosclerosis [^5645b5af]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Various interventions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) slow or reverse the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of clinical coronary events. Although the cardiovascular benefits of hormone replacement therapy have been demonstrated in observational studies in predominantly healthy women, no benefit has been found in a randomized clinical trial conducted in older women with established CVD. It is possible that the benefit of hormone therapy occurs when it is used relatively early in the progression of atherosclerosis. Techniques are now available to monitor the various stages of atherosclerosis. Quantitative coronary angiography, a technique used to evaluate relatively late-stage atherosclerosis, has been shown to predict the risk of subsequent clinical coronary events. B-mode ultrasonography of the intima-media wall thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery can assess the earlier stages of atherosclerosis and correlates with atherosclerosis risk factors, as well as with clinical cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcome. This technique offers a relatively rapid and cost-effective method to test therapies for CVD and to screen for individuals who are at high risk for cardiovascular events. As an example of the use of atherosclerosis imaging to evaluate possible therapeutic interventions, measurements of IMT were performed in a randomized, controlled trial comparing oral 17beta-estradiol with placebo. The results demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol significantly reduces the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in healthy, postmenopausal women when compared with placebo.

### Androgens, insulin resistance and vascular disease in men [^8ff614df]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing globally and is an established risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Insulin resistance is the hallmark feature of type 2 diabetes and is also an important component of the metabolic syndrome. There is evidence to suggest that testosterone is an important regulator of insulin sensitivity in men. Observational studies have shown that testosterone levels are low in men with diabetes, visceral obesity (which is strongly associated with insulin resistance), coronary artery disease and metabolic syndrome. Short-term interventional studies have also demonstrated that testosterone replacement therapy produces an improvement in insulin sensitivity in men. Thus hypotestosteronaemia may have a role in the pathogenesis of insulin-resistant states and androgen replacement therapy could be a potential treatment that could be offered for improvements in glycaemic control and reduction in cardiovascular risk, particularly in diabetic men.

### Prospective association of serum androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin with subclinical cardiovascular disease in young adult women: the "Coronary artery risk development in young adults" women's study [^6159743f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

The role of endogenous androgens and SHBG in the development of cardiovascular disease in young adult women is unclear.

Objective

Our objective was to study the prospective association of serum androgens and SHBG with subclinical coronary and carotid disease among young to middle-aged women.

Design and Setting

This was an ancillary study to the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a population-based multicenter cohort study with 20 yr of follow-up.

Participants

Participants included 1629 women with measurements of serum testosterone and SHBG from yr 2, 10, or 16 and subclinical disease assessment at yr 20 (ages 37–52 yr).

Main Outcome Measures

Coronary artery calcified plaques (CAC) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) were assessed at yr 20. The IMT measure incorporated the common carotid arteries, bifurcations, and internal carotid arteries.

Results

SHBG (mean of yr 2, 10, and 16) was inversely associated with the presence of CAC (multivariable adjusted odds ratio for women with SHBG levels above the median = 0.59; 95% confidence interval = 0.40–0.87; P = 0.008). SHBG was also inversely associated with the highest quartile of carotid-IMT (odds ratio for women with SHBG levels in the highest quartile = 0.56; 95% confidence interval = 0.37–0.84; P for linear trend across quartiles = 0.005). No associations were observed for total or free testosterone with either CAC or IMT.

Conclusion

SHBG levels were inversely associated with subclinical cardiovascular disease in young to middle-aged women. The extent to which low SHBG is a risk marker or has its own independent effects on atherosclerosis is yet to be determined.

### Effects of long-term and reduced-dose hormone replacement therapy on endothelial function and intima-media thickness in postmenopausal women [^cef5ddb3]. Menopause (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Short-term estrogen therapy improves endothelial function in postmenopausal women. However, there are few reports on its long-term effects on endothelial function and carotid intima-media thickness. Further, we determined whether a reduced dosage of estrogen may maintain its beneficial effects.

Design

Eighteen postmenopausal women (53.7 ± 1.1 years) who had been diagnosed as having osteoporosis were enrolled. Among them, 11 women were prescribed oral conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg and medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg per day, and 7 women were prescribed an oral calcium supplement as the control group. Each patient decided whether she would take hormone replacement therapy or a calcium supplement. We performed ultrasound measurement of endothelial function of the brachial artery and carotid intima-media thickness. Examinations were scheduled to be performed pre-therapy and after 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of therapy.

Results

After three years of therapy, 6 women in the hormone replacement therapy group agreed to take half the dose of oral conjugated estrogen. Improvement of flow-mediated dilatation was observed at 3 months and the improvement was preserved up to 36 months. A similar improvement was also observed while women were on hormone replacement therapy even at the reduced dosage. Intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery in the control group increased after 12 months, which was not observed in the hormone replacement therapy group.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that even at half the dose of estrogen, hormone replacement therapy may improve endothelial function and prevent the progression of carotid intima-media thickening in postmenopausal women.

### Compromised endothelial function in transgender men taking testosterone [^f7139daa]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Transgender men (TGM) are persons assigned female gender at birth with a male gender identity and are routinely treated with testosterone. Androgen excess is associated with endothelial dysfunction among cisgender females (CGF) and is an early sign of atherosclerosis and hypertension.

Objective

To determine the effect of testosterone treatment on endothelial function in TGM.

Setting

The John B. Pierce Laboratory and Yale School of Medicine.

Subjects

Eleven TGM (age 27 ± 5 years; BMI 24.4 ± 3.7 kg/m 2) receiving testosterone (T) and 20 CGF (28 ± 5 years; BMI 26.0 ± 5.1 kg/m 2) during the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle.

Design and Outcome Measures

We evaluated brachial vasodilatory responses following stimuli designed to elicit shear stress using 5-minute occlusion to determine endothelial function (flow-mediated vasodilation, FMD).

Results

Total T was greater in the TGM compared to CGF (484.6 ± 122.5 vs 1.5 ± 0.7 ng/dL), as was free T (83.9 ± 32.4 vs 1.9 ± 0.8 pg/dL). FMD was markedly lower in the TGM (4.5 ± 2.7%) compared to the CGF (8.1 ± 2.9%, P = 0.002) indicating significantly diminished endothelial function in TGM.

Conclusions

We have shown for the first time that in TGM the androgen-dominant hormonal milieu was associated with impaired endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction precedes clinically detectable atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries, so is an important marker for clinical cardiovascular risk. Therefore, attention to cardiovascular risk factors should be integral to the care of transgender men.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^420ea6b2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — testosterone therapy for men with age-related low testosterone and sexual dysfunction — ACP suggests that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment and include potential benefits, harms, costs, and patient preferences; ACP suggests that clinicians should reevaluate symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter and clinicians should discontinue treatment if there is no improvement in sexual function; ACP suggests that clinicians consider intramuscular rather than transdermal formulation because costs are considerably lower and clinical effectiveness and harms are similar. Evidence shows that men with a testosterone threshold ≤ 10.4 nmol/L [300 ng/dL] may show small improvements in sexual functioning on AMS, International Index of Erectile Function (erectile dysfunction domain), or IIEF-5, but evidence shows little to no improvement in physical function, depressive symptoms, energy and vitality, or cognition; the FDA requires labeling of testosterone products to include a warning about a possible increased risk for heart attacks and strokes; most studies followed patients for 12 months or less, so longer-term benefits and harms are unknown, and without symptom improvement treatment would incur additional cost with no clear benefit; evidence shows variability in patient values and preferences and does not support use in all patients without informed decision making.

### Adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in men during testosterone treatment: an individual patient and aggregate data meta-analysis [^cc874df5]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2022). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Testosterone is the standard treatment for male hypogonadism, but there is uncertainty about its cardiovascular safety due to inconsistent findings. We aimed to provide the most extensive individual participant dataset (IPD) of testosterone trials available, to analyse subtypes of all cardiovascular events observed during treatment, and to investigate the effect of incorporating data from trials that did not provide IPD.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials including IPD. We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, Embase, Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Review of Effects for literature from 1992 onwards (date of search, Aug 27, 2018). The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) men aged 18 years and older with a screening testosterone concentration of 12 nmol/L (350 ng/dL) or less; (2) the intervention of interest was treatment with any testosterone formulation, dose frequency, and route of administration, for a minimum duration of 3 months; (3) a comparator of placebo treatment; and (4) studies assessing the pre-specified primary or secondary outcomes of interest. Details of study design, interventions, participants, and outcome measures were extracted from published articles and anonymised IPD was requested from investigators of all identified trials. Primary outcomes were mortality, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular events at any time during follow-up. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We did a one-stage meta-analysis using IPD, and a two-stage meta-analysis integrating IPD with data from studies not providing IPD. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018111005.

Findings

9871 citations were identified through database searches and after exclusion of duplicates and of irrelevant citations, 225 study reports were retrieved for full-text screening. 116 studies were subsequently excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria in terms of study design and characteristics of intervention, and 35 primary studies (5601 participants, mean age 65 years, [SD 11]) reported in 109 peer-reviewed publications were deemed suitable for inclusion. Of these, 17 studies (49%) provided IPD (3431 participants, mean duration 9·5 months) from nine different countries while 18 did not provide IPD data. Risk of bias was judged to be low in most IPD studies (71%). Fewer deaths occurred with testosterone treatment (six [0·4%] of 1621) than placebo (12 [0·8%] of 1537) without significant differences between groups (odds ratio [OR] 0·46 [95% CI 0·17–1·24]; p = 0·13). Cardiovascular risk was similar during testosterone treatment (120 [7·5%] of 1601 events) and placebo treatment (110 [7·2%] of 1519 events; OR 1·07 [95% CI 0·81–1·42]; p = 0·62). Frequently occurring cardiovascular events included arrhythmia (52 of 166 vs 47 of 176), coronary heart disease (33 of 166 vs 33 of 176), heart failure (22 of 166 vs 28 of 176), and myocardial infarction (10 of 166 vs 16 of 176). Overall, patient age (interaction 0·97 [99% CI 0·92–1·03]; p = 0·17), baseline testosterone (interaction 0·97 [0·82–1·15]; p = 0·69), smoking status (interaction 1·68 [0·41–6·88]; p = 0.35), or diabetes status (interaction 2·08 [0·89–4·82; p = 0·025) were not associated with cardiovascular risk.

Interpretation

We found no evidence that testosterone increased short-term to medium-term cardiovascular risks in men with hypogonadism, but there is a paucity of data evaluating its long-term safety. Long-term data are needed to fully evaluate the safety of testosterone.

### Effect of exogenous melatonin on vascular reactivity and nitric oxide in postmenopausal women: role of hormone replacement therapy [^1f131980]. Clinical Endocrinology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Several effects of melatonin are modulated by gonadal steroids and are reduced in ageing women. Administration of melatonin reduces internal carotid artery pulsatility index (PI), and blood pressure in young individuals. Whether these effects are conserved in postmenopausal women and are influenced by hormone replacement therapy (HRT), was herein investigated.

Design

Randomised, double-blind placebo controlled study.

Patients

Twenty-three postmenopausal women of which 11 were unreplaced with HRT and 12 on the oestrogenic phase of continuous transdermal estradiol (50 microg/day) plus cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (5 mg/day x 12 days every 28 days).

Measurements

Internal carotid PI, by colour Doppler, and supine blood pressure were evaluated 90, 180 and 240 minutes following the oral administration of melatonin (1 mg) or placebo. Levels of nitrites/nitrates (NOx), the stable derivatives of nitric oxide, were also evaluated in samples collected 90 minutes following the administration of placebo or melatonin.

Results

In women not on replacement therapy melatonin was ineffective. In HRT-treated women, melatonin reduced internal carotid artery PI (P = 0.005). The effect was maximal within 90 minutes, and maintained for at least 240 minutes, with melatonin levels in the nocturnal physiological range. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced of 8 mmHg (P = 0.038) and 4 mmHg (P = 0.045), respectively, while NOx levels were significantly increased (P = 0.024).

Conclusions

The circulatory response to melatonin is conserved in postmenopausal women with but not without hormone replacement therapy. Maintenance of the cardiovascular response to melatonin, may be implicated in the reduced cardiovascular risk of postmenopausal women with hormone replacement therapy.

### Evidence that parenteral testosterone therapy may improve endothelium-dependent and-independent vasodilation in postmenopausal women already receiving estrogen [^e9c0e1e2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

The gender difference in cardiovascular disease has been partly attributed to higher androgenic hormone levels. Although testosterone in women may not affect lipids, it remains unknown whether it negates favorable estrogenic effects on endothelial function. We have investigated the effects of testosterone implant therapy on arterial reactivity encompassing endothelial-dependent and -independent vasodilation in women using hormone replacement therapy (HRT). B-mode ultrasound measurements of resting brachial artery diameter, following reactive hyperemia [endothelium-dependent flow- mediated dilation (FMD)] and following glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) (endothelium-independent dilation), were recorded in 33 postmenopausal women stabilized on HRT (> 6 months), at baseline, and 6 weeks after a testosterone implant (50 mg), with 15 postmenopausal nonusers of HRT serving as controls. In the brachial artery, baseline resting diameter was similar (0.40 ± 0.01 vs. 0.41 ± 0.01 cm, P = 0.5). In the treated group, testosterone levels increased (0.99 ± 0.08 to 4.99 ± 0.3 nmol/L, P < 0.001), associated with a mean 42% increase in FMD (6.4% ± 0.7 to 9.1% ± 1.1, P = 0.03). The control group did not change (8.1% ± 1.4 to 5.6% ± 1.0, P = 0.4). ANOVA of repeated measures (P = 0.04) and mean change (P = 0.02) in FMD both demonstrated significantly greater improvement with testosterone compared with controls. GTN induced vasodilation increased with testosterone treatment (14.9% ± 0.9 to 17.8% ± 1.2, P = 0.03). Our preliminary data indicate that parenteral testosterone therapy improves both endothelial-dependent (flow-mediated) and endothelium-independent (GTN-mediated) brachial artery vasodilation in postmenopausal women using long-term estrogen therapy. The mechanisms underlying these potentially beneficial cardiovascular effects require further investigation.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^03766eb8]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — testosterone therapy in patients with recent cardiovascular events — states that testosterone therapy should not be commenced for a period of three to six months in patients with a history of cardiovascular events (Expert Opinion). The panel adds that testosterone therapy, with close monitoring, may be considered after a three to six month waiting period, and clinicians should counsel patients on the association between exogenous testosterone and the increased risk of cardiovascular events. Supporting context notes that studies excluded men with a cardiovascular event within the preceding three to six months and that participants were excluded if they had a myocardial infarction or a cerebrovascular accident in the previous 3 months or had a systolic blood pressure > 160 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure > 100 mm Hg.

### Vitamin D in pituitary driven osteopathies [^fbe33c04]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

GHD patients may also have, as patients with acromegaly, significant cardiac comorbidities. Impact of VD on cardiovascular risk in GHD was explored by Savanelli et al. This study involved 41 hypopituitary patients with GHD and 41 controls. Hypovitaminosis D seemed the most powerful predictor of the prevalence of dyslipidemia and hypertension. Also the role of VD in the relationship between carotid artery intima-media thickness and IGF-I levels has been hypothesized in another study.

Vitamin D in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism

Male HH is a condition characterized by a decrease in serum testosterone levels due to a reduction in gonadotropin levels originating from the pituitary gland. Central hypogonadism constitutes a possible cause of secondary osteoporosis, which often requires, over sex hormone replacement therapy, the use of bone active drugs, adequate calcium intake and VD supplementation. The simultaneous presence of secondary hypogonadism and hypovitaminosis D may contribute to increase the risk of skeletal fragility.

Interconnections between hormones of the hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular (HPT) axis and VD levels were demonstrated. Since the discovery of the expression of VD receptor and VD enzymes in human testis, ejaculatory tract and mature spermatozoa, a potential VD role in spermatogenesis has also been suggested. The presence of the enzymes CYP2R1, CYP27A1 and CYP27B1 in Leydig cells suggested that VD may also be connected to male reproductive hormone secretion. The VDR and 1a-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) are also expressed anterior pituitary and hypothalamus, as well as in the testicle. Data from the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS) suggested a link between 25(OH)D deficit and biochemical HH. Also, Wehr et al. observed a positive correlation between testosterone and 25(OH)D levels, suggesting that serum VD may impact directly on gonadal function. Another retrospective study reported a high frequency of VD deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) in patients with hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, respectively 79% and 85%.

Very few studies have been performed on VD assessment in HH. A study investigated the metabolic effects of androgen therapy, detecting an increased availability on circulating levels of 1,25(OH)D in parallel with the increase in testosterone levels. However, this study had the major limitation of the small cohort of 13 subjects with very limited statistical power.

### The aging male: testosterone deficiency and testosterone replacement. An up-date [^f9e47afa]. Atherosclerosis (2004). Low credibility.

The significance of the age-related decline of androgens remains unclear in terms of cardiovascular risk, mood and cognition, and prostatic health. Although much research has been undertaken in this area and men's health has received still more attention in the latest years, there are no data based on randomized controlled clinical studies in aging men investigating the long-term effects of androgen replacement therapy on various aspects of the cardiovascular system, the immune system, body composition, and the brain. In men receiving long-term androgen replacement therapy, the safety aspects regarding the prostate are also an area of clinical importance. In this paper we present an up-dated review of the experimental and clinical evidence of androgen deficiency and androgen replacement therapy on carbohydrate metabolism, on coagulation and fibrinolysis, inflammatory effects, effects on lipoprotein metabolism, direct arterial effects, effects on body composition, effects on cognitive function and mood, and prostatic effects. The evidence clearly shows that data for the most part are conflicting, with only very few randomized studies available.

### Endogenous sex hormones and progression of carotid atherosclerosis in elderly men [^0204d2e6]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The burden of atherosclerosis especially afflicts the increasing older segment of the population. Recent evidence has emphasized a protective role of endogenous sex hormones in the development of atherosclerosis in aging men.

Methods and Results

We studied the association between endogenous sex hormones and progression of atherosclerosis in 195 independently living elderly men. Participants underwent measurements of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) at baseline in 1996 and again in 2000. At baseline, serum concentrations of testosterone (total and free) and estradiol (total and free E2) were measured. Serum free testosterone concentrations were inversely related to the mean progression of IMT of the common carotid artery after adjustment for age (beta = -3.57; 95% CI, -6.34 to -0.80). Higher serum total and free E2 levels were related to progression of IMT of the common carotid artery after adjustment for age (beta = 0.38; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.86; and beta = 0.018; 95% CI, -0.002 to 0.038, respectively). These associations were independent of body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, presence of hypertension and diabetes, smoking, and serum cholesterol levels

Conclusions

Low free testosterone levels were related to IMT of the common carotid artery in elderly men independently of cardiovascular risk factors.

### Adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in men during testosterone treatment: an individual patient and aggregate data meta-analysis [^cb6af744]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2022). High credibility.

Background

Testosterone is the standard treatment for male hypogonadism, but there is uncertainty about its cardiovascular safety due to inconsistent findings. We aimed to provide the most extensive individual participant dataset (IPD) of testosterone trials available, to analyse subtypes of all cardiovascular events observed during treatment, and to investigate the effect of incorporating data from trials that did not provide IPD.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials including IPD. We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, Embase, Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Review of Effects for literature from 1992 onwards (date of search, Aug 27, 2018). The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) men aged 18 years and older with a screening testosterone concentration of 12 nmol/L (350 ng/dL) or less; (2) the intervention of interest was treatment with any testosterone formulation, dose frequency, and route of administration, for a minimum duration of 3 months; (3) a comparator of placebo treatment; and (4) studies assessing the pre-specified primary or secondary outcomes of interest. Details of study design, interventions, participants, and outcome measures were extracted from published articles and anonymised IPD was requested from investigators of all identified trials. Primary outcomes were mortality, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular events at any time during follow-up. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We did a one-stage meta-analysis using IPD, and a two-stage meta-analysis integrating IPD with data from studies not providing IPD. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018111005.

Findings

9871 citations were identified through database searches and after exclusion of duplicates and of irrelevant citations, 225 study reports were retrieved for full-text screening. 116 studies were subsequently excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria in terms of study design and characteristics of intervention, and 35 primary studies (5601 participants, mean age 65 years, [SD 11]) reported in 109 peer-reviewed publications were deemed suitable for inclusion. Of these, 17 studies (49%) provided IPD (3431 participants, mean duration 9·5 months) from nine different countries while 18 did not provide IPD data. Risk of bias was judged to be low in most IPD studies (71%). Fewer deaths occurred with testosterone treatment (six [0·4%] of 1621) than placebo (12 [0·8%] of 1537) without significant differences between groups (odds ratio [OR] 0·46 [95% CI 0·17–1·24]; p = 0·13). Cardiovascular risk was similar during testosterone treatment (120 [7·5%] of 1601 events) and placebo treatment (110 [7·2%] of 1519 events; OR 1·07 [95% CI 0·81–1·42]; p = 0·62). Frequently occurring cardiovascular events included arrhythmia (52 of 166 vs 47 of 176), coronary heart disease (33 of 166 vs 33 of 176), heart failure (22 of 166 vs 28 of 176), and myocardial infarction (10 of 166 vs 16 of 176). Overall, patient age (interaction 0·97 [99% CI 0·92–1·03]; p = 0·17), baseline testosterone (interaction 0·97 [0·82–1·15]; p = 0·69), smoking status (interaction 1·68 [0·41–6·88]; p = 0.35), or diabetes status (interaction 2·08 [0·89–4·82; p = 0·025) were not associated with cardiovascular risk.

Interpretation

We found no evidence that testosterone increased short-term to medium-term cardiovascular risks in men with hypogonadism, but there is a paucity of data evaluating its long-term safety. Long-term data are needed to fully evaluate the safety of testosterone.

### Testosterone replacement therapy and cardiovascular risk [^65091095]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Testosterone is the main male sex hormone and is essential for the maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics and fertility. Androgen deficiency in young men owing to organic disease of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland or testes has been treated with testosterone replacement for decades without reports of increased cardiovascular events. In the past decade, the number of testosterone prescriptions issued for middle-aged or older men with either age-related or obesity-related decline in serum testosterone levels has increased exponentially even though these conditions are not approved indications for testosterone therapy. Some retrospective studies and randomized trials have suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, which has led the FDA to release a warning statement about the potential cardiovascular risks of testosterone replacement therapy. However, no trials of testosterone replacement therapy published to date were designed or adequately powered to assess cardiovascular events; therefore, the cardiovascular safety of this therapy remains unclear. In this Review, we provide an overview of epidemiological data on the association between serum levels of endogenous testosterone and cardiovascular disease, prescription database studies on the risk of cardiovascular disease in men receiving testosterone therapy, randomized trials and meta-analyses evaluating testosterone replacement therapy and its association with cardiovascular events and mechanistic studies on the effects of testosterone on the cardiovascular system. Our aim is to help clinicians to make informed decisions when considering testosterone replacement therapy in their patients.

### Testosterone concentration in young patients with diabetes [^b8f9f7d4]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

As previously reported, the concentrations of SHBG tended to be low in type 2 diabetic subjects and to be middle to high normal in type 1 diabetic subjects. Despite corrections made to total testosterone concentrations on the basis of SHBG, the concentrations of calculated free testosterone remained markedly lower in type 2 diabetes and relatively high in type 1 diabetes.

These observations have several clinical implications, since low testosterone concentrations may contribute to the impairment of sexual function, diminished libido, and erectile dysfunction. Furthermore, the lack of testosterone during these crucial years may lead to diminished peak bone mass and the lack of development or loss of skeletal muscle. In addition, these patients may develop increased adiposity and, therefore, may become more insulin resistant. Clearly, patients with type 2 diabetes, especially if they are obese, need further focused attention and systematic investigation. This is even more relevant to younger type 2 diabetic patients. Furthermore, patients with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high C-reactive protein concentrations. Thus, they may be at a heightened risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Indeed, low testosterone concentrations in male subjects are known to be associated with enhanced cardiovascular risk in observational studies. A Japanese study has shown that free testosterone (but not total testosterone) concentrations are inversely related to carotid intimal medial thickness in type 2 diabetic patients. Since free testosterone was measure by radioimmunoassay in that study, these findings need to be confirmed by using a more reliable assay.

### Effects of long-term estrogen replacement therapy versus combined hormone replacement therapy on nitric oxide-dependent vasomotor function [^45ef081c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen may increase production of the predominant endothelium-derived vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) and consequently improve vascular reactivity. In contrast, concurrent progestin therapy may oppose this beneficial effect. We studied the effect of long-term estrogen HRT and combined HRT on vasomotor function and on plasma nitrate, which reflects the amount of NO in the circulation. As lipid peroxidation affects NO production and impairs endothelial function, we also measured the amount of the in vivo lipid peroxidation marker urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha). The study group comprised 15 women receiving estradiol valerate HRT (mean age, 56 yr; treatment duration, 10.5 yr) and 15 women receiving combined HRT with estradiol valerate and levonorgestrel (mean age, 58 yr; treatment duration, 11.3 yr). The peak flow velocity (PFV) and pulsatility index of the common carotid and internal carotid artery and the abdominal aorta were measured by ultrasonography after long-term HRT (baseline), after a 4-wk pause and again 3 wk after reintroducing HRT. A statistically significant interaction between the groups and time points was observed in the PFV of the internal carotid artery (P = 0.011). In women taking estradiol valerate, the PFV values decreased significantly after withdrawal of HRT (P = 0.007) and increased again to the baseline level after reintroduction of therapy (P < 0.001). In women receiving combined HRT, the PFV remained stable over all study periods. At baseline, the PFV of women taking estradiol valerate correlated with the plasma nitrate concentration in the common carotid artery (r = 0.646; P = 0.009) and in the abdominal aorta (r = 0.579; P = 0.024). For pulsatility index and urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha) excretion, there were no significant differences between the groups. Our results suggest that the favorable effects of long-term estrogen treatment on blood flow are at least partly mediated through NO. The addition of levonorgestrel to the treatment regimen appears to abolish this effect.

### Association between testosterone replacement therapy and cardiovascular outcomes: a meta-analysis of 30 randomized controlled trials [^8f4b5d03]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The Cardiovascular safety of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) among men with hypogonadism is not well established to date. Hence, we sought to evaluate the cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes among patients receiving testosterone therapy by using all recently published randomized controlled trials.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, EMBASE, and Clinicaltrial.gov for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception until September 30th, 2023.

Results

A total of 30 randomized trials with 11,502 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age was ranging from 61.61 to 61.82 years. Pooled analysis of primary and secondary outcomes showed that the incidence of any CVD events (OR, 1.12 (95%CI: 0.77–1.62), P = 0.55), stroke (OR, 1.01 (95%CI: 0.68–1.51), P = 0.94), myocardial infarction (OR, 1.05 (95%CI: 0.76–1.45), P = 0.77), all-cause mortality (OR, 0.94 (95%CI: 0.76–1.17), P = 0.57), and CVD mortality (OR, 0.87 (95%CI: 0.65–1.15), P = 0.31) was comparable between TRT and placebo groups.

Conclusion

Our analysis indicates that for patients with hypogonadism, testosterone replacement therapy does not increase the CVD risk and all-cause mortality.

### Could androgens be relevant to partly explain why men have lower life expectancy than women? [^9a96bffd]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease

Men have higher cardiovascular disease mortality rates than women, particularly at the period in life, early adulthood, when male hormones are highest. However, haemorrhagic stroke mortality rates differ little by sex, suggesting that the relevant causative factor underlying men's cardiovascular disadvantage is specific to processes that drive non-haemorrhagic forms of cardiovascular disease, such as ischaemia, thrombosis, embolism and aneurysm. Notably, androgens may raise clotting factors, such as thromboxane.

Currently, at the same level of the major risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, specifically, age, smoking, low-density lipoprotien (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes, validated risk prediction models give substantially higher absolute risk for men than for women. Although menopause precedes an increase in ischaemic heart disease rates for women, RCTs have shown that oestrogen does not protect against cardiovascular disease in either menor women. Recent promotion of highly profitable testosterone to older men as an antidote to ageing has led to warnings about the cardiovascular risk of testosterone from regulators. In June 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a warning about venous blood clots to the testosterone product label. In July 2014, Health Canada warned about "serious and possible life-threatening heart and blood vessel problems such as heart attack, stroke, blood clot in the lungs or legs; and increased or irregular heart rate with the use of testosterone replacement products". The European Medicines Agency was less clear in November 2104, but advised that testosterone should be restricted to men with pathological hypogonadism. In March 2015, the US FDA warned about "the possible increased risk of heart attacks and strokes associated with testosterone use" and required a label change. Sales of testosterone are already falling in the USAand litigation against pharmaceutical companies is underway.

### Changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness 3 years after cessation of menopausal hormone therapy: follow-up from the kronos early estrogen prevention study [^32b0877d]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

As an exploratory analysis to address the question whether the rate of change of CIMT depends on age (or time), we tested for within-person curvilinear change in CIMT over the 7-year study period by refitting each woman's CIMT trajectory using a quadratic function of time. We then computed the proportion of women for whom a quadratic time effect was significant at the α = 0.05 level, and among those, compared the frequency of a positive versus negative coefficient of timeto indicate the tendency of quadratic increases or decreases in CIMT. Under the null hypothesis, we would expect by chance a low number of participants (5%) showing evidence of curvature, and of those equal proportions with positive (accelerating) and negative (decaying) curvature. A formal statistical test was performed using the binomial test, both for the abundance of significant quadratic coefficients, and of the equality between positive and negative coefficients.

To assess the sensitivity of the analysis to selection bias in women who agreed to participate in the present study, we repeated the longitudinal analysis of on-treatment trends using the entire KEEPS population at the Mayo site with available CIMT data. As an additional analysis, comparisons of KEEPS women who did and did not participate in the present study were examined on the basis of baseline and end-of-trial measures that may have influenced the selection of participants. All data analyses were conducted with SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Androgen deprivation therapy reversibly increases endothelium-dependent vasodilation in men with prostate cancer [^b9b45a85]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

In contrast to illness or aging states, therapeutic androgen deprivation is applied to men without underlying cause for androgen deficiency. The effect of androgen deprivation has been evaluated by 2 groups with conflicting results. Herman and colleagues compared endothelium‐dependent vasodilation in men with prostate cancer treated with orchiectomy or androgen blockade for > 6 months, in healthy controls, and in men in remission from nonprostate cancers. The men with prostate cancer had testosterone concentrations of 23 ng/dL compared with 548 ng/dL for healthy controls and 461 ng/dL for men in remission from nonprostate cancers. Brachial artery endothelium‐dependent vasodilation was significantly higher in the men with ADT (6.2%) compared with healthy controls (2.7%) or men in remission from nonprostate cancers (2.0%). In contrast, Gilbert and colleagues studied men with prostate cancer treated with ADT and controls matched for sex, age, and body mass index. Similarly, the ADT‐treated men had significantly lower testosterone levels compared with controls (12 versus 533 ng/dL). In this study, however, brachial artery endothelium‐dependent vasodilation was lower in men with prostate cancer treated with ADT (3.9%) compared with matched controls (5.9%).

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^71afdc69]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Androgens and cardiovascular health — Across observational studies, total T is not associated with an adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) or type 2 diabetes risk profile, whereas low SHBG or higher FAI due to low SHBG carries risk, with associations appearing to be driven more by obesity and low SHBG than T. Similar results were observed in a 9-year follow-up of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, where FAI was directly associated with the development of obesity (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.12–1.68) and SHBG was inversely associated (odds ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45–0.80). In the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) study of 390 women, those in the top quartile of T had more coronary artery disease on angiography and their cumulative 5-year survival was 78.9%, compared with 88.7% for women who were not hyperandrogenic. Additional reports note that endogenous T in postmenopausal women has been positively associated with brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation and that women with a total T level in the lowest quintile had the greatest risk for all-cause mortality and incident CVD over a 4.5-year follow-up period.

### Welcoming low testosterone as a cardiovascular risk factor [^2e56e362]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

Vascular tone and endothelial function

The vascular system is a target of androgen action and current evidence suggests that androgens are beneficial to vasculature. Older studies conducted more than six decades ago showed that testosterone replacement relieved symptoms of angina and peripheral vascular disease. 19 Similarly, population studies have shown that systolic and diastolic blood pressures are inversely correlated with testosterone. 20 Recent animal studies show that acute treatment with testosterone results in dilatation of the coronary and pulmonary arteries. 21 In humans, transdermal testosterone therapy improves exercise-induced myocardial ischemia (measured as time to ST depression) during an exercise stress test in men with stable angina, 22 with men having the lowest baseline testosterone levels benefitting the most. A recent study using oral testosterone in hypogonadal men with coronary artery disease showed increased myocardial perfusion. 23 These vasodilatory effects of testosterone are reflected by the fact that men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy experience arterial stiffness. 24 It is believed that testosterone causes both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation. The former is achieved by an increased release of nitric oxide from endothelium, whereas the latter by blocking of calcium channels and/or opening of potassium channels 25 (Figure 1). Recent studies also suggest a beneficial role for testosterone in endothelial regeneration. 26 Testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men results in an increase in the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells. 27 This increase is androgen receptor mediated (not a result of rise in estrogen levels) as this event is abolished by androgen receptor antagonists. 28

### Testosterone information… [^af6eb2dc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Testosterone is a hormone essential to the development of male growth and masculine characteristics. Testosterone products are FDA-approved __only__ for use in men who lack or have low testosterone levels in conjunction with an associated medical condition. Examples of these conditions include failure of the testicles to produce testosterone because of reasons such as genetic problems or chemotherapy. Other examples include problems with brain structures, called the hypothalamus and pituitary, that control the production of testosterone by the testicles. None of the FDA-approved testosterone products are approved for use in men with low testosterone levels who lack an associated medical condition. FDA-approved testosterone formulations include the topical gel, transdermal patch, buccal system, and injection.

An industry consortium, led by manufacturers of AndroGel and Androderm, conducted an FDA-required postmarketing safety trial titled the Testosterone Replacement Therapy for Assessment of Longterm Vascular Events and Efficacy Response in Hypogonadal Men trial to assess cardiovascular outcomes. The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, assessed in a time to event analysis. Noninferiority required an upper limit of 1. 5 for the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio among patients receiving at least one dose. TRAVERSE demonstrated non-inferiority of AndroGel 1. 62% vs. placebo by excluding a hazard ratio > 1.
5. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular event for subjects receiving AndroGel was
7. 0%; for those receiving placebo it was 7. 3%.

After Agency review, it was determined that the results of TRAVERSE did not demonstrate a new safety signal or trend in adverse cardiovascular outcomes with testosterone use. Related Information

### Testosterone replacement therapy for male hypogonadism [^f746deaa]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Testosterone deficiency, or male hypogonadism, is a clinical syndrome that can be defined as persistently low serum testosterone levels in the setting of symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency. Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. Evidence is conflicting regarding its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large, randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk. After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. Treatment method should take into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.

### Androgen deprivation therapy reversibly increases endothelium-dependent vasodilation in men with prostate cancer [^8abe6b57]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Participants

Men with high‐risk but not metastatic prostate cancer were recruited prior to initiation of ADT. No patient had received prior ADT, and no patient underwent surgery. ADT was to be applied per the treating attending physician. All participants received combined androgen blockade consisting of 50 mg oral bicalutamide daily plus an injection of 22.5 mg leuprolide acetate every 3 months for a minimum of 6 months. All participants underwent screening medical history, physical examination, and laboratory analysis, including serum electrolytes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and total and LDL cholesterol. Men with acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and coronary or peripheral artery intervention within 1 year were excluded. The protocol was approved by the human research committees of the Dana‐Farber Cancer Institute and the Brigham and Women's Hospital. All participants provided informed consent prior to participation.

Protocol

The effect of ADT on endothelium‐dependent and ‐independent vasodilation of the brachial artery was studied using a single‐arm trial of men at baseline and after 3 months of ADT. We chose 3 months because this time point is the earliest an increase in diabetes and coronary heart disease has been reported. All participants were studied in the morning in the postabsorptive state, fasting after the previous midnight. Participants also underwent evaluation of fasting lipids, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and testosterone and estradiol levels at each time period. In addition, participants who received 6 months of ADT were invited to return at 12 months, 6 months after ADT was discontinued, for reevaluation.

### Androgen deprivation therapy reversibly increases endothelium-dependent vasodilation in men with prostate cancer [^609dd077]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Direct effects of androgens on the vascular wall also may be important. In preclinical models, testosterone has been shown to promote vasodilation through a vascular smooth muscle–mediated mechanism. Interestingly, the vasodilatory effect of testosterone is not dependent on activation of androgen receptors. In human subcutaneous resistance arteries obtained from men with androgen deficiency studied ex vivo, testosterone was a concentration‐dependent endothelium‐independent vasodilator at the nonphysiological concentration of ≥ 1 μmol/L. In addition, testosterone therapy attenuated the vasodilatory effect of sodium nitroprusside (a vascular smooth muscle vasodilator) and enhanced the contractile response to norepinephrine (an α agonist). ADT has been associated with increased large artery stiffness and may participate in adverse cardiovascular outcomes through this mechanism. – Others have postulated a role for a testosterone‐mediated change in oxidative stress as a mechanism for the vascular pathophysiology; however, in humans, higher levels of testosterone have been shown to increase and decrease oxidative stress. – Elucidation of the mechanism underlying androgen deprivation and heightened cardiovascular risk in high‐risk men will require further preclinical and patient‐oriented research.

This study did not address all possible atherogenic mechanisms. ADT has been associated with prothrombotic changes including increases in fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and tissue plasminogen activator antigen – that may also explain a reported increase in venous thromboembolism. Platelet counts are unaffected by ADT, but platelet activation has yet to be characterized. In addition, this study did not include a placebo group because withholding ADT from men with prostate cancer and giving it to men without prostate cancer to enable a placebo group are both unethical because of the risks of morbidity and mortality.

### Effects of hormone replacement therapy on inflammation and stiffening of artery walls… [^cebf10d6]. ClinicalTrials (2000). Low credibility.

Effects of Hormone Replacement Therapy on Inflammation and Stiffening of Artery WallsClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This study will determine the effects of hormone replacement therapy on the walls of arteries in postmenopausal women. Inflammation and stiffness of artery walls are two risk factors for atherosclerosis-deposits of fatty substances that can block the vessel, causing a heart attack or stroke. Estrogen raises the levels of certain substances in the blood that cause vessel inflammation and lowers the levels of others. This study will measure the net effects of estrogen on artery wall inflammation and stiffness. Women in both groups will take pills for 3 months, then no pills for 1 month, and then will crossover to the alternate therapy for 3 months.

At the end of each 3-month treatment period, participants will undergo the following procedures to assess blood vessel inflammation and stiffness:

- Blood tests
- 60 cc of blood will be drawn to measure levels of hormones, cholesterol, and substances in the blood that indicate inflammation of the vessels.
- Ultrasonography
- an ultrasound probe will be applied gently on the neck to image the right and left carotid arteries. During the procedure, the heart's electrical activity will also be monitored with an electrocardiogram and a blood pressure cuff will be wrapped around the arm to obtain blood pressure measurements every 5 minutes.
- Magnetic resonance imaging
- Images of the carotid arteries are taken while the volunteer lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field.

A padded sensor called an MRI coil is placed over the neck and earplugs are placed in the ears to muffle the loud noise of the machine during scanning. During the second half of the exam, gadolinium is injected through a catheter inserted into a vein. Gadolinium is a contrast agent that is used to brighten the scan images. No history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. No cigarette smokers. No diabetes mellitus. Triglycerides less than 400 mg/dL. Blood pressure less than 160/90 without antihypertensive therapy. No history of coronary artery disease.

### Androgen deprivation therapy reversibly increases endothelium-dependent vasodilation in men with prostate cancer [^bfe783ca]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Our investigation in a similarly aged population with a similar reduction in testosterone showed an increase in endothelium‐dependent vasodilation in men treated with ADT compared with baseline. These results remained consistent when controlling for the change in baseline arterial diameter. Several possibilities may explain the variance among the studies. The most obvious difference is the duration of ADT. In our participants who received 3 evaluations, ADT was measured at 3 months. Herman and colleagues studied men with a mean ADT duration of 18 months. In contrast, Gilbert and colleagues studied men with a mean treatment duration of 37 months. The application of long‐term ADT suggests a sicker population and metabolic and vascular changes that may not have been manifest at the time we studied the participants. One advantage to our study is its pre–post design that permits the evaluation of the changes in androgen production, lipids, and insulin resistance, which are not captured in a cross‐sectional analysis. The decrease in size in baseline arterial diameter is suggestive of an adaptation to the change in the vascular environment, similar to that found in severely obese patients who lose significant amounts of weight. The change in baseline arterial diameter did not affect our determination because we used an allometric model. As noted by Atkinson and colleagues, "An allometric model involving the flow‐mediated response (on a log scale) as the outcome and Dbase (log‐transformed) as a covariate can completely eradicate the problem of Dbase dependency". Chung and colleagues showed that as the atherosclerotic risk factor profile worsens, resting brachial artery diameter increases. The return to baseline for laboratory and vascular assessments demonstrates the impact of ADT and its potential for reversibility when applied for 6 months. Further human and basic biological study is needed to determine the mechanism underlying these changes.

### Successful diagnosis and monitoring of giant prolactinomas: the role of sample dilutions [^1b9a9b3b]. Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Giant prolactinoma, a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma greater than 4 cm in largest dimension, poses unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, setting it apart from smaller prolactin-secreting tumors.

Methods

A 48-year-old man reported decreased ability to maintain penile erection. His genital examination was normal. Massively elevated prolactin (17164.5 µg/L, confirmed by dilution), low testosterone, and low luteinizing hormone were found. A giant prolactinoma encasing the internal carotid arteries and invading the surrounding bones was found. Carotid flow voids were not narrowed. Formal visual field testing revealed no deficits.

Results

The insulinlike growth factor 1 was normal, and the growth hormone suppressed appropriately 120 minutes after a 75-g oral glucose load. Over 8 months of cabergoline, the prolactin level normalized and the testosterone level increased. Striking regression of the tumor was observed after 1 year of therapy, although prolonged therapy was planned given that the mass was still encasing the carotid arteries. The patient's sexual symptoms improved. All prolactinomas should be treated with dopamine agonists to lower prolactin levels, shrink the tumor, preserve vision (if compromised), and restore gonadal function.

Discussion

This case of giant macroprolactinoma highlights the need for confirming markedly elevated prolactin measurements with dilution of the sample; assessing for concurrent growth hormone excess; and initiating dopamine agonist therapy as a first line, long- term therapy.
