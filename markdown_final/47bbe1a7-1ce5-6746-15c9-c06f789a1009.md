## Question

54 yo F with history of chronic migraines (treated with sumatriptan PRN), obesity, GERD, and known CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizer genotype presents with new-onset diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Her PCP starts her on nortriptyline 25 mg nightly for neuropathic pain. She calls the clinic one week later reporting "strange confusion, rapid heartbeat, and tremor". She also mentions she has recently increased her sumatriptan use to daily for severe migraines. Should nortriptyline be continued, and the dose increased as needed for neuropathic pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nortriptyline should be continued and up-titrated in a 54-year-old woman with diabetic peripheral neuropathy who is a CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer, is using sumatriptan frequently, and is experiencing confusion, tachycardia, and tremor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic implications of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolism on nortriptyline exposure. Then, I should verify the drug–drug interaction risk between nortriptyline and sumatriptan, especially for serotonin syndrome. Next, I will review the patient's symptom constellation and decide whether this fits serotonin toxicity. After that, I need to check guideline-backed alternatives for neuropathic pain that avoid these risks. Finally, I will outline immediate actions, monitoring, and a safer replacement plan with dosing and safety checks, including ECG considerations and fall-risk mitigation in a 54-year-old with obesity and GERD.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacogenomic issue. Nortriptyline is metabolized by CYP2D6 to less active metabolites; ultrarapid metabolizers typically have low parent drug levels and may appear "nonresponsive" at standard doses, which can tempt dose escalation, but that risks accumulating active parent drug and metabolites and worsening adverse effects, particularly anticholinergic and cardiotoxic effects, so I need to be cautious about pushing the dose upward here [^6df8cd24] [^92d897c1].

> Wait, let me verify the drug–drug interaction. Sumatriptan is a serotonergic triptan, and nortriptyline is a tricyclic with serotonergic activity; concomitant use increases the risk of serotonin syndrome, which can present with mental status changes, autonomic instability including tachycardia, and neuromuscular abnormalities such as tremor, matching this patient's symptoms closely, so this constellation is concerning for serotonin toxicity rather than simple TCA adverse effects alone [^5a04e3cb] [^5f46cb6f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the clinical picture. The triad of confusion, tachycardia, and tremor in the setting of a serotonergic TCA plus a triptan is classic for serotonin syndrome, and the FDA labeling for nortriptyline explicitly warns about this risk with triptans and advises discontinuation if serotonin syndrome is suspected, which means I should treat this as a potential serotonin toxicity event and stop the offending agents now rather than escalate the dose [^5a04e3cb] [^5f46cb6f].

> I need to check the evidence base for nortriptyline in neuropathic pain before deciding on alternatives. The Cochrane review concludes there is very low-quality evidence for nortriptyline in chronic neuropathic pain and does not support it as first-line, whereas duloxetine and pregabalin have stronger evidence and guideline support; moreover, a comparative effectiveness trial in cryptogenic sensory polyneuropathy found duloxetine and nortriptyline had similar utility when balancing efficacy and tolerability, reinforcing that safer, guideline-endorsed options exist [^850772ea] [^cb87fdd3] [^cc914b8b].

> Let me consider safer pharmacologic choices given her risk profile. Duloxetine 30 mg daily with a target of 60 mg daily is guideline-supported for diabetic neuropathic pain and avoids the serotonin syndrome risk inherent to combining a TCA with a triptan; pregabalin or gabapentin are also reasonable alternatives, with pregabalin favored when rapid titration is needed and gabapentin useful when cost or renal dosing flexibility is a priority, and both avoid serotonergic interactions with sumatriptan [^cc914b8b] [^34a9e76a].

> I should double-check cardiac and geriatric safety steps even at age 54. TCAs can prolong QT and cause orthostatic hypotension, and obesity and sedentary lifestyle increase cardiovascular risk; if a TCA were ever reconsidered, a baseline ECG with attention to QTc would be prudent, but given the current serotonin toxicity signal and interaction, the balance favors switching rather than attempting cautious rechallenge with a TCA in this context [^f9f6bbf2] [^09550ae9].

> Next, I should review immediate actions. I will discontinue nortriptyline now and advise stopping sumatriptan temporarily while symptoms resolve; I will monitor vitals and mental status over the next 24–48 hours and provide supportive care for serotonin syndrome if needed; I will also counsel on migraine management to reduce triptan overuse, as medication-overuse headache is common and can perpetuate frequent triptan use, and abrupt withdrawal with bridge therapy is guideline-supported in appropriate patients [^5a04e3cb] [^0690335b] [^b313d2aa].

> But wait, what if the patient still needs migraine acute therapy while we transition neuropathic pain treatment? Non-triptan options such as NSAIDs with antiemetics can be used for selected attacks, and preventive strategies should be considered to reduce triptan dependence; if triptans are absolutely necessary, they should be used sparingly and not in combination with serotonergic antidepressants, given the risk we just observed [^170eb162].

> I will now examine a practical replacement plan. I will start duloxetine 30 mg daily for one week, then increase to 60 mg daily if tolerated, with a follow-up in 2–4 weeks to assess pain, mood, sleep, blood pressure, and GI tolerability; if duloxetine is not suitable, pregabalin 75 mg twice daily titrated to 300 mg daily is a reasonable alternative, with renal function guiding dosing and with counseling on dizziness, edema, and weight effects; throughout, I will reassess migraine frequency and consider preventive therapy to reduce triptan exposure [^cc914b8b] [^34a9e76a].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. No, nortriptyline should not be continued or up-titrated in this patient; the combination with frequent sumatriptan use has likely precipitated serotonin syndrome, and safer, evidence-based alternatives like duloxetine or pregabalin should be used for diabetic neuropathic pain, with immediate discontinuation of nortriptyline and close monitoring of the serotonin toxicity symptoms [^5a04e3cb] [^850772ea] [^cc914b8b].

---

Stop nortriptyline immediately and do not increase the dose. The patient's confusion, tachycardia, and tremor are consistent with **serotonin syndrome** from the combination of nortriptyline and sumatriptan, and her CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolism increases toxicity risk [^5a04e3cb] [^notfound]. Nortriptyline should be discontinued and an alternative neuropathic pain agent (e.g. duloxetine or gabapentin) started, with close monitoring for serotonin syndrome and consideration of pharmacogenomic testing to guide future therapy [^cc914b8b] [^92d897c1].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

### CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolism

- **Increased metabolism**: Ultrarapid metabolizers convert nortriptyline to inactive metabolites faster, often yielding subtherapeutic levels at standard doses [^6df8cd24].
- **Paradoxical toxicity**: Despite faster metabolism, ultrarapid metabolizers can accumulate toxic metabolites or experience altered pharmacodynamics, increasing adverse effects [^6df8cd24].
- **Clinical evidence**: Case reports and studies show ultrarapid metabolizers can develop toxicity with TCAs, including confusion, tachycardia, and tremor [^notfound].

---

### Drug-drug interaction: nortriptyline and sumatriptan

- **Serotonin syndrome risk**: Sumatriptan (a 5-HT1B/1D agonist) plus nortriptyline (a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) increases serotonin syndrome risk, especially with high triptan use [^5a04e3cb].
- **Clinical features**: Confusion, tachycardia, tremor, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, and agitation are classic for serotonin syndrome [^5a04e3cb].
- **Timing**: Symptoms began after increasing sumatriptan frequency, supporting serotonin syndrome [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Serotonin syndrome**: The FDA warns against combining TCAs with triptans due to serotonin syndrome risk; discontinue if suspected [^5a04e3cb].
- **Neuropathic pain**: Nortriptyline is used for neuropathic pain, but evidence is limited and adverse effects are common; consider alternatives when toxicity occurs [^850772ea].
- **Pharmacogenomics**: CPIC recommends CYP2D6-guided dosing for TCAs to optimize efficacy and reduce toxicity [^92d897c1].

---

## Recommended clinical actions

### Immediate actions

Immediately **discontinue nortriptyline** and stop sumatriptan temporarily. Monitor for progression of serotonin syndrome and treat supportively (benzodiazepines for tremor/agitation, antipyretics, IV fluids, and beta-blockers for persistent tachycardia) [^5a04e3cb].

---

### Alternative pharmacological management

- **Duloxetine**: An SNRI with strong evidence for diabetic neuropathy; no significant interaction with sumatriptan [^cc914b8b].
- **Gabapentin or pregabalin**: Effective for neuropathic pain; no serotonergic interactions [^cc914b8b].
- **Pharmacogenomic testing**: Consider CYP2D6 testing to guide future antidepressant selection and dosing [^92d897c1].

---

### Long-term management considerations

Long-term management should include **patient education** on serotonin syndrome and drug interactions, and **regular monitoring** for adverse effects and efficacy with any new neuropathic agent. Coordinate migraine care to reduce triptan use and consider preventives to limit exposure [^0690335b].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Stop nortriptyline immediately and do not increase the dose. The patient's symptoms are consistent with **serotonin syndrome** from nortriptyline plus sumatriptan, compounded by CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolism. Switch to a non-serotonergic neuropathic pain agent (e.g. duloxetine or gabapentin) and monitor closely, with pharmacogenomic testing to inform future therapy [^5a04e3cb] [^cc914b8b] [^92d897c1].

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Nortriptyline hydrochloride is not recommended for children.

Nortriptyline hydrochloride is administered orally in the form of capsules. Lower than usual dosages are recommended for elderly patients and adolescents. Lower dosages are also recommended for outpatients than for hospitalized patients who will be under close supervision. The physician should initiate dosage at a low level and increase it gradually, noting carefully the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Following remission, maintenance medication may be required for a longer period of time at the lowest dose that will maintain remission.

If a patient develops minor side effects, the dosage should be reduced. The drug should be discontinued promptly if adverse effects of a serious nature or allergic manifestations occur.

Usual Adult Dose - 25 mg three or four times daily; dosage should begin at a low level and be increased as required. As an alternate regimen, the total daily dosage may be given once a day. When doses above 100 mg daily are administered, plasma levels of nortriptyline should be monitored and maintained in the optimum range of 50 to 150 ng/mL. Doses above 150 mg/day are not recommended.

Elderly and Adolescent Patients - 30 to 50 mg/day, in divided doses, or the total daily dosage may be given once a day.

Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with nortriptyline hydrochloride. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping nortriptyline hydrochloride before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Nortriptyline for treatment-resistant depression [^bf465301]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Up to 30% of patients with major depression fail to respond to an antidepressant trial, with most taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) as initial treatment. While the tricyclic antidepressants might be effective for SSRI nonresponders, they have been relegated to third- and fourth-line treatment. This study assesses the efficacy of nortriptyline for patients with treatment-resistant major depression.

Method

92 patients with treatment-resistant DSM-III-R major depression, with resistance defined by at least 1, but no more than 5, well-documented adequate trials of antidepressants during the current episode, were treated openly with nortriptyline for 6 weeks. Patients were titrated up to full target doses of nortriptyline within 1 week, with target blood levels of 100 ng/mL. Response was defined as a 50% or greater decrease of baseline 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score. We performed an intent-to-treat analysis with the last observation carried forward.

Results

Approximately 40% of patients were responders (N = 39) and 12% were remitters (N = 11) after 6 weeks of nortriptyline. Over a third of patients were unable to complete the trial.

Conclusion

Nortriptyline was effective for over a third of patients with treatment-resistant depression, and nortriptyline should be considered as potential treatment if patients fail to respond to other antidepressants.

### Paroxetine versus nortriptyline in the continuation and maintenance treatment of depression in the elderly [^aceffc44]. Depression and Anxiety (2001). Low credibility.

Elderly depressed patients are vulnerable to recurrence of depression and benefit from long-term antidepressant therapy. Physicians increasingly use selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as maintenance therapy, although in the absence of data showing that SSRIs are as efficacious as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in the prevention of depression relapse and recurrence. Our objective was to evaluate, in an open trial, the efficacy of paroxetine versus nortriptyline for preventing recurrence of depression in the elderly. Elderly patients with major depression were randomly assigned in a double-blinded fashion to receive either paroxetine or nortriptyline for the acute treatment of depression. Patients who did not respond or tolerate their assigned medications were crossed over openly to the comparator agent. Patients whose depression remitted continued antidepressant medication (paroxetine n = 38; nortriptyline n = 21) during an open 18-month follow-up study. We examined the rates of and times to relapse and to termination of treatment for any reason. Paroxetine (PX) and nortriptyline (NT) patients had similar rates of relapse (16% vs. 10%, respectively) and time to relapse (60.3 weeks vs. 58.8 weeks, respectively) over 18 months. A lower burden of residual depressive symptoms and side effects during continuation and maintenance treatment was evident in nortriptyline-treated patients. Paroxetine and nortriptyline demonstrated similar efficacy in relapse and recurrence prevention in elderly depressed patients over an 18-month period.

Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs

Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of nortriptyline hydrochloride or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Nortriptyline hydrochloride is not approved for use in pediatric patients (see WARNINGS, Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients; and PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).

Use of Nortriptyline Hydrochloride With Other MAOIs, Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue

Do not start nortriptyline hydrochloride in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In some cases, a patient already receiving nortriptyline hydrochloride therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, nortriptyline hydrochloride should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for two weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with nortriptyline hydrochloride may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see WARNINGS).

The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with nortriptyline hydrochloride is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use (see WARNINGS).

Serotonin Syndrome

The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including nortriptyline hydrochloride, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular changes (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.

The concomitant use of nortriptyline hydrochloride with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Nortriptyline hydrochloride should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking nortriptyline hydrochloride. Nortriptyline hydrochloride should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

If concomitant use of nortriptyline hydrochloride with other serotonergic drugs, including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.

Treatment with nortriptyline hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^641fa791]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Prevention of recurrence–MDD in older adult patients with a history of depression — recommended and conditional options: For older adult patients with a history of depression, the panel recommends clinicians offer either combination interpersonal psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy or combination supportive care and pharmacotherapy, and while the study on which this is based used nortriptyline, the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects; if the prior options are not acceptable or available, the panel suggests considering interpersonal psychotherapy (individual) alone. Based on the literature reviewed that met the IOM or AMSTAR requirements, comparative effectiveness research demonstrated sufficient evidence for the panel to recommend some combinations of treatments over others due to differences in treatment effect for prevention of recurrence, other treatment/combinations of treatments were equally recommended by the panel based on comparative effectiveness research evidence demonstrating no difference in effect for prevention of recurrence, and nortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacotherapy strategy for major depression and is generally reserved for patients who have not done well with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) prophylaxis in older children — amitriptyline — states it is the preferred first choice in the older child (older than 5 years), with higher response rates when an adequate dosage of 1.0 mg · kg−1 · day−1, occasionally 1.5–2.0 mg · kg−1 · day−1, is given for at least 4 weeks; dosing is commonly initiated at 0.25–0.5 mg · kg−1 · day−1 at night and increased by 5 to 10 mg, with QTc monitoring to maintain ≤ 460 msec before and after reaching the targeted dose. Nortriptyline can be considered but has no supporting studies and is not recommended in younger children because of frequent side effects and a risk for overdose.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^6620f175]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Older adults' treatment preference and medication considerations emphasize that pharmacotherapy is usually not indicated for subsyndromal depressive symptom cases, so psychological treatments are prioritized and CBT, problem-solving therapy, life-review and possibly other interventions can be recommended; older adults and younger adults appear to demonstrate similar improvements in response to psychotherapy. Nortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacotherapy approach for major depression and is generally reserved for patients who have not completed or have not responded adequately to either an SSRI or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline; some argue that paroxetine is contraindicated in older adults due to its anticholinergic side effects and many geriatric psychiatrists would prefer another SSRI (i.e., escitalopram or sertraline). The panel encourages shared decision-making between patients and clinicians.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^ee7a751a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommended pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) — Outpatient with stable CVD first-line options are varenicline or combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT); second-line options are bupropion or a single NRT product; third line is nortriptyline. If a single agent is insufficient to achieve abstinence, combine categories: varenicline + NRT (single agent), varenicline + bupropion, or bupropion + NRT (single agent). For inpatient acute coronary syndromes (ACS), in-hospital therapy to relieve nicotine withdrawal is a nicotine patch or combination NRT, with at-discharge options of combination NRT or varenicline; at-discharge second line is a single NRT product and third line is bupropion. Combination NRT comprises a nicotine patch plus the patient's choice of gum, lozenge, inhaler, or spray; some would start varenicline in-hospital and others at discharge, and regardless, continue nicotine patch or short-acting form for 1 week during up‑titration. Nortriptyline is not FDA‑approved for smoking cessation and has few data in CVD, and bupropion is listed as 3rd line because of no evidence of efficacy when started during hospitalization for acute ACS or acute MI, though no special safety concerns are noted.

### Should nortriptyline be used as a first-line aid to help smokers quit? Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis [^854959cd]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy of nortriptyline for smoking cessation compared to placebo and bupropion sustained release.

Data Sources

Randomized trials were identified by (1) checking electronic and (2) online publicly accessible registers of clinical trials; (3) searching references of identified studies and screening abstract books of conferences and symposia, and (4) personal communication with the first authors of identified papers.

Review Methods

We included randomized trials in which nortriptyline was compared to placebo or bupropion hydrochloride SR. The main clinical outcome measure was (at least) 6-month prolonged abstinence, confirmed with a biochemical test. To investigate the efficacy of nortriptyline in time, we calculated the percentage of smokers who relapsed in time.

Results

We identified five randomized trials, including 861 smokers. Compared to placebo medication, nortriptyline resulted in significantly higher prolonged abstinence rates after at least 6 months [relative risk (RR) = 2.4, 95% CI 1.7–3.6; RD = 0.11, 95% CI 0.07–0.15]. The difference in efficacy between nortriptyline and placebo was highest in the first months after the target quit date. However, the number of people who remained abstinent decreased substantially and significantly faster over time in the nortriptyline group. Although bupropion resulted in higher abstinence rates compared with nortriptyline, the difference was not statistically significant (RR = 1.7, 95% CI 0.7–4.1).

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis shows that the use of nortriptyline for smoking cessation resulted in higher prolonged abstinence rates after at least 6 months compared to placebo treatment. Furthermore, the use of nortriptyline for smoking cessation is well tolerated and safe. As a result, we believe health care professionals should be recommended to prescribe nortriptyline as a first-line therapy for smoking cessation, also because of the much lower cost of nortriptyline compared to bupropion SR.

### Prolonged toxicity after amitriptyline overdose in a patient deficient in CYP2D6 activity [^56b7daf0]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amitriptyline and its metabolite, nortriptyline, are metabolized, in part, by CYP2D6, a polymorphic enzyme. About 8% of Caucasians are deficient in CYP2D6 activity.

Case Report

We present the case of a comatose woman who intentionally overdosed on amitriptyline and displayed rising serum total tricyclic antidepressant concentrations for at least 6 days after admission. Serial immunoassay total tricyclic antidepressant concentrations in our patient showed gradual decline beginning day 7, although the patient did not regain normal mental status until day 12. Genotyping revealed the patient to be homozygous for the CYP2D6✱4 allele, the most common explanation of CYP2D6 enzymatic deficiency among Caucasians. Patients taking tricyclic antidepressants who are homozygous for CYP2D6✱4 demonstrate > 3 times concentration-time curve (AUCs) and prolonged elimination half-lives, especially of secondary amines such as nortriptyline.

Discussion

We believe this is the first report describing toxicokinetics after tricyclic antidepressant overdose in a CYP2D6-deficient patient.

### Pain assessment and treatment in children with significant impairment of the central nervous system [^6a3f8037]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) — use and cautions in neuropathic pain for children with SNI: Nortriptyline and amitriptyline have been used to treat peripheral neuropathic pain, central neuropathic pain, and visceral hyperalgesia, with mechanisms including presynaptic reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin and anticholinergic properties that can cause sedation, constipation, and urinary retention; adverse effects can be lessened with a slow titration to the initial goal dose, and TCAs should be used cautiously with other medications that can result in serotonin syndrome and with awareness of potential cardiac dysrhythmia, including prolonged QT interval. Nortriptyline has a lower anticholinergic effect, although it is unclear whether this is clinically significant in children. Nortriptyline and amitriptyline are considered first- or second-line treatment of neuropathic pain in adults and have the benefit of once- or twice-daily dosing; given the lack of evidence in children with SNI and potential adverse effects, a TCA might be a reasonable second-line medication after a trial with a gabapentinoid in such children with recurrent pain behaviors, and a TCA can be started while continuing gabapentin, supported by 1 study identifying greater benefit with the combination of gabapentin and nortriptyline over either alone in adults.

3 PROPHYLACTIC MEDICATIONS IN CVS

3.1 Recommendation 1. We strongly recommend that adults with moderate‐to‐severe CVS receive tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), especially amitriptyline, as a first‐line prophylactic medication

Grade: Strong recommendation, very low‐quality evidence. Vote: 100% agreement

Amitriptyline (AT) is a tricyclic antidepressant, a mixed serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that also interacts with cholinergic, and multiple histamine receptors and ion channels. 11 Amitriptyline is converted by cytochrome P4502C19 (CYP2C19) to nortriptyline (NT). 12 Both AT and NT are converted by CYP2D6 to their inactive metabolite. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 can affect the efficacy and side effect profile of TCAs. 13 Prophylactic therapy with TCAs should be considered in patients who have moderate‐to‐severe CVS. Moderate‐to‐severe CVS is defined by one or more of the following: ≥ 4 episodes/year, episodes > 2 days in duration, severe episodes that require emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalization, or episodes that significantly interfere with activities of daily living. 14 Patient preferences need to be taken into consideration prior to initiating prophylactic therapy.

### Nortriptyline for neuropathic pain in adults [^850772ea]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Antidepressants are widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage), usually in doses below those at which they exert antidepressant effects. An earlier review that included all antidepressants for neuropathic pain is being replaced by new reviews of individual drugs examining individual neuropathic pain conditions. Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is occasionally used for treating neuropathic pain, and is recommended in European, UK, and USA guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of nortriptyline for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 7 January 2015, and the reference lists of retrieved papers and other reviews. We also searched two clinical trials databases for ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing nortriptyline with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain. Participants were adults aged 18 years and over. We included only full journal publication articles and clinical trial summaries.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality. We considered the evidence using three tiers. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks' duration, parallel design); second tier evidence from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison; and third tier evidence from data involving small numbers of participants that was considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both. We planned to calculate risk ratio (RR) and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) and harmful outcome (NNH) using standard methods expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included six studies treating 310 participants (mean or median age 49 to 64 years) with various neuropathic pain conditions. Five studies used a cross-over design, and one used a parallel-group design; 272 participants were randomised to treatment with nortriptyline, 145 to placebo, 94 to gabapentin, 56 to gabapentin plus nortriptyline, 55 to morphine, 55 to morphine plus nortriptyline, 39 to chlorimipramine, and 33 to amitriptyline. Treatment periods lasted from three to eight weeks. All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias. No study provided first or second tier evidence for any outcome. Only one study reported our primary outcome of people with at least 50% reduction in pain. There was no indication that either nortriptyline or gabapentin was more effective in postherpetic neuralgia (very low quality evidence). Two studies reported the number of people with at least moderate pain relief, and one reported the number who were satisfied with their pain relief and had tolerable adverse effects. We considered these outcomes to be equivalent to our other primary outcome of Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) much or very much improved. We could not pool data, but third tier evidence in individual studies indicated similar efficacy to other active interventions (gabapentin, morphine, chlorimipramine, and amitriptyline), and to placebo in the conditions studied (very low quality evidence). Adverse event reporting was inconsistent and fragmented. More participants reported adverse events with nortriptyline than with placebo, similar numbers with nortriptyline and other antidepressants (amitriptyline and chlorimipramine) and gabapentin, and slightly more with morphine (very low quality evidence). No study reported any serious adverse events or deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

We found little evidence to support the use of nortriptyline to treat the neuropathic pain conditions included in this review. There were no studies in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The studies were methodologically flawed, largely due to small size, and potentially subject to major bias. The results of this review do not support the use of nortriptyline as a first line treatment. Effective medicines with much greater supportive evidence are available, such as duloxetine and pregabalin.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^f9f6bbf2]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain — tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have uncertain benefit; for patients with low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against tricyclic antidepressants (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). The evidence for the use of TCAs demonstrates limited benefit with low to very low quality evidence, and a systematic review showed no benefit for either function or pain, although older studies reported improvement in pain intensity with a moderate effect size of 0.43 but were inconclusive for function, quality of life (QoL), or healthcare utilization. Providers should use caution when prescribing TCAs to patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or a family history of sudden death; a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is indicated in patients who are aged > 50 years or with significant cardiac risk factors. When used in patients aged ≥ 65 years, the anticholinergic burden should also be considered and secondary amines such as nortriptyline or desipramine may be warranted due to decreased anticholinergic burden; some subpopulations may be at greater risk of sedation and falls, and there is also a risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly when combining with other medications (e.g., antidepressants).

### Corneal neuropathic pain: a review to inform clinical practice [^473b61ea]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Oral medications for corneal neuropathic pain with their dosage and mechanism of action.

Medication regimes should be tailored to individual patient needs and potential side-effects discussed.

TCA tricyclic antidepressant, SNRI serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, TID three times a day, BID twice a day, CNS central nervous system, TLR toll-like receptor.

Tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs) have been utilised in the management of CNP and maybe classified as secondary amines (e.g. nortriptyline and desipramine) and tertiary amines (e.g. imipramine and amitryptline). TCAs inhibit noradrenaline uptake but may have effects via actions such as sodium channel blockade, sympathetic blockage, antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors and anticholinergic activities. Due to a better safety profile, nortriptyline maybe preferred to tertiary amines, particularly in the elderly, as side effects such as confusion and postural hypotension maybe avoided. In neuropathic pain, the TCA can act in smaller doses and without needing to treat depression. In a retrospective study of 30 NCP patients, who had had an inadequate response to other systemic and topical treatments and with centralised component treated with nortriptyline on chart review there was a symptomatic improvement in CNP and mean quality of life scores also improved. In this study, 33% of patients had more than 30% improvement in pain and 27% withdrew from treatment due to prolonged side-effects even though 22% improved. Anti-convulsant/sodium channel blockers such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine or topiramate have also been used in CNP due to their ability to alter pro-inflammatory signalling and blockage of channels associated with nerve excitability.

The selection of the most appropriate agent(s) is based on a patient's needs and medical status with consideration of the agent that will be best tolerated and most effective. To improve compliance with oral therapies patients should be counselled on their potential side effects and time course of action. In general, a low dose is trialled first and increased if needed noting that it may take 2–3 months for pain symptoms to improve, and that further improvement could take a year or more. If the response is partial an additional agent maybe added again starting at a low dose. Treatment is generally maintained for 2–3 years before weaning. At present, it cannot be predicted who will respond to which oral therapy such that treatments needed to be trialled.

### Using a pharmacy-based intervention to improve antipsychotic adherence among patients with serious mental illness [^406c5628]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2011). Low credibility.

Adverse Events

One of the 2 deaths in the 12-month study period was in the intervention group and was considered "possibly" related to the intervention. This death was attributed to intoxication with cocaine, citalopram, and nortriptyline. The patient had had no changes in amitriptyline refilling patterns in the 11 months prior to death, and the medication was prescribed in usual doses. The high medication levels may have occurred for a number of reasons (intentional overdose, counterbalancing of a cocaine high with amitriptyline, etc.). However, if the patient ingested his amitriptyline more regularly with the intervention and was a slow metabolizer, this may have contributed to high nortriptyline levels. The data safety monitoring board and local IRBs reviewed this event and allowed the study to continue without change. No hospitalizations during the study were deemed related to the intervention.

### Optimal dosing of nortriptyline-topiramate and verapamil-paroxetine combinations in tinnitus treatment [^fc7e26f3]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine effective dose strategies for nortriptyline-topiramate (NT) and verapamil-paroxetine (VP) combinations for tinnitus treatment.

Methods

This secondary analysis examined data from an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) evaluating treatment outcomes in 41 patients. Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) scores were used as the primary outcome measure, administered at baseline, Week 4, and Week 8 to assess achievement of minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of 13-point reduction. Descriptive statistics were employed to characterize treatment responses and assess dose-response relationships.

Results

In the NT group (n = 19), 42% of the participants achieved a reduction in TFI scores meeting MCID with a mean dose of 44 ± 12mg nortriptyline plus 59 ± 16mg topiramate, all showing greater than 15% improvement. In the VP group (n = 22), 41% reached MCID with a mean of 207 ± 36mg verapamil plus 28 ± 5mg paroxetine. Of these, 88.9% showed at least a 15% improvement in TFI. Early responders who achieved MCID by the midpoint of the trial required continued dose escalations due to limited improvement in weekly VAS scores afterward. However, subsequent TFI changes were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Both NT and VP regimens effectively reduce tinnitus severity in approximately half of the patients at moderate doses within 8weeks. However, long-term effects may not have been fully captured, particularly among late improvers.

### Is baseline medication resistance associated with potential for relapse after successful remission of a depressive episode with ECT? Data from the consortium for research on electroconvulsive therapy (CORE) [^9153cb5f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To test whether pre-electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) medication resistance is associated with post-ECT relapse rates.

Method

In a post hoc analysis of data from a large multicenter trial of post-ECT relapse prevention strategies (conducted from May 1997 to July 2004), we assessed whether response to antidepressant medications prior to ECT for a unipolar nonpsychotic depressive episode (DSM-IV) was associated with differential relapse rates after remission with ECT. Baseline (i.e., pre-ECT) medication use was assessed with the Antidepressant Treatment History Form. Following remission with ECT that was stable for 1 week, patients were randomly assigned to receive 6 months of treatment with either combination lithium carbonate/nortriptyline or continuation ECT. Relapse was assessed with the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. There were 146 patients followed in the first week after remission (termed the interim week in this study), and 73 in the randomized phase of the study. For the purposes of this trial, medication resistance is defined as not having responded to at least 1 adequate trial of an antidepressant medication before ECT.

Results

In the first week after acute remission, 9.8% of patients not having at least 1 antidepressant medication trial met relapse criteria, while 31.4% of medication-resistant patients met relapse criteria, a difference that was statistically significant (p = .026). In the randomized phase of the study, 34.6% of non-medication-resistant patients relapsed, while 50.0% of medication-resistant patients relapsed, a difference that was not significant (p = .434).

Conclusion

We conclude that nonpsychotic patients who had at least 1 adequate antidepressant medication trial before ECT may be especially prone to early relapse after successful acute remission with ECT.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: commentary [^f8454511]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Prophylactic therapy for moderate–severe cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — tricyclic antidepressants (TCA): Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, or doxepin have "5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition", with a "Starting dosage: 25 mg qhs" and "Goal dosage (any TCA): 75–150 mg or 1–1.5 mg/kg qhs"; common adverse effects include "Somnolence, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, weight gain and prolonged QTc on ECG". Clinical considerations note "Slow titration (10–25 mg increments, every 2 wk, up to goal dosage) is generally better tolerated", that "Amitriptyline may have more anticholinergic/antihistaminergic activity than nortriptyline", and they are "Dosed at night".

### Continuation pharmacotherapy in the prevention of relapse following electroconvulsive therapy: a randomized controlled trial [^44302cc9]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is highly effective for treatment of major depression, but naturalistic studies show a high rate of relapse after discontinuation of ECT.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of continuation pharmacotherapy with nortriptyline hydrochloride or combination nortriptyline and lithium carbonate in preventing post-ECT relapse.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1993 to 1998, stratified by medication resistance or presence of psychotic depression in the index episode.

Setting

Two university-based hospitals and 1 private psychiatric hospital.

Patients

Of 290 patients with unipolar major depression recruited through clinical referral who completed an open ECT treatment phase, 159 patients met remitter criteria; 84 remitting patients were eligible and agreed to participate in the continuation study.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive continuation treatment for 24 weeks with placebo (n = 29), nortriptyline (target steady-state level, 75–125 ng/mL) (n = 27), or combination nortriptyline and lithium (target steady-state level, 0.5–0.9 mEq/L) (n = 28).

Main Outcome Measure

Relapse of major depressive episode, compared among the 3 continuation groups.

Results

Nortriptyline-lithium combination therapy had a marked advantage in time to relapse, superior to both placebo and nortriptyline alone. Over the 24-week trial, the relapse rate for placebo was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI] 70%-99%); for nortriptyline, 60% (95% CI, 41%-79%); and for nortriptyline-lithium, 39% (95% CI, 19%-59%). All but 1 instance of relapse with nortriptyline-lithium occurred within 5 weeks of ECT termination, while relapse continued throughout treatment with placebo or nortriptyline alone. Medication-resistant patients, female patients, and those with more severe depressive symptoms following ECT had more rapid relapse.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that without active treatment, virtually all remitted patients relapse within 6 months of stopping ECT. Monotherapy with nortriptyline has limited efficacy. The combination of nortriptyline and lithium is more effective, but the relapse rate is still high, particularly during the first month of continuation therapy.

### Persistence of cognitive impairment in geriatric patients following antidepressant treatment: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial with nortriptyline and paroxetine [^a3257c18]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2003). Low credibility.

Cognitive dysfunction is common in older persons suffering from a major depression. However, the degree to which this dysfunction is reversible with successful treatment of the depression remains uncertain. The present study examined the effects that treatment (randomized double-blind design) with either an SSRI (paroxetine) or a tricyclic antidepressant (nortriptyline) had on cognition in older depressed patients. The patients' performance was compared to that of a group of normal controls of similar age and education. Patients and controls were administered measures of working memory, information-processing speed, episodic memory and attention five times over the course of a 12 week trial. At baseline, the patients performed more poorly than the elderly controls on all cognitive measures. While the patients' performance did improve over the course of their treatment, the magnitude of this improvement did not exceed that produced in the elderly controls by practice alone. The same pattern of results was evident in both intent-to-treat and responder analyses. Thus, there was no evidence that the depressed patients' cognitive performance normalized after response to antidepressant therapy. Neither the patients' age at onset nor their baseline level of cognitive functioning influenced the amount by which their performance improved over the 12 week trial. There was no difference between paroxetine and nortriptyline in the amount of cognitive change associated with treatment. The present results suggest that cognitive dysfunction persists in older depressed patients even after their mood disorder has responded to antidepressant medications.

### Antiplatelet effects of antidepressant treatment: a randomized comparison between escitalopram and nortriptyline [^be033441]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Depressive disorders have been identified as independent risk factors for coronary heart disease. The present study (i) compared platelet function of depressed patients with that of healthy controls, (ii) analysed possible aggregability changes during 3 months of treatment with antidepressants, and (iii) sought to assess different effects of escitalopram and nortriptyline on platelet aggregation.

Methods

Blood samples of 91 major depressed patients and 91 healthy controls were analysed with whole blood aggregometry in a case-control setting. Depressed patients were randomized to two groups treated either with escitalopram (n = 47) or nortriptyline (n = 44). Platelet aggregation was studied on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 84 of continuing medication and was determined in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen.

Results

Platelet aggregation induced by ADP was increased among depressive patients compared with that of healthy controls (26%, p = 0.006). With antidepressant treatment, changes in platelet aggregation remained comparable in both groups at early time points (d1 to 21). In contrast, at day 84, patients with antidepressive response revealed significant differences in both medication groups: Patients receiving escitalopram showed a 23% decrease of ADP induced aggregation (p = 0.03) and a 15% decrease of collagen induced aggregation (p = 0.03). With nortriptyline the increase in impedance was reduced by 29% after ADP induction (p = 0.046).

Conclusion

Depressed patients have higher ex vivo platelet aggregation that may contribute to increased cardiovascular morbidity. After three months of antidepressant treatment with either escitalopram or nortriptyline, platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in antidepressant responders, irrespective of the antidepressant medication type.

Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6

The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7% to 10% of Caucasians are so called "poor metabolizers"); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).

In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).

Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^884fcfa0]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Older adult patients with depression — conditional recommendation for use: If a recommended treatment is not acceptable or available, the panel suggests that clinicians offer one of the following psychotherapies/interventions that demonstrated efficacy when compared with no treatment or treatment as usual. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (individual) (either standalone or in combination with usual care) was found to be superior to no treatment, a nonspecific talk therapy control, usual care, and desipramine. Combination cognitive-behavioral therapy and nonspecific therapeutic techniques (individual) with pharmacotherapy was superior to pharmacotherapy alone, and the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects. Interpersonal psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy was conditionally superior for preventing recurrence to supportive care or to IPT and supportive care, and the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects. Problem-solving therapy (group) was superior to reminiscence therapy (group), and interpersonal psychotherapy (individual) was superior to supportive care. The rationale states that the panel suggests the use of interventions that demonstrated efficacy when compared with no treatment (i.e., waitlist) or treatment as usual, notes that nortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacotherapy strategy for major depression, is generally reserved for patients who have not done well with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline, and that there is some efficacy data from systematic reviews/meta-analyses showing efficacy of second-generation antidepressants over placebo.

### Suicidal ideation during treatment of depression with escitalopram and nortriptyline in genome-based therapeutic drugs for depression (GENDEP): a clinical trial [^b27798ae]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Suicidal thoughts and behaviours during antidepressant treatment, especially during the first weeks of treatment, have prompted warnings by regulatory bodies. The aim of the present study is to investigate the course and predictors of emergence and worsening of suicidal ideation during tricyclic antidepressant and serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment.

Methods

In a multicentre part-randomised open-label study, 811 adult patients with moderate to severe unipolar depression were allocated to flexible dosage of escitalopram or nortriptyline for 12 weeks. The suicidality items of three standard measures were integrated in a suicidal ideation score. Increases in this score were classified as treatment emergent suicidal ideation (TESI) or treatment worsening suicidal ideation (TWOSI) according to the absence or presence of suicidal ideation at baseline.

Results

Suicidal ideation decreased during antidepressant treatment. Rates of TESI and TWOSI peaked in the fifth week. Severity of depression predicted TESI and TWOSI. In men, nortriptyline was associated with a 9.8-fold and 2.4-fold increase in TESI and TWOSI compared to escitalopram, respectively. Retirement and history of suicide attempts predicted TWOSI.

Conclusion

Increases in suicidal ideation were associated with depression severity and decreased during antidepressant treatment. In men, treatment with escitalopram is associated with lower risk of suicidal ideation compared to nortriptyline. Clinicians should remain alert to suicidal ideation beyond the initial weeks of antidepressant treatment.

### The SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for pediatric gastric emptying [^bf6c63ed]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2025). High credibility.

Medications and substances — agents affecting gastric emptying and pre-study handling: A wide range of medications can either increase or decrease gastric emptying, including aluminum hydroxide antacids, anticholinergics, antidepressants such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and venlafaxine, calcium channel blockers, H2 receptor antagonists, ondansetron, opioid pain medicines, phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine and promethazine, progesterone, proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate, and weight loss medicines such as semaglutide. The referring clinician should indicate whether the gastric emptying study will be performed while the patient takes these medications, and if the indication is to assess gastric emptying in the absence of therapy, the rule of thumb is that medications that may affect gastric emptying should be discontinued for at least 3 days before the gastric emptying study. Because stopping such drugs may not be possible or appropriate, performing the study while the patient takes some medications may be most informative, medication discontinuation may need to be discussed with the clinical team, and all pertinent current medications should be listed in the nuclear medicine report. Tobacco can delay gastric emptying and patients should be instructed to avoid tobacco before the study; cannabis can also delay gastric emptying, but in some patients cannabis may improve symptoms of gastroparesis, and if a cannabis product is being used therapeutically, the decision whether to continue or discontinue should be made in consultation with the referring physician.

Cardiac amyloidosis — neuropathic pain agents list dose titration, maximum daily dose, precautions, and adverse effects. Pregabalin is 75 mg twice daily; after 4–7 d, increase by the same dosage to goal of 300 mg/d as necessary to 600 mg/d, with a maximum of 600 mg/d (split twice a day); adjust for kidney insufficiency and consider psychiatric or addiction history, and adverse effects include sedation, dizziness, confusion, edema, euphoria, and weight gain. Gabapentin starts at 300 mg at bedtime, increase every 4–7 d by 300-mg increments, initially to 3 times/d and then to goal of 1,800 mg/d and as necessary to 3,600 mg/d, with a maximum of 3,600 mg/d (split 3 times/d); adjust for kidney insufficiency, and adverse effects include sedation, confusion, dizziness, edema, and weight gain. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) are dosed 10–25 mg at bedtime, increase every 4–7 d to goal of 100 mg at bedtime, with a maximum of 150 mg/d; there is risk of serotonin syndrome and caution is advised if cardiac disease or dysrhythmia history, with adverse effects including sedation, dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension, confusion, weight gain, urinary retention, constipation, and blurred vision. Selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine) are 20–30 mg once daily, then increase weekly by the same dosage to goal of 60 mg/d, with a maximum of 120 mg/d (split twice a day); risks include serotonin syndrome, increased bleeding risk, and withdrawal with abrupt discontinuation, with adverse effects including sedation, fatigue, nausea, hyperhidrosis, dizziness, and modest hypertension.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^a60e4419]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

The main preventative treatment options include flunarizine, propranolol, tricyclics, sodium valproate, low-dose topiramate (25 mg twice daily) and venlafaxine, which have all shown benefit in before-and-after analyses in VM and are established treatments for migraine headache.

Flunarizine 10 mg daily is the only treatment that has demonstrated benefit (for vertigo frequency and symptom severity) compared to a control group, albeit without a placebo and in a study with significant methodological flaws. While not meeting criteria for inclusion in this review, a service evaluation of flunarizine use at our institution found that 90% of patients experienced symptomatic improvement, and although side effects were common (reported by 50%), most patients felt that these were outweighed by the clinical benefit. In our experience flunarizine is generally well tolerated; however, we recommend that patients receive long-term monitoring due to the risk of parkinsonism with prolonged use. Propranolol is also generally well-tolerated, and while there are no randomized studies, there are a number of supportive observational studies and we have certainly found it to be useful in some patients with VM. Amitriptyline was found to be beneficial in two before-and-after studies. While the small study involving nortriptyline did not find a statistically significant reduction in DHI, a number of studies not meeting criteria for inclusion in the review have reported some benefit, and our experience is that nortriptyline is of similar effectiveness to amitriptyline and can also be used. Tricyclics may be useful in VM patients with comorbid insomnia even at low doses (10–25 mg daily); if used at higher doses they may also benefit patients with comorbid depression or anxiety, although high doses may lead to increased side effects. Sodium valproate may be effective in some patients; however, it can cause weight gain and is essentially contraindicated in women of childbearing potential, which significantly limits its use in the VM population. Topiramate, like other newer antiepileptic medications (e.g. levetiracetam and tiagabine), has been associated with a high frequency of depressive symptoms in clinical trials and may also increase the risk of self-harm or suicidal behaviour, thus should be used with caution in those with low mood or a history of depression. Topiramate is also teratogenic and should be avoided in women of childbearing age unless using reliable contraception. It may, however, be a good option in obese patients, as it can cause weight loss. Venlafaxine may be a good option if low mood is a significant comorbidity; however, it carries a risk of a withdrawal syndrome and patients should be counselled appropriately. Hypertension is another recognized side effect of venlafaxine therapy that appears to be dose-dependent, but its incidence tends to be low and the effect on blood pressure relatively weak, although a case of hypertensive encephalopathy following venlafaxine has been reported. Lamotrigine is not a standard treatment for migraine and there has only been one very small study in VM, thus we recommend that it is considered only in patients who have failed multiple other options. In refractory patients the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan or nutraceuticals (riboflavin, magnesium and coenzyme-Q10 alone or in combination) can be considered, although there are no studies in VM — this is justified by the fact that these treatments are well-tolerated, low risk and have evidence for benefit in migraine headache. The evidence for botulinum toxin to treat vestibular symptoms is currently very limited and somewhat conflicting, thus currently best suited to VM patients with prominent headache, as from the current evidence it appears to be less effective for vestibular symptoms. Additionally, it is expensive and may not be widely available: in the UK, botulinum toxin is funded for chronic migraine after failure of at least three other preventative treatments; however, it is not funded for VM. A single-centre analysis of CGRP inhibitors (not included in this review due to not meeting inclusion criteria) found that 60% of patients with VM retrospectively reported improvement in vestibular symptoms. While there is insufficient evidence to recommend CGRP inhibitors for VM, these may become an option in the future, and the results of a clinical trial comparing galcanezumab to placeboare eagerly awaited. We do not recommend acetazolamide because it is not a standard migraine treatment and is generally poorly tolerated, and we do not recommend metoprolol due to the lack of demonstrable benefit against a placebo.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^cfb55acd]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Neuropathic medications — conditional recommendation, evidence, and dosing in CP/CPPS: Clinicians may prescribe medications for neuropathic pain including the classes of tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentinoids. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in men with CP/CPPS, there was no significant difference at the primary endpoint of a response of 6-point drop in NIH-CPSI total scores (p = 0.07), but secondary outcomes showed improvements on NIH-CPSI subscores with 3.3 (pregabalin) versus 2.2 (placebo) of 21 points for pain (p = 0.04), 1.2 versus 0.6 of 10 points for urinary symptoms (p = 0.01), and 2.1 versus 1.4 of 12 points for QOL (p = 0.02), a higher Global Response Assessment response rate (31.2% versus 18.9%; p = 0.02), and improvement in total McGill Pain Questionnaire score (p = 0.01). This indicates that pregabalin may be effective in some patients; however, it should be noted that improvement of the NIH-CPSI subscores may be statistically significant but not clinically meaningful. There are no trials of gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or norepinephrine selective reuptake inhibitors in men with CP/CPPS; of the tricyclic antidepressants, nortriptyline is typically recommended over amitriptyline in elderly patients as it has fewer side effects and similar efficacy. Tricyclic antidepressants are usually started at a low dose, typically 10 mg orally nightly, with doses titrated for effect up to 75 to 100 mg per day as tolerated, and caution is advised in older patients due to the anticholinergic risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. For gabapentin, treatment can be started at 900 mg/day (300 mg/day on day 1, 600 mg/day on day 2, and 900 mg/day on day 3), titrated to 1,800 mg/day for greater efficacy with doses up to 3,600 mg/day in some patients, with an even lower starting dose in younger CP/CPPS patients of 100–300 mg orally at night. Pregabalin is approved at 300 mg/day for post herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy, a lower starting dose can be considered given response to 150 mg per day in the NIH trial, and it is approved at 450 mg/day for fibromyalgia; doses for both gabapentin and pregabalin need to be reduced in patients with a GFR below 60 mL/min.

### Patient assisted intervention for neuropathy: comparison of treatment in real life situations (PAIN-CONTRoLS): Bayesian adaptive comparative effectiveness randomized trial [^cb87fdd3]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Cryptogenic sensory polyneuropathy (CSPN) is a common generalized slowly progressive neuropathy, second in prevalence only to diabetic neuropathy. Most patients with CSPN have significant pain. Many medications have been tried for pain reduction in CSPN, including antiepileptics, antidepressants, and sodium channel blockers. There are no comparative studies that identify the most effective medication for pain reduction in CSPN.

Objective

To determine which medication (pregabalin, duloxetine, nortriptyline, or mexiletine) is most effective for reducing neuropathic pain and best tolerated in patients with CSPN.

Design, Setting, and Participants

From December 1, 2014, through October 20, 2017, a bayesian adaptive, open-label randomized clinical comparative effectiveness study of pain in 402 participants with CSPN was conducted at 40 neurology care clinics. The trial included response adaptive randomization. Participants were patients with CSPN who were 30 years or older, with a pain score of 4 or greater on a numerical rating scale (range, 0–10, with higher scores indicating a higher level of pain). Participant allocation to 1 of 4 drug groups used the utility function and treatment's sample size for response adaptation randomization. At each interim analysis, a decision was made to continue enrolling (up to 400 participants) or stop the whole trial for success (80% power). Patient engagement was maintained throughout the trial, which helped guide the study and identify ways to communicate and disseminate information. Analysis was performed from December 11, 2015, to January 19, 2018.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive nortriptyline (n = 134), duloxetine (n = 126), pregabalin (n = 73), or mexiletine (n = 69).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a utility function that was a composite of the efficacy (participant reported pain reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline to week 12) and quit (participants who discontinued medication) rates.

Results

Among the 402 participants (213 men [53.0%]; mean [SD] age, 60.1 [13.4] years; 343 White [85.3%]), the utility function of nortriptyline was 0.81 (95% bayesian credible interval [CrI], 0.69–0.93; 34 of 134 [25.4%] efficacious; and 51 of 134 [38.1%] quit), of duloxetine was 0.80 (95% CrI, 0.68–0.92; 29 of 126 [23.0%] efficacious; and 47 of 126 [37.3%] quit), pregabalin was 0.69 (95% CrI, 0.55–0.84; 11 of 73 [15.1%] efficacious; and 31 of 73 [42.5%] quit), and mexiletine was 0.58 (95% CrI, 0.42–0.75; 14 of 69 [20.3%] efficacious; and 40 of 69 [58.0%] quit). The probability each medication yielded the highest utility was 0.52 for nortriptyline, 0.43 for duloxetine, 0.05 for pregabalin, and 0.00 for mexiletine.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that, although there was no clearly superior medication, nortriptyline and duloxetine outperformed pregabalin and mexiletine when pain reduction and undesirable adverse effects are combined to a single end point.

### Serotonin receptor agonists in the acute treatment of migraine: a review on their therapeutic potential [^170eb162]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by moderate-to-severe headache attacks lasting 4–72 hours with unilateral location and pulsating quality, aggravated by movement or causing avoidance of routine physical activity and associated with nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Migraine is an important socioeconomic burden and is ranked the sixth cause of years of life lost because of disability in the general population and the third cause of years of life lost in people younger than 50 years.–

Migraine is an episodic disorder, but its frequency during the lifetime can fluctuate back and forth from a low to a high pattern. Each year, ~3% of patients with episodic migraine develop new-onset chronic migraine (CM), with headache occurring ≥ 15 days/month (for > 3 months with at least eight attacks having migraine features). When the frequency of the attacks is four or more per month, a preventative therapy with one or more of the following pharmacological classes is required: antihypertensive agents (e.g. β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, aldosterone receptor blockers), antiepileptic drugs (e.g. topiramate, divalproex sodium), and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, nortriptyline). Botox® (onabotulinumtoxinA) is indicated for the prevention of CM.

The cornerstone of pharmacological treatment is represented by the acute therapy, aimed to abort attacks and lead to a prompt relief from pain. Migraine acute therapy is based on nonspecific (analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) or specific (triptans and ergot derivatives) drugs. The choice may be based on a stratified care approach (i.e. depending on migraine severity and other clinical factors) or on the step care management (i.e. if the response to analgesics is not sufficient, patients might receive specific drugs).

### Comparison of the effects of escitalopram and nortriptyline on painful symptoms in patients with major depression [^48577831]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Unexplained painful physical symptoms are commonly reported by depressed patients. The evidence suggests that dual-action antidepressants are potent in relieving pain in depression. However, a direct comparison of the effects of selective serotonergic and selective noradrenergic antidepressants on painful symptoms has not been investigated so far.

Method

Sixty patients who participated in the Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression study with a diagnosis of moderate or severe episodes of depression according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria were involved. All the participants were randomly allocated to receive nortriptyline or escitalopram. The severity of depression was measured using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The intensity of pain was measured on the Visual Analog Scale at the same points of the study.

Results

At "week 0", 83.3% of the patients later randomized to treatment with escitalopram and 86.7% of those treated with nortriptyline reported at least one painful symptom. A significant decrease of pain intensity was observed after 2 weeks of treatment. The two groups did not differ in degree of pain reduction at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 in comparison to baseline values. A 50% reduction in pain intensity preceded the 50% reduction of depression severity. The intensity of pain at "week 0" did not differ in remitted or nonremitted patients at week 8.

Conclusion

Both selective serotonergic and selective noradrenergic antidepressants are equally effective in alleviations of painful physical symptoms of depression. The presence of painful symptoms before the onset of treatment did not determine the final response.

### Suicidal ideation during treatment of depression with escitalopram and nortriptyline in genome-based therapeutic drugs for depression (GENDEP): a clinical trial [^2c651fbf]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

Sample and study design

The sample comprised 811 subjects with major depressive disorder taking part in GENDEP, a partially randomised multicentre clinical and pharmacogenomic study. Participants were included if they met criteria for a major depressive episode of at least moderate severity, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV) and International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) criteria, established using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, version 2.1). Patients with no contraindications were randomly allocated to receive flexible dosage nortriptyline (50 to 150 mg daily) or escitalopram (10 to 30 mg daily) for 12 weeks. Patients with contraindications for one of the drugs were allocated non-randomly to the other antidepressant. Participants who could not tolerate the initially allocated medication or who did not experience sufficient improvement despite adequate dosage for 8 weeks were offered a change to the other medication. Participants who changed medication were then followed-up using the same protocol as for the first antidepressant. All subjects were of European ethnicity and between 18 and 72 years of age. The exclusion criteria were: a first-degree relative with bipolar affective disorder or schizophrenia, a history of hypomanic or manic episode, mood incongruent psychotic symptoms, primary substance misuse or primary organic disease, current treatment with an antipsychotic or a mood stabilizer, and pregnancy or lactation. A total of 15 subjects who had missing data on all three suicidality items at baseline were excluded.

The study protocol was approved by research ethics committees in each centre. After describing the study to the subjects, written informed consent was obtained. The GENDEP trial is registered at EudraCT (no. 2004-001723-38) and ISRCTN (no. 03693000).

### Six months of treatment for depression: outcome and predictors of the course of illness [^13d8537a]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The goals of this study were to determine the course of illness in a cohort of depressed patients undergoing treatment for 6 months and whether there are clinically useful predictors of their course of illness.

Method

A cohort of 175 depressed outpatients undergoing drug treatment were followed prospectively for 6 months. Patients were initially randomly assigned to fluoxetine or nortriptyline. Those who responded were encouraged to continue taking their drugs for the 6 months. Those who did not were switched to other drugs or drug combinations.

Results

Of the 175 patients, 101 (58%) had a good outcome (achieved recovery and remained well), 54 (31%) had a fluctuating outcome (achieved recovery or remission but suffered a relapse or recurrence), and 20 (11%) had a poor outcome (remained depressed for the 6 months). Factors predicting good outcome included early response and a low level of schizoid personality disorder symptoms, and variables predicting poor outcome included a high score for harm avoidance and the absence of an early response.

Conclusions

Depression is a recurring and chronic disorder. Personality factors such as a high harm avoidance score and schizoid traits were associated with a worse outcome, but demographic features, depression characteristics, depression subtypes, and comorbidity were not. Early response was strongly associated with the course of illness, but none of these features added significantly to the clinicians' ability to predict outcome.

### Inhibition of cytochrome P4502D6 activity with paroxetine normalizes the ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype as measured by nortriptyline pharmacokinetics and the debrisoquin test [^6df8cd24]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype of the cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme has been considered a relevant cause of nonresponse to antidepressant drug therapy. Prescribing high doses of antidepressants to such patients leads to high concentrations of potentially toxic metabolites and an increased risk for adverse reactions. Normalization of the metabolic status of ultrarapid metabolizers by inhibition of CYP2D6 activity could offer a clinically acceptable method to successfully treat such patients with antidepressants.

Methods

Five ultrarapid metabolizers with a CYP2D6 gene duplication or triplication were treated with 25 mg nortriptyline twice a day for 3 consecutive weeks, alone during the first week and concomitantly with the CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine 10 mg or 20 mg twice a day, respectively, during the second and third weeks. After the third week, nortriptyline was discontinued and the subjects were treated with paroxetine 20 mg twice a day during the fourth study week. At the end of each study week, the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of nortriptyline or paroxetine were determined within the dose interval. In addition, the CYP2D6 phenotype was determined by debrisoquin (INN, debrisoquine) test at baseline and at the end of each study phase. Treatment-related adverse events were recorded during drug administration and for 1 week thereafter.

Results

All 5 subjects had very low (subtherapeutic) nortriptyline concentrations after 7 days' treatment with nortriptyline only. Addition of paroxetine 10 mg twice a day to the nortriptyline regimen resulted in a change in all individuals to the "normal" extensive debrisoquine metabolizer phenotype, and therapeutic plasma nortriptyline concentrations were achieved in 4 of 5 subjects after a 3 times mean increase in nortriptyline trough concentration (P = 0.0011). Doubling the paroxetine dose caused a 15 times mean increase in paroxetine trough concentration (P < .001), indicating strong inhibition by paroxetine of its own metabolism. The high paroxetine concentrations in 2 subjects caused them to have the poor debrisoquine metabolizer phenotype and resulted in a further increase in plasma nortriptyline trough concentration (P = 0.0099). A strong correlation (rank correlation coefficient [r(s)] = 0.89; P < .0001) was observed between paroxetine and nortriptyline trough concentrations. Paroxetine also significantly decreased the fluctuation of nortriptyline concentrations within the dose interval. One subject discontinued the study after the second study week because of adverse effects; otherwise, the study drugs were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Paroxetine, with a daily dosage from 20 to 40 mg, is an effective tool in normalizing the metabolic status of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers.

### Trajectories of suicidal ideation during 12 weeks of escitalopram or nortriptyline antidepressant treatment among 811 patients with major depressive disorder [^2973807d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Suicidal ideation is a frequent and difficult-to-treat clinical challenge among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, little is known regarding the differential development during antidepressant treatment and whether some patients may suffer from persistent suicidal ideation.

Methods

Among 811 patients with Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN)-verified MDD from 2004–2007 assessed weekly for 12 weeks of escitalopram or nortriptyline antidepressant treatment, we applied item response theory to integrate a suicidality score based on 3 rating scales. We performed latent growth mixture modeling analysis to empirically identify trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression analyses estimated associations with potential predictors.

Results

We identified 5 distinct classes of suicidal ideation. The Persistent-low class (53.7%) showed no suicidal ideation whereas the Persistent-high class (9.8%) had high suicidal ideation throughout 12 weeks. Two classes showed a fluctuating course: the Fluctuating class (5.2%) ended at a low level of suicidal ideation, whereas the Slow-response-relapse class (4.8%) initially responded slowly but then experienced a large increase to a high level of suicidal ideation after 12 weeks. The Fast-response class (26.5%) had a high baseline severity similar to the Persistent-high class but responded quickly within a few weeks and remained at a low level. Previous suicide attempts and higher mood symptom severity were associated with worse suicidal ideation trajectories, whereas living with a partner showed a trend toward better response.

Conclusion

Approximately 1 of 5 patients with MDD showed high or fluctuating suicidal ideation despite antidepressant treatment. Studies should investigate whether suicidal ideation may persist for longer periods and more targeted treatment possibilities.

### Pharmacogenomic testing for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 in cyclic vomiting syndrome [^09de9b88]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Amitriptyline (AT) is recommended as first-line prophylactic therapy in patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). However, significant side effects limit its use and dosing is based on trial and error. Though the Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium (CPIC) Guidelines recommend dosing for AT based on CY2D6 and CYP2C19 genotype profile, this is not followed in clinical practice.

Methods

This pilot study determined CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotypes and ascertained its association with adverse drug reactions (ADRs), clinical response, and serum concentration of AT and nortriptyline in a well-characterized cohort of adults with CVS.

Key Results

Of 46 subjects with CVS, age 33 ± 12years, 61% female, 85% Caucasian, a third (33%) had normal CYP2C19 metabolizer status, while 4% were poor, and 43% were ultrarapid metabolizers. Most (61%) had normal CYP2D6 genotype while 9% were poor and 2% were ultra-rapid metabolizers. There was no statistically significant association between genotype and ADRs, clinical response or serum drug concentration. There was a trend towards significance between genotype and clinical response, with 64% of responders having normal CYP2D6 metabolism versus 36% of nonresponders (p = 0.06). ADRs were encountered in 46% of patients with 28% discontinuing the medication as a result.

Conclusions and Inferences

A subset of patients with CVS have dysfunctional alleles of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. Larger prospective studies to evaluate the clinical impact of pharmacogenomic testing in CVS are needed. This has the potential to optimize clinical management, predict ADRs and allow for personalized therapy.

### Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes and dosing of tricyclic antidepressants [^92d897c1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Polymorphisms in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 affect the efficacy and safety of tricyclics, with some drugs being affected by CYP2D6 only, and others by both polymorphic enzymes. Amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and trimipramine are demethylated by CYP2C19 to pharmacologically active metabolites. These drugs and their metabolites, along with desipramine and nortriptyline, undergo hydroxylation by CYP2D6 to less active metabolites. Evidence from published literature is presented for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotype-directed dosing of tricyclic antidepressants.

### The importance of catastrophizing for successful pharmacological treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain [^e088bd66]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Inclusion criteria consisted of: ≥ 18 years of age; diagnosis of peripheral polyneuropathy with associated NeP; ≥ 6 months duration of NeP; NeP severity was ≥ 4 on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with severity enough to require the prescription of a first-line pharmacological agent; patient agreement to attend scheduled clinical appointments in 3 and 6 months' time; and completion of informed consent. Exclusion criteria consisted of: diagnosis of another cause of NeP other than peripheral polyneuropathy; current use of a first-line pharmacotherapy or prior use of all possible first-line pharmacotherapies; presence of other serious health concerns that may have interfered with the follow-up visits; inability to provide information assessed in questionnaires due to language or cognitive issues; and presence of another cause of chronic pain of greater severity than that of NeP due to peripheral polyneuropathy which could interfere with assessments. Patients with concurrent tolerable musculoskeletal pain, such as with osteoarthritis, were not excluded if in the opinion of the investigator this condition would not be expected to interfere with data collection and follow-up visits.

Pharmacotherapy intervention

Following completion of questionnaires at the baseline visit, prescription of a first-line NeP pharmacotherapy (amitriptline, nortriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin) occurred using the Canadian Pain Society Consensus Statement and Guidelines. The medication was selected by the physician and patient through consensus after accounting for the patients' demographics and comorbidities. There were no attempts to use one of these first-line agents more than any other agent. If a patient had already received or was intolerant to each of the four medications (and the two classes of medications [tricyclic antidepressants or gabapentinoids]), then that patient was excluded from further study. For patients where at least one of these medications had been previously attempted, only those first-line medications for which the patient was naïve were considered. Dosing of the selected agent took place on an individual basis based upon pain severity, comorbidities, body weight, age, and other potential factors. Regular use of pharmacotherapy for the 6 months preceding the last follow-up visit was recorded.

In the current review, we included two placebo comparisons from Atkinson of maprotiline, and paroxetine, which we respectively refer to in our analysis as Atkinson. We included three placebo comparisons from Atkinson of desipramine < 60 ng/mL (analysis: Atkinson), desipramine > 60 ng/mL (analysis: Atkinson) and fluoxetine (analysis: Atkinson).

All studies included patients because they had back pain, but only one study explicitly selected low-back patients with significant depressive symptoms. Three studies excluded patients with major depression, and in one study it was unclear if patients were depressed or not.

Several types of antidepressants were investigated: tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, and 'atypical' antidepressants (e.g. aminoketone antidepressants). Most studies evaluated the effectiveness of TCAs with noradrenergic (maprotiline, nortriptyline, desipramine). Three studies evaluated a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine, fluoxetine) and one study investigated 'atypical' antidepressants, bupropion (aminoketone antidepressant). While two trials used an active placebo (i.e. preparation containing substances that mimic the adverse effects of antidepressants), the other trials used an inert placebo. In all studies patients were allowed to continue regular medication (e.g. aspirin, NSAIDs), although opioids were usually not allowed. One study reported little or no information on additional medication.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of chronic gastrointestinal pain in disorders of gut-brain interaction: expert review [^1d53f8e6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Gut–brain neuromodulators dosing and side effects (Table 2) — Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline start at 10 mg at night and are titrated by 10 mg/wk or 10 mg/fortnight according to response and tolerability to a maximum of 30–50 mg at night, with common side effects of sedation, dry eyes, dry mouth, and constipation. Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine start at 30 mg once daily and are titrated according to response and tolerability to a maximum of 60 mg once daily, with side effects including sedation, dry mouth, constipation or diarrhea, anxiety, reduced appetite, nausea, headache, and fatigue. Mirtazapine starts at 15 mg once daily and is titrated according to response and tolerability to a maximum of 45 mg once daily, with side effects including sleep disorders, constipation or diarrhea, anxiety, increased appetite and weight gain, nausea, headache, and fatigue; note that secondary amines include desipramine and nortriptyline, tertiary amines include amitriptyline and imipramine, and secondary amines may have fewer anticholinergic side effects than tertiary amines.

VA/DoD CMI guideline evidence appraisal and recommendation — The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence and considered the 2014 CMI CPG, concluding this is a Reviewed, New-replaced recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. In one analysis, tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) benefits were no longer statistically significant when limited to studies with ≥ 50 patients per treatment group, and the population studied was predominantly female with indirectness as the population had FMS and not CMI. The benefits to pain relief and improvements in QoL outweighed AEs except for amitriptyline, which had more AEs than placebo but most were mild. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^9b3445a6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

If an antidepressant agent is warranted and there is no cognitive impairment, SSRIs or TCAs can be considered as first-line therapy. The TCAs inhibit reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, serotonin. The TCAs also possess alpha-adrenergic antagonist, antimuscarinic, and antihistaminic properties. Almost all TCAs — amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, and nortriptyline (with the exception of doxepine) — have been demonstrated to be potent antidepressants in randomized controlled trials involving patients with PD. The secondary amine TCAs (e.g. desipramine and nortriptyline) are preferred due to better tolerability over the tertiary TCAs. Desipramine and imipramine improved motor symptoms of PD as well as mood. In a subset of patients, such as those with hypersalivation or overactive bladder, the antimuscarinic activity of TCAs may be of additional clinical benefit. Sedating TCAs may be helpful for the treatment of depression with insomnia. Anticholinergic properties of TCAs limit their use in PD patients with existing or emerging cognitive dysfunction. Although infrequent, the TCAs have the potential to induce cardiac conduction disturbances, and obtaining a baseline electrocardiogram prior to treatment initiation is recommended for best practice.

If the use of a TCA is limited or contra-indicated due to cognitive impairment, comorbid medical conditions, or treatment-emergent adverse effects, SSRIs can be considered as first-line treatment. In a 30-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, desipramine and citalopram both improved depressive symptoms compared with placebo. In practice, SSRIs are well tolerated and with the exception of tremor, which is occasionally induced by SSRIs. They rarely exacerbate PD motor symptoms. In uncontrolled studies, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline were similarly effective for the treatment of depression in PD. Among the SSRIs, citalopram and sertraline are preferred due to efficacy results, tolerability, and low drug-drug interaction potential. Paroxetine is a less favorable choice due to its profile of side effects and the observations that it failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in some randomized trials.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^d6efc3a1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants — functional abdominal pain (FAP) and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) — have reported benefits across drug classes. Tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and monoamine uptake inhibitors show improvement of functional GI symptoms in published reports, and in adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) without comorbid depression, SSRI treatment reported decreased abdominal pain and bloating with increased overall well-being. In pediatrics, an open-label 12-week flexible dose study of subjects 7−18 years old found 84% improved function with decreased pain and associated symptoms; open-label data also report efficacy greater than propranolol and cyproheptadine in 50% to 60% of children, and amitriptyline data show 80% of children had a > 50% improvement over 8 to 10 weeks. Safety notes include that nortriptyline has an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias and SSRIs have not been adequately studied in the pediatric population. When prescribing these agents to children and adolescents, it is recommended to provide appropriate information regarding depression and suicidal ideation for patients and families, and an FDA-cited statement reports increased spontaneous reports of suicidal thoughts and/or behavior without evidence these lead to an increased risk of suicide.

Drug metabolism

Once administered, pharmacologic agents undergo several phases of metabolism to change their therapeutic activity and eventually facilitate excretion. Phase I metabolism generally increases hydrosolubility of molecules via enzymatic reactions. The CYP enzymes are responsible for about 75% of these reactions and catalyze oxidative reactions including hydroxylation, epoxidation, dealkylation, deamination, and dehalogenation.

Polymorphisms in CYP enzymes can alter the functions of these enzymes, leading to different rates of drug metabolism and subsequent differences in drug tolerance among individuals, changing both therapeutic and toxicity thresholds. 'Ultrarapid metabolizers' have no drug response at normal doses (nonresponders); 'extensive metabolizers' have expected response to standard doses (normal); 'intermediate metabolizers' have slight increased response and increased toxicity to standard doses; 'poor metabolizers' have slow, to no, drug metabolism, leading to high drug levels at standard doses and higher risk for drug toxicity.

Notably, if the medication administered is in the form of a prodrug which requires metabolism for activation, then the impact of polymorphisms is opposite that of above. Ultrarapid metabolizers will have increased drug levels given increased levels of activation whereas poor metabolizers will have low to no levels of active drug. It is estimated in population studies that ultrarapid and poor metabolizers each constitute 8% of the population. As these subgroups have the greatest risk of aberrant drug behavior, it follows that pharmacogenomics are likely to be clinically relevant in less than 20% of the population. Generally, intermediate metabolizers may require dose adjustment if optimal response is not achieved with the recommended dose, but one does not expect negative clinical consequences.

Several of the CYP enzymes responsible for phase I metabolism are important in drug metabolism in FGIDs.

CYP2D6 and the central neuromodulators

The CYP2D6 enzyme has more than 100 genetic variations, with both functional and non-functional alleles. CYP2D6 is responsible for metabolism of antidepressants including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), both of which are frequently used for management of pain modulation in treatment of FGIDs. The number of functional CYP2D6 genes has been shown to be correlated with the metabolism of nortriptyline, a TCA. How this translates to therapeutic response in FGID treatment needs to be studied further, but suggests that choice of therapy for improvement of pain control in these patients could be tailored to maximize drug efficacy depending on an individual patient's pharmacogenomics.

### Committee opinion No 673: persistent vulvar pain [^8e75e0bb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Persistent vulvar pain — amitriptyline and gabapentin dosing and tapering are described as follows: Amitriptyline "often is used as a first-line agent beginning at an oral dose of 5–25 mg nightly and increased by 10–25 mg each week, generally not to exceed a total of 150 mg daily", and "if cessation is necessary, tricyclic antidepressants should not be stopped suddenly; weaning the patient by 10–25 mg every few days is indicated". For gabapentin, dosage "can be increased over time from 300 mg total daily to a maximum dose of 3,600 mg daily (1,200 mg by mouth three times a day)", and it "is the most studied and used anticonvulsant for vulvodynia".

### Management of chronic multisymptom illness: synopsis of the 2021 US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guideline [^81cee771]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — Amitriptyline dosing in adults is 10–50 mg/d with an adequate trial of 6–8 weeks; use lower doses in the elderly; and while no dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment are provided in manufacturers labeling, some experts recommend reducing initial and maintenance doses by 50% in patients with hepatic impairment. Notable adverse effects include dry mouth, fatigue, sedation, vasovagal reaction, orthostatic hypotension, constipation, urinary retention, QTc prolongation; conduction abnormalities, suicidal ideation, and discontinuation syndrome. Comments include contraindicated with MAOIs and within 14 days of starting or stopping MAOIs, contraindicated with cisapride, avoid use with QTc prolonging drugs, anticholinergics, use with caution in patients with cardio- or cerebrovascular disease, and there is currently no evidence to support the use of TCAs in patients with ME/CFS; further, there may be an increased risk (i.e., for suicidality) with the use of TCAs depending on a patient's comorbidities.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^06a3d785]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Tension-type headache preventive therapy — We suggest amitriptyline for the prevention of chronic tension-type headache. (Weak for | Reviewed, Not changed) An SR of three RCTs examined amitriptyline (50 mg and 100 mg dosing) versus placebo in chronic TTH and found a reduction of monthly headache days after 4 weeks of 6.2 fewer days per month than placebo (95% CI: -8.1 to -4.2), with similar findings at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. Caution should be used in patients 65 years of age and older because of anticholinergic effects, and regardless of cardiac history, it is recommended that any patients at higher risk for cardiac arrhythmias consult with a cardiologist. Although the risk of overdose can occur with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), the rate of hospitalization is greater with TCAs because of a narrower therapeutic index; when more than 10 mg/kg of a TCA is ingested, mild to moderate poisoning occurs with severe anticholinergic effects, and when more than 15–20 mg/kg is ingested (> 1000mg, versus clinical dose of 10–20mg), the patient will present with the symptoms of severe poisoning, including coma, seizure, cardiac arrhythmias, and death; risk of serotonin syndrome is present when amitriptyline is combined with other serotonergic medications, and all antidepressants carry the boxed warning of increased risk of suicidality in children, adolescents, and young adults.

### A qualitative evaluation of the oncologists', neurologists', and pain specialists' views on the management and care of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in the Netherlands [^301e908d]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Theme 2: Assessment

All oncologists perform a brief (verbal) screening on pre-existing peripheral neuropathy and risk factors before each chemotherapy cycle, sometimes referring to a neurologist when present (quote 14). Reporting CIPN symptoms is actively encouraged, improving follow-up, and thus detecting neurotoxicity earlier (quotes 15–16). For CIPN grading, the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCae) is used, most commonly when further assessing symptoms (14) (quotes 17–18, 24–25). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) questionnaires are only used in the context of clinical studies (quotes 19–20). In uncertainty, consulting a neurologist and change in chemotherapy-regimen are considered (quotes 26–28).

Follow-up regarding side effects differs after adjuvant chemotherapy (mainly by the surgeon) and after chemotherapy in metastasized disease (mainly by the oncologist), for patients with severe symptoms of CIPN and in a palliative setting (the oncologist or nurse practitioner) (quotes 21–23).

Theme 3: Therapy

Symptomatic treatment is usually started for pain and/or poor sleep quality, using amitriptyline, nortriptyline, pregabalin, and gabapentin, but not duloxetine (quotes 29–31). Because of side effects or insufficient effect, half the patients stop taking this medication in time (quote 34). Non-pharmacological advice is practical and involves foot care, avoidance of painful stimuli (e.g. cold prevention), or support in coping (quotes 35–36).

Reduced initiation doses are a strategy in pre-existing peripheral neuropathy or in a distinct wish to preserve fine motor skills. Complex cases are discussed among colleagues (quotes 37–39). Later dose reduction is usually protocolized, 25% (in neurotoxicity grade ≥ 2) up to 50% (quote 40), and determined by chemotherapy goal (adjuvant or palliative, impact on survival) or pre-existing neuropathies. Side effects are accepted as being (partially) inevitable, and thus must be embedded in the informed consent (quotes 41–45).

### A qualitative evaluation of the oncologists', neurologists', and pain specialists' views on the management and care of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in the Netherlands [^1b0ec219]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Theme 3: Treatment (in)possibilities

Pregabalin is the first choice for all but one, followed by tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or duloxetine (parallel made with diabetic polyneuropathy) with no apparent preference. Nortriptyline is generally preferred over amitriptyline because of its side effects profile. In case of a circumscribed area of pain, capsaicin is used. Gabapentin, cannabinoids, other topical drugs, and opioids are incidentally prescribed.

Essential and individual patient education (on pain), coaching, self-sustainability, and recommending physical activity are sometimes reinforced by rehabilitation (daily problems and suffering), physical, occupational, and/or psychological therapy (anxiety and depression symptoms) (quote 68). This concerns existential issues, managing chronic disease and cancer, acceptance, and "creating a positive vicious circle" (quote 69). However, there is a shared frustration in seeing patients, having (had) cancer treated, now being disabled consequently, without sufficient treatment results.

By not thinking: 'everything is always so painful', but being active, keeping up activities, finding distraction and creating something of a positive vicious circle. Trying to improve energy levels, experiencing success, alleviating the experienced burden. How do you cope with pain, which probably will not fade away totally, an aspect you should give attention to, improving acceptance, and probably giving space for improvements with our treatments (quote 69).

Theme 4: Socio-environmental aspects

Social and work-related issues are mentioned as a reason for further diagnostic efforts, although not yielding more therapeutic options (quote 70).

Most statements overlap with "theme 3 – treatment (im)possibilities". The strategy in starting and increasing medication, coaching, creating options for self-sustainability, and weighing effects versus side effects are stated to be key in treatment success and patient satisfaction.

Theme 5: Diagnostic conundrums

In patients with pain, anamnesis (regarding any temporal relationship with chemotherapy cycles, distribution, comorbidities) combined with (specific) physical examination is regarded as sufficient by most. EMG is used in specific cases, regarded of little value in diagnosis and even less in predicting CIPN evolution. Questionnaires are not used. Interviewees are generally reluctant towards statements on the course of CIPN, especially in less used or newer chemotherapeutic agents, underlining the uncertain course and final state. (See also above "Theme 3".).

### Genitofemoral neuralgia: adding to the burden of chronic vulvar pain [^194a359e]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Additionally, imaging of the pelvis was conducted through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereby T1-, T2- and proton density-weighted sequences were obtained, though no anomalies could be documented.

Initial pain relief was procured through application of a 5% lidocaine patch fit to the right labium majus and left in place during daytime for 12 hours a day. While providing some attenuation of pain during the day, the patient continued to experience severely disturbed sleep. Nortriptyline at a daily dose of 25 mg was ill-tolerated without any effect on vulvar pain. Venlafaxine was slowly titrated, starting with a dose of 37.5 mg and adding up in increments of 37.5 mg per day at intervals of 7 days, until a daily dose of 150 mg was reached. While reporting mild side effects of vivid dreaming and increased transpiration, the patient experienced rapid improvement of vulvar pain, which allowed her to resume normal sleep at night, after 2 years of sleep deprivation. She gradually tapered off use of the lidocaine patch and reported that she no longer experienced vulvar discomfort during activities of daily life. In view of the side effects under venlafaxine, the treatment regimen was changed to duloxetine 60 mg a day, resulting in disappearance of the side effects, while maintaining optimal pain relief of the vulva. Discomfort over the right thigh, primarily described as itching rather than burning, did persist however, for which we initiated a compounded topical gabapentin cream in a 6% concentration formulated in a nonionic cream, resulting in significant relief of discomfort over the right thigh. At some point in time during follow-up, the patient reported a slight but hindering exacerbation of vulvar pain under duloxetine. Careful history taking revealed that the pain reoccurred following a bicycle day trip, and the patient was therefore instructed on vulvar care with emphasis on limiting vulvar mechanical strain as a known aggravating factor. One year after initial assessment, the patient remains pain free under continued treatment with duloxetine orally 60 mg a day and 6% gabapentin cream applied twice daily. For this kind of approach or publication, Ghent University Hospital Institutional Review Board approval was not deemed necessary by our institution. Written informed consent from the patient was obtained.

### Myofascial pain syndrome: an update on clinical characteristics, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^4f4d7ae3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1.2 Antidepressants

7.1.2.1 Tricyclic Antidepressants

Amitriptyline and nortriptyline are tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) commonly used in chronic pain management for their analgesic effects, achieved by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, which enhances descending pain modulation pathways. One RCT reported significant improvements in myofascial tenderness and headache intensity with amitriptyline compared to placebo in patients with chronic tension‐type headaches. Another clinical trial on MPS and TMJD found significant pain reductions at 6 weeks and 1 year with amitriptyline use, although the effect diminished over time, and no improvement was observed in depression scores. An observational study reported clinically meaningful pain reductions for both amitriptyline and nortriptyline in patients with masticatory myofascial pain, with nortriptyline showing slightly greater efficacy. While amitriptyline and nortriptyline have shown short‐ to medium‐term benefits in reducing pain for MPS patients, there is insufficient evidence to determine their long‐term effectiveness.

7.1.2.2 Serotonergic Modulators

Citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), increases serotonin availability by blocking its reuptake, potentially modulating pain perception through its effects on neurotransmission in the central nervous system. However, an RCT in patients with chronic tension‐type headaches found no significant differences between citalopram and placebo in reducing myofascial tenderness, headache intensity, or PPT.

Sumatriptan, a 5‐HT1B/1D receptor agonist used for its vasoconstrictive and pain‐modulating effects, showed limited effectiveness in a crossover pilot study on temporalis muscle MPS, with no significant differences observed compared to placebo.

Tropisetron, traditionally used to manage chemotherapy‐induced nausea, has demonstrated potential analgesic effects in musculoskeletal pain by inhibiting the release of substance P and neuropeptides from nociceptors. An RCT found that local trigger‐point injections of tropisetron significantly reduced pain intensity compared to baseline at 7 days post‐injection.

There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of citalopram, sumatriptan, or tropisetron for managing MPS, as limited RCTs show no significant improvements in outcomes compared to placebo.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS): is there a difference based on onset of symptoms – pediatric versus adult? [^ffa63967]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Data collection

Demographic characteristics including age, gender, race, geographic location, personal and family history of all patients were collected at the time of initial evaluation with a standard questionnaire that was completed by patients prior to their appointment. This was then reviewed at the time of the initial clinic visit and information was confirmed. Data was collected on disease characteristics such as duration and severity of disease, age of onset, delay in diagnosis, specific triggers, associated co-morbid conditions, history of marijuana use and number of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. Medications used as prophylactic therapy in CVS including tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline, anti-epileptics such as topiramate and mitochondrial supplements such as coenzyme Q-10, L-carnitine, and riboflavin were recorded. Adverse effects of medications, response to treatment, disability and job loss due to CVS were ascertained. Data was collected on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet; most of the variables were in a categorical format with some data such as number of ED visits and hospitalizations recorded as continuous variables. Data was collected as per the historical recollection of the patient with supplementation from previous medical records. The patients were divided based on time of onset of symptoms (pediatric-onset and adult-onset) and response to therapy. This study was approved by Institutional Review Board at the Medical College of Wisconsin.

All patients seen in our clinic were asked standard questions about the frequency, duration and severity of episodes. Complete response to therapy was defined as ≥ 80% amelioration in symptom duration, frequency and severity and partial response was at least a 50–80% reduction. Non-responders had either no change in their disease status or < 50% reduction in symptom duration, frequency and severity. Patients were deemed compliant if they reported taking their prescribed medications and either discontinued or reduced their marijuana intake significantly. Cessation of marijuana use was not verified routinely with a drug screen.

### Guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association [^87a9d5db]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

The mean effective dose in adults is 75‐100 mg daily or 1‐1.5 mg/kg body weight. 3, 15, 28 Amitriptyline is best titrated in 10‐25 mg increments as this improves tolerability by allowing adaptation to and preventing discontinuation from side effects, particularly daytime sedation. This improves the ultimate efficacy of the medication. Most of the panelists used 10 mg but some used 25 mg. As always, this needs to be individualized based upon the patient response. The incidence of side effects with AT varies from 9% to 25% although this did not result in discontinuation of the drug in most studies. 19 Side effects include daytime sedation, weight gain, dryness of mouth, and constipation. The night‐time administration of AT can often promote sleep, whereas the lingering daytime sedation tends to improve or resolve in 8‐12 weeks. Though most studies have only evaluated AT, NT may be used alternatively to minimize side effects. Given the risk of prolongation of the QTc interval and cardiac arrhythmias, we recommend obtaining an EKG at baseline, once during titration at ~50 mg and after the target dose is reached. More frequent monitoring will vary between individual patients, based on their response to AT and concomitant use of other medications that can prolong the QT interval. It is recommended that the QTc be maintained at < 470 msec for women and < 450 msec for men. The dosage of AT should be reduced or stopped if there is QTc prolongation or development of significant side effects. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias appears to be low, and no serious adverse events have been reported with its use in CVS. Serious psychiatric side effects such as psychotic reactions, hypomania, and delirium may occur with the treatment of depression with amitriptyline but are not reported in CVS, perhaps due to the higher doses typically used to treat the former. 29

### Use of nonrecommended drugs in patients with Brugada syndrome: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^efbaa67d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Nonrecommended Drugs During Follow‐Up

A total of 34.4% (93/270) patients with BrS were treated with any nonrecommended BrS drug during a median follow‐up of 6.8 years after they had been diagnosed with BrS. The most commonly first prescribed nonrecommended BrS drugs were tramadol (n = 44), fexofenadine (n = 18), metoclopramide (n = 14), and propranolol (n = 5), which are all drugs to preferably avoid. Other prescribed drugs to preferably avoid were verapamil, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and bupropion, all prescribed to ≤ 3 patients (Table 2). Four patients were treated with a drug to avoid as the first prescribed drug (lithium or nortriptyline), and a total of 8 patients were treated with 1 or more drugs to avoid (lithium, nortriptyline, amitriptyline, propafenone, flecainide, or cannabis) during follow‐up. A total of 90 patients were treated with drugs to preferably avoid. Twenty‐three patients (24.7%) were treated with ≥ 2 different nonrecommended BrS drugs during follow‐up. Of the 17 patients treated with nonrecommended drugs in the 90 days immediately before BrS diagnosis, 13 (76.5%) continued use of the same drug (n = 8) or were treated with other types of nonrecommended drugs (n = 5) after their BrS diagnosis.

### Suicidal ideation during treatment of depression with escitalopram and nortriptyline in genome-based therapeutic drugs for depression (GENDEP): a clinical trial [^a1c34c10]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Worsening of pre-existing suicidal ideation during treatment (TWOSI)

Of the 473 subjects who reported significant suicidal ideation at baseline, 197 (42%) qualified for TWOSI at some time during treatment. The highest rate of TWOSI (22%) was in the sixth week of treatment.

TWOSI was predicted by depression severity during the follow-up (OR = 3.28, 95% CI 2.49 to 4.32 for 1 SD increase in observed mood, P < 0.0001), history of suicide attempts (OR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.45, P = 0.015) and retirement (OR = 3.25, 95% CI 1.33 to 7.92, P = 0.009). Drug, changes in dosage, age, gender, age at depression onset, marital status, education or children did not significantly predict TWOSI. Randomisation status was significantly associated with TWOSI (P = 0.022). There was a drug by gender interaction (P < 0.0001) due to a higher risk of TWOSI in men taking nortriptyline than in men taking escitalopram (OR = 2.47, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.56, P = 0.004). A total of 43.4% (n = 33/76) of men taking nortriptyline had TWOSI compared to only 33.7% (n = 33/98) of those taking escitalopram. This interaction remained significant after adjustment for baseline severity of depression and severity of depression during the study. Subjects with TWOSI moved significantly more often to the second course of medication than participants without TWOSI (P < 0.0001).

Self-reported suicidal ideation

As the BDI scale correlated the least with our composite suicidal ideation score (0.77) and this was the only self-report questionnaire, we repeated all analyses with this scale alone. The results were very similar to the main findings and all coefficients were in the same direction.

Clinician-rated suicidal ideation

In order to compare our results to an established way of defining suicidal ideation, we repeated the analyses using the more stringent traditional cut-off of 2 on the third item of the HRSD-17. Although this analysis was slightly less efficient, all results were in the same direction with estimates within the 95% CIs of our main results and the gender by drug interaction remained significant (P = 0.045).

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^34a9e76a]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Role of pain modulators

Pain modulators include the gabapentanoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (TCI; eg, amitriptyline) and serotonin noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (SNRI; eg, duloxetine). Some indications that may be helpful to guide initial choice of therapy are listed in Table 3.

Table 3
Relative indications for choosing a specific pain modulator

Practical approach:
Amitriptyline: Start with 10 mg at night and if necessary escalate the dose weekly by 10–25 mg/day, up to a maximum dose of 50–150 mg/day. The usual dose for pain relief is 25–50 mg/day. Since the analgesic effect is independent of the mood-altering effect, the dose used for pain is lower than the antidepressant dose (100–300 mg).–
Pregabalin: Start low and titrate slowly according to tolerability, initially 25 mg at night, increasing by 25 mg increments every 3 days. Dosing is initially nocté, followed by higher doses, to a maximum daily dose of 300 mg, administered in two divided doses. Some patients prefer to take only a night-time dose.
Gabapentin: Start with a low dose (100–300 mg at bedtime or 100–300 mg three times daily). Because it has nonlinear pharmacokinetics, it requires slow and careful titration, increasing the dose by 100–300 mg three times daily every 1–7 days as tolerated. The maximum dose is 3600 mg per day in divided doses (1200 mg three times daily).
Duloxetine: Start with 30 mg and increase to 60 mg after 1 week. The dose may be increased to 120 mg/day (60 mg twice daily).

Patients with chronic pain have often been taking one of these medications in the past. Lack of efficacy may be consequent to inappropriate dosing or use of monotherapy. Dosing should be optimized and patients generally require combination therapy, which, in comparison with monotherapy, may be more effective and permit lower doses, with improvement in tolerability. However, the potential for additive adverse effects, increased risk of drug interactions and reduced adherence due to increasing complexity of dosing are also important considerations. Once the dose of a single agent has been stabilized at a therapeutic level, if response is not adequate after 2–4 weeks (and treatment is tolerable), then combination therapy may be considered, using any of the other classes of pain modulators.

Compliance should be assessed by asking the patient to bring all of their medications with them to each consultation.

### Combination treatment of neuropathic pain: Danish expert recommendations based on a Delphi process [^ce73d7f6]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Combination therapy with TCAs

Table 3 below presents the rating of the scientific evidence and clinical experience with combinations with TCAs. The combination therapy with pregabalin/gabapentin was described in the previous section and shown in Table 2.

The Delphi panel agreed that the evidence for the combination of TCAs and SNRIs was insufficient (CDC rating C) (Table 3). Although this combination is sometimes used in clinical practice, the overlapping side effect profile and the risk of serotonin syndrome makes this combination less useful.

For the combination of TCAs and SSRIs, moderate evidence was found against its use and the Delphi panel would not recommend it (CDC rating D). This combination imposes a high risk of serotonin syndrome.

The majority of the Delphi panel found that there is good evidence for the combination of TCAs and opioids (CDC rating I + B) (Table 3). The scientific evidence is, however, divergent, dependent on the type of NeP. Mercadante et aland Khoromi et alfound no additional effect of the combination for neuropathic cancer and lumbar pain, whereas in NeP of mixed causes, Gilron et alshowed a favorable effect (flexible maximum tolerable dose [MTD] 100 mg morphine per day plus flexible MTD 100 mg nortriptyline per day compared with monotherapy with each drug). Mean MTD dose (mg ± SEM) of nortriptyline was 83.9 ± 3.2 mg as monotherapy versus 60.2 ± 4.6 mg in combination. Mean MTD dose of morphine was 65.4 ± 4.3 mg as monotherapy versus 60.2 ± 4.6 mg in combination. The combination also led to fewer side effects than high-dose monotherapy. The combination of TCAs and opioids is frequently used by the experts.

### Continuous lumbar sympathetic blockade enhances the effect of lumbar sympatholysis on refractory diabetic neuropathy: a randomized controlled trial [^58e76c5f]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications of patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with an estimated prevalence in this patient population of approximately 30%. It is also a leading cause of morbidity and is associated with increased mortality. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy include loss of sensation, neuropathic pain, and paresthesia. The loss of sensation in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) may lead to ulcers, which is a major cause of amputation. Many of the symptoms of the neuropathy can last for years and severely impact the affected individual's quality of life.

The management and treatment of DPN remain challenging to both patients and clinicians. At the present time there is no satisfactory cure for the disease, and treatment strategy focuses on slowing the progress of the neuropathy, relieving pain, and managing complications. Patients are recommended to have a healthy eating plan and adopt a healthy life style to help keep the blood sugar level within a target range. Several medications are used to relieve pain, with first-line treatment options including tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, nortriptyline). Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine, or opiates and opiate analogs) may also be used if other first-line treatments are not successful. While a number of treatments are available, the overall outcomes of the current management are still not satisfactory, and new treatments of diabetic neuropathy are continuously being investigated.

More recently, non-pharmacological approaches, such as spinal cord stimulation, have been proposed to treat painful DPN. There have been reports that spinal cord stimulation can improve diabetic limb circulation blood flow and relieve neuropathic and ischemic pain. Improvement of the peripheral blood flow may be involved in the mechanism of the analgesic effect of spinal cord stimulation. In China, spinal cord stimulation for treating neuropathic pain is not in wide use due to the high cost of the treatment; as alternative, another non-pharmacological approach, lumbar sympathetic blockade, has received much interest. Lumbar sympathetic blockade has the advantage of being a minimally invasive technique, with patients usually having a quick recovery time. In addition, the treatment is affordable to the majority of patients. Although the technique has been available for a long time, its safety and outcomes in patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy have not been intensively studied. One case report suggested that sympathetic blocks can be an effective management of painful diabetic neuropathy.

### Suicidal ideation during treatment of depression with escitalopram and nortriptyline in genome-based therapeutic drugs for depression (GENDEP): a clinical trial [^e7966842]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Results

Sample baseline characteristics

Figure 1 displays the flow of participants throughout the study. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the 323 non-suicidal subjects and the 473 suicidal subjects are shown in Table 4. Subjects who reported suicidal ideation at baseline had more severe depression (0.75 (0.54) versus 1.06 (0.59), P < 0.0001). More subjects with suicidal ideation at baseline reported a history of suicide attempts than individuals without suicidal ideation at baseline (19.3% versus 6.3%, P < 0.0001).

Flow of participants throughout the study.

Suicidality-related adverse events

Among those reporting significant suicidal ideation at baseline, two women (44 and 34 years old) randomised to escitalopram were admitted to hospital owing to suicidal ideation during the course of the study. Among those with no significant baseline suicidal ideation, a 55-year-old woman randomised to nortriptyline committed suicide in the ninth week of treatment. In the following analyses, these subjects were considered as having an increase of more than 1 SD at the time of dropout. Based on a score of four on the third item of the HRSD-17, and as shown in Table 3, eight individuals reported a suicide attempt, all of them at baseline. Only one of them also reported a suicide attempt during the first week of treatment.

Following the diagnosis of NUC, treatment was initiated with 25 g of intravenous sodium thiosulfate (STS) twice weekly for 2 weeks before the frequency was increased to thrice weekly. Wound cleansing and debridement were performed, and 90-minute sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy were started. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was discontinued after the fifth treatment due to patient-reported pain with hyperbaric oxygen sessions. After 18 weeks of STS therapy, the ulcer was fully healed (Fig 4). The frequency of STS therapy was reduced to once weekly for the next 2 months before discontinuation, given the cessation of disease activity. Although the ulcer had healed, the patient continued to experience pain of the inguinal folds, scrotum, and penile shaft. Alongside continued use of acetaminophen, nortriptyline 50 mg was prescribed for severe pain flares and tramadol 10 mg was prescribed for nightly use. The patient continues to be seen by the pain management clinic.

### Effect of CYP2C19 polymorphisms on antidepressant prescription patterns and treatment emergent mania in bipolar disorder [^5cd109ab]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

With respect to sertraline, we found that PM had a lower chance of early persistence, i.e. claiming a second dispense. However, this association was not significant in sensitivity analyses. We also found a lower risk of treatment discontinuation in patients with the CYP2C19 EM+ metabolic phenotype, an effect that persisted in some sensitivity analyses. This observation could indicate a lower rate of side effects that has not been described in previous studies. Although higher plasma concentration of sertraline has been reported in poor CYP2C19 metabolizers, there is scant evidence to suggest that CYP2C19 metabolic phenotypes affect treatment outcomes or adverse events.

The CPIC guideline recommends that tricyclics should be avoided in CYP2C19 ultra-rapid metabolizers. CYP2C19 metabolizes amitriptyline into the active metabolite nortriptyline, and clomipramine into the active metabolite desmethylclomipramine. The drug/metabolite ratio has been shown to differ based on CYP2C19 genotype. This might factor in on response and side effect profile due different effects of secondary amines such as nortryptiline. Here we present the first empirical evidence that this recommendation might extend to bipolar disorder. The rate of early persistence was lower among ultra-rapid metabolizers using clomipramine or amitriptyline. Although the association did not remain in sensitivity analyses, it suggests that CYP2C19 metabolic phenotypes might be of importance for early treatment discontinuation.

A biomarker that can predict manic switch when using antidepressants in bipolar disorder would be valuable. We found slower drug metabolism via CYP2C19 to be associated with a higher rate of manic episodes within 3 months after starting treatment with sertraline and with amitriptyline or clomipramine. It stands to reason that a slower metabolism with ensuing higher serum concentrations might be a risk factor for treatment emergent mania. By extension, this indicates a likely dose-response relationship between antidepressant dose and risk for treatment emergent mania. Interestingly, higher risk of treatment induced mania has previously been linked to poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, but data are limited. It should be noted that the although the results did replicate in sensitivity analyses, the event rate was low, the p-value close to 0.05, and was one among several other tested hypotheses. The finding should therefore be interpreted with caution. Future replication studies of adequate power might attempt to genotype both CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. It should be noted that these studies need be large given the low number events found in our study that amounted to 50 manic inpatient events during the first 3 months of 3484 sertraline treatments periods.

### Chronic pelvic pain: ACOG practice bulletin, number 218 [^0cd795e0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Neuropathic medications in chronic pelvic pain — Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended for patients with neuropathic chronic pelvic pain and can be prescribed by obstetrician–gynecologists; evidence from neuropathic pain trials shows benefit, including a systematic review of 37 double-blind randomized trials in which SNRIs and tricyclic antidepressants were superior to placebo with a number-needed-to-treat of 24 patients for one to experience a clinical improvement. Duloxetine is superior to placebo for neuropathic pain from diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia, whereas venlafaxine trials showed strong placebo effects and high potential for selection bias, and no published trials have established the efficacy of duloxetine or venlafaxine in chronic pelvic pain in women. Tricyclic antidepressants are commonly used but have only weak evidence of efficacy; a 2009 double blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) found gabapentin plus nortriptyline worked better than either alone for chronic neuropathic pain. Based on effectiveness in other neuropathic pain syndromes, gabapentin and pregabalin are recommended for neuropathic chronic pelvic pain and can be prescribed by obstetrician–gynecologists; neuropathic medications have a role once underlying visceral etiologies are addressed and a neuropathic component is diagnosed, many studies are not specific to chronic pelvic pain, and clinicians should assess for and treat concurrent myofascial dysfunction. Calcium channel alpha 2-delta ligand medications (gabapentin or pregabalin) are common treatments for chronic pelvic pain.

7.2 Effects of Valproate on Other Drugs

Valproate has been found to be a weak inhibitor of some P450 isozymes, epoxide hydrase, and glucuronyltransferases.

The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of valproate co-administration on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of several commonly prescribed medications. The list is not exhaustive, since new interactions are continuously being reported.

Drugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed

Amitriptyline/Nortriptyline

Administration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5 females) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21% decrease in plasma clearance of amitriptyline and a 34% decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline. Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received. Concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity. Monitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered for patients taking valproate concomitantly with amitriptyline. Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.

### The pharmacogenomics of pain management: prospects for personalized medicine [^22790b4c]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

CYP2D6

Located on chromosome 22q13.1, the gene encoding the enzyme CYP2D6 is one of the most widely investigated with relation to genetic polymorphism. It is responsible for the metabolism of around one-quarter of all currently marketed drugs, including common analgesics such as codeine, tramadol, and dihydrocodeine. Currently, more than 80 allelic variants have been reported for CYP2D6. A combination of polymorphisms, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), duplications, insertion/deletions, and/or gene conversions have been reported to affect CYP2D6 activity.

The phenotypic variation of CYP2D6 due to genetic polymorphism is well established. Depending on their CYP2D6 function, patients can be categorized into poor metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, or ultrarapid metabolizers. The function is directly related to the number of normal (wild-type) or abnormal alleles inherited. The distribution of the CYP2D6 phenotypes varies by ethnicity (Table 1), largely due to differences in inherited SNPs. For example, the CYP2D6✱4, CYP2D6✱10, and CYP2D6✱17 alleles have reduced activity and these alleles are expressed in a higher proportion, resulting in a higher incidence of poor metabolizer and intermediate metabolizer phenotypes.

Knowledge of a patient's CYP2D6 phenotype can guide appropriate analgesic dosage and reduce the number of adverse reactions (Table 2). There are many case reports citing examples where failure to recognize these phenotypes resulted in life-threatening adverse reactions.–Many of these cases involved the administration of codeine to ultrarapid metabolizers, who subsequently experienced respiratory or central nervous system depression. The pediatric population is known to be particularly susceptible. A recent case report documented respiratory depression in a pediatric ultrarapid metabolizer following the administration of tramadol, despite tramadol only being a partial opioid. In a study of dose adjustment of nortriptyline, a drug commonly prescribed in the management of chronic pain, it was calculated that the therapeutic dose for a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer would be tenfold less than for an ultrarapid metabolizer to achieve the same plasma levels.

### Antidepressants for preventing postnatal depression [^06c65537]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is common in the postnatal period and can lead to adverse effects on the infant and wider family, in addition to the morbidity for the mother. It is not clear whether antidepressants are effective for the prevention of postnatal depression and little is known about possible adverse effects for the mother and infant, particularly during breastfeeding. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2005.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antidepressant medication for the prevention of postnatal depression, in comparison with any other treatment, placebo or standard care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR ‒ both Studies and References), CENTRAL (Wiley), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), on 13 February 2018. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 13 February 2018 to identify any additional unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of initiation of antidepressants (alone or in combination with another treatment), compared with any other treatment, placebo or standard care for the prevention of postnatal depression among women who were either pregnant or had given birth in the previous six weeks and were not currently depressed at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We requested missing information from investigators wherever possible and sought data to allow intention-to-treat analyses.

Main Results

Two trials including a total of 81 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. All participants in both studies had a history of postnatal depression and were not taking antidepressant medication at baseline. Both trials were conducted by the same research group. Risk of bias was low or unclear in most domains for both studies. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis due to the small number of studies. One study compared nortriptyline with placebo and did not find any evidence that nortriptyline was effective in preventing postnatal depression. In this study, 23% (6/26) of women who took nortriptyline and 24% (6/25) of women who took placebo experienced postnatal depression (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.59, very low quality evidence) in the first 17 weeks postpartum. One woman taking nortriptyline developed mania; and one side effect, constipation, was more common among women taking nortriptyline than those taking placebo. The second study compared sertraline with placebo. In this study, 7% (1/14) of women who took sertraline developed postnatal depression in the first 17 weeks postpartum compared with 50% (4/8) of women who took placebo. It is uncertain whether sertraline reduces the risk of postnatal depression (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.07, very low quality evidence). One woman taking sertraline had a hypomanic episode. Two side effects (dizziness and drowsiness) were more common among women taking sertraline than women taking placebo. Conclusions are limited by the small number of studies, small sample sizes and incomplete outcome data due to study drop-out which may have led to bias in the results. We have assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low, based on the GRADE system. No data were available on secondary outcomes of interest including child development, the mother‒infant relationship, breastfeeding, maternal daily functioning, family relationships or maternal satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the limitations of the current evidence base, such as the low statistical power of the included studies, it is not possible to draw any clear conclusions about the effectiveness of antidepressants for the prevention of postnatal depression. It is striking that no new eligible trials have been completed in the period of over a decade since the last published version of this review. Larger trials are needed which include comparisons of antidepressant drugs with other prophylactic treatments (e.g. psychological interventions), and examine adverse effects for the fetus or infant. Future reviews in this area may benefit from broadening their focus to examine the effectiveness of antidepressants for the prevention of perinatal (i.e. antenatal or postnatal) depression, which could include studies comparing antidepressant discontinuation with continuation for the prevention of relapse of depression during pregnancy and the postnatal period.

### Cognitive remission: a novel objective for the treatment of major depression? [^a3283f32]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In adults with late-life MDD (n = 177), greater pretreatment verbal memory was associated with better treatment response. Conversely, in elderly subjects (age > 65 years; n = 58) with MDD, executive dysfunction was associated with increased risk of relapse after 16-week therapy with nortriptyline, as well as higher recurrence rates after a 2-year placebo-controlled maintenance phase. Subjects with late-onset depression (i.e. > 60 years old) are likely to experience increased impairment in verbal memory, processing speed, and executive function with respect to depressed adults. In particular, executive deficits in the elderly were found to correlate with increased residual symptomatology, higher recurrence rates, and worse response to antidepressant medication. However, a meta-analysis of 17 studies of late-life MDD indicated that better performance on tests of executive function (i.e. Dementia Rating Scale initiation and perseveration subtest) and non-executive function (including two tests of psychomotor speed, one test of construction, and one test of memory) is associated with response to antidepressant treatment. Thus, the authors concluded that specific cognitive deficits per se do not offer a reliable basis for making clinical judgments about probable illness course, in contrast to the depression-executive dysfunction model, according to which the occurrence of executive dysfunction portends poor response to antidepressant medication.

The confounding effect of age

The major caveat of studies showing the efficacy of antidepressant therapy in treating cognitive deficits is the over-representation of elderly subjects (age > 65 years) in the samples, which limits their external validity. Indeed, the effects of antidepressants on cognitive performance in the elderly are likely negatively influenced by the combined effects of comorbidities and a greater likelihood of side effects. Notwithstanding the paucity of data showing beneficial effects of antidepressants on cognitive performance in non-elderly adult subjects with MDD, converging evidence supports the assumption that the clinical magnitude of antidepressant effects is also small in this population. A systematic review showed that different antidepressant treatments induced smaller changes in measures of executive function and attention, despite clinically perceived changes in verbal learning, memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed. Thus, these factors might represent trait-like markers of MDD.

### German Society of Neurology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and affective disorders in people with Parkinson's disease: new spotlights on diagnostic procedures and non-pharmacological interventions [^c20d5411]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants with anticholinergic properties are associated with an increased risk of deterioration in cognitive function, triggering hallucinations or psychosis, increased constipation, and an increased cardiovascular risk, particularly in elderly and cognitively impaired PwPD, and should only be used with caution. The noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor desipramine demonstrates both efficiency as an antidepressant and a smaller anticholinergic and antihistaminic effect among TCAs. Desipramine is not commercially available in the EU but can be imported (as norpramine) from international pharmacies in drug dosages of 10, 25, 50, 100, or 150 mg. Nortriptyline, the TCA with the best data among PwPD, acts mainly as a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), in addition to its sedative effect due to its additional antagonization of H1 and 5-HT2A receptors. However, nortriptyline has a high affinity for antagonizing muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and, therefore, has a strong anticholinergic effect. In addition, there is a potential cardiotoxic effect due to the sodium or calcium channel blocking action of nortriptyline, so its use can be problematic in PwPD. SSRIs (citalopram) and SNRIs (slow-release venlafaxine) have demonstrated antidepressant effects in clinical trials and may have less side effects compared with TCAs. The combination of an SSRI with an irreversible monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor like selegiline is not recommended because of the risk of developing serotonergic syndrome. The use of trazodone as a dual-acting serotonergic agent, with its presynaptic inhibition of serotonin reuptake and postsynaptic blockade of 5-HT2A receptors, strong affinity for central alpha-1 receptors, weak antagonistic affinity for H1 receptors, and lack of anticholinergic activity, also appears feasible in the treatment of depression in PwPD. Trazodone has a sedative effect that may be beneficial in PwPD with sleep problems. Given the limited clinical data, though, trazodone is a second-line recommendation.

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias).

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

Falls

Perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

Regarding medical management for medication overuse headache, more specifically with respect to discontinuation of overused medication, advice, EAN 2020 guidelines recommend to provide advice alone as an initial treatment approach in patients overusing triptans or simple analgesics and not having major psychiatric comorbidities.

Background

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that was synthesised in 1960 and introduced as early as 1961 in the USA, but is still regularly used. It has also been frequently used as an active comparator in trials on newer antidepressants and can therefore be called a 'benchmark' antidepressant. However, its efficacy and safety compared to placebo in the treatment of major depression has not been assessed in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of amitriptyline compared to placebo or no treatment for major depressive disorder in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) to August 2012. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). The reference lists of reports of all included studies were screened and manufacturers of amitriptyline contacted for details of additional studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amitriptyline with placebo or no treatment in patients with major depressive disorder as diagnosed by operationalised criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used a random-effects model throughout.

Main Results

The review includes 39 trials with a total of 3509 participants. Study duration ranged between three and 12 weeks. Amitriptyline was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving acute response (18 RCTs, n = 1987, OR 2.67, 95% CI 2.21 to 3.23). Significantly fewer participants allocated to amitriptyline than to placebo withdrew from trials due to inefficacy of treatment (19 RCTs, n = 2017, OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.28), but more amitriptyline-treated participants withdrew due to side effects (19 RCTs, n = 2174, OR 4.15, 95% CI 2.71 to 6.35). Amitriptyline also caused more anticholinergic side effects, tachycardia, dizziness, nervousness, sedation, tremor, dyspepsia, sedation, sexual dysfunction and weight gain. In subgroup and meta-regression analyses the results of the primary outcome were robust towards publication year (1971 to 1997), mean participant age at baseline, mean amitriptyline dose, study duration in weeks, pharmaceutical sponsor, inpatient versus outpatient setting and two-arm versus three-arm design. However, higher severity at baseline was associated with higher superiority of amitriptyline (P = 0.02), while higher responder rates in the placebo groups were associated with lower superiority of amitriptyline (P = 0.05). The results of the primary outcome were rather homogeneous, reflecting comparability of the trials. However, methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were usually poorly reported. Not all studies used intention-to-treat analyses and in many of them standard deviations were not reported and often had to be imputed. Funnel plots suggested a possible publication bias, but the trim and fill method did not change the overall effect size much (seven adjusted studies, OR 2.64, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.10).

Authors' Conclusions

Amitriptyline is an efficacious antidepressant drug. It is, however, also associated with a number of side effects. Degree of placebo response and severity of depression at baseline may moderate drug-placebo efficacy differences.
