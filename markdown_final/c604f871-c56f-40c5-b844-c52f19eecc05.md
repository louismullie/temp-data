## Question

What are several elements that you look at when reviewing prior records from psychiatric care provided over a period of time.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which elements to review when looking at prior psychiatric care records over a period of time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing a reliable chronology and checking record integrity. Then, I should verify core demographics and the initial reason for presentation. Next, I will map symptom chronology and episode features, review treatments and substance use, examine family history, and appraise psychosocial and developmental context. After that, I need to check medical comorbidities, perform longitudinal risk assessment, and review collateral information. I will then assess functioning, adherence, response patterns, and formal assessment results. Finally, I will synthesize all data into a current formulation and highlight key principles to guide interpretation and decision-making [^113T4hHZ] [^1162syPw] [^111VP2Lj].

> Let me first confirm the chronological framework and record integrity, because without a coherent timeline, patterns will be obscured and clinical inferences may be unreliable. Wait, let me verify that encounters are ordered from earliest to latest, and that gaps in care, missing notes, or fragmented systems are documented explicitly. I should double-check for discrepancies between retrospective summaries and contemporaneous notes, using anchoring tools like life history calendars or structured interval methods to mitigate recall bias and capture variability over time [^117CJoUZ] [^116k8qwc] [^116HGQJm].

> Next, I should review core demographics and the original reason for psychiatric evaluation, including the patient's goals and preferences, to ground subsequent interpretations in the initial clinical context. Hold on, I should verify that cultural, linguistic, and social determinants relevant to engagement and interpretation are noted at the outset, not inferred later from disparate entries [^1162syPw].

> I will now examine the psychiatric symptom chronology and episode characteristics, confirming age at onset, episode frequency, duration, severity, and diagnostic evolution against DSM criteria used at each time point. Let me consider seasonal or stress-related patterns and early-onset indicators that might forecast a more refractory course; I should double-check whether prior notes documented these features consistently, as endpoint-only views can miss informative trajectories and response latency patterns [^111VP2Lj] [^111jta84] [^115Mg6Tu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment adequacy without a comprehensive treatment inventory. I need to check every prior intervention: specific medications, doses, duration, adherence, response, adverse effects, psychotherapies with modality and dose of therapy, hospitalizations, and other settings. Hmm, wait a minute — patient recall often underestimates augmentation trials and misclassifies response; I should cross-verify self-report with charts and, when possible, pharmacy fills to correct for recall limitations before labeling a trial "failed" or "intolerant" [^115Zoywt] [^116owBtV] [^111VP2Lj] [^1162syPw].

> I should confirm the longitudinal substance use trajectory, including onset, type, quantity, frequency, periods of abstinence, and treatment attempts, with specific attention to tobacco and alcohol, given their impact on psychiatric course and pharmacotherapy. But wait, what if prescribed or over-the-counter agents contribute to symptoms or interactions? I need to ensure the record captures all substances and medications, recognizing that comorbid substance use substantially modifies treatment response and safety monitoring needs [^1162syPw] [^1118PHoe] [^116cPCUD].

> Let me verify the family psychiatric and medical history, prioritizing first-degree relatives with mood, psychotic, and substance use disorders, as well as family suicide history. Hold on, I should also check whether prior notes conflated family lore with verified diagnoses; a structured approach improves accuracy and helps quantify risk, given elevated cross-diagnostic vulnerability in relatives of individuals with schizophrenia and mood disorders [^111VP2Lj] [^113v7wJw] [^11364Asv].

> Next, I should review the psychosocial and developmental context across the record: relationships and supports, housing and employment stability, developmental milestones and transitions, cultural beliefs relevant to illness models, and trauma exposures. Wait, I need to ensure trauma history is explicitly documented and not assumed absent when unrecorded, since trauma shapes symptom expression, insight, engagement, and risk across disorders [^111VP2Lj] [^1162syPw].

> I will now examine medical comorbidities, medications, physical examinations, and labs over time, with a focus on conditions that mimic or exacerbate psychiatric symptoms and on interactions affecting drug metabolism and safety. Let me double-check whether medical evaluations were contemporaneous with psychiatric symptom changes; missing or outdated medical workups can obscure reversible contributors to psychiatric presentations and complicate pharmacologic decisions [^111VP2Lj] [^113T4hHZ] [^116cPCUD].

> I need to ensure a longitudinal risk assessment, tracking suicide ideation, plans, attempts, access to means, violence risk, self-harm behaviors, impulsivity, and disinhibition across encounters. Hold on, risk is dynamic, not a one-time attribute; I should verify trends, such as escalation in frequency or lethality of attempts, and correlate them with treatment changes, intoxication, or psychosocial stressors to refine current risk stratification [^1166vqwd] [^1162syPw] [^116qVjAK].

> Let me first confirm the presence and quality of collateral information, including family, prior clinicians, external hospital records, and any legal or forensic reports, and reconcile discrepancies with patient self-report. Wait, I should verify whether integrating multi-informant data altered diagnoses or heritability estimates in prior assessments; combined sources generally enhance diagnostic validity and reduce noise from rater or informant bias [^111Z4ibW] [^117CJoUZ].

> Next, I should review functional status and quality of life over time, tracking activities of daily living, occupational or academic function, social participation, and subjective well-being, because functional trajectories often diverge from symptom curves and predict long-term outcomes. I should confirm whether declines or recoveries were temporally linked to treatments or environmental changes to avoid attributing function gains solely to symptom shifts [^111VP2Lj].

> I will now examine adherence and engagement patterns, including appointment attendance, medication adherence, therapeutic alliance, and premature termination, because these elements predict relapse and apparent treatment resistance. Wait, let me verify whether adherence issues coincided with side effects, insight deficits, or social barriers, since addressing these drivers can convert "nonresponse" into response [^113XNeDB] [^1162syPw].

> Let me consider treatment response patterns and predictors, noting early versus late response, partial response, and treatment-resistant episodes, rather than relying only on endpoint outcomes. I should double-check for early improvement signals and stable nonresponse trajectories, which have stronger prognostic value for long-term outcomes and may guide earlier strategy changes, including augmentation or mechanism-switching [^115Mg6Tu] [^111jta84] [^112jbrLn].

> Next, I should review results of diagnostic and assessment tools: standardized symptom scales, neuropsychological tests, drug screens when indicated, metabolic panels, and functional assessments, ensuring measurements are anchored to baseline and repeated at meaningful intervals. Hold on, I must verify that scale-based monitoring was used to assess antipsychotic trials and depressive episodes, since structured measurements at baseline and predefined endpoints improve interpretability of efficacy and tolerability [^117UscBa] [^111VP2Lj] [^113J8fXZ] [^116k8qwc].

> Finally, I will synthesize all longitudinal data into a current clinical formulation: DSM-5 diagnoses with supporting criteria, illness timeline, prior treatment responses and barriers, dynamic risk profile, and tailored recommendations that leverage what has worked and avoid what has failed or harmed. Let me reconsider whether a precision-oriented approach can refine prognosis and selection of interventions, recognizing that careful ongoing monitoring and iterative adjustment remain essential even as we individualize care [^113T4hHZ] [^112FtZz7] [^113XNeDB].

> Key principles to keep front-of-mind as I interpret the record include the following, and I should double-check each against the file: temporal relationships matter, so distinguish premorbid, acute, and chronic phases; context is crucial, so integrate psychosocial stressors, cultural factors, and trauma; triangulate information from multiple sources to reduce bias; prioritize trajectories over isolated events; document gaps and limitations explicitly; and remember that risk fluctuates and must be reassessed longitudinally rather than assumed static [^111ZQccC] [^111VP2Lj] [^111Z4ibW] [^116HGQJm] [^111LXWmL] [^1162syPw].

Identify **co-occurring psychiatric disorders** and their impact [^113T4hHZ], and document medical conditions that affect psychiatric care [^113T4hHZ]. Record substance use, related treatments, and their impact on psychiatric care [^111g1dYE] [^1118PHoe].

---

### Psychosocial and functional status

Assess **social supports**, relationships, and social functioning [^111xvaFo]. Document occupational and educational functioning, including performance and impairments at work and school [^111VP2Lj]. Note major stressors and life events affecting mental health [^113NWLEv].

---

### Documentation quality and consistency

Evaluate the record for **completeness**, accuracy, and consistency [^116k8qwc]. Check for standardized assessments and outcome measures [^117UscBa]. Identify gaps, inconsistencies, and missing information [^116owBtV] [^116HGQJm].

---

Reviewing prior psychiatric records requires a **structured approach** that addresses diagnostic accuracy, treatment response, risk, comorbidities, psychosocial context, and documentation quality, supporting a comprehensive and safe longitudinal assessment [^113XNeDB].

### The REVAMP study: Research exploring various aspects and mechanisms in preeclampsia: Study protocol [^112wmsFy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries. Considering the burden of preeclampsia and its associated complications, it is important to understand the underlying risk factors and mechanisms involved in its etiology. There is considerable interest in the potential for dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) as a therapeutic intervention to prevent preeclampsia, as they are involved in angiogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory pathways.

- **Methods**:
	- The REVAMP study (Research Exploring Various Aspects and Mechanisms in Preeclampsia) follows a cohort of pregnant women from early pregnancy until delivery to examine longitudinally the associations of maternal LCPUFA with clinical outcome in preeclampsia. A multisite center for advanced research was established, and pregnant women attending Bharati Hospital and Gupte Hospital in Pune, India, for their first antenatal visit are recruited and followed up at 11–14 weeks, 18–22 weeks, 26–28 weeks, and at delivery. Their personal, obstetric, clinical, and family histories are recorded.

	- Anthropometric measures (height and weight), a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), physical activity, socioeconomic status, fetal ultrasonography, and color Doppler measures are recorded at different time points across gestation. Maternal blood at all time points, cord blood, and placenta at delivery are collected, processed, and stored at −80 °C. The children's anthropometry is assessed serially up to the age of 2 years, when their neurodevelopmental status is evaluated.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116iiG7k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

It is recommended that the prescribing physician communicates the following information to patients being treated with naltrexone hydrochloride:

You have been prescribed naltrexone hydrochloride as part of a comprehensive treatment for your alcoholism or drug dependence. You should carry identification to alert medical personnel to the fact that you are taking naltrexone hydrochloride. A naltrexone hydrochloride medication card may be obtained from your physician for this purpose, which should help ensure that you can receive adequate treatment in an emergency. If you require medical treatment, inform the treating physician that you are receiving naltrexone hydrochloride therapy. You should take naltrexone hydrochloride as directed by your physician.

- **Increased sensitivity to opioids**: Advise patients that if they previously used opioids, they may be more sensitive to lower doses of opioids and at risk of accidental overdose should they use opioids after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued or temporarily interrupted. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to them of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose.

- **Blocking effects of opioids**: Advise patients that because naltrexone hydrochloride can block the effects of opioids, they will not perceive any effect if they attempt to self-administer heroin or any other opioid drug in small doses while on naltrexone hydrochloride. Further, emphasize that the administration of large doses of heroin or any other opioid to try to bypass the blockade…

### Family history of schizophrenia as a risk factor for axis I psychiatric conditions [^11364Asv]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

People with first-degree relatives with schizophrenia are at an elevated risk of developing the disorder themselves. High rates of psychotic symptoms in non-psychotic disorders, high rates of comorbidity in psychotic disorders, and diversity of outcomes following psychosis-risk states together suggest that this vulnerability may be for psychiatric conditions in general, not limited to schizophrenia. In this study, data from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) were used to examine the association between having a first-degree relative with schizophrenia and the lifetime development of a range of non-psychotic axis I psychiatric disorders using adjusted odds ratios. Having a relative with schizophrenia was associated with an increased risk for most non-psychotic psychiatric conditions examined, including those expected to be associated with schizophrenia (affective, anxiety, and substance use disorders) and those not expected (bulimia, disorders of childhood onset), excluding respondents with lifetime psychotic symptoms and controlling for demographic factors.

Family history of schizophrenia among this predominantly African-American and Afro-Caribbean sample appears to be a risk factor for a range of axis I diagnoses, supporting a continuous rather than categorical nature of psychiatric vulnerability. Future studies should examine whether these associations are due to genetic or environmental factors, or both.

### The importance of the complete history in the discovery of a potential suicide: A case report [^115fYrrQ]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Suicidal ideation and completed suicides are an increasing problem among the elderly. In 1992, the elderly accounted for 13% of the population but represented 20% of all completed suicides. Recognized risk factors for suicides in elderly patients include depression, deteriorating physical health, and loss of independent functioning. A complete history enables the examiner to establish a relationship with the patient and to formulate a diagnosis. Unfortunately, histories are often incomplete. Many factors can account for this, including financial pressures, patient volume, and overspecialization.

The physiatric history is the integration of many parts. It incorporates not only the physiatrist's evaluation but also those of other disciplines, such as physical and occupational therapy. The physiatric history is a sensitive tool for assessing the state of being of the whole patient. We describe a case in which a careful and complete physiatric history and physical examination revealed an elderly patient with suicidal ideation and a plan.

### A clinical perspective on the relevance of research domain criteria in electronic health records [^115xvygz]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The limitations of the DSM nosology for capturing dimensionality and overlap in psychiatric syndromes, and its poor correspondence to underlying neurobiology, have been well established. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a proposed dimensional model of psychopathology, may offer new insights into psychiatric illness. For psychiatric clinicians, however, since tools for capturing these domains in clinical practice have not yet been established, the relevance and means of transition from the categorical system of DSM-5 to the dimensional models of RDoC remain unclear. The authors explored a method of extracting these dimensions from existing electronic health record (EHR) notes.

- **Method**: The authors used information retrieval and natural language processing methods to extract estimates of the RDoC dimensions in the EHRs of a large health system. They parsed and scored EHR documentation for 2,484 admissions covering 2,010 patients admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit between 2011 and 2013. These domain scores were compared with DSM-IV-based ICD-9 codes to assess face validity. As a measure of predictive validity, these scores were examined for association with two outcomes: length of hospital stay and time to all-cause hospital readmission. Together, these analyses were intended to address the extent to which RDoC symptom domains might capture clinical features already available in narrative notes but not reflected in DSM diagnoses.

- **Results**: In mixed-effects models, loadings for the RDoC cognitive and arousal domains were associated with the length of hospital stay.

### Clinical significance of monitoring early symptom change to predict outcome [^115Mg6Tu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Even with efforts to develop medication algorithms for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses, there is no single authoritative method that can be used to incorporate multiple factors in the treatment decision process. For this reason, physicians are faced with the often daunting task of sifting through the numerous treatment options for psychiatric illness to develop an approach that will prove the most successful for their patients.

Investigating patient patterns of response, particularly during the acute phase of treatment, and bearing them in mind when developing treatment protocols may assist clinicians in optimally managing the degree and course of symptom response. We present here a consideration of the timing and nature of response as well as individual patient predictors, which may impact therapy decisions. Furthermore, we explore the clinical significance of integrating response patterns into the treatment approach. We believe that an analysis of response patterns, in conjunction with the use of other practice guidelines, is a viable method to more effectively navigate critical decision points in the treatment process and ultimately have a dramatic effect on patient outcome.

### Factors predisposing to the onset of bipolar disorder: A 30-year longitudinal study [^114Qbe8m]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Patients in the Nottingham Study of Neurotic Disorder were recruited over a four-year period between 1983 and 1987. All participants had diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders and were seen in general practice psychiatric clinics. These clinics were popular extensions of community care in the latter years of the 20th century and facilitated earlier intervention in patients' pathological processes. Because the referred patients were seen early, they were also more representative of the population with anxiety and depressive disorders, who were classified at the time of the study as the core group of neurotic disorders.

The patients participated in a randomized trial of treatments during the first 10 weeks of the study, the results of which have been published elsewhere. They underwent further assessments at 16, 32, and 52 weeks, and at 2, 5, 12, and 30 years post-randomization, with the last patient seen in July 2019. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) no active psychiatric treatment at entry, (ii) informed consent, (iii) a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) diagnosis of either generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, or dysthymic disorder (or any combination thereof), as determined by the administration of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III, and (iv) no history of other assumed independent psychiatric illnesses (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or alcohol or drug addiction). Two hundred and ten patients were randomized; however, 10 patients dropped out or were found to be ineligible before baseline measures were completed.

### Investigation of possible risk factors for depression in Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review of the evidence [^1115y6Vg]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Depression is common in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with an increased risk of institutionalization and mortality. Understanding the risk factors for depression in AD is key to its development and treatment.

- **Methods**: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAL databases for longitudinal prospective cohort studies that evaluated risk factors for depression in people with AD. Two authors independently selected articles for inclusion and assessed the quality of studies using predetermined criteria.

- **Results**: In seven studies that met the inclusion criteria, 2029 participants were followed up for a median of 5 years. Gender and educational attainment were not predictors of depression risk. A history of a past psychiatric disorder and greater cognitive impairment predicted an increased risk of depression in more than one study. In single studies, younger age, having a family history of psychiatric disorder, neuroticism, functional decline, presence of sleep disturbance and aggression, and increased cardiovascular risk predicted depression risk. Not being within 6 months of dementia onset and, counterintuitively, having two comorbid disorders were protective factors in one study.

- **Limitations**: A small number of studies exist overall, and only a few have examined the same risk factors. Most of the studies have measured depression using scales that are not validated in AD.

- **Conclusions**: These results inform a preliminary model of depression risk in people with AD. Unlike in the general population, men and women, and those with higher and lower education levels, are not predictors of depression risk.

### The science of human factors: Separating fact from fiction [^111LXWmL]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Low credibility.

Human factors is an established body of science that is positioned to assist with the challenge of improving healthcare delivery and safety for patients. Human factors and healthcare professionals can work together to identify problems and solutions that may not be apparent by traditional means. While human factors does not promise instant solutions for healthcare improvement, it can provide a wealth of scientific resources for sustainable progress. Here, we have attempted to clarify the goals of human factors and pave the way for interdisciplinary collaborations that may yield new, sustainable solutions for healthcare quality and patient safety.

### The joint analysis of personal interview and family history diagnoses: Evidence for validity of diagnosis and increased heritability estimates [^111Z4ibW]. Psychological Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Psychiatric diagnoses obtained at personal interviews are only moderately reliable and depend critically on accurate self-observation. Reports by family members provide additional information but may be biased. It is unclear how best to combine these two sources of diagnostic data.

- **Methods**: Using complete data on lifetime prevalence for six disorders in approximately 1200 male-male twin pairs from a population-based registry, we first applied a standard bivariate twin model — which treats self-diagnoses and informant-diagnoses as separate phenotypes — and then examined a 'multiple-rater' model, which assumes that self-report and co-twin-report are fallible indices of one underlying disease liability. Best-fit models were chosen using Akaike's information criterion.

- **Results**: Standard bivariate analyses indicated that the same genetic factors accounted for variation in self-reported and co-twin-reported diagnoses. The multiple-rater model produced a substantial decrease in variance attributed to individual-specific environment and a proportional increase in heritability of liability for major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, and adult antisocial behavior, but not for drug abuse/dependence or regular tobacco use. The best-fit model consistently included either a 'bias' or a 'correlated error' path. No evidence for family environmental risk factors was found for any disorder.

- **Conclusion**: The genetic factors that influence self-reported psychiatric illness also influence psychiatric illness as described by relatives. For many psychiatric disorders, the integration of personal and family data is critical to improving diagnostic accuracy and heritability estimates.

### Precipitating factors for functional cognitive disorder [^117LiT3Q]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

As part of a larger FCD diagnostic study, data from consecutive patients with an FCD diagnosis attending three dedicated clinics (two neuropsychiatrists and one senior neurology trainee with an interest in cognition) in NHS Lothian, Scotland, between September 2023 and March 2024, were retrospectively extracted from medical electronic records.

The diagnosis of FCD was made if patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria published in 2020: (1) one or more symptoms of impaired cognitive function; (2) evidence of internal inconsistency; (3) symptoms or deficit not better explained by another medical or psychiatric disorder; and (4) symptoms causing significant distress or impairment in social or other important areas of functioning or warranting medical evaluation. All patients had at least 12 months of follow-up for diagnostic confirmation. Patients with an uncertain diagnosis and ongoing investigations were excluded. All evaluating clinicians had expertise in the diagnosis of FND and cognitive symptoms and were previously involved in diagnostic and expert consensus studies for FCD. The diagnosis of FCD was supported by investigations in a pragmatic manner according to practices and local standards.

As part of routine assessment interviews, patients were asked about the mode of onset and precipitating factors in the acute group of cognitive symptoms, demographics, past or present comorbidities, family history of cognitive symptoms, occupational exposure to cognitive difficulties, symptom duration, and trajectory.

### Correlates of suicide attempt history in bipolar disorder: A stress-diathesis perspective [^116qVjAK]. Bipolar Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Distinguishing clinical characteristics of bipolar patients who have made a suicide attempt may help to identify at-risk individuals. We sought to identify such factors and to consider them within a stress-diathesis model of suicidal behavior.

- **Methods**: Patients with bipolar disorder (N = 96) were compared with respect to the presence or absence at baseline evaluation of a history of suicide attempt. We used multiple logistic regression analysis to assess the unique associations of independent variables to history of a past suicide attempt.

- **Results**: The regression analysis showed that a history of suicide attempt in bipolar disorder was associated with greater recent suicidal ideation, more psychiatric hospitalizations, lifetime aggressive traits, and an earlier age at onset of a first mood episode.

- **Conclusions**: Aggressive traits and early treatment of mood disorders, especially major depressive episodes, are potential targets for suicide prevention in bipolar disorder.

### Statistical methods for longitudinal research on bipolar disorders [^115RpnCS]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Outcomes research in bipolar disorders, because of complex clinical variation over time, presents demanding research design and statistical challenges. Longitudinal studies involving relatively large samples, with outcome measures obtained repeatedly over time, are required. In this report, statistical methods appropriate for such research are reviewed.

- **Methods**: Analytic methods appropriate for repeated measures data include: (i) endpoint analysis; (ii) endpoint analysis with last observation carried forward; (iii) summary statistic methods yielding one summary measure per subject; (iv) random effects and generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression modeling methods; and (v) time-to-event survival analyses.

- **Results**: Use and limitations of these methods are illustrated within a randomly selected (33%) subset of data obtained in two recently completed randomized, double-blind studies on acute mania. Outcome measures obtained repeatedly over 3 or 4 weeks of blinded treatment in active drug and placebo sub-groups included change-from-baseline Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores (continuous measure) and achievement of a clinical response criterion (50% YMRS reduction). Four of the methods reviewed are especially suitable for use with these repeated measures data: (i) the summary statistic method; (ii) random/mixed effects modeling; (iii) GEE regression modeling; and (iv) survival analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Outcome studies in bipolar illness ideally should be longitudinal in orientation, obtain outcomes data frequently over extended times, and employ large samples.

### Impact of interpersonal factors on insight in schizophrenia [^111xvaFo]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). Low credibility.

Whereas clinical insight in schizophrenia has been consistently associated with personal factors, such as sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms, or cognition, little is known about its relationships with interpersonal factors, including close environment and personal characteristics involved in social interactions. Most of the few studies available have focused on one particular interpersonal factor, such as social cognition, contact frequencies, or therapeutic alliance. At the time of writing, no study has explored the specificity of associations between clinical insight and different levels of interpersonal factors, nor if these associations are independent of personal factors.

Associations between insight and interpersonal factors were explored through multiple regression in a sample of 80 outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Lower insight was associated with lower interpersonal functioning, independently from personal factors such as age, gender, age at first hospitalization, executive functioning, and symptoms. Our findings replicate previous studies with regard to the associations between clinician-rated insight and social cognition or social contact frequencies. They also provide new information about specific associations between clinician-rated insight and perceived social support, as well as between patient-rated insight and therapeutic alliance. Finally, models of insight based on personal factors were significantly improved by the inclusion of interpersonal factors. These results strongly support the crucial role of interpersonal factors in insight, both from the clinician and patient perspectives.

### How accurate are patients in reporting their antidepressant treatment history [^115Zoywt]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

A patient's report of their antidepressant treatment history is one of the most important pieces of information used in selecting an antidepressant regimen. It is currently unknown how accurate patients are in describing and characterizing their antidepressant treatment history.

- **Methods**: Seventy-three patients receiving treatment for depression at our outpatient psychiatric practice were interviewed by an independent evaluator who was blind to each patient's treatment history. Information was obtained regarding which antidepressant and augmentation regimens patients had undergone, antidepressant doses, duration of trials, and the nature of response to each trial. The results of these interviews were then compared with patients' actual treatment history as elicited from an independent chart review.

- **Results**: Patients recalled 85 of the 104 (81.7%) monotherapy trials they had undergone in the past 5 years, but only recalled 12 of 46 (26.1%) augmentation trials (P < 0.001). Patients were found to be very reliable in distinguishing between those trials that were of adequate dose and duration and those that were not. Patients were also generally reliable in depicting the quality of response to past trials, though patient report of a past negative trial was significantly more reliable than a report of a past positive trial. The presence of depressive symptomatology did not adversely affect patients' ability to recall past trials or accurately describe their responses to past regimens.

- **Limitations**: All patients were treated by a single psychiatrist.

### Factors contributing to variations in physicians' use of evidence at the point of care: A conceptual model [^113dMxcF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There is ample evidence that many clinical decisions made by physicians are inconsistent with generally accepted evidence, leading to the underuse of some efficacious diagnostic, preventive, or therapeutic services and the overuse of others of marginal or no value to the patient. Evolving new payment and delivery models place greater emphasis on the provision of evidence-based services at the point of care. However, changing physician clinical behaviors is likely to be difficult and slow.

Policymakers, therefore, need to design interventions that are most effective in promoting greater evidence-based care. To help identify modifiable factors that can influence clinical decisions at the point of care, we present a conceptual model and literature review of physician decision-making. A multitude of factors drawn from different disciplines have been shown to influence physician point-of-care decisions. We present a conceptual framework for organizing these factors, dividing them into patient, physician, practice site, physician organization, network, market, and public policy influences.

In doing so, we review literature that speaks to these factors. We then identify areas where additional research is especially needed and discuss the challenges and opportunities for health services and policy researchers to gain a better understanding of these factors, particularly those that are potentially modifiable by policymakers and organizational leaders.

### Apadaz [^116CkiLZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent re-evaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction because the use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Apadaz abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing benzhydrocodone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Apadaz in combination with other abused drugs.

- **Drug-seeking behavior**: This behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare providers. "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and those with substance use disorders. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.

Apadaz, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^116qgeXL]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, more specifically with respect to psychosocial evaluation, ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining psychological evaluations in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain when any of the following indications are present:

- **Psychosocial dysfunction**: Observed or suspected significant psychosocial dysfunction.

- **Contributing factors**: To determine psychosocial factors contributing to the patient's pain reports and disability behaviors.

- **Inadequate recovery**: Inadequate recovery, including continued dysfunctional status despite a duration exceeding the typical course of recovery, failure to benefit from indicated therapies, or failure to return to work when medically indicated. This also includes a persistent pain problem inadequately explained by the patient's physical findings.

- **Medication and drug issues**: This includes any suspicion of drug overuse or misuse, aberrant drug behavior, substance abuse, addiction, or use of illicit substances. Consideration is also given to the chronic use of opioids.

- **Psychiatric history**: Premorbid history of major psychiatric symptoms or disorder.

- **Compliance and adherence issues**: Problems with compliance/adherence with prescribed medical treatment or rehabilitation program. This is relevant for evaluating candidacy for, or potential benefit from a proposed functional restoration program, such as comprehensive occupational rehabilitation or interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation.

- **Cognitive impairment**: Evidence of possible cognitive impairment associated with related significant activities of daily living dysfunction, secondary to injury and/or possible adverse effects of medical therapies initiated for chronic pain.

- **Catastrophic injuries**: Catastrophic injuries with significant pain-related concerns.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^117UscBa]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

The BAP 2020 guidelines provide recommendations regarding the follow-up and surveillance for schizophrenia, specifically in the assessment of treatment response. They advise monitoring trials of antipsychotic efficacy using comprehensive symptom assessment scales, such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. It is recommended to obtain assessments at baseline and at the end of a predetermined trial period, typically starting with an initial period of 2 weeks.

### Amphetamine abuse in emergency department patients undergoing psychiatric evaluation [^115DcnNb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Amphetamine abuse accounts for numerous Emergency Department (ED) visits and is often associated with psychiatric disease, with many patients requiring involuntary psychiatric hold placement. It is a common practice in EDs to obtain a urine drug screen (UDS) as part of the "medical clearance" process for psychiatric patients. However, the prevalence of amphetamine-positive UDS in ED patients with psychiatric disease is unknown, as is the relationship of the UDS test to the final patient disposition.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of amphetamine-positive UDS in ED patients undergoing psychiatric evaluation, and whether amphetamine-positive UDS is associated with involuntary psychiatric hold placement.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study of adult patients seen in a single urban university ED who had a psychiatric evaluation and a UDS over a 1-year period. Eligible patients had results of the UDS, placement of involuntary holds, past psychiatric history, chief complaint, insurance status, and demographic information recorded. Regression analysis was performed, adjusting for the listed covariates, to evaluate the independent association of amphetamine-positive UDS and involuntary psychiatric hold placement.

- **Results**: A total of 1207 patients were included for analysis. Amphetamine-positive UDS were found in 14.8% of patients. Multivariate analysis showed no association of a psychiatric hold due to presence of amphetamines on UDS (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55–1.05, p = 0.1).

### Dsuvia [^117VMj8j]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because the use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Dsuvia abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing sufentanil, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Dsuvia in combination with other abused drugs.

"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare providers. "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and those with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.

Dsuvia, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that must be employed.

### Systematic review: Family history in risk assessment for common diseases [^115LsmHH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The usefulness of routinely examining family history in primary care practice is uncertain.

- **Purpose**: To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of collecting family history in primary care populations; how well family history predicts individual disease risk; and how accurately patients report it.

- **Data sources**: English-language studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO from 1995 to 2 March 2009.

- **Study selection**: Two independent reviewers selected studies that met question-specific eligibility criteria. These included controlled and uncontrolled intervention studies of systematic family history collection and uptake of preventive interventions or adverse effects, longitudinal and cross-sectional studies that examined family history and disease frequency, and studies in which reported family history was validated against relatives' true disease status.

- **Data extraction**: Information about study quality, setting, and findings was extracted using standardized protocols.

- **Data synthesis**: Two uncontrolled studies provided insufficient evidence to assess whether querying about family history improves any outcomes. One randomized, controlled trial and two uncontrolled studies provided weak evidence that some patients experienced a reversible, short-term increase in anxiety associated with family history taking. In 41 studies, different family history definitions were associated with sensitivities of 0 to 0.51 and specificities of 0.66 to 1.00 for detection of disease risk, and 0 to 0.83 and 0.48 to 1.00, respectively.

### Factors predisposing to the onset of bipolar disorder: A 30-year longitudinal study [^112G3VHg]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The aims of the study included measurement of symptomatic and personality change, recording of life events and environmental change, changes in the SCID DSM diagnosis, and treatment and service use data over the follow-up period.

Symptomatic change was recorded by interview using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale, and two related subscales, the Montgomery & Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Brief Scale for Anxiety (BAS). Self-ratings of anxiety and depression were recorded using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale (HADS). Because many patients had significant anxiety and depressive symptoms, the scores on the HADS scale were combined and classed as cothymia.

Life events up to 2 years were recorded using the Scaling of Life Events Scale and subsequently by interview and assessment of clinical notes. Personality assessment was carried out using the Personality Assessment Schedule (PAS) and its subsequent conversion to DSM-III categories of personality disorder.

Assessments in the study took place between 1983 and 2019. As the patients were recruited over a four-year period, the follow-up times were also staggered. The study began as a randomised trial of five treatments: placebo, dothiepin, diazepam, cognitive behaviour therapy, and self-help, given for 6 weeks and then tailed off before assessment at 10 weeks. Personality assessment was also made at baseline. Subsequently, further assessments were made at 16, 32, 52, and 104 weeks after randomisation, when further data were reported. After 5 years, assessments were…

### The pursuit of better diagnostic performance: A human factors perspective [^111WqwBK]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Low credibility.

The putative distinction between 'cognitive' and 'system' becomes somewhat spurious when one considers the diagnostic work of a busy emergency department with its chaotic mix of system-based, cognitive, affective, perceptual, temporal, and variable patient factors. Both cognitive and system variables can be manipulated and tested separately, but with both types of variables interacting in the clinical setting, the interaction term in our analyses should be of just as much interest as the main effects. In a multi-site survey of primary care physicians on diagnostic challenges, when respondents were asked specifically about the role of cognitive factors, they simultaneously referenced system and patient factors.

The perils of embracing dichotomies too eagerly are ever present — no less for the learned than the uninitiated. They may serve as useful fictions or labels initially in helping to simplify complex phenomena. However, dichotomies tend to assert too much, feeding delusions of understanding when their overuse impedes it. Instead of serving as convenient shorthand labels, they uncritically take on explanatory power, serving as causes rather than consequences. Parsing the world into imperfect humans and imperfect systems, into cognitive versus system-based research approaches, and into system 1 (intuitive) versus system 2 (analytical) modes of thinking misses much of the human factors work on shared mental models and distributed cognition cited earlier.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^115HdYH2]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

For the evaluation of obesity-specific circumstances in pediatric patients, particularly regarding the assessment for comorbidities, the AAP 2023 guidelines recommend a comprehensive patient history. This should include obtaining mental and behavioral health screenings, evaluating social determinants of health, and conducting physical examinations. The following diagnostic studies are suggested for assessing obesity-related comorbidities in patients aged 2–18 years with overweight or obesity:

- **Dyslipidemia**: Obtain a fasting lipid panel to evaluate for dyslipidemia in pediatric and adolescent patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity or overweight. Evaluation for lipid abnormalities is also recommended for patients aged 2–9 years with obesity.

- **Diabetes**: Obtain fasting plasma glucose, a 2-hour plasma glucose level following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c to evaluate for abnormal glucose metabolism in pediatric and adolescent patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity or those with overweight in the presence of risk factors for T2DM or MASLD.

- **MASLD**: Obtain an alanine transaminase measurement to evaluate for abnormal liver function in pediatric and adolescent patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity or those with overweight in the presence of risk factors for T2DM or MASLD.

- **Hypertension**: Measure blood pressure at every visit, starting at 3 years of age, to evaluate for hypertension in pediatric and adolescent patients with overweight and obesity.

### Factors to consider during identification and invitation of individuals in a multi-stakeholder research partnership [^114qUADW]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

We used a modified Delphi process to achieve consensus on the factors. This method allows for consensus based on literature, stakeholder opinions, and expert judgments. We used two stages of feedback from co-authors via email and a final stage involving a teleconference for the executive group to categorize factors lacking consensus.

- **Stage 1**: We sought feedback regarding the importance of each of the 18 factors in stakeholder identification, how they could be used by a research team, and examples from co-authors' experience. We emailed co-authors a draft of the manuscript background and a spreadsheet containing open questions regarding the factors (Appendix 3), asking co-authors to answer the questions, provide comments, and propose new factors. We offered an optional teleconference. We appraised the qualitative responses and looked for consensus with regard to removing or amending factors. We amended the factors and created a document summarising feedback.

- **Stage 2**: To determine the importance of the remaining factors in stakeholder selection, we sent co-authors a spreadsheet (Appendix 4), asking them to categorize factors as: 'highly desirable', 'desirable', or 'exclude'. We encouraged justifications via a free-text box. To inform this process, we shared the document summarizing each factor, created in stage 1.

	- **Sub-bullet example**: For each factor, we added votes for 'highly desirable', 'desirable', and 'exclude'. We summarised justifications given to understand the reasoning behind decisions and contextualize vote counting. We looked for overall agreement and categorized.

### The effects of the pandemic on mental health in persons with and without a psychiatric history [^113NWLEv]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Prospective studies are needed to assess the influence of pre-pandemic risk factors on mental health outcomes following the COVID-19 pandemic. From direct interviews prior to (T1), and then in the same individuals after the pandemic onset (T2), we assessed the influence of personal psychiatric history on changes in symptoms and well-being.

- **Methods**: Two hundred and four individuals (ages 19–69, including 117 females) from a multigenerational family study were followed clinically up to T1. Psychiatric symptom changes (T1 to T2), their association with lifetime psychiatric history (categorized as no history, only-past history, and recent history), and pandemic-specific worries were investigated.

- **Results**: At T2, relative to T1, participants with recent psychopathology (in the last 2 years) had significantly fewer depressive (mean, M = 41.7 vs. 47.6) and traumatic symptoms (M = 6.6 vs. 8.1, p < 0.001). In contrast, those with no and only-past psychiatric history experienced decreased well-being (M = 22.6 vs. 25.0, p < 0.01). Three pandemic-related worry factors were identified: illness/death, financial, and social isolation. Individuals with recent psychiatric history exhibited greater illness/death and financial worries than the no/only-past groups, but these worries were unrelated to depression at T2. Among individuals with no/only-past history, illness/death worries predicted increased T2 depression [B = 0.6(0.3), p < 0.05].

### Countertransference reactions to adolescents with eating disorders: Relationships to clinician and patient factors [^116DZ2p9]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

This study explores the emotional responses, or countertransference (CT) reactions, that clinicians experience when working with patients who have eating disorders (EDs). The study aims to identify clinician, patient, and therapy variables associated with these responses. In this research, 120 clinicians reported on various aspects of treating an adolescent female patient with an ED.

- **Results**: Six patterns of reactions were identified: angry/frustrated, warm/competent, aggressive/sexual, failing/incompetent, bored/angry at parents, and overinvested/worried feelings. These reactions exhibited meaningful relationships with clinician demographics, patient characteristics, and treatment techniques.

- **Discussion**: Clinicians' reactions were most frequently associated with the clinician's gender, the patient's level of functioning and improvement during treatment, and the patient's personality style. These issues have significant implications for treatment, training, and supervision.

### Phenelzine sulfate [^113rpwgM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Read the Medication Guide that comes with your or your family member's antidepressant medicine. This guide is specifically about the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions associated with antidepressant medicines. Discuss with your or your family member's healthcare provider:

- **All risks and benefits**: of treatment with antidepressant medicines.
- **All treatment choices**: for depression or other serious mental illnesses.

What is the most important information I should know about antidepressant medicines, depression, and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions?

Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some people may have a particularly high risk, including those with (or with a family history of) bipolar illness (also called manic-depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions.

How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member?

Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed. Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.

### Response rate profiles for major depressive disorder: Characterizing early response and longitudinal nonresponse [^111jta84]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

The definition of response is critical when seeking to establish valid predictors of treatment success. However, response at the end of the study or endpoint only provides one view of the overall clinical picture relevant in testing for predictors. The study employed a classification technique designed to group subjects based on their rate of change over time while simultaneously addressing the issue of controlling for baseline severity.

- **Methods**: A set of latent class trajectory analyses, incorporating the baseline level of symptoms, were performed on a sample of 344 depressed patients from a clinical trial. This trial evaluated the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy and two antidepressant medications, escitalopram and duloxetine, in patients with major depressive disorder.

- **Results**: Although very few demographic and illness-related features were associated with response rate profiles, the aggregated effect of candidate genetic variants previously identified in large pharmacogenetic studies and meta-analyses showed a significant association with early remission as well as nonresponse. These same genetic scores showed a less compelling relationship with endpoint response categories. In addition, consistent nonresponse throughout the study treatment period occurred in different subjects than endpoint nonresponse, verified by follow-up augmentation treatment outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: When defining groups based on the rate of change, controlling for baseline depression severity may help to identify the clinically relevant distinctions of early response and longitudinal nonresponse.

### Using life history calendars to improve measurement of lifetime experience with mental disorders [^117CJoUZ]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Retrospective reports of lifetime experience with mental disorders greatly underestimate the actual experiences of disorder because recall error biases reporting of earlier life symptoms downward. This fundamental obstacle to accurate reporting has many adverse consequences for the study and treatment of mental disorders. Better tools for accurate retrospective reporting of mental disorder symptoms have the potential for broad scientific benefits.

- **Methods**: We designed a life history calendar (LHC) to support this task and randomized more than 1,000 individuals to each arm of a retrospective diagnostic interview with and without the LHC. We also conducted a careful validation with the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition.

- **Results**: Results demonstrate that — just as with frequent measurement longitudinal studies — use of an LHC in retrospective measurement can more than double reports of lifetime experience of some mental disorders.

- **Conclusions**: The LHC significantly improves retrospective reporting of mental disorders. This tool is practical for application in both large cross-sectional surveys of the general population and clinical intake of new patients.

### Factors associated with antidepressant, anxiolytic and hypnotic use over 17 years in a national cohort [^114ybMtk]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The findings and existing research highlight that, contrary to our original hypothesis, clinical predictors were less likely to be associated with the use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, or hypnotics in 1999 as compared to 1982 or 1989. For example, suicidal ideation, difficulty sleeping, and poor physical health were associated with psychotropic medication use in 1982 and 1989, but none of these factors were associated with psychotropic drug use in 1999. On the other hand, non-clinical factors were more likely to be associated with antidepressant, anxiolytic, or hypnotic use in 1999 than in 1982 or 1989 after adjusting for the severity of psychiatric symptoms.

One of the factors very strongly associated with antidepressant, anxiolytic, and hypnotic use in this study was the individual reporting a history of nervous trouble. An important aspect of this variable is that individuals who report a history of nervous trouble are acknowledging that they have had problems with mental health. Those with mental health difficulties are not always likely to acknowledge or present symptoms; among NSHD survey members who had a mental disorder in adolescence, the majority do not report a history of nervous trouble as little as ten years later. One of the key barriers to the treatment of depression is whether an individual recognizes the fact that they have an illness. This is related to the concept of perceived need for treatment. Psychological models of perceived need identify three stages that an individual goes through before perceiving a need for treatment: experiencing symptoms.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for schizophrenia, particularly in the assessment of treatment response, the BAP 2020 guidelines recommend addressing several aspects during regular reviews of antipsychotic regimens:

- **Therapeutic efficacy**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the current treatment.

- **Side effects of treatment**: Monitor and assess any adverse effects experienced by the patient.

- **Medication adherence**: Ensure that the patient is compliant with their medication regimen.

- **Physical health**: Conduct regular checks to maintain the overall health of the patient.

- **Need to continue, change, or stop medication**, and consider the implications of any decisions taken.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bulimia nervosa, specifically with respect to the initial evaluation, the APA 2023 guidelines recommend assessing the following during the initial psychiatric evaluation of patients with a possible eating disorder:

- **Weight measurement**: Ensure accurate and consistent monitoring.
- **Quantity of eating and weight control behaviors**: Evaluate the frequency, intensity, or time spent on dietary restriction, binge eating, purging, exercise, and other compensatory behaviors.
- **Co-occurring health conditions**: Consider any present psychiatric disorders.
- **Comprehensive review of systems**: Conduct a thorough review to identify potential issues.

### Life history of experienced and witnessed aggression: Development of a new assessment instrument [^113HEALt]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Low credibility.

A lifetime history of experienced aggression and a lifetime history of witnessed aggression assessment was developed, and its psychometric properties were examined in a modest sample of individuals with and without a history of psychopathology. Following this, the two assessments were administered to 400 subjects with or without histories of major psychiatric and personality disorders. These studies demonstrated good to excellent psychometric properties, as well as evidence of convergent and divergent validity. Since both assessments quantify the occurrence of aggressive behaviors directed at a person and the occurrence of aggressive behaviors witnessed, the researchers propose that these assessments represent a needed modular assessment of aggression in the environment for behavioral science research.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, the CCSMH 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a thorough review of the personhood of the patient with dementia. This includes factors such as sex, gender, sexual orientation, language, race, ethnicity, cultural background, trauma history, religious or spiritual beliefs, and other relevant aspects. These considerations are crucial when attempting to understand contributors to BPSD and to inform the assessment and management strategies.

### Comparing retrospective reports to real-time/real-place mobile assessments in individuals with schizophrenia and a nonclinical comparison group [^116HGQJm]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

Retrospective reports are often used as the primary source of information for important diagnostic decisions, treatment, and clinical research. Whether such reports accurately represent individuals' past experiences in the context of a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia is unclear. In the study, 24 individuals with schizophrenia and 26 nonclinical participants used a mobile device to complete multiple real-time/real-place assessments daily, over 7 consecutive days. At the end of the week, participants were also asked to provide a retrospective report summarizing the same period.

- **Comparison of methods**: The data captured by the two methods showed that participants from both groups retrospectively overestimated the intensity of negative and positive daily experiences. In the clinical group, overestimations for affect were greater than for psychotic symptoms, which were relatively comparable to their retrospective reports. In both samples, retrospective reports were more closely associated with the week's average than the most intense or most recent ratings captured with a mobile device.

Multilevel modeling revealed that much of the variability in weekly assessments was not explained by between-person differences and could not be captured by a single retrospective estimate. Based on the findings of this study, clinicians and researchers should be aware that while retrospective summary reports of the severity of certain symptoms compare relatively well with average momentary ratings, they are limited in their ability to capture variability in one's affective or psychotic states.

### Maintaining reliability in a long-term psychiatric study: An ongoing inter-rater reliability monitoring program using the longitudinal interval follow-up evaluation [^116k8qwc]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2001). Low credibility.

The Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE) has been shown to be a valid and reliable instrument for characterizing the week-by-week course of anxiety disorders examined retrospectively over the period of one year. Due to the chronic nature of these disorders, there is a need for reliable, valid instruments for measuring their course over extended periods, if we are to learn more about their natural history. This paper describes a rater-monitoring program designed to ensure long-term inter-rater reliability and prevent "rater drift".

In this program, clinical interviewers score taped interviews and are required to maintain a median intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of at least 0.80 with other raters. Raters also assess tapes from previous years to ensure consistent application of diagnostic criteria across generations of interviewers.

- **Reliability study**: A study was conducted to compare psychiatric status ratings (PSRs) collected using biweekly telephone interviews with semi-annual interviews. The ICCs for panic, agoraphobia, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder were very good to excellent.

- **Further study**: Another reliability study examined the PSRs of subjects who had been previously lost to follow-up. ICCs for panic, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression were good to excellent.

These results show that the LIFE, when used in conjunction with an intensive training and rater monitoring system, is a reliable instrument for use in longitudinal studies of the course of anxiety disorders.

### Meperidine addiction or treatment frustration [^111aUbJW]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

There have been few studies on the psychiatric characteristics of analgesic addiction. The perception by physicians that patients were addicted to analgesics might be partially attributable to frustration with poor response to treatment. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the medical records of 20 subjects (15 male and 5 female) who were perceived by general physicians as having an addiction to meperidine. The most common medical diagnosis among these patients was chronic pancreatitis (7/20). Among them, five had a past history of suicide attempts, and three exhibited self-injury behavior during the index admission.

The perception of addiction may be attributed to a vicious cycle of factors: 1) chronic intractable pain; 2) poor staff-patient relationship; 3) lower pain threshold or tolerance due to anxiety or depression; 4) a history or tendency of substance abuse; and 5) placebo use and inadequate analgesic regimens. The findings of this study suggest the importance of the following diagnostic and treatment procedures: 1) evaluate suicide risk; 2) treat comorbid psychiatric diseases; 3) identify factors that cause a vicious cycle in pain control; 4) discuss misconceptions of opiate analgesics among medical staff; 5) manage poor staff-patient relationships aggressively; and 6) avoid diagnosing "addiction" unless absolutely necessary.

### Response to past depression treatments is not accurately recalled: Comparison of structured recall and patient health questionnaire scores in medical records [^116owBtV]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Assessing response to prior depression treatments is common in research and clinical practice, but few data are available regarding the accuracy of patient recall. Data from a population-based survey were linked to electronic medical records to examine the agreement between patients' recalled treatment response and depression severity scores in the medical records.

Electronic medical records from a large health system identified 1,878 adult patients with two or more episodes of clinician-diagnosed major depressive disorder or dysthymia between January 2005 and December 2009. Diagnoses had been recorded using ICD-9 codes. These potential participants were mailed an invitation letter, and of these, 578 completed an online or mailed survey, including structured recall of response to each prior depression treatment. Participants rated both global improvement during treatment and improvement specifically attributed to treatment. For 269 of the survey participants, at least one treatment episode could be unambiguously linked to both pretreatment and posttreatment Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scores in the electronic medical records. Analyses examined the agreement between patients' recall of treatment response and response according to PHQ-9 scores from the medical records.

Agreement between recall and the medical records was poor for both overall improvement following treatment (κ = 0.10; 95% CI, 0.00–0.19) and improvement attributed to treatment (κ = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.00–0.25). Agreement remained poor when the sample was limited to medication treatment.

### Longitudinal course and risk factors associated with psychosis in bipolar youths [^111LW7SD]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

To compare the longitudinal clinical course of youths with bipolar disorder (BD) spectrum with lifetime (past, intake, and/or follow-up) psychosis (BDP+) to youths with BD without lifetime psychosis (BDP-), this study also aims to identify risk factors associated with an increased risk of the first onset of psychosis during prospective follow-up.

- **Method**: Bipolar disorder youths (BDP+ = 137, BDP- = 233), aged 7–17 years old, were followed on average every 7 months for 11.7 years and evaluated using standardized instruments. Data were analyzed using linear and generalized linear models for the full sample, as well as for youths who developed the first period of psychosis (n = 55).

- **Results**: After adjusting for confounders, BDP+ youths with one, and in particular ≥ 2 lifetime psychotic episodes, had higher rates and more severe mood and anxiety symptoms, higher rates of suicidality, psychiatric hospitalizations, and sexual/physical abuse, and poorer psychosocial functioning than BDP- youths. Even before the first onset of psychosis during follow-up, BDP+ youths showed more psychopathology and had more family history of psychiatric illness than those who never developed psychosis. First-onset psychosis was associated with low socioeconomic status (SES), living with one parent, bipolar disorder type one and type two, comorbid anxiety, history of hospitalizations, and family history of mania and suicidality.

- **Conclusion**: BDP+ is associated with poor prognosis and worse clinical picture, even before the onset of psychosis, indicating the need for prompt identification and treatment.

### The new field of 'precision psychiatry' [^112FtZz7]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

While medicine has always had a personalized approach, it is not completely precise, or at least, not precise enough. The results achieved with instruments and information that physicians conventionally use, mostly covered by medical history and physical examination, are wanting. In this sense, precision medicine, as currently conceptualized and empowered by newly available and powerful technologies, promises to finally fulfill its long-awaited ideal. If precision psychiatry lives up to its promises, it will not just be quantitatively 'more precise' than contemporaneous psychiatry; it will also be qualitatively different – and, in this case, a new field would emerge.

An analogy could be made with arterial blood pressure. Blood pressure is measured on a continuous scale; however, an individual with a systolic blood pressure of zero cannot be considered in the same category as an individual with a systolic blood pressure of 300. An individual with a systolic blood pressure of zero is facing death in overt shock and requires treatment with drugs that increase blood pressure, while an individual with a systolic blood pressure of 300 is in overt hypertensive crisis and requires drugs that decrease blood pressure. Although both situations are manifestations of underlying alterations in the same continuous variable, i.e. blood pressure, they are so distinctly different that they are in different categories. The same applies to psychiatry and precision psychiatry when considering 'preciseness' dimensionally on a continuous scale.

### The versatility of the superomedial pedicle with various skin reduction patterns [^115VeqbZ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The inferior pedicle technique remains one of the most commonly used techniques in breast reduction surgery despite lengthy operating times, poor nipple sensation, and bottoming-out over time. The superomedial pedicle in reduction mammaplasty has previously been described using limited incision patterns. This study evaluated the safety and reliability of the superomedial pedicle with various skin reduction patterns and compared the surgical time with the inferior pedicle technique.

- **Methods**: A total of 279 superomedial breast reductions were reviewed over a 6-year period, representing the transition period from inferior pedicle to superomedial pedicle techniques of three attending surgeons. Among these reductions, 215 had complete records and were included in the data analysis. The remaining 64 records were evaluated for viability of the nipple-areola complex. Assessments included skin pattern markings, average size of reduction, average body mass index, and complications. Risk factors and patient comorbidities were also recorded.

- **Results**: There were no cases of nipple loss in the series. The overall complication rate was 18 percent; patients' average body mass index was 29. The revision rate for contour or scar improvement was 4 percent. A statistically significant reduction in operating time of 41 minutes (p = 0.0001) was seen in comparison with the inferior pedicle reduction.

- **Conclusions**: The superomedial dermoglandular pedicle is a safe and reliable technique for reduction mammaplasty. Its versatility allows for reproducible results in a broad range of patients.

### Managing difficult encounters: Understanding physician, patient, and situational factors [^111ZhAZf]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Family physicians commonly find themselves in difficult clinical encounters, which often leave the physician feeling frustrated. The patient may also be dissatisfied because of unmet needs, unfulfilled expectations, and unresolved medical issues. Difficult encounters may be attributable to factors associated with the physician, patient, situation, or a combination.

- **Physician factors**: Common issues include negative bias toward specific health conditions, poor communication skills, and situational stressors.
- **Patient factors**: These may include personality disorders, multiple and poorly defined symptoms, nonadherence to medical advice, and self-destructive behaviors.
- **Situational factors**: Factors such as time pressures during visits, patient and staff conflicts, or complex social issues can also contribute.

To better manage difficult clinical encounters, the physician needs to identify all contributing factors, starting with his or her personal frame of reference for the situation. During the encounter, the physician should use empathetic listening skills and a nonjudgmental, caring attitude; evaluate the challenging patient for underlying psychological and medical disorders; consider previous or physical or mental abuse; set boundaries; and use patient-centered communication to reach a mutually agreed-upon plan. The timing and duration of visits, as well as expected conduct, may need to be specifically negotiated. Understanding and managing the factors contributing to a difficult encounter will lead to a more effective and satisfactory experience for both the physician and the patient.

### Empirical psychopathology classification and the importance of trans-diagnostic dimensional factors [^115vHgd8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The assessment and diagnosis of psychopathology is one of the most important pursuits in mental health research and practice. It is also one of the most controversial activities in the current zeitgeist. Classically, psychopathology has been described using hundreds of putatively discrete categories delineated based on expert clinical experience and consensus. The ability to assess and study classic psychopathology categories was a critical development in the history of psychiatry and is closely linked to the development of the DSM-III.

### Identifying postpartum depression: Using key risk factors for early detection [^114RvPpw]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Personal and family history of psychiatric disorders are key risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD), yet their combined contribution has been understudied. This study examines personal and family psychiatric history, alone and combined, and their effect on absolute risk and relative risk (RR) of mild/moderate or severe PPD.

In this cohort study, data from 142,064 childbirths with PPD screenings from 2015 to 2021 were merged with population registers. Exposures were defined as personal and family psychiatric history through psychiatric hospital contact or psychotropic prescription fills by index mothers and their parents prior to delivery. Outcomes were mild/moderate PPD, measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale with a cut-off of ≥ 11 within 12 weeks postpartum, and severe PPD, indicated by antidepressant fill or depression diagnosis within 6 months postpartum. Absolute risks and RRs were calculated using Poisson regression models adjusted for parity, education, maternal age, and calendar year.

Of the 142,064 participants, 23.4% had no psychiatric history, 47.4% had only family history, 6.0% had only personal history, and 23.2% had both. The latter group had the highest risk of PPD: the absolute risk of mild/moderate PPD was 11.7% (95% CI: 11.5%-11.8%), with an adjusted RR of 2.35 (95% CI: 2.22–2.49). Personal psychiatric history alone was identified as the most potent risk factor. A dose–response relationship based on the severity of personal and family psychiatric history was observed.

This study documents a substantial association between personal and family psychiatric history and the risk of PPD.

### Evaluating multivariate risk scores for clinical decision making [^111SWU61]. Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The medical literature abounds with risk scores that can help clinicians predict the probability of disease. Risk scores are popular and attractive because they synthesize the effects of several different risk factors for disease in a way that is otherwise too complex for the human mind alone to analyze. However, to optimize clinical decision making, users of risk scores need to consider the factors and methods used to create the score and to recognize the potential limitations of risk scores.

Clinicians should consider the patient populations in which the risk score has been developed and validated, the risk factors included in the score, how computing the score might fit into the flow of daily practice, and how risk scores can help estimate pretest probability. An awareness of the uses and potential limitations of using risk assessment tools will aid the clinician in daily clinical decision making. These tools may grow in importance and use with increasing utilization of electronic health records.
