## Question

How should a urinary tract infection during pregnancy be managed in a patient with an amoxicillin allergy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a urinary tract infection during pregnancy in a patient with an amoxicillin allergy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and obtaining a urine culture with susceptibilities. Then, I should clarify the clinical syndrome: is this cystitis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, or pyelonephritis. Next, I need to characterize the reported amoxicillin allergy to determine whether cephalosporins are safe. After that, I will choose empiric therapy tailored to pregnancy, allergy phenotype, and local resistance patterns, making sure to avoid drugs that are unsafe or ineffective in pregnancy. Finally, I should plan follow-up, including test-of-cure where indicated and consideration of suppression after pyelonephritis, while integrating antimicrobial stewardship and special cases like group B streptococcal bacteriuria.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and secure microbiology. I need to obtain a clean-catch midstream urinalysis and urine culture with susceptibilities for any pregnant patient with urinary symptoms or when asymptomatic bacteriuria is suspected, because ACOG recommends culture to guide therapy and pregnancy is a setting where ASB warrants screening and treatment due to risks of pyelonephritis and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^111HbnGX] [^1144U2MN]. I should document colony counts and organism identification; for ASB, ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL is significant, while in symptomatic cystitis a threshold ≥ 10³ CFU/mL is sufficient, though I will double-check thresholds and align with lab reporting practices in my setting [^1179bTZG] [^1144U2MN].

> Next, I will determine the clinical syndrome, because this drives route and duration. Acute cystitis typically presents with dysuria, frequency, and urgency and can be treated with a targeted 5–7 day oral regimen in pregnancy, whereas acute pyelonephritis presents with fever, flank pain, and costovertebral-angle tenderness and requires initial intravenous therapy with subsequent oral step-down for a total of about 10–14 days, often with hospitalization at the outset in pregnancy [^116p68YB]. Hold on, I should verify the duration for pyelonephritis; although some studies explore shorter courses, ACOG still supports approximately 10–14 days total therapy in pregnancy pending more definitive evidence, so I will adhere to that interval here [^notfound].

> Now, I need to clarify the reported amoxicillin allergy, because this determines whether I can safely use cephalosporins. More than 90% of patients who carry a penicillin allergy label are not truly allergic, and cefazolin in particular is safe for most penicillin-allergic patients, including those with IgE-mediated reactions, due to different side chains, but it should be avoided in those with severe delayed hypersensitivity such as SJS/TEN, DRESS, hepatitis, nephritis, serum sickness, or hemolytic anemia; when feasible, structured history and penicillin allergy testing can be pursued to de-label safely in pregnancy or postpartum [^114FqJSb] [^113uQLaw] [^112bGYXM] [^1157TKDX]. Wait, I should not jump to conclusions: some older approaches suggested avoiding all β-lactams after anaphylaxis, but given contemporary side-chain data, cefazolin remains acceptable except in severe delayed reactions; I will explicitly document the reaction phenotype to guide therapy now and future care [^114FqJSb] [^111ZfDBJ].

> Before choosing antibiotics, I should remember that amoxicillin and ampicillin are poor empiric choices for UTI in pregnancy due to high E. coli resistance, so the amoxicillin allergy does not actually remove a recommended empiric option; it mainly reinforces choosing alternatives with good activity and safety in pregnancy [^116p68YB]. I need to ensure empiric selection is adjusted once susceptibilities return to minimize resistance pressure and maximize cure, consistent with stewardship [^116p68YB].

> For acute cystitis or asymptomatic bacteriuria, my first-line oral options in pregnancy include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and a first-generation cephalosporin such as cephalexin, chosen based on allergy phenotype and local susceptibility patterns, with TMP-SMX reserved for later trimesters when alternatives are not suitable due to first-trimester concerns; I will tailor duration to 5–7 days for most agents in pregnancy, except fosfomycin which is given as a single dose [^116p68YB] [^112HsPQX] [^112ph6V3]. Hmm, wait a minute — about nitrofurantoin dosing: the RCT in nonpregnant women used 100 mg three times daily, but in pregnancy and routine practice, 100 mg twice daily for 5 days is standard; I should correct to 100 mg twice daily for 5–7 days in pregnancy while recognizing the RCT's TID schedule does not directly apply to pregnant patients [^1139v98s] [^116p68YB].

> I will now examine agent-specific caveats for cystitis. Nitrofurantoin is effective against common uropathogens and is widely used in pregnancy; it should be avoided near term in those with risk of neonatal G6PD-related hemolysis and not used for pyelonephritis because it does not achieve therapeutic renal parenchymal levels, so I need to confirm lower-tract disease before prescribing it [^116p68YB]. Fosfomycin tromethamine 3 g PO once is useful for adherence and is indicated only for uncomplicated cystitis; if bacteriuria persists or recurs, I should select an alternative agent, and I must not use fosfomycin for pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess [^11335mYn] [^112HsPQX]. Cephalexin 500 mg every 6 hours for 5–7 days is acceptable in pregnancy and safe in most patients with penicillin allergy except those with severe delayed hypersensitivity, so I should confirm the allergy phenotype before using it [^114FqJSb] [^116p68YB]. TMP-SMX can be considered in the second or third trimester when no better option is available given resistance concerns and theoretical first-trimester risks, so I will reserve it and check local antibiograms carefully [^112ph6V3] [^116dkvj7].

> But wait, what if the reported amoxicillin allergy is a severe delayed hypersensitivity. In that scenario, I should avoid all β-lactams, including cephalosporins, and choose a non-β-lactam such as nitrofurantoin for cystitis or fosfomycin if appropriate, while ensuring the infection is not pyelonephritis because these agents are inadequate for upper-tract disease [^114FqJSb] [^112HsPQX] [^116p68YB]. If the reaction was IgE-mediated but not severe delayed, cefazolin or cephalexin remain acceptable choices due to side-chain differences, which I should explicitly document in the plan to support safe administration and future care [^114FqJSb] [^111ZfDBJ].

> For acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy, I should initiate intravenous therapy and consider admission, then step down to oral therapy based on clinical response and susceptibilities to complete about 10–14 days total treatment, carefully avoiding agents that do not penetrate the renal parenchyma such as nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin [^115ZFE6n] [^116p68YB] [^112HsPQX]. Ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours is a common and appropriate first choice with good E. coli coverage and pregnancy safety; cefazolin 1 g IV every 8 hours is also reasonable depending on local ESBL rates, and both are generally safe even in many patients labeled penicillin-allergic unless there is a history of severe delayed β-lactam hypersensitivity, which I need to check explicitly [^116dkvj7] [^114FqJSb] [^115ZFE6n]. If β-lactams cannot be used due to severe delayed allergy and the patient is seriously ill, I may need to involve infectious diseases for alternatives such as an aminoglycoside, balancing maternal-fetal risks and local resistance while planning close monitoring, but I will confirm institutional guidance before proceeding [^116dkvj7] [^115ZFE6n].

> Hold on, I should verify special-case agents I might be tempted to use. Pivmecillinam was FDA-approved for uncomplicated UTI and has long European experience, but as an amidinopenicillin it is a β-lactam and should be avoided in severe delayed penicillin allergy; moreover, U.S. pregnancy-specific guidance is limited, so I will not choose it first-line in this amoxicillin-allergic pregnant patient without allergy clarification and susceptibility support [^116Y6BbM]. Fluoroquinolones are generally avoided in pregnancy, and amoxicillin-clavulanate has inferior cure rates for uUTI compared with fluoroquinolones and faces resistance issues, so neither is preferred empirically here in pregnancy, especially with an amoxicillin allergy label complicating β-lactam choices [^115JHQBP] [^116p68YB].

> I should double-check follow-up and prevention steps. After treating cystitis or ASB in pregnancy, it is reasonable to repeat a urine culture about one week after completing therapy to document eradication, particularly if there were high-risk features or prior recurrence, and this approach is used in pregnancy programs and aligns with heightened vigilance in this population [^117UC6Z2] [^116p68YB]. Following an episode of pyelonephritis in pregnancy, ACOG suggests considering suppressive therapy for the remainder of pregnancy given recurrence risk, though evidence is limited; I will individualize and document this plan [^114N98A4] [^115ZFE6n].

> Let me consider group B streptococcal bacteriuria nuances. If GBS is isolated at significant counts during pregnancy, management must address both UTI treatment thresholds and implications for intrapartum prophylaxis; notably, asymptomatic GBS bacteriuria at colony counts less than 10⁵ CFU/mL generally does not require treatment during pregnancy, but it establishes an indication for intrapartum prophylaxis, which I will clearly record to avoid missed peripartum coverage [^117GjwmV]. I need to ensure this distinction is communicated so that undertreatment and overtreatment are both avoided [^117GjwmV].

> Next, I should review allergy delabeling opportunities. Because most penicillin allergy labels are not confirmed and cefazolin and many cephalosporins are safe for most patients with reported penicillin allergy, targeted history and, when feasible, penicillin skin testing or supervised oral challenge during or after pregnancy can optimize therapy now and in the future; I will arrange counseling and referral when appropriate to enhance antimicrobial stewardship and maternal-neonatal outcomes [^114FqJSb] [^113uQLaw] [^112bGYXM] [^1157TKDX].

> Finally, I need to ensure my plan remains adaptable to local resistance data and individual patient factors. E. coli resistance to ampicillin and amoxicillin is high in many regions, supporting avoidance of these agents for empiric therapy in pregnancy; I will use culture results to narrow therapy promptly, avoid agents contraindicated for pyelonephritis, and document allergy phenotypes to safely include cephalosporins when indicated, all consistent with ACOG guidance and stewardship principles [^116p68YB] [^116dkvj7] [^115ZFE6n].

For pregnant patients with a **true amoxicillin allergy**, safe and effective options for uncomplicated cystitis include **nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5–7 days** [^116p68YB] (avoid at term) or **fosfomycin 3 g PO single dose** [^11335mYn]. Cephalosporins (e.g. cephalexin 500 mg PO QID for 5–7 days) are appropriate when the allergy is **non-severe** [^114FqJSb] because cross-reactivity is low [^111ZfDBJ]. For severe IgE-mediated reactions, avoid all beta-lactams and use nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin [^116p68YB]. Always obtain a **urine culture** [^111HbnGX] before starting antibiotics and adjust therapy based on sensitivities. If pyelonephritis is suspected, hospitalize and treat with non-beta-lactam options (e.g. aztreonam or gentamicin) with close maternal–fetal monitoring [^115ZFE6n] [^116dkvj7].

---

## Recommended antibiotic alternatives

### First-line alternatives

Nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days is a **first-line choice** [^116p68YB]; avoid at term (≥ 38 weeks), during labor, or if G6PD deficiency is present. Fosfomycin tromethamine 3 g orally as a single dose is another **first-line option** effective for uncomplicated cystitis but not for pyelonephritis [^11335mYn] [^112HsPQX].

---

### Second-line alternatives

Cephalosporins such as cephalexin 500 mg orally four times daily for 5–7 days are appropriate in **non-severe penicillin allergy** [^114FqJSb] given low cross-reactivity [^111ZfDBJ]. Aztreonam 1–2 g IV every 8–12 hours is reserved for **severe infections** or when oral therapy is not feasible.

---

## Antibiotics to avoid

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Contraindicated due to fetal cartilage toxicity [^112mYXUQ].

- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**: Avoid in the first trimester (neural tube defects) and near term (kernicterus) [^116p68YB] [^112ph6V3].

- **Aminoglycosides**: Avoid unless absolutely necessary due to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity risks [^116dkvj7].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Urine culture should be obtained [^111HbnGX] before initiating antibiotics to guide therapy and ensure appropriate **antibiotic selection**. Penicillin allergy testing can be considered during pregnancy to **confirm or exclude true allergy**, allowing safer antibiotic choices [^112bGYXM] [^114FqJSb].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety

- **Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin**: Effective and safe for uncomplicated UTIs in pregnancy, with low risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [^116p68YB] [^113R6hZ5].

- **Cephalosporins**: Safe and effective in pregnancy, with minimal cross-reactivity in non-severe penicillin allergies [^114FqJSb] [^111ZfDBJ].

- **Aztreonam**: Safe alternative for severe penicillin allergies, though typically reserved for more severe infections.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Test of cure should be performed 1–2 weeks [^117UC6Z2] after completing therapy to ensure **eradication of infection** [^116p68YB]. Maternal and fetal monitoring should include regular assessment for adverse reactions and **fetal well-being** throughout treatment [^115ZFE6n].

For managing acute cystitis in pregnant patients, the ACOG 2023 guidelines recommend administering a targeted antibiotic for 5–7 days. It is advisable to avoid using amoxicillin and ampicillin when initiating empiric therapy before obtaining culture and sensitivity results due to the high resistance rates of E. coli to these antibiotics in most areas.

Fosfomycin tromethamine is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) in women due to susceptible strains of *Escherichia coli* and *Enterococcus faecalis*. It is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess.

If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with fosfomycin tromethamine, other therapeutic agents should be selected. (See precautions and clinical studies sections.)

### Cefazolin as the mainstay for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with a penicillin allergy in obstetrics and gynecology [^114FqJSb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Cefazolin is the most common antibiotic used for prophylaxis in obstetrics and gynecology. Among those with a penicillin allergy, alternative antibiotics are often chosen for prophylaxis, given fears of cross-reactivity between penicillin and cefazolin. Alternative antibiotics in this setting are associated with adverse sequelae, including surgical site infection, induction of bacterial resistance, higher costs to the healthcare system, and possible Clostridium difficile infection. Given the difference in R1 side chains between penicillin and cefazolin, cefazolin use is safe and should be recommended for patients with a penicillin allergy, including those who experience Immunoglobulin E-mediated reactions such as anaphylaxis. Cefazolin should only be avoided in those who experience a history of a severe, life-threatening delayed hypersensitivity reaction manifested as severe cutaneous adverse reactions (Steven-Johnson Syndrome), hepatitis, nephritis, serum sickness, and hemolytic anemia in response to penicillin administration. In addition, > 90% of those with a documented penicillin allergy do not have true allergies on skin testing. Increased referral for penicillin allergy testing should be incorporated into routine obstetric care and preoperative assessment to reduce suboptimal antibiotic prophylaxis use. More education is needed among providers surrounding penicillin allergy assessment and cross-reactivity among penicillins and cephalosporins to optimize antibiotic prophylaxis in obstetrics and gynecology.

### The relationship of prenatal antibiotic exposure and infant antibiotic administration with childhood allergies: a systematic review [^113DB7Cj]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

The majority of studies examined or adjusted for other influential factors in the relationship between prenatal antibiotic usage and childhood asthma. Potential confounders generally considered were maternal and/or familial asthma, infant gender, maternal age, ethnicity, education, smoking during pregnancy, parity, and birth weight. Relevant potential confounders often not taken into account were delivery mode, maternal infections, breastfeeding, and postnatal child antibiotic usage.

Confounding by indication, such as by maternal respiratory infections, was addressed in four studies by additional examination of the types of antibiotics generally used for different infections, such as respiratory and urinary tract infections. Two studies found that antibiotics used to treat maternal respiratory infections had a stronger effect than antibiotics used to treat maternal urinary tract infections, although the effects of both types of antibiotics were still significant. Metsala et al. (2014) found the strongest association for antibiotics treating both respiratory diseases and urinary tract infections, but no significant effect for antibiotics only treating urinary tract infections. These studies suggested that there may have been at least some confounding by maternal respiratory tract infections. Conversely, Stensballe et al. (2013) found that maternal antibiotics used to treat non-respiratory diseases had a significant and stronger effect than mothers using any type of antibiotics, suggesting a causal role of an unidentified factor.

### Penicillin allergy in pregnancy: Moving from "rash" decisions to accurate diagnosis [^113uQLaw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The emergence of beta-lactam-resistant pathogenic organisms has limited or even eliminated drugs such as penicillin and ampicillin from available antibiotic choices for treating common infections in obstetrics and gynecology. In clinical situations where penicillins and cephalosporins are appropriate or recommended as first-line agents, patient-reported penicillin allergies lead to the routine use of alternative, but potentially less effective, agents. Using broader-spectrum and possibly suboptimal alternative antibiotic regimens for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus or for surgical prophylaxis for cesarean delivery in women with a reported penicillin allergy may affect these women during labor and birth.

Most individuals who report a penicillin allergy are neither truly allergic nor at risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction after exposure to penicillin. Available evidence suggests important roles for both targeted history-taking to determine the nature of drug allergies and penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women to optimize their antibiotic-related treatment during pregnancy and for their lifetimes. It is recommended to consider and adopt penicillin allergy testing more widely in pregnant women specifically, as well as in the general population of women cared for by providers of obstetrics and gynecology.

### Outpatient penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women who report an allergy [^112bGYXM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The potential benefits of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women with a suspected allergy include adherence to guideline-directed antibiotic therapy in the setting of group B streptococcus prophylaxis or cesarean delivery infection prophylaxis and reduction in exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Penicillin allergy testing to document those who truly require alternative treatments supports antibiotic stewardship to mitigate emerging drug resistance. Ideally, penicillin allergy testing should occur preconception or at the time of initial allergy reaction. Obstetricians can use preconception encounters and postpartum visits to counsel women regarding the benefits of penicillin allergy testing. Recent publications, as well as the latest Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, advocate for the consideration of penicillin allergy testing in pregnancy. Given the low incidence of anaphylaxis, this study highlights the ability to perform allergy testing in the outpatient setting. In light of the potential to improve antibiotic stewardship and the demonstrated acceptability and feasibility of testing, women with a reported penicillin allergy can undergo allergy testing during pregnancy.

### Outpatient penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women who report an allergy [^111SzC4K]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Balancing drug allergy with antibiotic stewardship is a difficult and ever-present challenge for the obstetrician. Antibiotics are administered to 30–74% of women during pregnancy for a wide variety of indications. The most commonly used antibiotics include penicillin and other beta-lactams, clindamycin and other macrolides, and aminoglycosides.

Pregnant women with a self-reported penicillin allergy typically receive alternative antibiotics that are broader spectrum, such as cefazolin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. This increases the risk for antibiotic resistance and maternal morbidity. In the general population, self-reported penicillin allergy occurs in 10% of patients; however, when tested, fewer than 2% have a proven (or true) allergic reaction. Penicillin allergy also decreases over time, with up to 80% of patients with a confirmed penicillin allergy losing sensitization 10 years later.

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology encourages the consideration of allergy testing in women who self-report a penicillin allergy. Penicillin allergy can be confirmed through skin testing, but there are limited data to inform allergy testing in pregnancy. Two studies using skin testing with 27 and 56 pregnant women reported that only 3% and 7% of women, respectively, had a true penicillin allergy, and none had anaphylaxis. Neither of these studies in pregnant women included a graded oral challenge, which is important because an oral drug challenge is the gold standard for determining true drug allergy.

Our aim was to estimate the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of outpatient penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections - United States, 2014 [^112AEHA1]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Among 680,988 pregnancies in 2014 identified in the 2013–2015 data, 482,917 were eligible for further analysis (Figure 1). Among these, 34,864 (7.2%) pregnant women had an initial outpatient UTI claim 90 days before or during pregnancy. UTI diagnoses were most frequent during the first trimester of pregnancy (41.0% of UTIs) and least frequent in the third trimester (11.8%). Overall, 68.9% of women with an outpatient UTI filled a prescription for an antibiotic within 7 days of their outpatient visit during pregnancy (median = 0 days, standard deviation = 1.1 days). In contrast, a higher proportion of women with UTIs before pregnancy filled a prescription (76.1%) during the 90 days before the estimated LMP.

- **Antibiotic types during pregnancy**: The type of antibiotic dispensed differed for UTIs treated before and during pregnancy. Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) and sulfonamides (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) were more commonly dispensed to women within 90 days before their LMP than to pregnant women during any trimester of pregnancy. In contrast, nitrofurantoin, cephalosporins (e.g. cephalexin), and penicillins (e.g. amoxicillin) were more commonly dispensed during pregnancy than during the 90 days before LMP. The most frequently dispensed antibiotics during the first trimester of pregnancy were nitrofurantoin (34.7%), ciprofloxacin (10.5%), cephalexin (10.3%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (7.6%).

### Effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin vs. single-dose fosfomycin on clinical resolution of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women: A randomized clinical trial [^1139v98s]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

The study "Nitrofurantoin vs. fosfomycin in uncomplicated UTI" was published by Huttner A. and colleagues in 2018 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the diseases acute cystitis and acute pyelonephritis. The trial investigated the effect of a 5-day nitrofurantoin regimen in female patients with uncomplicated UTI. It employed a multi-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial (RCT) design involving a population of 513 female patients. The inclusion criteria specified female patients with uncomplicated UTI. Key exclusion criteria included pregnancy and lactation, suspected upper UTI, recent antibiotic use or UTI symptoms within the preceding 4 weeks, indwelling catheter, immunosuppression, and ongoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

- **Interventions**:
	- 255 patients received oral nitrofurantoin (100 mg PO TID for 5 days).
	- 258 patients received oral fosfomycin (single 3 g oral dose).

- **Primary outcome**:
	- There was a significant increase in clinical resolution at 28 days post-therapy completion (70% vs. 58%; ARD 12, 95% CI 4 to 21).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- A significant increase in microbiologic resolution (74% vs. 63%; ARD 11, 95% CI 1 to 20).
	- A significant increase in clinical response at 14 days (75% vs. 66%; ARR 9, 95% CI 1 to 17).

### The etiology and prevalence of urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women in Iran: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115RVjRv]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common clinical problem, constituting about 1–6% of medical referrals, and includes urinary tract, bladder, and kidney infections. UTI may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) being of particular importance due to the lack of symptoms. UTI and its related complications cause approximately 150 million deaths per year worldwide.

In pregnant women, physiological and anatomical changes in the urinary tract, along with immune system changes during pregnancy, increase the prevalence of ASB and can, in some cases, lead to symptomatic infection. This poses serious risks for both mother and fetus. Factors such as increasing age, parity, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, a history of UTI, urinary tract disorders, and immune deficiency may elevate the risk of UTI in pregnant women.

Bacteriuria during pregnancy, if untreated with antibiotics, could result in complications such as preterm labor, pre-eclampsia, hypertension, pyelonephritis, anemia, amnionitis, low birth weight, neonatal deaths (stillbirths), bacteremia, and toxic septicemia. Treating bacteriuria in pregnancy reduces the risk of these complications. Therefore, screening for early diagnosis and treatment of bacteriuria in women during pregnancy is necessary to prevent its complications.

The overall prevalence of bacteriuria in pregnant Iranian women was reported to range from 2% to 41%, indicating inconsistency in study results. Thus, determining the prevalence of ASB, UTI, and the most common pathogenic microorganisms involved is a valuable diagnostic capability.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but it is usually recommended for the amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated.

First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI traditionally involves a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin.

- **Antimicrobial therapy factors**: Factors to consider when selecting appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence within the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy.

- **Ideal antimicrobial agents**: Ideal agents for UTI management primarily excrete through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels.

Additionally, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, as well as for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Amoxicillin [^112MhCtR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Use in specific populations**:

	- **Pediatric use**: Modify dose in patients 12 weeks or younger (≤ 3 months). Due to incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

	- **Pregnancy**: Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (3 and 6 times the 3 g human dose, based on body surface area). There was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin. However, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, amoxicillin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

	- **Labor and delivery**: Oral ampicillin is poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether the use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of requiring obstetrical intervention.

	- **Nursing mothers**: Penicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. The use of amoxicillin by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants, and caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman.

	- **Geriatric use**: An analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin capsules was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects.

### Diagnostic and treatment difficulties of pyelonephritis in pregnancy in resource-limited settings [^116dkvj7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

As expected, E. coli was the most commonly isolated urinary pathogen, accounting for 87.5% of acute pyelonephritis and confirming similar rates from previous reports in pregnancy. Ampicillin, previously the drug of choice for E. coli antepartum pyelonephritis because of its efficacy, cost, and safety for the mother and fetus, has been lost to global resistance. With a rate of ampicillin susceptibility for E. coli of only 14% on the Thai–Burmese border, it represents an unacceptable choice for febrile UTI in pregnancy. Low rates of susceptibility to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid have been reported in most of Europe and the United States.

The low rates of susceptibility to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and the high rates of susceptibility to ceftriaxone, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin in our study are likely to have resulted from antimicrobial prescribing patterns in the camp, which have not changed for 20 years. The refugee camps on the Thai–Burma border have used oral ampicillin or amoxicillin for outpatient UTI and IV ampicillin and gentamicin for hospitalized patients since their inception in 1986. The latest guidelines contain changes in recommended regimens for urinary tract pathogens based primarily on the evidence presented here.

More than 10 years ago, Biedenbach and others reported high antimicrobial resistance in Thailand among commonly encountered pathogens and a rate of ESBL production of 15.7% for E. coli and 45.6% for K. pneumoniae.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy in a rural population of Bangladesh: Population-based prevalence, risk factors, etiology, and antibiotic resistance [^117UC6Z2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment was guided by the MIST treatment algorithm for positive urine cultures, as shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1. UTI was managed in pregnant women with high burden growth (> 10⁵ CFU/mL of a uro-pathogen) as well as among women with intermediate growth who exhibited UTI symptoms, following ACOG recommendations. From January to October 2012, the first-line antibiotic treatment consisted of cefixime 400 mg taken orally once daily for 3 days. After observing that only two-thirds of E. coli isolates were susceptible to cefixime, the first-line treatment was changed to nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) 100 mg taken orally twice daily for 7 days. All symptomatic women were also referred to the sub-district hospital for further evaluation and management.

A test of cure was conducted 1 week after completing antibiotic treatment for all pregnant women with positive cultures. If the second urine culture continued to be positive, the supervising field physician prescribed an antibiotic based on the antimicrobial sensitivity pattern. Cases of persistent UTI after repeated treatments were referred to Sylhet Osmani Medical College Hospital for further evaluation and management.

- **Data analysis**: Simple descriptive statistics were used to describe the distribution of uro-pathogens and antibiotic sensitivity patterns. For the risk factor analysis, the primary outcome was UTI requiring antibiotic treatment, as defined in Table 1. A number of socio-demographic characteristics, nutrition, behavior, and reproductive history variables were included as potential risk factors. Socio-demographic characteristics encompassed household wealth, household size, religion, and woman's age.

### Safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation: A systematic review [^1157TKDX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Approximately 8–13% of pregnant patients report penicillin allergy. Penicillins and other beta-lactams are widely used in pregnancy but often avoided in these patients, resulting in suboptimal therapy, antimicrobial resistance, higher costs, and increased morbidity for patients and neonates. True penicillin allergy is rare, and 95% of unverified penicillin allergies are delabeled on evaluation. Although penicillin allergy evaluation is safe and recommended for pregnant patients, few are assessed. Research concerning antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation is accelerating, and we undertook a systematic review to summarize this growing body of evidence for obstetric providers.

- **Data sources**: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed ahead-of-print and non-Medline, and clinicaltrials.gov was conducted in collaboration with a medical information specialist. There was no restriction on study language, date, or design.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: All peer-reviewed studies of pregnant people reporting unverified penicillin allergy undergoing penicillin allergy evaluation with ≥ 5 participants were included. Case reports, non-peer-reviewed sources, and studies regarding desensitization of verified penicillin-allergic patients were excluded.

- **Study appraisal and synthesis methods**: Title/abstract review, full text review, and data extraction were completed independently by two authors. Conflicts were resolved by a third author. Studies were evaluated using validated quality assessment tools.

Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in detail.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^113UXyyY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for the highest proportion of primary care antibiotic prescriptions issued to pregnant women in the UK. Pregnant women have an increased susceptibility to UTIs due to physiological changes. The growing uterus can result in urinary retention, which predisposes the woman to infection. Additionally, hormonal fluctuations relax the ureteral muscle and cause an accumulation of urine in the bladder, which also increases the chance of developing a UTI.

Treatment of UTIs is recommended in pregnancy if bacteria are detected in the urine, even if there are no accompanying symptoms, i.e. in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Both ASB and symptomatic UTIs in pregnancy are risk factors for the development of pyelonephritis, which can result in severe maternal morbidity. It is estimated that 20–30% of women with bacteriuria in the first trimester go on to develop pyelonephritis in later trimesters. Therefore, although ASB on its own is not treated in the general population, guidelines published by the European Urological Association (EAU) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) recommend screening and treating bacteriuria with or without symptoms. The management strategy according to these guidelines is to use a short course of antibiotics.

### Three versus five days of pivmecillinam for community-acquired uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial [^111oy7RC]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

The study protocol was previously published. During the trial, the following amendments were made: the study period was extended to 30 months due to slow participant accrual; and the control urine sample arrival timeframes were redefined because participants secured their first and second urine samples with a wider range than predefined: the first urine sample from 9 to 11 days to 7 to 21 days, and the second from 28 to 30 days to 15 to 42 days post-inclusion, respectively. The study ended in November 2017 when the study medication expired.

- **Study design and population**: This multicentre, parallel randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical phase IV trial was performed from May 12, 2015, to November 30, 2017, at nine general practice clinics in Denmark. Females (aged 18–70 years) presenting with symptoms of dysuria, frequency (pollakiuria), and/or urgency were screened according to study criteria and asked to participate based on clinical symptoms. Follow-up ended one month after the last participant was included. Participants were included after providing written consent. Common symptoms of UTI (dysuria, frequency, or urgency) were assessed based on a validated questionnaire. Each symptom was scored from 0 to 3 (none, mild, moderate, or severe), and a cumulative score of ≥ 2 points was required for participation. The presence of these inclusion symptoms and the absence of vaginal symptoms has an estimated 90% positive predictive value for uncomplicated UTI, with no clear diagnostic value for urine-dipstick or culture. Exclusion criteria included allergy to beta-lactams.

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^114swyqX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that may lead to significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. A large number of drugs and drug combinations are available to treat urinary tract infections, most of which have been tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy have, therefore, been problematic.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to determine, from the best available evidence from randomised controlled trials, which agent is the most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. This includes considerations of cure rates, reinfection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care units, the need for a change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (November 2009) and reference lists of articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered all trials where the intention was to allocate participants randomly to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: We included 10 studies, recruiting a total of 1125 pregnant women. In most of the comparisons, there were no significant differences between the treatments under study with regard to cure rates, reinfection, incidence of preterm delivery, and admission to neonatal intensive care units.

### Impact of a clinical guideline for prescribing antibiotics to inpatients reporting penicillin or cephalosporin allergy [^111HVDs8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Self-reported penicillin allergy infrequently reflects an inability to tolerate penicillins. Inpatients reporting penicillin allergy often receive alternative antibiotics that might be broader spectrum, more toxic, or less effective.

- **Objective**: To develop and assess a clinical guideline for the general inpatient provider that directs taking a history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy.

- **Methods**: A guideline was implemented to assist providers with assessing allergy history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with reported penicillin or cephalosporin allergy. The guideline utilized a standard two-step graded challenge or test dose. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to assess safety, feasibility, and impact on antibiotic use by comparing treatment 21 months before guideline implementation with 12 months after guideline implementation.

- **Results**: Significantly more test doses to β-lactam antibiotics were performed monthly after versus before the guideline implementation (median 14.5, interquartile range 13–16.25, vs. 2, interquartile range 1–3.25, P < .5) between periods. Guideline-driven test doses reduced the use of alternative antimicrobial therapy following the test dose, including vancomycin (68.3% vs. 37.2%, P < .001), aztreonam (11.5% vs. 0.5%, P < .001), aminoglycosides (6.0% vs. 1.1%, P = 0.004), and fluoroquinolones (15.3% vs. 3.3%, P < .001).

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^115ZFE6n]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

For specific circumstances concerning acute pyelonephritis, particularly in pregnant patients, the ACOG 2023 guidelines recommend suspecting pyelonephritis in pregnant patients with a fever (≥ 38.0 °C) and urine tests suggesting a urinary tract infection (UTI). Additional symptoms indicative of an upper genitourinary tract infection, such as flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness, further support the diagnosis.

### Duration of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy [^116aPaVB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

A previous Cochrane systematic review has shown that antibiotic drug treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women substantially decreases the risk of pyelonephritis and reduces the risk of preterm delivery. However, it is not clear whether single-dose therapy is as effective as longer conventional antibiotic treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different durations of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2015) and reference lists of identified articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing antimicrobial therapeutic regimens that differed in duration (particularly comparing single dose with longer duration regimens) in pregnant women diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included 13 studies, involving 1622 women. All were comparisons of single-dose treatment with short-course (four- to seven-day) treatments. The risk of bias of trials included in this review was largely unclear, and most trials were at high risk of performance bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. When any antibiotic agent was used, the 'no cure' rate for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women was slightly lower for the short-course treatment.

### Management of group B streptococcal bacteriuria in pregnancy [^117GjwmV]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2012). High credibility.

For specific circumstances involving asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant patients, the SOGC 2012 guidelines recommend not treating asymptomatic pregnant patients with urinary group B streptococcal colony counts less than 10⁵ CFU/mL. This is advised to prevent adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes such as pyelonephritis, chorioamnionitis, or preterm birth.

### Safety and tolerability of pivmecillinam during more than four decades of clinical experience: A systematic review [^116Y6BbM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

In April 2024, pivmecillinam became the first antibiotic in approximately 20 years to receive US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uUTI). It has been used elsewhere — mainly in Europe and Canada — for over 40 years, and key guidelines recommend pivmecillinam as a first-line treatment for uUTIs. Pivmecillinam is an oral prodrug of mecillinam, an amidinopenicillin antibiotic that binds exclusively to penicillin-binding protein (PBP)-2 in enteric bacteria. Mecillinam acts synergistically with other beta-lactams that bind to PBP1a/PBP1b and/or PBP3 in gram-negative bacteria and, when used in combination, may also have the potential to constrain the evolution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.

In Europe, oral pivmecillinam is also indicated for the treatment of salmonellosis and recommended in certain regions for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis; peak serum levels of mecillinam are reached approximately 1 hour post-dose, and the serum half-life is 1.2 hours.

There is a need for new antibiotic options for uUTI in the United States. The rate of development and approval of new antibiotics has decreased steadily since the 1980s due to economic and regulatory obstacles. The proportion of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria is increasing in community and healthcare settings, which erodes the value of commonly used agents such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), nitrofurantoin, and fluoroquinolones.

Treatment choices for uUTI are also influenced by safety considerations, including gastrointestinal and other side effects associated with antibiotic therapy.

### Bicillin L-A [^1146ZB3D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing Bicillin L-A in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of development of drug-resistant bacteria. Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma. Care should be taken to avoid intravenous or intra-arterial administration, or injection into or near major peripheral nerves or blood vessels, as such injection may produce neurovascular damage (see warnings and dosage and administration sections).

Prolonged use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken. Bicillin L-A contains approximately 0.11 mEq of sodium per 600,000 units of penicillin G (approximately 2.59 mg of sodium per 600,000 units of penicillin G).

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics and usually resolves when the antibiotic is discontinued. However, after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever), even as late as two or more months after taking the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Bicillin L-A, should only be used to treat bacterial infections; they do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold).

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^1133WNzH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

A total of ten databases were searched, and search terms were mutually agreed upon by the authors and an independent colleague to ensure a comprehensive process. The studies included in the review were assessed independently by the authors using CASP checklists. Any disagreement was resolved through meetings and discussions about the relevant studies.

A limitation of this review is that only English language publications were included; therefore, there might be options that have not been identified. The results of this review have been discussed using a narrative synthesis approach due to the heterogeneous design of the included studies and the differing nature of the interventions identified.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections - United States, 2014 [^113tLEJ9]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

The study analyzes women with pregnancies in 2014 who had an outpatient claim for at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis and filled at least one prescription for an antibiotic from an outpatient pharmacy within seven days of their UTI diagnosis before or during pregnancy. This data was collated from the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Database, United States, 2013–2015.

- **Definitions and data explanation**: UTIs were identified based on the presence of an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM) diagnosis code of UTI (599.0) or acute cystitis (595.0 or 595.9) on at least one outpatient claim. The first antibiotic prescription(s) filled from an outpatient pharmacy within seven days of a UTI diagnosis was considered relevant.

- **Trimester explanation**: The first trimester is defined as 0–90 days after the last menstrual period (LMP); the second trimester is 91–180 days after LMP; and the third trimester is 181 days after LMP until the end of pregnancy.

- **Additional notes**: Some women filled prescriptions for more than one type of antibiotic, resulting in numbers and proportions greater than those associated with "any" antibiotic. Women could experience up to two UTIs from 90 days before LMP through the end of pregnancy.

Abbreviation: LMP = date of last menstrual period.

The figure outlines antibiotic medication types filled from outpatient pharmacies among pregnant women who had an outpatient claim for at least one UTI diagnosis and filled a prescription for an antibiotic, segmented by period before and during pregnancy.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline [^115HJY1S]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women, specifically concerning the choice of antibiotics, the AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend completing a course of antibiotic therapy for as short a duration as reasonable, generally no longer than 7 days, in patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^112mYXUQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

While antibiotics are vital in the eradication of urinary tract infections (UTIs), their use contributes to antimicrobial resistance, a global health threat. Antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria survive antibiotic treatment, potentially leading to serious or life-threatening infections. The use of antibiotics is strongly associated with the increasing emergence of resistant bacteria, resulting in the redundancy of previously effective antibiotics. This issue is particularly concerning in pregnancy, where the choice of safe antibiotics is limited due to their teratogenic potential. For example, quinolones should be avoided in pregnancy because of the risk of joint malformations in the fetus. Antibiotics becoming ineffective due to antimicrobial resistance further restricts the range of drugs available to treat infections safely.

An example of this in practice is the replacement of trimethoprim with nitrofurantoin as the first-line antibiotic to treat UTIs, following an increase in resistance due to trimethoprim's widespread use in the UK. Moreover, the use of antibiotics can result in individuals carrying resistant bacteria for several months to a year after completing a course of treatment. These resistant bacteria can transfer to close physical contacts and may colonize and infect subsequent hosts. This is especially concerning in pregnancy, as women can pass on resistant bacteria to the neonate during birth, when the infant is most vulnerable to infection.

An example of resistance specific to obstetric practice is the increase in ampicillin-resistant strains, which necessitates further consideration and research into non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of UTIs in pregnancy.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy in a rural population of Bangladesh: Population-based prevalence, risk factors, etiology, and antibiotic resistance [^1137dSuK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in pregnancy are a significant yet under-emphasized risk factor for pregnancy morbidity and adverse birth outcomes in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. UTIs may present in pregnancy with symptoms of acute cystitis or pyelonephritis, or may be more insidious in women with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Screening and treatment of ASB by urine culture are recommended for all women at least once in early pregnancy in high-income countries by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Care, and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence of the United Kingdom (UK).

In low-income countries, screening and treatment of UTIs or ASB are challenging due to the costs and logistics of performing urine culture. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) made context-specific antenatal care recommendations for the screening and treatment of ASB in LMICs, recommending urine culture in settings with capacity or mid-stream urine Gram stain, and treatment of ASB.

There is a paucity of population-based data on the prevalence and etiology of UTIs in pregnancy in low- and middle-income countries. In a recent review, the global prevalence of UTI and/or ASB in pregnancy ranged from 3 to 35% across five continents in countries with preterm birth rates greater than 10%. Women carry a higher risk of UTI than men, and pregnancy places women at increased risk of ascending infection due to the weight of the fetus and dilation of the ureters and renal pelvis. Before urine culture was a standard of care in the US (1960s), pyelonephritis was a common concern.

### Efficacy of lactoferrin in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections in pregnant Egyptian women: a randomized controlled trial [^1179bTZG]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

- **Urine culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing**: Using the calibrated loop technique, the collected urine samples were processed and inoculated into cysteine lactose electrolyte deficient medium, blood and MacConkey agar plates and incubated for 2–3 days. Colony counts greater than 10⁵/ml were considered significant bacteriuria. Isolated bacteria were identified according to standard bacteriological procedures using colony characteristics, gram-staining, and a series of biochemical tests.

	- All isolates underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing using commercial disks, in accordance with the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (CLSI) standard disk diffusion technique with the recommended CLSI breakpoints. The following antimicrobials were tested at these concentrations: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (20/10 µg), ampicillin (10 µg), ciprofloxacin (5 µg), trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (1.25/23.75 µg), ceftriaxone (30 µg), meropenem (10 µg), nitrofurantoin (300 µg), fosfomycin (200 µg), and erythromycin (15 µg). Women diagnosed with ASB or acute cystitis received appropriate therapy according to antibiogram sensitivity.

- **Outcome measures**: The main outcome of this study was the number of episodes of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), acute cystitis, or pyelonephritis in the study cohort. ASB was defined as significant bacteriuria > 10⁵ cfu/ml in a single clean midstream urine sample, in the absence of any abnormal urinary symptoms; acute cystitis was presented with dysuria, frequency, and urgency with a colony count ≥ 10³ cfu/ml.

### Antibiotics for treating gonorrhoea in pregnancy [^111L1kt2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, posing a significant public health challenge. *N. gonorrhoeae* can be transmitted from the mother's genital tract to the newborn during birth, potentially causing gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum as well as systemic neonatal infections. It can also result in endometritis and pelvic sepsis in the mother. This review updates and replaces an earlier Cochrane Review on antibiotics for treating this infectious condition.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical effectiveness and harms of antibiotics for treating gonorrhoea in pregnant women.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2017), LILACS database (1982 to April 5, 2017), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; April 5, 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov (April 5, 2017), the ISRCTN Registry (April 5, 2017), and Epistemonikos (April 5, 2017). We also searched reference lists of all retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of antibiotics for treating gonorrhoea in pregnancy. The antibiotics could have been used alone or in combination, were administered parenterally, orally, or both, and were compared with another antibiotic. We included RCTs regardless of their publication status (published, unpublished, published as an article, an abstract, or a letter), language, or country. We applied no limits on the length of follow-up. We excluded RCTs using a cluster- or cross-over design, or quasi-RCTs.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^112SsJ43]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

The procedures for this study involved providing participants assigned to antibiotic prophylaxis with a choice of nitrofurantoin (50 or 100 mg), trimethoprim (100 mg), or cefalexin (250 mg), administered orally once daily. The choice depended on previous urine culture results and the individual's history of allergy or intolerance. Methenamine hippurate was prescribed as a twice daily oral dose of 1 g. While participants were allowed to switch between antibiotic drugs or treatment strategies, adherence to the allocated intervention was emphasized. Participants experiencing symptomatic UTI episodes were advised to seek discrete treatment courses of antibiotics in their usual manner, typically via their general practitioner.

Follow-up assessments were conducted every three months until month 18. At each visit, participants were asked about the occurrence of any UTIs, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Information on UTI episodes was confirmed from healthcare records when necessary. Blood samples were taken to monitor kidney and liver function in all participants. Urine samples were submitted to the central laboratory at baseline, during the scheduled three-monthly visits, and at the time of UTI episodes. Optional perineal swabs were submitted at baseline and at six-monthly routine visits. Additionally, participants completed symptom questionnaires every three months and at the time of symptomatic UTI episodes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing using a cephalosporin with a different side chain. If the test is negative, challenge testing is advised to exclude an allergy to the specific cephalosporin. This recommendation is especially relevant when a patient with a clinical history of penicillin allergy and positive skin tests requires a cephalosporin.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^113R6hZ5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common infection among pregnant women and have been associated with maternal and fetal complications. Antimicrobial exposure during pregnancy is not without risk. International guidelines recommend a single screen-and-treat approach to asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB); however, this approach has been questioned by recent studies.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this narrative review was to assess the pathophysiology, risk factors, and management of UTI during pregnancy, its impact on pregnancy outcomes, and to develop recommendations on the best use of antimicrobials.

- **Sources**: PubMed, Cochrane Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Content**: Owing to the physiological changes related to pregnancy, pregnant women are at higher risk of UTI. All types of UTIs combined have been estimated to affect approximately 2% to 15% of women. ASB affects 2% to 7% of pregnant women. Recent studies do not provide good-quality evidence for an association between ASB and acute pyelonephritis if ASB is untreated. There is low-to-moderate-quality evidence that treatment of ASB results in a reduction in the incidence of low birth weight and preterm birth, which justifies screening practices for ASB with only a single urine culture in the first trimester. If the clinician opts for treatment, a short course of β-lactams, nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin should be favored. Studies on cystitis during pregnancy are limited. Acute pyelonephritis has been shown to be associated with increased maternal complications and in some studies has also been associated…

### Benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a systematic review [^114x3fzL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Most European and North American clinical practice guidelines recommend screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) as a routine pregnancy test. Antibiotic treatment of ASB in pregnant women is intended to reduce maternal upper urinary tract infections (upper UTIs) and preterm labor. However, most studies supporting the treatment of ASB were conducted between the 1950s and 1980s. Due to subsequent changes in treatment options for ASB and UTIs, the applicability of findings from these studies has been questioned.

Our systematic review had three objectives: firstly, to assess the patient-relevant benefits and harms of screening for ASB versus no screening; secondly, to compare the benefits and harms of different screening strategies; and thirdly, if no reliable evidence on the overarching screening question was identified, to determine the benefits and harms of treatment of ASB.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched several bibliographic databases, trial registries, and other sources (up to February 2016) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective non-randomized trials. Two authors independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. As meta-analyses were not possible, we summarized the results qualitatively.

- **Results**: We did not identify any eligible studies that investigated the benefits and harms of screening for ASB versus no screening or that compared different screening strategies. We identified four RCTs comparing antibiotics with no treatment or placebo in 454 pregnant women with ASB.

According to 2011 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, nonpregnant women with uncomplicated UTIs should be treated with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. For pregnant women in their first trimester, a 2011 Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin may be prescribed only if other antimicrobial therapies are deemed clinically inappropriate. In this analysis, 34.7% of pregnant women with UTIs in 2014 filled a prescription for nitrofurantoin, and 7.6% filled a prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during their first trimester of pregnancy.

Few estimates of UTI treatment among pregnant women are available, though this estimate is similar to a previous report of approximately 700 mothers of liveborn infants without major birth defects. These mothers were enrolled in a large, multisite, population-based case-control study of risk factors for major birth defects from 1997 to 2011. In that study, approximately 6.7% of pregnant women reported at least one UTI from the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, with two-thirds (66.6%) reporting antibiotic treatment. This is similar to the prevalence observed in this analysis.

- **Estimates of antibiotic treatment for UTIs during the 3 months before the last menstrual period (LMP)**: These estimates are similar to previous studies of nonpregnant women. A 2003 study examined approximately 13,000 claims among women aged 18–75 years with acute cystitis enrolled in a preferred provider care organization during 1997–1999.

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^115GwfrB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that can result in significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is a large number of drugs, and combinations of them, available to treat urinary tract infections; however, most have been tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy have, therefore, been problematic.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to determine, from the best available evidence from randomized control trials, which agent is most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy in terms of cure rates, reinfection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 2003) and reference lists of articles were searched.

- **Selection criteria**: All trials were considered where the intention was to allocate participants randomly to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Eight studies were included, recruiting a total of 905 pregnant women. In most of the comparisons, there were no significant differences between studied treatments with regard to cure rates, reinfection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, and admission to neonatal intensive care unit.

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^1144U2MN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a bacterial infection of the urine without any of the typical symptoms associated with a urinary infection, occurring in 2% to 15% of pregnancies. If left untreated, up to 30% of mothers may develop acute pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with low birthweight and preterm birth. This is an update of a review last published in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on the development of pyelonephritis and the risk of low birthweight and preterm birth.

- **Search methods**: For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 4 November 2018, as well as the reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found during antenatal screening were included. Trials using a cluster-RCT design and quasi-RCTs were eligible for inclusion, as were trials published in abstract or letter form, but cross-over studies were not.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included 15 studies involving over 2000 women. Antibiotic treatment compared with placebo or no treatment may reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^112HsPQX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Fosfomycin tromethamine is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) in women due to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Fosfomycin tromethamine is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess.

If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with fosfomycin tromethamine, other therapeutic agents should be selected (see precautions and clinical studies sections).

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy in a rural population of Bangladesh: Population-based prevalence, risk factors, etiology, and antibiotic resistance [^112C8G74]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), and our study demonstrates high and concerning rates of antibiotic resistance to common antimicrobial agents for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) in pregnancy. The gram-negative uropathogens were highly resistant to ampicillin and azithromycin. More than 30% of E. coli isolates were not susceptible to common second and third generation cephalosporins. Among the most common uropathogens, E. coli and staphylococcal species, there was only low-to-moderate susceptibility to cefixime, a traditionally potent oral third generation cephalosporin. Similar high and concerning rates of antibiotic resistance were reported in the WHO Global Surveillance of Antimicrobials. In national-level data from Southeast Asia, 16–68% of E. coli isolates, and 34–81% of Klebsiella isolates were resistant to third generation cephalosporins. This data emphasizes the urgency for antibiotic stewardship in LMIC, and the need to develop new effective antimicrobials with safety in pregnancy.

There were several limitations to this study. We did not have the ability to speciate coagulase-negative staphylococcal species in our field laboratory. We presume the majority of these species were Staphylococcus saprophyticus; however, it is possible that some of these may have been Staphylococcus epidermidis, which might be considered a skin contaminant. Another challenge is the differentiation of skin contamination versus true pathogens. The rates of S. aureus growth were high, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine what proportion of those should be classified as significant infections or skin contaminants.

### SPL drug information for ampicillin [^112XxHs3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of ampicillin PO in pregnant patients across all trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. Ampicillin is classified in FDA pregnancy category B. Animal data reveal no teratogenic effects. While ampicillin should be used with caution in pregnancy, penicillins are generally considered safe during pregnancy when clearly needed. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and the benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.

The drug ampicillin PO is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. It has been administered to a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Diagnostic and treatment difficulties of pyelonephritis in pregnancy in resource-limited settings [^115mkSfT]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Although a 10–14 day therapy is accepted for the treatment of pyelonephritis, particularly in pregnant women, new studies are challenging this duration of therapy. The treatment choice for pyelonephritis in pregnant women is limited. Antimicrobial drug resistance is rising at an alarming rate, with very few new treatment options for Gram-negative bacteria in both non-pregnant and pregnant individuals. The rise of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria is compounding the problem because antimicrobials such as cephalosporins, which have a good safety profile in pregnant women, are rendered ineffective.

Only four randomized control trials involving pregnant women, including groups of 90, 178, 179, and 101, respectively, or 548 women in total, have assessed antimicrobial efficacy. These studies concluded that in non-bacteremic patients, oral cephalexin (500 mg every 6 hours) did not differ in efficacy and safety from intravenous (IV) cephalothin (1 g every 6 hours) treatment. One-time daily IV ceftriaxone was as effective as multiple daily doses of cefazolin. No difference in clinical response was observed with IV ampicillin and gentamicin, IV cefazolin, or intramuscular ceftriaxone, whereas cefuroxime (750 mg every 8 hours IV) was more efficacious and better tolerated than cephradine (1 g every 6 hours IV).

A review article reported that two weeks of therapy seem acceptable for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in women, not specifically pregnant women; nevertheless, 10- to 14-day courses are suggested. Here, we report the incidence, risk factors, diagnosis, microbial pathogens, and antimicrobial susceptibilities.

### Urinary tract infections and antibiotic use in pregnancy - qualitative analysis of online forum content [^112EseNn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are the standard treatment for asymptomatic and symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) during pregnancy. Their overuse, however, can contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and expose the fetus to drugs that might affect its development. Preventative behaviors are currently the best option to reduce incidences of UTIs and avoid the use of antibiotics during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to explore women's experiences of UTIs in pregnancy to develop an understanding of their concerns and to optimize and encourage behaviors that facilitate the appropriate use of antibiotics.

- **Methods**: An online pregnancy forum in the United Kingdom (UK) was used to collect data on women's discussions regarding UTIs. A total of 202 individual threads generated by 675 different usernames were selected for analysis. The data was organized using NVivo 11® software and then analyzed qualitatively using inductive thematic analysis.

- **Results**: Women's perceptions of UTIs and antibiotic use in pregnancy were driven by their prenatal attachment to the fetus. UTIs were thought to be common and high-risk during pregnancy, leading to the belief that antibiotics were essential in the presence of suspected symptoms. The dominant view about antibiotics was that their use was safe and of little concern during pregnancy. Women reported emotional reactions to developing a UTI and coped by seeking information on behavior change strategies to assist with recovery, as well as emotional support from the online forum.

- **Conclusions**: Women face dual risks when they experience UTIs; the risk f

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: Randomised controlled trial [^115qQwRP]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins, and 50% to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near-patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections while minimizing antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values. We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives.

Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesized that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of management using dipstick or clinical algorithms compared with the alternative management strategies.

### Urinary tract infections and antibiotic use in pregnancy - qualitative analysis of online forum content [^114ijrZ5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

A few women expressed reluctance and questioned the use of antibiotics in pregnancy for the treatment of UTIs. The reasons varied from concerns about teratogenicity, effects on long-term immunity, or personally experiencing antibiotic side effects. For example, Liza was fearful about the effects on the fetus: "I'm petrified that taking amoxicillin will harm baby"! Meanwhile, another website user was concerned about longer-term effects such as the development of allergies in the child.

"Personally, I would be wary of it [antibiotic] because there is a link between taking antibiotics in late-stage pregnancy and the baby having eczema and allergies. I took antibiotics in late pregnancy, and my daughter has multiple food allergies and eczema", stated Tania.

Despite these concerns, expressed by only a small proportion of women, most considered antibiotics to be generally safe. "Antibiotics are one of the few things they are really sure about giving to pregnant women, precisely because we get infections", said Tula.

The majority of women compared the risks of a UTI with the risks of using antibiotics and viewed antibiotics as the safest option for the normal progression of their pregnancy. They drew on their personal experiences of using antibiotics or viewed a prescription as proof that antibiotics were not dangerous. As Carey suggested, "Doc wouldn't prescribe if dangerous. It's more dangerous to leave a UTI, as at its worst it can cause kidney issues and miscarriage". This view meant that some women thought it was better to take antibiotics…

### Prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and associated risk factors for urinary tract infections in pregnant women attending ANC in some integrated health centers in the Buea Health District [^114wYaAg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most frequent infections after respiratory tract infections affecting humans, with over 150 million cases per year. The anatomy of the female urinary tract predisposes women to UTIs more than men. Furthermore, physiological and hormonal changes during pregnancy increase the risk of UTIs in pregnant women. Untreated UTIs in pregnancy can be detrimental to both the mother and child, causing preterm labor, low birth weight, and pyelonephritis. The situation is worrisome because the infection can be asymptomatic. This study investigated the prevalence and risk factors for UTIs, the diagnostic potential of dipstick analyses, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens from pregnant women attending ANC in some Integrated Health Centers (IHCs) in Buea Health District (BHD).

- **Methods**: A structured questionnaire was administered to consenting pregnant women at participating IHCs to collect data on demographic characteristics, risk factors, and symptoms of UTI. Urine samples were collected for dipstick analysis and culture. Antibiograms were performed on the isolates by the disc diffusion method. A bivariate analysis was conducted to investigate the association of risk factors with UTI. Chi-square (χ²) tests and odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were used to compare statistics and test for associations at a significant level of p ≤ 0.05.

- **Results**: Of the 287 participants recruited, 89 (31%) were positive for UTI. There were 150 women with no symptoms, of whom 43 (28.7%) were positive for UTI. E. coli was the most frequent…

### Influence of perinatal antibiotic on neonatal gut microbiota: a prospective cohort study [^114DBy5V]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

In the present study, urinary tract infections (UTIs) were the predominant reason for maternal antibiotic prescription, accounting for 33.7% (27) of the cases, which aligns with the findings of a global survey, where UTIs were the most frequently treated infection at 67.9%. The findings of this study offer an insightful comparison of the maternal antibiotic usage patterns reported for the ME and IME groups, shedding light on regional and cohort-specific variations in antibiotic prescribing practices during pregnancy. Stokholm et al. (2022) noted the predominant use of macrolides (2%), nitrofurantoin (1%), penicillin (15%), and ampicillin derivatives (6%). This study revealed a comparable trend with specific antibiotics such as cotrimoxazole, clindamycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam, each of which was administered to 13.3% of the participants in both the ME group and the IME group. This consistent use underscores the critical role these antibiotics play in managing infections during pregnancy, reflecting targeted approaches to antibiotic therapy on the basis of their effectiveness and safety profiles.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections - United States, 2014 [^1148qjMZ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, pregnancies and UTI diagnoses were identified based on diagnosis and procedure codes; LMP dates, delivery dates, and UTI diagnoses were not validated, which could result in misclassification concerning the length of gestation, type of infection, the occurrence or timing of UTIs, and the dispensing of antibiotics. Some women might have also had concomitant infections, potentially affecting the type of antibiotic prescribed.

Second, pregnancies might not have been recognized by the provider or the patient at the time of UTI diagnosis and treatment. Third, these data did not allow identification of clinically appropriate nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment based on urine culture or antibiotic testing. Fourth, the MarketScan Commercial Database is a convenience sample and is not generalizable to the U.S. population. Finally, antibiotic prescriptions paid for out-of-pocket were not included.

The CDC's analysis of a large insurance claims database demonstrated that, in 2014, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were common treatments for women with UTIs during their first trimester of pregnancy. Improving antibiotic selection is an important aspect of antibiotic stewardship, and these antibiotics have potential risks associated with early pregnancy use, particularly during organogenesis. Given the recommendations to avoid these medications in early pregnancy if possible and the fact that nearly 50% of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, it is important to evaluate and improve prescribing practices.

### Lower urinary tract infections: Management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic re-prescription in primary care [^116MgLK6]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

A urine sample for microbiological investigation is recommended in all children under 3 months, all children under 16, pregnant women, and all men. An annual average increase in urine sampling for culture of 3% has been reported. We found that microbiological investigation is not being carried out as recommended. However, even if microbiological examination and/or culture were coded for one in four of all episodes of UTI in patients older than 3 months, we cannot exclude lack of recording of this information by some GPs.

As in previous studies, we investigated antibiotic re-prescription as a measure of treatment effectiveness. Because this approach has limitations, we used different definitions of re-prescription: the earliest subsequent prescription of a UTI-specific antibiotic issued within 4–28 days after the initial antibiotic prescription in the primary analysis; and within 6–28 and 8–28 days in sensitivity analyses. However, because of lack of linkage to hospital and emergency services, we did not consider progression of UTI to pyelonephritis and sepsis in the definition of re-prescription and might have missed some events. The percentage of patients re-prescribed antibiotics after an index prescription for the same UTI episode was low (3–4%), but this still represents over 3000 patients each year. We also found evidence of a statistically significant, gradual increase in antibiotic re-prescription over the five years covered by the study. Previous studies have reported rates ranging between 2% when failure requiring hospitalization was studied in a population-based setting.

### No. 250-recurrent urinary tract infection [^116ndaBk]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women, specifically with respect to antibiotic prophylaxis, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend offering postcoital prophylaxis as an alternative to continuous therapy. This approach aims to minimize costs and side effects in patients with rUTIs associated with sexual intercourse.

Regarding the specific circumstances of acute pyelonephritis in pregnant patients, particularly in relation to antibiotic therapy, the ACOG 2023 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to guide management after the treatment of pyelonephritis during pregnancy. It is recommended to consider initiating suppressive therapy for the remainder of the pregnancy, similar to the approach for recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs).

### Effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin vs single-dose fosfomycin on clinical resolution of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women: A randomized clinical trial [^115GiqJ8]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Use of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin has increased since guidelines began recommending them as first-line therapy for lower urinary tract infection (UTI).

The objective was to compare the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin in women with uncomplicated cystitis.

This multinational, open-label, analyst-blinded, randomized clinical trial included 513 nonpregnant women aged 18 years and older. These participants presented with symptoms of lower UTI, such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, or suprapubic tenderness. They had a positive urine dipstick result, indicating nitrites or leukocyte esterase, and no known colonization or previous infection with uropathogens resistant to the study antibiotics. The recruitment occurred from October 2013 through April 2017 at hospital units and outpatient clinics in Geneva, Switzerland; Lodz, Poland; and Petah-Tiqva, Israel.

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral nitrofurantoin, 100 mg three times a day for 5 days, or a single 3-g dose of oral fosfomycin. They returned 14 and 28 days after therapy completion for clinical evaluation and urine culture collection.

The primary outcome was the clinical response in the 28 days following therapy completion. Clinical response was defined as clinical resolution (complete resolution of symptoms and signs of UTI without prior failure), failure (need for additional or change in antibiotic treatment due to UTI or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy), or indeterminate (persistence of symptoms without objective evidence of infection).

### Amoxicillin-clavulanate vs ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women: a randomized trial [^115JHQBP]. JAMA (2005). High credibility.

The high prevalence of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials among Escherichia coli causing acute cystitis in women has led to increased use of alternative antibiotics. One such antibiotic, amoxicillin-clavulanate, has not been well studied.

- **Objective**: To compare the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of amoxicillin-clavulanate to that of a 3-day regimen of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute cystitis in women. The primary study hypothesis was that the amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin treatment groups would differ in clinical cure.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: This was a randomized, single-blind treatment trial involving 370 women, aged 18 to 45 years, with symptoms of acute uncomplicated cystitis. Participants had a urine culture with at least 10² colony-forming units of uropathogens per milliliter from a university student health center or a health maintenance organization.

- **Interventions**: Women were randomly assigned to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (500 mg/125 mg twice daily) or ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) for 3 days. They were followed up for 4 months.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome measure was clinical cure. Secondary study outcomes of interest were microbiological cure and vaginal E. coli colonization at the 2-week follow-up visit.

- **Results**: Clinical cure was observed in 93 (58%) of 160 women treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with 124 (77%) of 162 women treated with ciprofloxacin (p < 0.001). Amoxicillin-clavulanate was not as effective as ciprofloxacin, even among women infected with strains susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^116zLC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often need to select antibiotics for patients who are reported to have an antibiotic allergy. For penicillins, the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing for predicting serious allergic reactions is excellent. For other beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin skin testing is useful for excluding the possibility of sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring. For other antibiotics, the patient history remains the most useful tool for determining whether a serious reaction is likely to occur with further drug exposure.

The cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is probably no higher than the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other classes of antibiotics. When a patient has a suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy, desensitization therapy should be considered if the efficacy of alternate antibiotics is in doubt. For the treatment of serious infections, it is usually possible to safely administer the antibiotic of choice despite a history of possible antibiotic allergy.
