## Question

I wonder if it's helpful to take antibiotics before traveling so I won't get traveler's diarrhea. Could you give me an overview of possible reasons to use prophylactic antibiotics?

Assistant: Prophylactic antibiotics are sometimes considered to reduce the likelihood of traveler's diarrhea, but recommendations vary. Possible factors include:

### 1. Travel Destination Risk
- **Reason**: Places with high rates of contaminated food or water may have increased traveler's diarrhea cases.
- **Guidance**: Prophylaxis may be more commonly discussed if the region is known for frequent bacterial infections.

### 2. Resistance Patterns
- **Reason**: Some antibiotics might not be effective if there is local bacterial resistance.
- **Guidance**: Checking local or regional guidelines is often recommended.

### 3. Duration & Purpose of Trip
- **Reason**: Short, leisure visits vs. extended stays in remote areas can influence the decision.
- **Guidance**: A week-long resort stay may be different from backpacking for a month in rural regions.

### 4. Underlying Medical Conditions
- **Reason**: Individuals with compromised immunity might consider prophylaxis more seriously.
- **Guidance**: Chronic illnesses or weakened immune systems can place travelers at higher risk.

### 5. Possible Side Effects
- **Reason**: Taking antibiotics unnecessarily can lead to adverse effects or increased resistance.
- **Guidance**: Weigh the risks of antibiotic use against the benefit of preventing diarrhea.

### 6. Official Guidelines
- **Reason**: Health organizations (like CDC) have varying guidance based on local data.
- **Guidance**: Recommendations differ by destination and traveler's health status.

Are there any specifics about your trip, such as location or health concerns, that might help clarify?

Is it relevant which country I'm visiting? I'm not really sure about any local antibiotic resistance issues yet. Does that factor in when deciding whether to take them or not?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether taking antibiotics before travel helps prevent traveler's diarrhea and, if so, in whom and how to choose an agent. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline risk of traveler's diarrhea and whether prevention is even necessary. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about routine antibiotic prophylaxis. Next, I will examine the evidence for effectiveness and safety, including resistance and microbiome effects. After that, I need to identify the narrow scenarios where prophylaxis might be reasonable. Finally, I will consider alternatives like bismuth subsalicylate and outline a practical, stewardship-aligned approach with self-treatment plans and counseling points [^5c3a972b] [^f38e2e5f] [^17cfed11].

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk so I don't jump to conclusions. Traveler's diarrhea remains common in high-risk destinations, historically around 20–60% for a 2-week stay, though improved hygiene has reduced risk in some regions to roughly 8–20% in parts of the world, which still represents substantial morbidity and itinerary disruption for many travelers [^5c3a972b] [^da549991].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance before discussing exceptions. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same message — routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for most travelers due to limited net benefit and meaningful harms, including resistance acquisition and adverse effects [^f38e2e5f] [^17cfed11] [^a1b9d8e6].

> I will now examine the effectiveness data to ensure I'm not overstating the case. Rifaximin has randomized data showing about 72–77% relative risk reduction in high-incidence settings, which sounds impressive, but wait, let me verify the clinical context: this benefit must be weighed against microbiome disruption and the fact that rifaximin does not cover invasive pathogens like Campylobacter or Shigella, so it is not a universal shield and may leave travelers vulnerable to dysentery in some regions [^a09580b0] [^72aa115c].

> I need to check safety and resistance trade-offs carefully. Antibiotic exposure during travel increases colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms, including ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and this risk persists after return; even nonabsorbed agents like rifaximin can perturb the gut ecosystem and facilitate colonization, so the ecological harm is real and not trivial [^15c1668b] [^dab80826] [^76597cac].

> But wait, what if the traveler is in a high-risk group where the balance shifts? I should confirm the narrow indications where prophylaxis may be considered: immunocompromised hosts, those with serious chronic illness where a diarrheal illness would be catastrophic, or very short, high-stakes trips where even a brief illness is unacceptable; in these scenarios, if used, rifaximin is the preferred agent given its favorable safety and minimal systemic absorption, and fluoroquinolones are specifically discouraged for prophylaxis due to toxicity and resistance concerns [^3a5af758] [^2be17c7d] [^012cc223] [^30235c1e].

> Let me consider alternatives because prophylaxis is usually off the table. Bismuth subsalicylate offers moderate protection, around 40–60% in some studies, and is a reasonable non-antibiotic option for travelers who can adhere to frequent dosing and have no salicylate contraindications; probiotics lack consistent benefit for prevention and are not recommended by major guidelines, so I should not overpromise on them [^54bb9bc6] [^7e7232f1] [^838e2396].

> I should double-check the practical approach so travelers are prepared. The standard of care is pretravel counseling on safe food and water, hand hygiene where relevant, and provision of a self-treatment kit with loperamide and a single-dose or short-course antibiotic tailored to destination resistance patterns — azithromycin in South/Southeast Asia due to fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter, and rifaximin or a fluoroquinolone elsewhere for noninvasive E. coli–predominant disease — with clear instructions to treat moderate to severe illness promptly while avoiding antibiotics for mild cases [^5c3a972b] [^f9f2b904] [^3314444e].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric and pregnancy nuances so I don't overgeneralize. For children, routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended and evidence is limited; bismuth subsalicylate is not advised in young children due to salicylate risks, and breastfeeding remains protective with supportive rehydration prioritized; in pregnancy, if prophylaxis is absolutely necessary, azithromycin is preferred given safety considerations [^4c524ad6] [^ae306c9a] [^30235c1e].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. No, for most travelers it is not helpful to take antibiotics before travel to prevent traveler's diarrhea because the harms outweigh the benefits; prophylaxis may be considered only in select high-risk hosts or mission-critical short trips, and if used, rifaximin is the agent of choice within a stewardship framework that still prioritizes safe food and water practices and self-treatment readiness rather than routine chemoprophylaxis [^f38e2e5f] [^2be17c7d] [^5c3a972b].

---

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea is **not recommended** for most travelers because of limited benefit and meaningful risks, including antibiotic resistance, C. difficile infection, and adverse effects [^f38e2e5f] [^a1b9d8e6]. Prophylaxis may be considered only for **high-risk travelers** (e.g. immunocompromised, chronic GI disease, or those whose trip would be severely impacted by illness) and, if used, should be short-term with rifaximin or bismuth subsalicylate [^3a5af758] [^2be17c7d] [^54bb9bc6]. For most, emphasize safe food/water, hand hygiene, and carry self-treatment antibiotics for moderate-to-severe illness [^5c3a972b] [^7e7232f1].

---

## Effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis

Antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of traveler's diarrhea by about 50–90% [^a1b9d8e6], depending on the agent and destination [^46b2d9c0]. Rifaximin, a nonabsorbable antibiotic, is **effective against noninvasive E. coli** — the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea — and has minimal systemic absorption, which may reduce adverse effects [^a09580b0] [^3a059d99]. However, prophylaxis does not protect against invasive pathogens (e.g. Campylobacter, Shigella) and may be less effective in regions with high resistance rates [^72aa115c].

---

## Risks and limitations of antibiotic prophylaxis

While antibiotic prophylaxis is effective, several **risks and limitations** must be considered:

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Prophylactic antibiotics can promote colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, posing long-term health risks [^15c1668b] [^d0131239].

- **Adverse effects**: Antibiotics can cause gastrointestinal disturbances, allergic reactions, and rare but serious complications such as Clostridioides difficile infection [^a1b9d8e6].

- **Limited spectrum**: Rifaximin does not cover invasive bacterial pathogens, necessitating alternative antibiotics for severe or dysenteric illness [^72aa115c].

- **Ethical considerations**: Routine prophylaxis contributes to global antibiotic resistance, undermining public health efforts [^d0131239].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Major professional organizations, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), and the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM), **do not recommend routine antibiotic prophylaxis** for traveler's diarrhea [^f38e2e5f] [^17cfed11]. Instead, they advocate for:

- **Non-antibiotic measures**: Emphasis on safe food and water practices, hand hygiene, and traveler education [^7e7232f1] [^ea9fd6f6].

- **Self-treatment**: Carrying antibiotics for empiric treatment of moderate-to-severe traveler's diarrhea, with rifaximin, fluoroquinolones, or azithromycin as appropriate based on destination and clinical context [^5c3a972b] [^f9f2b904].

- **Selective prophylaxis**: Consideration of prophylaxis only for high-risk travelers, such as those with immunocompromise, chronic gastrointestinal disease, or those undertaking critical short-term missions where illness would have significant consequences [^3a5af758] [^742497a0].

---

## Situations where prophylaxis may be considered

Prophylaxis may be considered in **specific scenarios**:

| **Situation** | **Rationale** | **Recommended agent** |
|-|-|-|
| Immunocompromised travelers | High risk of severe complications from traveler's diarrhea | Rifaximin or bismuth subsalicylate |
| Chronic gastrointestinal disease (e.g. IBD) | Increased susceptibility to severe diarrhea | Rifaximin or bismuth subsalicylate |
| Critical short-term missions (e.g. military, diplomatic) | Significant impact of illness on mission success | Rifaximin or bismuth subsalicylate |
| Pregnant travelers | Limited safe options; azithromycin preferred if prophylaxis is deemed necessary | Azithromycin (limited data) |

---

## Alternative preventive strategies

Given the limitations of antibiotic prophylaxis, **alternative preventive strategies** are recommended:

- **Safe food and water practices**: Avoiding high-risk foods, drinking bottled or treated water, and practicing hand hygiene [^7e7232f1] [^ea9fd6f6].

- **Bismuth subsalicylate**: Moderately effective in preventing traveler's diarrhea, suitable for travelers who can adhere to frequent dosing [^54bb9bc6] [^7e7232f1].

- **Probiotics**: Limited evidence supports their use in preventing traveler's diarrhea, and they are not routinely recommended [^838e2396] [^3c202757].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea is **not recommended** for most travelers due to limited benefit and significant risks, including antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Prophylaxis may be considered for high-risk travelers, with rifaximin or bismuth subsalicylate as preferred agents. For the general population, emphasize safe food and water practices, hand hygiene, and self-treatment strategies for moderate-to-severe illness.

Purpose Of Review

Travelers' diarrhea, affecting millions of travelers every year globally, continues to be a leading cause of morbidity despite advances in vaccination, prevention, and treatment. Complications of travelers' diarrhea often present to gastroenterologists and some patients followed by gastroenterologists are at higher risk of developing travelers' diarrhea. This review will provide an update on recent progress made in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of travelers' diarrhea.

Recent Findings

Most causes of travelers' diarrhea remain bacterial, but newly recognized pathogens are emerging. Patient-related and travel-related factors affect disease development risk and should guide prophylaxis and treatment. Although specific vaccines are being developed, they have not yet had a major impact on travelers' diarrhea, and understanding their roles and limitations is especially important. Prophylaxis and treatment of populations at risk (children, chronically ill patients, and those on immunosuppressive medications) remain challenging and require a tailored approach.

Summary

Travelers' diarrhea will continue to challenge patients and physicians despite the use of sanitation advice, prophylactic vaccines, and treatment with antibiotics. Effects may extend beyond the time of travel, such as postinfectious complications and exacerbation of preexisting disease. Future research should focus on novel strategies for reducing exposure to pathogens, vaccine development, early detection, and targeted treatments.

The prevention of traveler's diarrhea by use of pharmacologic agents has been of great interest since the early 1960s. It was not until the discovery of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli as the dominant causative organism of travelers' diarrhea, however, that rational antimicrobial therapy could be studied. Selected antimicrobials have proven to be highly efficacious, but, by consensus, are not widely used.

### Drug prophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea [^d5476105]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Travelers' diarrhea is the most common health impairment in persons visiting developing countries, affecting 20% to > 50% of tourists. Although it is usually benign, travelers' diarrhea represents a considerable socioeconomic burden for both the traveler and the host country. The most common enteropathogens are enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. Travelers' compliance with dietary precautionary measures is poor. Despite the excellent protection rates provided by antibiotics, routine administration of prophylaxis is currently not recommended because of potential adverse reactions. Of the various antibiotics that have been tested, quinolones are considered to be the first choice worldwide; however, quinolone-resistant pathogens are increasingly being isolated. Because it is frequently administered and provides only moderate protection, bismuth subsalicylate is not considered a recommendable option for prophylaxis in Europe, where it is rarely available anyhow. To date, no probiotic has been able to demonstrate clinically relevant protection worldwide. In conclusion, there is no satisfactory prophylactic option, and worldwide monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the search for novel antimicrobial agents, such as nonabsorbed antibiotics, and nonantibiotic medications should continue.

### Post-travel diarrhea | Yellow book… [^0044aa41]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathogenesis While acute travelers' diarrhea is usually self-limited and the etiologies are mostly infectious pathogens, the pathogenesis of persistent diarrhea in returned travelers generally falls into one of the following broad categories:

- Ongoing infection or co-infection with a second organism not targeted by initial therapy;
- Previously undiagnosed GI disease unmasked by the enteric infection; or
- A post-infectious phenomenon. Ongoing infection Most cases of TD are the result of bacterial or viral infection and are short-lived and self-limited. In addition to prolonged symptoms of typical pathogens among immunosuppressed persons and sequential infection with different pathogens, ongoing infection with parasites can cause prolonged diarrheal symptoms. Table 10.
4. 1 lists common bacterial, viral, and protozoal pathogens causing TD.

Occasionally, onset of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms occurs after a bout of acute gastroenteritis, known as post-infectious IBS. PI-IBS symptoms can occur after an episode of gastroenteritis or TD. The clinical workup for microbial pathogens and underlying GI disease in patients with PI-IBS will be negative. Whether using antibiotics to treat acute TD increases or decreases the likelihood of PI-IBS is unknown. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is characterized by an excess of bacteria in the small intestine and is associated with intestinal motility disorders. Symptoms may include IBS-type symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, persistent diarrhea, or flatulence, and, in some cases, manifestations of nutrient malabsorption. Diagnosis is by carbohydrate breath testing, and treatment is with antibiotics. Evaluation Traditional methods of microbial diagnosis of diarrheal illness include stool culture, antigen detection using enzyme immunoassays, and microscopy.

For detection of bacteria, routine stool culture will identify. Management For persistent diarrhea, specific treatment of identified enteropathogens is usually indicated and appropriate management of underlying GI disease is warranted. In cases where bacterial infection is suspected, or determined by culture-independent testing, stool culture can determine antimicrobial susceptibility. Dietary modifications might help patients with malabsorption or lactose intolerance. Symptomatic treatment or the use of nonabsorbable antibiotics offers potential benefit if small intestinal bacterial overgrowth accompanies the symptom complex.

### Traveler's diarrhea [^da549991]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is the most important health issue among international travelers. In high risk areas, 50–90% of travelers may experience an episode of TD. The risk of acquiring TD is influenced by factors such as the destination, duration of stay, standard of accommodation, type of travel, age of the traveler, and also by individual risk factors. Most cases of TD are caused by bacteria; treatment for TD are loperamide and antibiotics. Preventive strategies such as hygiene measures have limited impact. Prophylactic intake of antibiotics or vaccines to prevent from TD can be considered in special situations.

### Travelers' diarrhea: antimicrobial therapy and chemoprevention [^72aa115c]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

The use of preventive measures and self-treatment for travelers' diarrhea is routine in regions where the occurrence of diarrhea is predictably high. People traveling to these areas who do not exercise care in their selection of consumed foods and beverages will suffer high rates of illness. Such diarrhea normally affects the traveler for a day, although it can result in chronic postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. Although systemic antibacterial drugs are effective in preventing diarrhea, their use is not routinely recommended because of side effects and their importance as a therapy for extra-intestinal infections. This review focuses on current and future uses of antibacterial drugs in the prevention and therapy of travelers' diarrhea. Minimally absorbed (< 0.4%) rifaximin can effectively reduce the occurrence of travelers' diarrhea without side effects. Bismuth subsalicylate is a useful alternative, although it is less effective than rifaximin for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea and the required doses are less convenient. All people who travel to high-risk areas should take curative antimicrobial agents with them for self-treatment of illness: rifaximin 200 mg three times a day for 3 days, or an absorbable agent such as a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin taken in a single dose initially, with the need for a second or third dose determined by clinical response. Loperamide (up to 8 mg per day for ≤ 2 days) can be given with the antibiotic to offer rapid symptomatic improvement. In the future, the ability to evaluate the genetic risk of illness acquisition might allow person-specific recommendations to be made.

Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea — An NIH-sponsored consensus meeting concluded that routine antibiotic chemoprophylaxis should not be used, and subsequent evaluations have recommended against prophylaxis except in high-risk groups, with standard practice unchanged for 20 years. Developments challenging this stance include recognition that postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome is an important chronic health consequence after TD and the availability of rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic that may provide a safer alternative than fluoroquinolones; however, safety concerns with antibiotic use of any class remain an important consideration.

ACG Clinical Guideline — prevention and prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea: Patient level counseling on prevention of acute enteric infection is not routinely recommended but may be considered in the individual or close contacts of the individual who is at high risk for complications. Individuals should undergo pretravel counseling regarding high-risk food/beverage avoidance to prevent traveler's diarrhea. Frequent and effective hand washing and alcohol-based hand sanitizers are of limited value in preventing most forms of traveler's diarrhea but may be useful where low-dose pathogens are responsible for the illness as for example during a cruise ship outbreak of norovirus infection, institutional outbreak, or in endemic diarrhea prevention. Bismuth subsalicylates have moderate effectiveness and may be considered for travelers who do not have any contraindications to use and can adhere to the frequent dosing requirements. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for prevention of TD are not recommended. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis has moderate to good effectiveness and may be considered in high-risk groups for short-term use.

### Emerging concepts in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of travelers' diarrhea [^76597cac]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Traveller's diarrhea, though not life-threatening. is often a vexing problem, which impacts overall function of the traveller while on holiday. Increasing data is available regarding molecular diagnostic techniques, which may help obtain an early etiologic diagnosis. Use of antibiotics for traveller's diarrhea is controversial in this era of multidrug resistance and microbiome disruption.

Recent Findings

Travel to the tropics promotes gut colonization with drug-resistant bacteria and this risk increases after treatment with antibiotics, leading to potential ecological impacts in the country of residence.

Summary

Traveller's diarrhea is common and can impact a traveller's itinerary leading to significant inconvenience, and occasional longer term sequelae. Though bacterial causes predominate, recommended treatment is conservative in mild-to-moderate cases. Molecular techniques for early diagnosis of traveller's diarrhea may help with appropriate management. Treatment with antibiotics is sometimes required but is associated with gut colonization by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

### Traveler's diarrhea: a clinical review [^5c3a972b]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute diarrhea is the most common illness that affects travelers to low-income regions of the world. Although improved hygiene has reduced the risk of traveler's diarrhea in many destinations, the risk remains high in others.

Objective

To review the current state of knowledge on the etiology, risk factors, prevention, and management of traveler's diarrhea.

Evidence Review

A search of the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases for the period 2012-April 2014 was performed for articles on traveler's diarrhea. The database search yielded 2976 articles, of which 37 were included in this review. These were added to 85 articles previously identified by the authors.

Findings

Improved hygiene has reduced the risk of traveler's diarrhea from 20% or more (for a 2-week stay) to between 8% and 20% in some parts of the world. Acquiring traveler's diarrhea causes 12% to 46% of travelers to change their travel plans. Returning travelers seeking medical care have a diagnosis of gastrointestinal disturbance in approximately one-third of all cases. Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome may occur in 3% to 17% of patients who have had traveler's diarrhea. Prevention of traveler's diarrhea by dietary avoidance measures is often not successful. Chemoprophylaxis should be restricted to travelers who are at risk of severe complications of diarrhea. Ciprofloxacin is the standard treatment in self-therapy of traveler's diarrhea except when patients are in South or Southeast Asia, where azithromycin is preferred.

Conclusions and Relevance

Diarrhea remains a common problem for international travelers. Persons intending to travel to at-risk countries should be counseled regarding prevention measures and may be given a travel pack that includes medications for self-treatment should they become ill.

### Traveller's diarrhoea [^ec20fd00]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Traveller's diarrhoea affects over 50% of travellers to some destinations and can disrupt holidays and business trips. This review examines the main causes and epidemiology of the syndrome, which is associated with poor public health infrastructure and hygiene practices, particularly in warmer climates. Although travellers may be given common sense advice on avoidance of high-risk foods and other measures to prevent traveller's diarrhoea, adherence to such advice is sometimes difficult and the evidence for its effectiveness is contradictory. However, non-antimicrobial means for prevention of traveller's diarrhoea are favoured in most settings. A simple stepwise approach to the management of traveller's diarrhoea includes single doses or 3-day courses of antimicrobials, often self administered. The antibiotics of choice are currently fluoroquinolones or azithromycin, with an emerging role for rifaximin. In the long term, there will be greater benefit and effect on the health of local inhabitants and travellers from improving public health and hygiene standards at tourist destinations.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^f927eebd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute and persistent watery diarrhea is generally discouraged: in most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, empiric antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), with an exception that may be made in people who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

### New insights and directions in travelers' diarrhea [^f1c0297d]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Since first studied more than 5 decades ago the risk of travelers'diarrhea for persons going from industrialized regions to developing countries has remained high. Most cases of illness are caused by bacterial agents. Travelers' diarrhea is associated with temporary disability and it may progress to chronic intestinal illness and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. Exercising care about food and beverage intake, the use of rifaximin prophylaxis for selective patients, and self-treatment of all resultant illness will continue to be the way in which the disease is prevented or managed best by travelers. Future approaches will be aimed at making host regions safer and providing more effective methods of treatment and prevention of enteric disease during short-term international travel.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^d2e64e4d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Acute diarrheal infections are a common health problem globally and among both individuals in the United States and traveling to developing world countries. Multiple modalities including antibiotic and non-antibiotic therapies have been used to address these common infections. Information on treatment, prevention, diagnostics, and the consequences of acute diarrhea infection has emerged and helps to inform clinical management. In this ACG Clinical Guideline, the authors present an evidence-based approach to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of acute diarrhea infection in both US-based and travel settings.

### Update in traveler's diarrhea [^d2fbc8b7]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

TD has not proved as preventable as hoped, despite knowing that it is transmitted mainly through food. Travelers have little ability to select restaurants based on the kitchen hygiene. The rates of TD in travelers to developing countries have not changed in the past 50 years, either because the dietary precautions they are taught are not effective or they cannot be adhered to in the course of a pleasurable vacation. Nonantibiotic prophylaxis with bismuth subsalicylate has the potential to prevent 40% to 60% of TD episodes in short-term travelers, and is probably underused. Antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent up to 90% of infections, but is not routinely recommended. Empiric treatment of TD has been the best approach to dealing with this problem, but its usefulness is being undermined by growing antibiotic resistance in many parts of the world. Fluoroquinolones are still the most useful agents where Campylobacter is not a predominant pathogen. Rifaximin may prove to be a useful addition to the options for treatment and prophylaxis. If used for treatment, it may require a backup antibiotic in areas where Campylobacter and Shigella are prominent pathogens.

### Therapy for and prevention of traveler's diarrhea [^10ad652d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea associated with international travel is commonly caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, or noroviruses. Early studies to define these enteropathogens took place at the University of Maryland during the Theodore E. Woodward years. Although a reduction in the rate of diarrhea may be possible through avoidance of foods and beverages likely to be contaminated, a more effective preventive strategy is to administer nonabsorbed (< 0.4%) rifaximin each day during trips to areas where the risk of traveler's diarrhea is high (i.e., high-risk areas). For the self-treatment of diarrhea that occurs during travel, all persons planning trips to high-risk areas should take with them medication with expected activity against the prevalent bacterial enteropathogens: rifaximin (for the treatment of common afebrile, nondysenteric diarrhea), a fluoroquinolone, or azithromycin. Further study is needed to determine whether it is possible to avoid important morbidity associated with diarrhea and the development of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome with chemoprophylaxis and/or early effective treatment.

### Advising travelers about immunizations and diarrhea… [^a83d52c2]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Patients who are planning foreign travel often seek advice about immunizations and prevention of traveler's diarrhea and malaria. Medical Letter consultants summarized the current recommendations for these and other conditions, suggesting several new sources of complete medical information for travelers. Medical Letter consultants generally do not recommend prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea. Prophylactic prescriptive agents such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin or norfloxacin can cause photosensitivity, and over-the-counter bismuth subsalicylate is less effective than an antibiotic. Rather, they suggest treatment only for severe or persistent symptoms. Loperamide hydrochloride, along with a single dose of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin or ofloxacin, usually provides symptomatic relief in adults in less than 24 hours. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is safe for use in children.

Oral rehydration salts help maintain fluid balance, particularly in young children and the elderly. Specific recommendations for immunizations were listed by disease type, including cholera, hepatitis A and B, influenza, measles, meningitis, polio, typhoid, yellow fever and malaria. The parenteral vaccine for cholera is not recommended because of its limited effectiveness and association with adverse reactions. Travelers going anywhere outside the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia or New Zealand are encouraged to obtain a hepatitis A vaccination. However, only persons at "high risk" and those who may require medical or dental care in endemic areas require vaccination for hepatitis B. Vaccination against influenza is recommended for all persons at high risk of complications and for those traveling to the tropics or to the Southern Hemisphere between April and September.

Prophylaxis for malaria includes a dose of 300 mg base of chloroquine once a week in areas with chloroquine-sensitive malaria. In areas of chloroquine-resistant malaria, 250 mg of mefloquine once a week is the drug of choice, except in the Thai-Cambodian and Thai-Myanmar border areas and western Cambodia, where mefloquine resistance is common. In these areas, doxycycline is an alternative treatment for persons older than 8 years of age who are not pregnant. Additional recommendations for malaria prophylaxis in adults and children were published in the January 2, 1998, edition of.

### Antimicrobials increase travelers' risk of colonization by extended-spectrum betalactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^15c1668b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

There are 2 major tools for avoiding colonization by resistant intestinal bacteria while traveling: prevention of TD and restriction of the use of antimicrobials against TD. As the means to prevent TD have not been very successful, greater attention should be aimed at educating travelers to be more cautious in their use of antibiotics. We propose the following principles: antimicrobials should not be prescribed as prophylaxis against TD, and mild and moderate disease should, in general, not be treated with antimicrobials. In addition to guidelines on prevention of colonization, infection control measures applied to returning travelers at hospitals in low-prevalence countries should also be revised to adopt a risk-based approach.

INTRODUCTION

Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is the most common illness experienced by international travelers and can occur during travel to any part of the world. Travel destination heavily influences the incidence rate of TD. Travelers to developing countries have an incidence rate of 20% per 2-week stay, whereas those traveling to low-risk areas (United States, Western Europe, and Australia) have a < 8% per 2-week stay TD incidence. Although mortality from TD is low, TD can cause significant incapacitation both during and after travel. Thirty percent of travelers to high-risk areas can become incapacitated from TD and may not be able to participate in planned activities for up to 24 hours. In addition, the evidence increasingly suggests a link between TD and the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

With the high incidence of TD among international travelers and its associated morbidity, it is important to counsel travelers on TD prevention measures. Currently, TD prevention strategies are focused on food and water restrictions and chemoprophylaxis. Currently, there is no antibiotic with an approved indication for TD prophylaxis. In the previous two decades, rifaximin, a nonabsorbable antibiotic with a favorable safety profile, has demonstrated moderate efficacy in TD prevention. In the 1970s–1980s, doxycycline was commonly prescribed as TD prophylaxis. Multiple studies showed that taking daily doxycycline during travel significantly reduced the incidence of TD. By the mid-1980s, doxycycline resistance began to emerge, especially in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). – Therefore, the 1985 National Institute of Health Consensus Statement on TD recommended early treatment strategies for TD over the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Furthermore, they did not recommend doxycycline as an early treatment strategy.

Doxycycline is still commonly used for malaria prophylaxis among international travelers. With changes in resistance patterns of enteric pathogens, it is unclear what effect doxycycline currently has on the development of TD. – We examined a cohort of travelers who received various malaria-preventive strategies, seeking to evaluate whether the use of doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis was associated with a decreased risk of TD during international travel.

### As far as travelers' risk of acquiring resistant intestinal microbes is considered, no antibiotics (absorbable or nonabsorbable) are safe [^dab80826]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

 — I warmly thank Drs Bradley Connor and Jay Keystone for their meritorious editorial commentary on our research showing that antibiotic use predisposes travelers to colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). They cogitate about fundamental problems associated with refraining from antibiotics for travelers' diarrhea (TD), listing potential alternative approaches. Acknowledging their valuable discussion on the whole, I was, however, concerned about one proposition — chemoprophylaxis with nonabsorbable antibiotics as an alternative — which essentially contradicts our purport, caution with antibiotics.

Although attacking the pathogen, antimicrobials also kill innocent bystanders, members of microbiota providing colonization resistance against invaders. Disrupting this barrier within the gut, antibiotics — absorbable or not — make space for newcomers. Rifaximin, a nonabsorbable antimicrobial used, for example, for TD, has a broad-spectrum in vitro activity against aerobic and anaerobic, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. From our present perspective, the broader the spectrum, the greater the damage. Although possibly less efficient than fluoroquinolones and azithromycin in selecting multidrug-resistant microbes, rifaximin ultimately functions like any antimicrobial: it opens a door to local newcomers. When taken in an environment with a high prevalence of (multi)resistant intestinal bacteria plus poor hygiene, the newcomers inevitably also include resistant bacteria. Therefore, with respect to colonization, nonabsorbables are not safe for travelers, either; and prophylactic antimicrobials against TD would, indeed, be the last alternative, putting anyone involved at an unnecessary risk.

### Travelers' diarrhea [^2b7a409d]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Travelers' diarrhea affects 20–60% of travelers to low-income regions of the world. Much of the evidence for the clinical description and management of travelers' diarrhea was generated years ago, however, there is new information on geographic and host risk, etiology, and prevention strategies.

Recent Findings

Travel to South Asia, followed by sub-Saharan Africa and South America, carries the highest risk for diarrheal syndromes in returned travelers. Women are more susceptible to travel-related diarrhea than men. Host genetic studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the lactoferrin, osteoprotegerin, and IL-10 genes are associated with small but increased risks for diarrhea and enteric pathogens. Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis is likely to be a new agent identified as causing travelers' diarrhea, and heat-stable toxin-producing Escherichia coli appears to be more common than heat-labile toxin E. coli. Overall levels of sanitation at the travel destination, including individual eating establishments, are strong predictors for acquisition of travelers' diarrhea. A new transdermal LT vaccine shows promise in modifying the severity of travelers' diarrhea. It remains uncertain whether prophylaxis or prompt self-treatment of travelers' diarrhea will prevent late-onset irritable bowel syndrome. For self-treatment, azithromycin is the drug of choice in travelers to areas where there is a high risk of fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter spp., such as South and Southeast Asia and possibly North Africa, Central and South America.

Summary

There is increased understanding of the determinants of travelers' diarrhea. Despite this travelers' diarrhea remains one of the most common illnesses in travelers. Continued focus on intervention strategies may ultimately lead to decreased incidence.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^c5bd52b1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — treatment of acute disease: The usage of balanced electrolyte rehydration over other oral rehydration options in the elderly with severe diarrhea or any traveler with cholera-like watery diarrhea is recommended. The use of probiotics or prebiotics for the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults is not recommended, except in cases of postantibiotic-associated illness. Bismuth subsalicylates can be administered to control rates of passage of stool and may help travelers function better during bouts of mild-to-moderate illness. In patients receiving antibiotics for traveler's diarrhea, adjunctive loperamide therapy should be administered to decrease duration of diarrhea and increase chance for a cure. The evidence does not support empiric anti-microbial therapy for routine acute diarrheal infection, except in cases of traveler's diarrhea (TD) where the likelihood of bacterial pathogens is high enough to justify the potential side effects of antibiotics.

### Travelers' diarrhea… [^a1b9d8e6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic antibiotics Older controlled studies showed that use of antibiotics reduced diarrhea attack rates by 90%. For almost all travelers, though, the risks associated with the use of prophylactic antibiotics, including side effects, Clostridioides difficile infection, and increased risk of carriage of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, do not outweigh the benefits. Prophylactic antibiotics might rarely be considered for short-term travelers who are high-risk hosts. Antimicrobial resistance and other adverse consequences Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for most travelers. Prophylactic antibiotics afford no protection against nonbacterial pathogens and can remove normally protective microflora from the bowel, increasing the risk for acquisition of resistant bacterial pathogens.

Travelers can become colonized with extended-spectrum beta lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, a risk that is increased by exposure to antibiotics while abroad. Use of prophylactic antibiotics limits therapeutic options if TD occurs; a traveler relying on prophylactic antibiotics will need to carry an alternative antibiotic to use if severe diarrhea develops. Additionally, use of antibiotics has been associated with allergic and other adverse reactions. Antimotility agents alone are not recommended for patients with bloody diarrhea or those who have diarrhea and fever. Loperamide can be used in children, and liquid formulations are available. In practice, however, these drugs are rarely given to children aged < 6 years. Antibiotics The effectiveness of a particular standby antimicrobial drug for self-treatment depends on the etiologic agent and its antibiotic sensitivity.

If tolerated, single-dose regimens are equivalent to multidose regimens and might be more convenient for the traveler. As with rifaximin, travelers taking rifamycin would need to seek medical care or carry a separate antibiotic in case of infection due to an invasive pathogen. Antimicrobial resistance and other adverse consequences Antibiotics are effective in reducing the duration of diarrhea by approximately 1–2 days in cases caused by bacterial pathogens susceptible to the antibiotic prescribed. However, concerns about the adverse consequences of using antibiotics to treat TD remain. Travelers who take antibiotics are at risk of becoming colonized by drug-resistant organisms, resulting in potential harm to travelers — particularly immunocompromised people and people prone to urinary tract infections — and the possibility of introducing resistant bacteria into the community.

### Current concepts in travelers' diarrhea: epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance and treatment [^5ae3d8fa]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review recent advances in travelers' diarrhea, which remains one of the most common health problems afflicting individuals from developed countries visiting less affluent regions of the world.

Recent Findings

A large epidemiologic study done at the point of departure provided insights into regional risk factors for travelers' diarrhea and demonstrated that visitors rarely exercised dietary precautions aimed at disease prevention. A preventive program implemented with the close interaction between public health agencies, hotel industry and academia can result in effective reduction of cases. A polymorphism in the IL-8 gene promoter is associated with susceptibility to diarrhea due to enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. New diagnostic tools assist in better understanding the role of norovirus and emerging bacterial enteric pathogens such as enteroaggregative E. coli. Rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic, is a safe and effective alternative for the prevention and treatment of travelers' diarrhea due to non-invasive organisms.

Summary

Traditional public health and new antimicrobial agents can decrease the risk of travel related diarrhea.

### Traveler's diarrhea [^ab9109e8]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea affects millions of persons who travel to developing countries each year. Food and water contaminated with fecal matter are the main sources of infection. Bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella are common causes of traveler's diarrhea. Parasites and viruses are less common etiologies. Travel destination is the most significant risk factor for traveler's diarrhea. The efficacy of pretravel counseling and dietary precautions in reducing the incidence of diarrhea is unproven. Empiric treatment of traveler's diarrhea with antibiotics and loperamide is effective and often limits symptoms to one day. Rifaximin, a recently approved antibiotic, can be used for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in regions where noninvasive E. coli is the predominant pathogen. In areas where invasive organisms such as Campylobacter and Shigella are common, fluoroquinolones remain the drug of choice. Azithromycin is recommended in areas with quinolone-resistant Campylobacter and for the treatment of children and pregnant women.

### Travellers' diarrhoea [^d56556a1]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is estimated that approximately 30% to 70% of international travellers will develop diarrhoea during their travels or after returning home.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults from resource-rich countries travelling to resource-poor countries? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 24 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (empirical), antibiotics plus antimotility agents, antimotility agents, bismuth subsalicylate, diet, oral rehydration solutions, and racecadotril for travellers' diarrhoea.

### Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in international travelers [^d0131239]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical strategies and interventions

Travel-associated AMR has implications for clinical practice. Medical practitioners should be aware of travel history as a risk factor for AMR. Clinicians providing pretravel health consultation should also consider antimicrobial stewardship principles and be cautious about the prescription of broad-spectrum antimicrobials for empiric use by travelers. Recent analyses have shown that although the occurrence of travelers' diarrhea cannot be controlled for, reducing the use of empiric antimicrobial treatment for travelers' diarrhea may be useful for lowering the acquisition of travel-associated AMR bacteria.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^3314444e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy in acute diarrheal infections (adults) — indications and comparative evidence: Antibiotics should be used for cases of dysentery and moderate-to-severe traveler's diarrhea where the likelihood of bacterial pathogens is high enough to justify the potential side effects of antibiotics (Strong recommendation, high level of evidence), and use of antibiotics for community-acquired diarrhea should be discouraged as most community-acquired diarrhea is viral and is not shortened by antibiotics (Strong recommendation, very low level evidence). For travelers' diarrhea, the evidence for the use of anti-microbial therapy is strongly supported, with antibiotics shortening the overall duration of moderate-to-severe TD to a little over 24h and reducing time to last unformed stool by 1–3 days compared with no therapy or placebo; combination of an antibiotic with loperamide further shortens duration of illness. Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin have been the primary antibiotics of choice, but resistance — particularly among Campylobacter — means the use of macrolides such as azithromycin for treatment is recommended, and azithromycin was shown to be more effective than ciprofloxacin for all cases of TD in travelers to Thailand. For all antibiotics, either single-dose therapy or treatment for up to 3 days is usually sufficient; studies show that once daily therapy is as effective as 3-day therapies for TD due to noninvasive pathogens, and a 3-day therapy is recommended for patients presenting with fever or dysentery. Short-course fluoroquinolone or macrolide antibiotic use has demonstrated risks of development of Clostridium difficile infection and risks for tendinopathies and arthropathies.

### Doxycycline malaria prophylaxis impact on risk of travelers' diarrhea among international travelers [^d3b9ddf6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study had multiple limitations. First, our study collected observational data with self-reported enteric symptoms as well as adherence to malaria prophylaxis. The lack of TD pathogen identification limits a direct assessment of doxycycline breakthroughs. Our study did not record confounding medical conditions or concomitant medications that could predispose travelers TD or influence providers' decision on which malaria prophylaxis to prescribe. Dietary habits and the risk for TD were not explored in non-deployment travel portion of this study as previous TravMil studies have not shown an association between TD and dietary habits. Finally, although we attempted to control for geographic variability to some extent in the multivariate analysis, it may be that areas of travel in which prescribers favored doxycycline also may be lower-risk itineraries with lower rates of TD.

Previous studies have shown that there is seasonality in TD. Season affects both the frequency of TD seen and pathogens causing TD. In our study, the median travel duration was 19 days. However, on military deployment trips, the median duration was 34 days. In addition, subjects frequently traveled to multiple locations, 31%, and, therefore, portions of their travel could be in different regions of exposure. Because so many trips involved changes in season (including changes in seasonality based on geography), we did not explore seasons of travel and their effect on TD.

Because the aim of the study was to look at the risk factors associated with TD, the use of antibiotics for TD self-treatment was not addressed in this study. In addition, this study was designed to show the effect of doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis on TD during an acute period of time. One of the limitations of this study is that long-term effects of the use of doxycycline were not evaluated. TravMil is currently evaluating risk factors for extended B-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli colonization after military travel by looking at region of travel, malaria prophylaxis, and antibiotics used for TD self-treatment. Initial data from this study did not show the use of doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis or the use of antibiotics for self-treatment of TD to be associated with ESBL colonization. Studies in civilian populations have shown association between antibiotic use for self-treatment of TD and ESBL colonization. However, when one study looked at antibiotics used for reasons other than self-treatment of TD and antimalarial chemoprophylaxis, there was no association with ESBL colonization.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^30235c1e]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Preventing bacterial enteric infections in adults and adolescents with HIV — travel and prophylaxis guidance emphasizes that immunizations (e.g., against Salmonella serotype Typhi) should be recommended in advance of travel (AIII), and antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent bacterial enteric illness is not routinely recommended, including for travelers (AIII). In rare cases — such as for immunosuppressed travelers, depending on level of immunosuppression, region of travel, and trip duration — antimicrobial prophylaxis with rifaximin or azithromycin should be offered (CIII), and antimicrobial prophylaxis with rifaximin or azithromycin should be considered (CIII). Because of toxicity associated with fluoroquinolone use and increasing antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens outside of the United States, routine use of fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis is discouraged (AIII). During pregnancy, azithromycin is the preferred agent for prophylaxis (BIII). For people with HIV already taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), TMP-SMX may offer limited protection against traveler's diarrhea. Clarifying terminology, CDI = Clostridioides difficile–associated infection.

### Antibacterial chemoprophylaxis in the prevention of traveler's diarrhea: evaluation of poorly absorbed oral rifaximin [^46b2d9c0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The use of antibacterial drugs was first shown to effectively reduce the occurrence of traveler's diarrhea nearly 50 years ago. The approach was not encouraged for general use by a Consensus Development Conference in 1985 because of concerns about adverse effects of the drugs and the possible development of resistance against systemically absorbed drugs. When therapy with poorly absorbed rifaximin was shown to be as effective as therapy with systemically absorbed drugs in shortening the duration of traveler's diarrhea, without the development of resistant coliform flora, the use of rifaximin for the prevention of traveler's diarrhea was studied. In the present study, rifaximin provided 72% protection against the development of diarrhea and 77% protection against active or treated diarrhea during 2 weeks of drug administration to United States students in Mexico. Rifaximin offers a potentially useful approach for preventing traveler's diarrhea. Potential areas of future study include use of the drug to prevent diarrhea due to mucosally invasive bacteria, including ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter species, and to reduce the occurrence of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome.

### Doxycycline malaria prophylaxis impact on risk of travelers' diarrhea among international travelers [^33f8bb6b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

International travelers are frequently at risk for travelers' diarrhea (TD) and malaria. Doxycycline was one of the earliest antibiotics shown to have efficacy in TD prevention. With increasing resistance and recommendations against antibiotic chemoprophylaxis, doxycycline fell out of use. We evaluated TD incidence and risk factors in a prospective cohort of travelers, specifically in regard to malaria prophylaxis. Travelers' diarrhea was defined as ≥ 3 loose stools in 24 hours or two loose stools in 24 hours associated with other gastrointestinal symptoms. The Poisson regression model with robust error variance was used to estimate the RR of TD. Three thousand two hundred twenty-seven trips were enrolled: 62.1% of participants were male, with a median age of 39 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27,59) and a median travel duration of 19 days (IQR 12,49); 17.4% developed TD; 32% traveled to Africa, 40% to Asia, and 27% to the Caribbean and Latin America; and 20% took doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis, 50% took other antimalarials, and 30% took none. Decreased RR of TD was associated with doxycycline (RR 0.62 [0.47–0.82], P < 0.01) and military travel (RR 0.57 [0.47–0.70], P < 0.01). Increased risk of TD was associated with female gender (RR 1.28 [1.09–1.50], P < 0.01), hotel accommodations (RR 1.30 [1.10–1.53], P < 0.01), travel to tropical South America (RR 1.34 [1.09–1.64], P < 0.01), and duration of travel (RR 1.00 [1.00–1.01], P < 0.01). The use of doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis is associated with lower TD risk, suggesting increasing bacterial enteropathogen susceptibility similar to previous observations. Doxycycline selection for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis may provide additional traveler benefit in infection prevention.

### Doxycycline malaria prophylaxis impact on risk of travelers' diarrhea among international travelers [^7e8e1756]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

International travelers are frequently at risk for travelers' diarrhea (TD) and malaria. Doxycycline was one of the earliest antibiotics shown to have efficacy in TD prevention. With increasing resistance and recommendations against antibiotic chemoprophylaxis, doxycycline fell out of use. We evaluated TD incidence and risk factors in a prospective cohort of travelers, specifically in regard to malaria prophylaxis. Travelers' diarrhea was defined as ≥ 3 loose stools in 24 hours or two loose stools in 24 hours associated with other gastrointestinal symptoms. The Poisson regression model with robust error variance was used to estimate the RR of TD. Three thousand two hundred twenty-seven trips were enrolled: 62.1% of participants were male, with a median age of 39 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27,59) and a median travel duration of 19 days (IQR 12,49); 17.4% developed TD; 32% traveled to Africa, 40% to Asia, and 27% to the Caribbean and Latin America; and 20% took doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis, 50% took other antimalarials, and 30% took none. Decreased RR of TD was associated with doxycycline (RR 0.62 [0.47–0.82], P < 0.01) and military travel (RR 0.57 [0.47–0.70], P < 0.01). Increased risk of TD was associated with female gender (RR 1.28 [1.09–1.50], P < 0.01), hotel accommodations (RR 1.30 [1.10–1.53], P < 0.01), travel to tropical South America (RR 1.34 [1.09–1.64], P < 0.01), and duration of travel (RR 1.00 [1.00–1.01], P < 0.01). The use of doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis is associated with lower TD risk, suggesting increasing bacterial enteropathogen susceptibility similar to previous observations. Doxycycline selection for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis may provide additional traveler benefit in infection prevention.

Traveler's diarrhea is the most common travel disease in both children and adults. Adult guidelines for traveler's diarrhea have been established, but significant gaps persist in guidance for the evaluation and management of pediatric traveler's diarrhea. Adult guidelines are not necessarily applicable in children, and it is essential for clinicians to account for the differences in pediatric pathophysiology, clinical presentations, and treatment recommendations when evaluating and managing pediatric traveler's diarrhea.

### Medication and dosage considerations in the prophylaxis and treatment of high-altitude illness [^2ce7edce]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

With increasing numbers of people traveling to high altitude for work or pleasure, there is a reasonable chance that many of these travelers have preexisting medical conditions or are receiving various medications at the time of their sojourn. As with all travelers to high altitude, they are at risk for altitude illnesses such as acute mountain sickness, high-altitude cerebral edema, and high-altitude pulmonary edema. While there are clear recommendations for pharmacologic measures to prevent or treat these illnesses, these recommendations are oriented toward healthy individuals and do not take into account the presence of preexisting medical conditions. In this review, we consider how the choice and dose of the medications used in the management of altitude illness-acetazolamide, dexamethasone, nifedipine, tadalafil, sildenafil, and salmeterol-are affected by a patient's underlying medical conditions. We discuss the indications and current dosing recommendations for individuals without underlying disease, and then consider how drug selection or dosing regimens will be affected by the presence of renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, other important medical conditions, and the potential for serious drug interactions. We include comments about interactions with antimalarial medications and antibiotics used in the treatment of traveler's diarrhea, as well as the safety of use during pregnancy. By giving these issues adequate consideration, clinicians can increase the chances that properly evaluated patients with underlying medical conditions will enjoy a safe trip to high altitude.

### Acute diarrhea in adults [^3bf816e4]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute diarrheal disease accounts for 179 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Diarrhea can be categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and both types have infectious and noninfectious causes. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is often viral in etiology and is the most common presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness. History for patients with acute diarrhea should include onset and frequency of symptoms, stool character, a focused review of systems including fever and other symptoms, and evaluation of exposures and risk factors. The physical examination should include evaluation for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or potential surgical processes. Most episodes of acute diarrhea in countries with adequate food and water sanitation are uncomplicated and self-limited, requiring only an initial evaluation and supportive treatment. Additional diagnostic evaluation and management may be warranted when diarrhea is bloody or mucoid or when risk factors are present, including immunocompromise or recent hospitalization. Unless an outbreak is suspected, molecular studies are preferred over traditional stool cultures. In all cases, management begins with replacing water, electrolytes, and nutrients. Oral rehydration is preferred; however, signs of severe dehydration or sepsis warrant intravenous rehydration. Antidiarrheal agents can be symptomatic therapy for acute watery diarrhea and can help decrease inappropriate antibiotic use. Empiric antibiotics are rarely warranted, except in sepsis and some cases of travelers' or inflammatory diarrhea. Targeted antibiotic therapy may be appropriate following microbiologic stool assessment. Hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and food and water safety measures are integral to preventing infectious diarrheal illnesses.

### Prevention and treatment of traveler's diarrhea… [^fc450fc5]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Prevention Traveler's diarrhea is fundamentally a sanitation failure, leading to bacterial contamination of food and water. It is best prevented through proper sewage treatment and water disinfection. In the absence of these amenities, the next best option is for the educated traveler to take precautions to prevent the disease. Preventive measures include not drinking tap water, not using ice in beverages, not eating salads and other forms of raw vegetables, not eating fruits that can't be peeled on the spot and not eating mayonnaise, pastry icing, unpasteurized dairy products and undercooked shellfish. Drug Prophylaxis Table 3 summarizes the various drug therapies used for prophylaxis against traveler's diarrhea. Bismuth subsalicylate, in a dosage of two 262-mg tablets four times a day can prevent traveler's diarrhea. It has been shown to provide a 65 percent protection rate.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea, always a controversial topic, is now recommended only in specific situations, such as in the seriously immunocompromised patient or the seriously ill patient who would not be able to withstand a diarrheal illness. If antibiotic prophylaxis is used, the antibiotic should only be taken for a three-week period. Other exceptions may include persons who plan short-term critical travel, such as a diplomatic mission, or persons who are unable to practice prevention. Loperamide may also be taken if the patient does not have dysentery. Before beginning antibiotic therapy, however, patients should first take a dose of loperamide to see if the antimotility agent stops the diarrhea. Antibiotic therapy should be deferred until it is clear that the diarrheal illness requires antibiotic therapy, since dietary change and stress can cause transient gastrointestinal upset.

2 A single antibiotic dose may be effective for mild traveler's diarrhea, and patients should reassess their condition in 12 hours to determine if further doses are necessary.
10. One future option might be nonabsorbable antimicrobial drugs such as bicozamycin, furazolidone, aztreonam and rifaximin, which have already shown some benefit in the treatment of traveler's diarrhea. Bicozamycin might also be an effective prophylactic agent that would treat only the gastrointestinal tract and, therefore, be more acceptable from the standpoint of safety.

Immunocompromised travelers — contraindications and other health risks — Healthcare professionals should assess whether the traveler's conditions, medications, or treatments constitute contraindications to, decrease the effectiveness of, or increase the risk for adverse events from disease-prevention measures for the trip. Depending on destination, measures might include immunizations or medications for malaria chemoprophylaxis or self-treatment for travelers' diarrhea. Clinicians also should assess whether destination health hazards could exacerbate underlying conditions or cause more severe outcomes in an immunocompromised traveler and determine whether specific interventions are available to mitigate these risks.

### What's new in enteric infectious diseases at home and abroad [^1189bb3b]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review was designed to focus on the important research in the area of acute infectious diarrhea published within the past year. PubMed was reviewed for articles published in 2004 and 2005 relating to pathogen-specific diarrhea and for travelers' diarrhea to identify the newly published articles.

Recent Findings

New studies continue to show the importance of the diarrheagenic Escherichia coli as causes of acute and persistent diarrhea. Enteroaggregative E. coli has recently been shown to be an unrecognized cause of community-acquired diarrhea in infants in the USA. Genetic factors explain an increased susceptibility to travelers' diarrhea among international travelers. Also, poorly non-absorbed rifaximin (< 0.4%) was shown to be an effective drug when used prophylactically to prevent bacterial diarrhea during high risk travel.

Summary

Studies will continue to define the etiology of diarrhea and to better understand the epidemiology and prevention of infectious diarrhea. Antibacterial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens is a growing problem, leading to the search for newer antibacterial drugs. Diarrhea due to bacterial agents in international travelers can be prevented and treated successfully by antibacterial drugs. The nonabsorbed rifamycin drug, rifaximin, appears to be ideally suited to become the important new drug in prevention and treatment of travelers' diarrhea. Studies are underway to determine the value of the drug in preventing invasive forms of diarrhea during travel to Asia and in the prevention of the commonly occurring post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.

### Case-case analysis using 7 years of travelers' diarrhea surveillance data: preventive and travel medicine applications in cusco, Peru [^862f4970]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Reported diarrhea risk factors.

During the week before presenting with diarrhea, 47% of participants ate the majority of meals in a restaurant, 15.2% in a friend's home, 13% in a hotel, and 24.8% in an "other" location (Table 1). All participants reported consuming at least one of the following risky food items time during the week before illness: fruit juice (86%), cheese (78%), raw green vegetables (72%), cold sauces (52%), milk (46%), ice (40%), reheated buffet foods (38%), ice cream (33%), unpeeled fruit (29%), street vendor food (28%), the local drink chicha (25%), and tap water (14%) (Table 2).

Approximately two-thirds (176/230) of study participants reported receiving advice to prevent diarrhea. These individuals reported following this guidance all (46%), some (51%), or none (3%) of the time. Among those who reported always following recommendations, 93% (84/90) reported consuming three or more of the abovementioned foods linked to TD. Among these three stratified risk groups, the majority consumed fruit juice (84%, 86%, and 83%), cheese (73%, 83%, and 83%), or raw green vegetables (58%, 81%, and 83%), and the majority (84%) of the group that reported always following recommendations also consumed at least three foods linked to TD. In addition, 55/230 (24%) study participants took medications to prevent diarrhea, at some time prior to 1 week before enrollment. Of these individuals, 50 provided information on the type of medication used: 32% had taken antibiotics, 4% took bismuth preparations, and 64% took "other" medications.

Travel and breastfeeding — travelers' diarrhea (TD) treatment — exclusive breastfeeding helps protect children against TD and breastfeeding is ideal rehydration therapy; children suspected of having TD should breastfeed more frequently and should not be offered other fluids or foods that replace breastfeeding, and breastfeeding travelers with TD should continue breastfeeding if possible and increase their own fluid intake, with evidence lacking that any TD pathogen can pass into breast milk. Breastfeeding travelers should avoid bismuth subsalicylate compounds in over-the-counter antidiarrheals, fluoroquinolones and macrolides are excreted in breast milk and clinicians should consult the breastfed child's primary healthcare professional before deciding which antibiotics to prescribe; most experts consider the short-term use of azithromycin compatible with breastfeeding, loperamide is another preferred antidiarrheal medication to use while breastfeeding, and use of oral rehydration salts is fully compatible with breastfeeding.

### Doxycycline malaria prophylaxis impact on risk of travelers' diarrhea among international travelers [^2d89138f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our evaluation of the use of doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis and risk of TD among international travelers demonstrates a negative association between doxycycline used as malaria prophylaxis and incidence of TD in international travelers. Given the widespread prevalence of TD in international travelers, as well as the limitations and unclear efficacy of dietary restrictions for prevention, and limited options for chemoprophylaxis, these findings warrant consideration. Rifaximin is approved for the prevention of TD in selected populations. Meta-analysis shows that rifaximin has a decreased RR of developing TD (RR 0.41 [0.3–0.56], P < 0.01)compared with our study showing doxycycline RR of 0.62 (0.47–0.82), P < 0.01. Although these observational data do not derive from a randomized controlled trial, the findings support doxycycline effectiveness in TD prevention.

### Traveler's diarrhea in the pediatric population: etiology and impact [^15d0cbff]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Children who travel are at risk of developing the same, well-known illnesses that affect adult travelers. The etiology, treatment, and actual risk of these illnesses are not well defined in children. The limited amount of data available forces clinicians to extrapolate appropriate treatment for children. Recommendations for children have not been standardized. The role and judicious use of antimicrobials in the treatment of pediatric traveler's diarrhea have evolved during recent decades and will be reviewed here. The past 2 decades have seen an unprecedented, sustained growth in travel. The epidemiology related to travel medicine has evolved to describe travelers and their illnesses more specifically. The development of the field of travel medicine has led to greater understanding and improved, targeted treatment of travel-related illnesses. Most of the data available today describe traveler's diarrhea in adults. Children traveling to distant destinations from their home country have not been well studied, yet treatment parameters exist in practice and will be reviewed here.

### Health recommendations for international travel: a review of the evidence base of travel medicine [^ce42523a]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

International travel is increasing, including travel to countries with emerging economies. Travel may pose health risks for the individual and contribute to the global spread of infectious diseases. The specialty of travel medicine is aimed at minimizing health risks associated with international travel. The field has emerged in the past 25 years, and the evidence base supporting its clinical practice is growing. This review will describe the evidence base underlying travel medicine, highlight recently updated travel medicine guidelines, and outline future research priorities.

Recent Findings

Recommendations for a number of common vaccines for travelers have been updated recently. More sophisticated detection methods are leading to the identification of a wider spectrum of pathogens associated with travelers' diarrhea, and antibiotic resistance is increasingly being identified. New treatment options for malaria are available, and a fifth Plasmodium species causing disease in humans has been identified.

Summary

An evidence base for the practice of travel medicine is emerging. Expert opinion and consensus guidelines continue to play an important role in supporting clinical practice.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of rifaximin to prevent travelers' diarrhea [^a09580b0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Travelers' diarrhea causes substantial morbidity and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome.

Objective

To evaluate nonabsorbable rifaximin for prevention of travelers' diarrhea.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Setting

Guadalajara, Mexico.

Participants

U.S. students.

Intervention

On arrival in Guadalajara, Mexico, 210 U.S. adults received rifaximin (200 mg/d, 200 mg twice daily, or 200 mg 3 times daily) or placebo for 2 weeks.

Measurements

Participants were followed daily for 3 weeks for enteric disease and symptoms and daily for 5 weeks for drug side effects. Changes in intestinal coliform flora were studied.

Results

Travelers' diarrhea developed in 14.74% of participants taking rifaximin and 53.70% of those taking placebo (rate ratio, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.17 to 0.43]). Rifaximin provided 72% and 77% protection against travelers' diarrhea and antibiotic-treated travelers' diarrhea, respectively (P < 0.001 for both), and all rifaximin doses were superior to placebo. In the groups that did not report travelers' diarrhea, rifaximin significantly reduced the occurrence of mild diarrhea (P = 0.02) and moderate and severe intestinal problems (P = 0.009 for pain or cramps; P = 0.02 for excessive gas). Rates of adverse events were comparable in the rifaximin and placebo groups. Minimal changes in coliform flora were found during rifaximin therapy.

Limitations

Rifaximin safely prevented travelers' diarrhea in Mexico, where most cases are caused by diarrhea-producing Escherichia coli. A study is needed in Asia to determine whether rifaximin can prevent diarrhea caused by invasive bacterial pathogens.

Conclusions

Rifaximin prevents travelers' diarrhea with minimal changes in fecal flora, and more liberal chemoprophylaxis against this disease should be considered. Future studies should evaluate whether rifaximin is effective in preventing postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome.

### Rifaximin: a unique gastrointestinal-selective antibiotic for enteric diseases [^3a059d99]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Rifaximin is gaining attention for its potential activity in a multitude of gastrointestinal diseases. We review the unique pharmaceutical properties of this antibiotic and the published evidence in the literature regarding the use of rifaximin for different gastrointestinal disorders.

Recent Findings

Rifaximin is a gastrointestinal-selective antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, an excellent safety profile, minimal drug interactions, and negligible impact on the intestinal microbiome. Rifaximin is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea caused by noninvasive diarrheagenic Escherichia coli and is approved in more than 30 other countries for a variety of gastrointestinal disorders. Considerable research with this medication has been conducted for the treatment and prevention of travelers' diarrhea, the treatment of portal systemic encephalopathy, Clostridium difficile infection, small bowel intestinal overgrowth, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pouchitis, and colonic diverticular disease.

Summary

Rifaximin is effective for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea and can be considered as the treatment of choice for uncomplicated travelers' diarrhea. When invasive travelers' diarrhea pathogens are suspected, an alternative antibiotic should be administered. Rifaximin appears promising as a chemoprophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea and as a treatment of portal systemic encephalopathy. This antibiotic may be effective for other gastrointestinal diseases, but more well designed clinical studies are needed to confirm its efficacy for these off-label indications. Future studies will determine whether the development of significant bacterial resistance will limit rifaximin use.

Management of persistent diarrhea — specific treatment of identified enteropathogens is usually indicated, and appropriate management of underlying gastrointestinal (GI) disease is warranted; when bacterial infection is suspected or determined by culture-independent testing, stool culture can determine antimicrobial susceptibility. Dietary modifications might help patients with malabsorption or lactose intolerance, and symptomatic treatment or the use of nonabsorbable antibiotics offers potential benefit if small intestinal bacterial overgrowth accompanies the symptom complex.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy for bloody diarrhea — adults and children: In immunocompetent children and adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bloody diarrhea while waiting for results of investigations is not recommended (strong, low), except for infants < 3 months of age with suspicion of a bacterial etiology; ill immunocompetent people with fever documented in a medical setting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and bacillary dysentery presumptively due to Shigella; and people who have recently travelled internationally with body temperatures ≥ 38.5°C and/or signs of sepsis (weak, low). When indicated, the empiric antimicrobial therapy in adults should be either a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin, or azithromycin, depending on the local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate), and empiric therapy for children includes a third-generation cephalosporin for infants < 3 months of age and others with neurologic involvement, or azithromycin, depending on local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate). Empiric antibacterial treatment should be considered in immunocompromised people with severe illness and bloody diarrhea (strong, low), and asymptomatic contacts of people with bloody diarrhea should not be offered empiric treatment but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate).
