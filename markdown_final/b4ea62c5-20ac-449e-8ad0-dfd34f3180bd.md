## Question

For a 66-year-old presenting with memory loss, what evaluation and management plan is appropriate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an appropriate evaluation and management plan for memory loss in a 66-year-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history, red flags, and collateral information. Then, I should review appropriate cognitive and functional screening to distinguish MCI from dementia. Next, I will verify the initial laboratory and imaging workup to exclude reversible causes. After that, I must formulate the differential diagnosis tailored to a 66-year-old, including atypical or treatable etiologies. Then, I will determine when to refer for specialty evaluation and advanced testing, followed by how to disclose the diagnosis and counsel. Finally, I need to outline management, follow-up, caregiver support, and how to adjust the plan as new features emerge or evidence evolves.

> Let me first confirm the essentials in the clinical history and examination, and I should explicitly gather collateral information from a care partner because insight is often limited in cognitive disorders and this substantially shifts pretest probability of etiologies such as Alzheimer's disease; I need to characterize onset, tempo, domain pattern, and impact on instrumental activities of daily living, while screening for red flags like rapid progression over weeks to months, focal deficits, seizures, fluctuating attention, or prominent visual hallucinations that would push me toward urgent evaluation for delirium, autoimmune encephalitis, prion disease, or Lewy body disease respectively [^112p4jMf] [^117NDWci] [^1147y65Y].

> Wait, let me verify the optimal bedside screening strategy before jumping ahead; for brief cognitive testing, MoCA outperforms MMSE for detecting MCI and has fewer ceiling effects, while the Mini-Cog can be used for rapid screening, and I must pair cognition with a functional measure such as the FAQ to separate MCI from dementia, remembering that education and baseline ability can mask early deficits and that normal screens do not rule out disease, necessitating repeat assessments if suspicion remains; simultaneously, I should screen for depression because it can mimic dementia presentations and is potentially reversible [^116SYo2v] [^111GS32s] [^1156i2xt] [^113gFjCH] [^1142qCWS].

> Hold on, I should verify baseline laboratory and imaging workup to exclude common reversible contributors; per primary care and international guidance, I need TSH, vitamin B12, CBC, metabolic panel including renal and hepatic function and glucose, with additional serologies based on risk, and for structural imaging, brain MRI without contrast is preferred over CT to evaluate for atrophy patterns, vascular disease, mass lesions, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or subdural hematoma; if uncertainty persists over time, serial MRI can document progression and refine etiology [^115DZWaA] [^113gFjCH] [^111Xg868] [^1136uEX5].

> Let me think about the differential diagnosis specific to age 66; age 66 is "young-onset" dementia, which often has atypical phenotypes and higher genetic or non-Alzheimer differentials — wait, I should confirm definitions, because some sources define young-onset strictly as onset before 65, so 66 years sits at the cusp and still warrants heightened attention to atypical features and treatable causes; leading considerations include typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease, vascular cognitive impairment with stepwise decline or extensive small-vessel disease, dementia with Lewy bodies with fluctuations and visual hallucinations, and frontotemporal dementia with early behavioral or language change, while I must not miss autoimmune or paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis when onset is subacute with seizures or prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as normal pressure hydrocephalus if gait and continence are involved [^112p4jMf] [^1115b52Z] [^111Xg868] [^116m3UXi] [^112Qcyv2].

> I should double-check when to escalate to specialty referral and advanced testing; indicators include atypical or nonamnestic presentations, rapid progression, early behavioral syndrome, language-led decline, visual syndromes, motor signs, or persistent diagnostic uncertainty after initial workup, at which point CSF biomarkers for Aβ42, total tau, and p-tau can help adjudicate Alzheimer pathology, amyloid PET can be used judiciously with clinical context and may change management when incorporated earlier, FDG-PET patterns can support differentiation among AD, FTD, and LBD, EEG is appropriate if seizures or fluctuating cognition are suspected, and autoimmune/paraneoplastic panels should be pursued in subacute or inflammatory presentations; in specialized settings, blood-based biomarkers may serve as triage or adjuncts but generally require confirmatory CSF or PET before definitive etiologic labeling [^1147y65Y] [^115YhDdH] [^112gv8s9] [^115Tbpip] [^112h4634] [^1115uthu] [^111gJQTX].

> Next, I should review best practices for diagnosis disclosure and counseling; I need to clearly differentiate MCI from dementia by functional independence, discuss prognosis including variable rates of progression and potential stability or reversion, address safety risks such as driving and workplace performance as applicable, and provide written information while inviting family involvement to align understanding and planning, ensuring empathy and shared decision-making throughout [^115NuJUS] [^113KemWj].

> I will now examine management in layers; for probable Alzheimer's disease, cholinesterase inhibitors are reasonable in mild-to-moderate stages after informed discussion of benefits and harms, with memantine added in moderate-to-severe disease, whereas across MCI and early dementia I should emphasize nonpharmacologic interventions including regular exercise at least twice weekly, cognitive engagement, optimization of sleep, hearing, and vision, and aggressive control of vascular risk factors; I must also treat reversible contributors like B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, and depression, and if autoimmune encephalitis is confirmed, initiate immunotherapy promptly because timely treatment can substantially improve outcomes [^117D8ZRZ] [^1115hmBs] [^116m3UXi].

> But wait, I need to ensure an explicit follow-up plan; for MCI, follow-up every 6 to 12 months, definitely within 18 months, with earlier review if new concerns arise, and for diagnosed dementia, regular monitoring with repeated use of the same cognitive instrument, functional assessment, surveillance for behavioral and psychological symptoms, medication review for anticholinergic burden, and caregiver needs assessment to preempt burnout and crises are essential components of high-quality longitudinal care [^115NuJUS] [^112gv8s9].

> I should confirm that advanced care planning and caregiver support are woven in from the outset; early discussions about goals of care, legal and financial planning, linkage to community resources such as Alzheimer's Association programs, and home safety assessments for wandering or exploitation risks can mitigate downstream harm and align care with patient values [^115qkEqA] [^114ZW5Zv].

> Let me reconsider how to adjust the plan as the disease evolves; I must remain vigilant for atypical features that warrant re-evaluation of etiology, titrate or deprescribe therapies based on tolerance and stage, integrate emerging evidence such as blood-based biomarkers judiciously within a comprehensive clinical workup, and coordinate multidisciplinary input, while repeatedly screening for comorbidities that can drive behavioral symptoms and functional decline [^115vbm1K] [^117UTyiM] [^111aV4bQ].

> Finally, I should double-check the key decision points to keep the pathway coherent: determining whether the presentation is typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease or atypical to trigger specialty referral, verifying whether functional impairment is present to distinguish MCI from dementia, identifying red flags that require urgent evaluation for reversible causes, and using advanced biomarkers when the etiologic diagnosis remains equivocal or high-stakes decisions depend on diagnostic certainty, especially in relatively younger patients where misdiagnosis risk and occupational impact are greater [^113gFjCH] [^116SYo2v] [^1147y65Y].

A 66-year-old with memory loss needs a **structured workup** to identify reversible causes and distinguish MCI from dementia. Start with a detailed history, exam, and cognitive screening (MoCA or MMSE), then order labs (CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, folate, HbA1c, LFTs, RPR, HIV) and **MRI brain** to exclude structural causes [^113M3Src] [^111Xg868]. If cognitive impairment is confirmed, refer for neuropsychological testing and consider CSF or PET biomarkers if diagnosis remains uncertain. Management includes treating reversible causes, optimizing vascular risk factors, and initiating cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine if Alzheimer's is diagnosed, with regular follow-up to monitor progression and adjust care [^113WxWT4] [^116vaVk7].

---

## Clinical history and examination

- **Onset and progression**: Determine if acute, subacute, or chronic; rapid progression suggests delirium, encephalitis, or prion disease [^1147y65Y].

- **Cognitive domains**: Assess memory, language, executive function, visuospatial skills, and attention.

- **Functional status**: Evaluate ADLs and IADLs to distinguish MCI from dementia [^1156i2xt].

- **Neuropsychiatric symptoms**: Screen for depression, anxiety, psychosis, and behavioral changes.

- **Medical history**: Review vascular risk factors, head trauma, seizures, alcohol/drug use, and medications (especially anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, opioids).

- **Family history**: Inquire about dementia, Parkinson's, or psychiatric disorders.

- **Neurological examination**: Look for focal deficits, parkinsonism, ataxia, or motor neuron signs.

## Cognitive screening tools

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) **is highly sensitive** for MCI and early dementia and is preferred over the MMSE for mild impairment [^111GS32s]. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is widely used but is less sensitive for MCI [^111GS32s]. The Mini-Cog is a quick screening tool that combines three-word recall with clock drawing [^116SYo2v].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Routine laboratory tests to exclude **reversible causes** include:

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| CBC | - Anemia <br/> - Infection |
| CMP | - Electrolytes <br/> - Renal <br/> - Hepatic function |
| TSH | Hypothyroidism |
| - Vitamin B12 <br/> - Folate | Deficiency states |
| HbA1c | Diabetes control |
| LFTs | Hepatic encephalopathy |
| - RPR <br/> - HIV | - Syphilis <br/> - HIV-associated cognitive impairment |

---

## Neuroimaging

MRI brain is the **preferred initial imaging modality** to exclude structural lesions, vascular disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus, and to assess hippocampal atrophy [^111Xg868]. CT brain is an alternative if MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. FDG-PET is considered if the diagnosis remains uncertain after the initial workup, particularly to differentiate Alzheimer's from frontotemporal dementia or Lewy body dementia.

---

## Neuropsychological testing

Formal **neuropsychological assessment** is indicated when cognitive screening is inconclusive, to differentiate MCI from dementia, or in atypical or rapidly progressive presentations; it also documents baseline cognitive function for future comparison.

---

## Biomarkers

CSF analysis of amyloid-beta, tau, and phosphorylated tau **can support an Alzheimer's diagnosis**, especially in atypical presentations [^115YhDdH]. Blood-based biomarkers are emerging in specialized settings but are not yet standard in primary care [^1115uthu].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Neurodegenerative**: Alzheimer's, Lewy body, frontotemporal, Parkinson's dementia.

- **Vascular**: Multi-infarct dementia, strategic infarcts.

- **Psychiatric**: Depression, anxiety, functional cognitive disorder.

- **Metabolic**: Hypothyroidism, vitamin deficiencies, hepatic/renal dysfunction.

- **Structural**: Tumors, normal pressure hydrocephalus, subdural hematoma.

- **Infectious**: HIV, syphilis, prion diseases.

---

## Management plan

- **Treat reversible causes**: Correct metabolic abnormalities, adjust medications, treat depression/anxiety.

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Regular exercise, cognitive stimulation, social engagement, Mediterranean diet.

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's; memantine for moderate-to-severe disease [^113WxWT4].

- **Safety assessment**: Driving, firearms, medication management, home safety.

- **Advance care planning**: Discuss prognosis, advance directives, and caregiver support.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should track **cognitive decline**, functional status, and behavioral symptoms [^116vaVk7]. Repeat cognitive testing and, when indicated, imaging help document progression [^1136uEX5]. Management should be adjusted based on progression and patient needs.

---

Bottom line: Use a structured **workup** to identify reversible causes and distinguish MCI from dementia; combine history, exam, cognitive screening, targeted labs, and **MRI brain** as first-line imaging [^113M3Src] [^111Xg868]. Tailor **management** by treating reversible contributors and initiating evidence-based dementia therapies when indicated, with regular follow-up to monitor progression and support patients and caregivers [^113WxWT4] [^116vaVk7].

Dementia is defined by significant chronic or acquired impairment in a single domain or loss of two or more cognitive functions due to brain disease or injury. It is a common chronic syndrome in adults and constitutes the fifth leading cause of death in patients over 65 years of age. Multiple etiologies of dementia exist, most notably Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, as well as other neurologic diseases such as vascular dementia and normal pressure hydrocephalus.

In addition to aiding clinicians in selecting the most appropriate imaging test for patients suspected of one of these dementia syndromes, this document highlights the most appropriate initial imaging tests for patients with suspected mild cognitive impairment and rapidly progressive dementia, as well as the most appropriate pre- and post-treatment imaging tests for patients undergoing therapy with antiamyloid monoclonal antibodies.

### Status of memory loss [^114SKQGh]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old woman presented with the first onset of seizure with no prior history of cognitive dysfunction. EEG revealed focal non-convulsive status epilepticus. MRI brain showed a left temporal non-enhancing lesion. Temporal pole biopsy showed acute neuronal necrosis and astrocyte hyperplasia together with extensive amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Perivascular oligodendroglial hyperplasia was present. Postmortem examination revealed extensive plaque and tangle disease.

Perivascular oligodendroglial hyperplasia was limited to the left temporal area. The presence of focal perivascular oligodendroglial hyperplasia in the left temporal cortex, combined with extensive plaque and tangle disease, may have contributed to the focal status epilepticus in this patient. Although the presence of focal perivascular oligodendroglial hyperplasia has been reported in cases of temporal lobe epilepsy, it has not been reported as a cause of seizure in patients with Alzheimer's disease previously. Further studies for clinical-pathologic correlation would be required to confirm this hypothesis.

### Confabulation, amnesia and motor memory loss as a presentation of apparent ITPR1 antibody autoimmune encephalitis [^111fG3k8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old woman presented to the hospital with an acute, hypoactive altered mental status. Her symptoms began three days prior, including hallucinations, urinary and fecal incontinence, and somnolence. She also exhibited confabulations, amnesia, motor memory loss, and a wide-based gait. Medical, psychiatric, and neurological evaluations, which included imaging and laboratory workups, were unrevealing. Treatment for possible Wernicke encephalopathy and psychosis with high-dose intravenous thiamine and antipsychotic medications did not lead to improvement.

After discharge, a send-out cerebrospinal fluid autoimmune encephalitis panel tested positive for the newly identified neuronal inositol triphosphate receptor one (ITPR1) antibody. This prompted readmission for intravenous steroids, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin, which resulted in mild clinical improvement. Here, we describe confabulations and psychiatric symptoms as novel manifestations of the primary presentation of anti-ITPR1 encephalitis in an effort to promote faster recognition of this disease and early initiation of treatment in suspected cases.

### Alzheimer's disease [^114s3VcE]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Alzheimer's disease:

- **Definition**: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and functional impairment.

- **Pathophysiology**: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two primary pathophysiological mechanisms: the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, neuroinflammation, characterized by alterations in the functional responses of microglia and astrocytes and dysregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, also plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease worldwide is estimated at 598.97 per 100,000 population.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include advancing age, a family history of the disease, and a genetic predisposition, particularly the presence of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, Alzheimer's disease presents with progressive memory decline as well as cognitive deficits with executive dysfunction, language, visual perceptual difficulties, apraxia, and agnosia. Emotional and behavioral symptoms may also emerge in the moderate-to-severe stages of the disease.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic condition with no known cure. The prognosis is typically poor as the disease progressively worsens over time. The life expectancy following a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can vary between 3 to 10 years, with age being a significant factor.

### Renal cell carcinoma presenting with paraneoplastic hallucinations and cognitive decline from limbic encephalitis [^112Qcyv2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We present a 66-year-old woman with 2 months of visual hallucinations, unintentional weight loss, and short-term memory decline, whose clinical presentation and EEG supported a diagnosis of limbic encephalitis. Subsequent evaluation for a paraneoplastic etiology revealed a renal mass, which was resected and identified as clear cell renal carcinoma. The patient's clinical condition improved after resection of the mass. When patients present with incongruous subacute neuropsychiatric symptoms, clinicians should be mindful of paraneoplastic neurological disorders, as early diagnosis and treatment of malignancy may lead to symptomatic improvement.

### Initial evaluation of the patient with suspected dementia [^117D8ZRZ]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Dementia is a common disorder among older persons, and projections indicate that the number of patients with dementia in the United States will continue to grow. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia account for the majority of cases. After a thorough history and physical examination, including a discussion with family members, a baseline measurement of cognitive function should be obtained. The Mini-Mental State Examination is the most commonly used instrument to document cognitive impairment. Initial laboratory evaluation includes tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone and vitamin B12 levels. Structural neuroimaging with noncontrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is also recommended. Other testing should be guided by the history and physical examination.

Neuropsychologic testing can help determine the extent of cognitive impairment but is not recommended on a routine basis. It may be most helpful in situations where screening tests are normal or equivocal, but there remains a high level of concern that the person may be cognitively impaired.

### A review of the non-Alzheimer dementias [^112StRwc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

To review the clinical features, neuropathologic features, clinical course, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management strategies of the primary non-Alzheimer degenerative and prion disorders that cause dementia, a systematic approach was undertaken.

- **Data sources**: The PubMed MEDLINE search engine was used to query for all published articles written in English from January 1990 to August 2005 using the keywords non-Alzheimer, tau, tauopathy, synuclein, synucleinopathy, prion, cognitive impairment, and dementia syndrome. These and related terms were also queried on additional search engines, including On-Line Mendelian Inheritance in Man and GeneTests. Reputable organizations dedicated to promoting education and research in specific syndromes and disorders were queried using Google.

- **Study selection**: The original articles on the disorders and syndromes, as well as subsequent articles and consensus papers that discussed in detail the clinical features, pathologic features, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management strategies, or some combination thereof, were selected for this review.

- **Data extraction**: Data were extracted from articles that include generally accepted concepts and guidelines on the non-Alzheimer degenerative and prion disorders as viewed by the author.

- **Data synthesis**: The synthesized data emphasized the cardinal clinical features, differential diagnosis, findings on ancillary studies most helpful in establishing accurate diagnoses, as well as diagnostic criteria and key principles of management.

This article provides an up-to-date overview of the significant aspects concerning non-Alzheimer dementias, focusing on accurate diagnosis and effective management strategies.

### Diagnostic evaluation of elderly patients with mild memory problems [^111PyVxr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

This case-based discussion focuses on the clinical presentation and diagnostic assessment of a uniquely challenging group of elderly patients: those with symptoms of mild memory problems. Such patients present a challenge to clinicians because of flux in our understandings of normal, age-related cognitive changes, cognitive changes due to neurodegenerative illnesses, and the relationships between depression and cognitive impairment. Additionally, symptoms of memory problems may be reported by an observer rather than the patient. These challenges warrant stepwise evaluation of elderly patients who present with symptoms of memory loss.

### Nationally informed recommendations on approaching the detection, assessment, and management of mild cognitive impairment [^115NuJUS]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations: Sharing the diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up**: When mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is identified or diagnosed, it should be openly discussed and explained as being different from normal aging, emphasizing the importance of follow-up. With the patient's permission, sharing the diagnosis of MCI should involve inviting other support or family members to participate, and written feedback must be provided. It is crucial to differentiate MCI from dementia, discuss the variability of its course, and educate patients about strategies that may improve cognition or delay progression to dementia.

Upon being informed they have MCI, patients should understand there is no immediate need to routinely address driving unless a risk is identified. They should also be informed that MCI may impact their work, and an assessment of potential risk should be discussed. Ideally, patients with MCI should be reviewed every six to twelve months, but definitely within eighteen months by a general practitioner or specialist. Triggers for earlier review should include patient or family concern, recent hospital admission, multi-domain amnestic MCI, neurological signs, or mood and behavioral symptoms. Referral to a specialist for follow-up should be considered in cases of unexpected change.

Follow-up for MCI can be conducted in primary care with appropriate training and support. Any follow-up visit for individuals with MCI should include a validated cognitive scale that is consistently repeated and a comparative structured informant report.

Comparison of selected brief cognitive tests to detect cognitive impairment or dementia:

- **The Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE)**: This is the most widely known and best‐studied brief test of cognition that usually takes less than 10 minutes to administer. However, it currently has copyright restrictions on its use. Alternative tools are available for medical practice with comparable (for dementia) or better (for mild cognitive impairment, MCI — e.g. MoCA, see below) diagnostic accuracy than the MMSE.

- **The Mini‐Cog**: This is a very quick (2–3 minutes) test containing two items: a measure of short‐term memory (short‐delay recall of three words) and a measure of visuospatial ability and executive functions (Clock Drawing Test). It has acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting cognitive impairment and has been evaluated in four large systematic reviews. It is validated as a screening test (not a diagnostic test) and, like the MMSE, may have low sensitivity to detect MCI in more intellectually capable individuals.

- **The MoCA**: This is a 20‐item test assessing multiple cognitive domains (orientation, memory, language, attention, visuospatial, and executive functions) and usually takes 12 to 15 minutes to administer. The diagnostic accuracy of the MoCA for identifying persons with cognitive impairment or dementia has been studied in systematic reviews with up to 34 studies and appears to be more accurate than the MMSE for detecting MCI. While the MoCA can be effective at detecting MCI in individuals with average or above-average levels of education, performance on the MoCA can be highly sensitive to educational background.

### Early-onset dementia: Diagnostic challenges [^116FHnu2]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man was brought to our hospital by his family, seeking medical treatment for the patient's long-standing progressive word-finding difficulties, forgetfulness, agitation, and social withdrawal. After multiple previous physician consultations, the patient was mistakenly diagnosed with epilepsy and prescribed multiple anticonvulsants, to which his above-mentioned symptoms were unresponsive. His condition progressed over the next ten years, resulting in severe cognitive impairments and complete dysfunctionality. An electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment revealed persistent spike and wave activity in the left temporal lobe. Brain MRI showed multiple small bright T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) foci within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres surrounding the ventricular system, as well as some widening of extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid spaces. The patient was finally diagnosed with early-onset dementia and temporal lobe epileptiform abnormalities. This case emphasizes the need for diagnostic consideration of dementia in cognitively impaired patients, even when they are not of advanced age.

### Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: Recommendations of the International Working Group [^117DKWxj]. The Lancet Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

In 2018, the US National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association proposed a purely biological definition of Alzheimer's disease that relies on biomarkers. Although the intended use of this framework was for research purposes, it has engendered debate and challenges regarding its use in everyday clinical practice. Cognitively unimpaired individuals can have biomarker evidence of both amyloid β and tau pathology but will often not develop clinical manifestations in their lifetime. Furthermore, a positive Alzheimer's disease pattern of biomarkers can be observed in other brain diseases in which Alzheimer's disease pathology is present as a comorbidity.

In this personal view, the International Working Group presents what we consider to be the limitations of biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and on the basis of this evidence, we propose recommendations for how biomarkers should and should not be used for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in a clinical setting. We recommend that Alzheimer's disease diagnosis be restricted to people who have positive biomarkers together with specific Alzheimer's disease phenotypes. Biomarker-positive cognitively unimpaired individuals should be considered only at-risk for progression to Alzheimer's disease.

### European consensus for the diagnosis of MCI and mild dementia: Preparatory phase [^111TM27D]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Low credibility.

The etiological diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders in middle-to-old age relies on biomarkers, although evidence for their rational use is incomplete. A European task force is defining a diagnostic workflow where expert experience fills evidence gaps for biomarker validity and prioritization. We report on the methodology and preliminary results.

- **Methods**: Using a Delphi consensus method supported by a systematic literature review, 22 delegates from 11 relevant scientific societies defined workflow assumptions.

- **Results**: We extracted diagnostic accuracy figures from literature on the use of biomarkers in diagnosing the main forms of neurocognitive disorders. Supported by this evidence, panelists defined the clinical setting (specialist outpatient service), application stage (MCI-mild dementia), and detailed pre-assessment screening (clinical-neuropsychological evaluations, brain imaging, and blood tests).

- **Discussion**: The Delphi consensus on these assumptions set the stage for developing the first pan-European workflow for using biomarkers in the etiological diagnosis of middle-old age neurocognitive disorders at MCI-mild dementia stages.

- **Highlights**: Rational use of biomarkers in neurocognitive disorders lacks consensus in Europe. A consensus of experts will define a workflow for the rational use of biomarkers, ensuring it is patient-centered and based on clinical presentation. The workflow will be updated as new evidence accrues.

### Early-onset dementia: Diagnostic challenges [^111fC3hf]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Starting with some difficulties in naming things and people, this patient's disease process involved progressive cognitive deterioration, a key characteristic of dementia. As the patient also experienced seizures, he was initially diagnosed with epilepsy, which was not confirmed via an initially normal EEG. An initial MRI, which was reported by the family, also indicated brain atrophy and lesions. Despite this, dementia was not considered. However, a follow-up EEG at our hospital revealed persistent spike and wave activity on the left side over the temporal lobe region with an amplitude of 50–80 μV, suggesting left temporal epileptiform activity. Widening of the axial CSF spaces, prominent sulci, and deepening of the gyri in both cerebral hemispheres, as well as in the temporal lobes bilaterally, was further evident on follow-up imaging. Collectively, the patient's imaging and EEG findings pointed towards both subcortical and cortical brain pathology and potentially epilepsy. Accordingly, mixed type dementia (cortical and subcortical) and co-morbid temporal lobe epilepsy were diagnosed.

Two observations are of note in the present case which indicate the primacy of dementia over epilepsy. First, antiepileptic medication was of no benefit to this patient in his dementia symptoms, likely due to the progressive underlying pathology and resultant dementia. Second, age-related regression measures of memory in patients with epilepsy often show that amnesia/dementia is not a direct consequence of progressive epilepsy.

Given the history, physical examination findings, and brain imaging…

### Dementia: Timely diagnosis and early intervention [^115qkEqA]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosing dementia can be difficult owing to its insidious onset, symptoms resembling "normal ageing" memory loss, and a diversity of other presenting symptoms — for example, difficulty in finding words or making decisions. An individual's ability to accommodate, compensate, or even deny his or her symptoms in the early stages should also be considered. The individual's family may also have noticed difficulties in communication and personality or mood changes; family concern is of particular importance. Increasing frequency of patients' visits to their general practice, missed appointments, or confusion over drugs may also be warning signs.

Diagnosis of subtype is important given differences in management, disease course, and outcomes for different dementias. Awareness of early symptoms in less common dementias can assist generalists in deciding to which specialist services patients are referred. Duration over which symptoms have developed is also important, with Alzheimer's disease tending to have a more insidious onset than vascular dementia.

### Diagnosing and managing patients with dementia [^114guqMi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

As the number of older Americans grows, the prevalence of dementia is increasing. Older patients who present to primary care offices often have some form of dementia, but various factors can cause the diagnosis to be missed or delayed. Physicians can work to proactively assess dementia in their patients and provide a timely diagnosis. The diagnostic process for dementia includes screening for pathology and, when indicated, conducting a cognitive evaluation and performing a differential diagnosis. Several brief but reliable tools are available to aid in screening and evaluating patients for dementia.

### Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^117UTyiM]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

For each recommendation, a series of bullet points was written, describing the rationale and considerations for implementation, followed by a narrative citing evidence for the recommendation, considerations for how to operationalize the actions represented by that recommendation, and specific situations that may be exceptions. The DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Report was then circulated to a panel of external reviewers for peer review. Based on feedback from the external reviewers and developments in the field — particularly related to advances in and accessibility of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers in the United States from 2020–2023 — the 19 DETeCD‐ADRD CPG recommendations underwent several revisions, and the final 19 DETeCD‐ADRD CPG recommendations achieved unanimous consensus for adoption on October 25, 2023. The DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Report was revised accordingly, point-by-point responses to reviews were documented, and the final DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Comprehensive Report was unanimously approved by workgroup members, and is available online.

- **Which patients might be considered for a referral to a specialist**:

Some patients, especially those who are relatively young, may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office-based examination. An evaluation by a specialist or a dementia subspecialist should be strongly considered if a patient presents with atypical cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, apraxia, agnosia), sensorimotor dysfunction (e.g. cortical visual abnormalities, movement or gait disorders), or accompanying mood/behavioral disturbances (e.g. profound anxiety, depression, apathy, psychosis, or changes in personality). Rapid progression or a fluctuating course, which may suggest potential superimposed delirium, LBD, or VCID, are also indicators for referral. Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia, usually defined as developing within weeks or months, are urgent medical problems requiring prompt examination, and in some cases, in-patient evaluation and management. Patients with atypical forms of neurodegenerative dementias may have substantially different care and management needs, as well as considerations regarding safety, compared to patients with typical presentations of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Delays in accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with atypical and young-onset dementias may cause substantial distress, harm, and costs to patients, families, and society, especially when a patient is working and/or raising children at home.

### Advances in diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and emerging treatment targets [^115RmPUR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Until recently, the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) could not truly be made until an autopsy was performed. Patients' diagnoses relied heavily on clinicians' skills to recognize signs and symptoms of AD, and these diagnoses were often incorrect. The rate of misdiagnosis was particularly high in the earlier stages of the disease, when symptoms are milder. Researchers have made significant strides over the past two decades in identifying diagnostic biomarkers and treatment targets. Can AD now be diagnosed before patients show symptoms? What do potential treatments look like? This CME presentation highlights exciting developments.

### Mild cognitive impairment: Diagnosis, longitudinal course, and emerging treatments [^114CyCRn]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is widely regarded as the intermediate stage of cognitive impairment between the changes seen in normal cognitive aging and those associated with dementia. Elderly patients with MCI constitute a high-risk population for developing dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the core clinical criteria for MCI have remained largely unchanged, the operational definition of MCI has undergone several revisions over the course of the last decade and remains an evolving diagnosis. Prognostic implications of this diagnosis are becoming clearer with regard to the risk of progressive cognitive deterioration.

While patients with MCI may represent an optimal target population for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, results from clinical trials have been mixed, and an effective treatment remains elusive. This article provides a brief overview of the evolution of the concept of MCI and reviews diagnostic criteria, the longitudinal course of the disorder, and emerging treatments for MCI.

### Outcome measures for Alzheimer's disease: A global inter-societal Delphi consensus [^11254UVw]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Low credibility.

It should be noted that cognitive tests such as the MMSE and MoCA have limitations. For example, at initial assessment, these measures are unable to determine whether a person's performance represents a decline from prior function. Cognitive tests cannot capture decline (unless obtained serially, which is not possible when a person initially presents for diagnosis) but are able to show a comparison of a person's performance on cognitive tests with the test performance of normative groups (inter-individual comparison). Because almost all normative groups are composed mainly of white people (and many are limited to English-speaking white people), cognitive test assessment of non-white people is further complicated by test bias. Ideally, a measure would capture intra-individual change and use the patient as his or her own control, which would reduce the bias currently seen with norm-referenced tests.

### Harmonized diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease: Recommendations [^116D88Ze]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Two major sets of criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have recently been published. One set is from an International Working Group (IWG) and the other from working groups convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Alzheimer's Association (AA) in the United States. These criteria aim to support a clinical diagnosis with in vivo evidence of AD pathology through imaging methods and detection of biofluid biomarkers, emphasizing an aetiological diagnosis even in the prodromal stages of the disorder. Nonetheless, there are substantial differences between these two sets of criteria.

- **Methods**: An international group of investigators with experience in the clinical diagnosis of AD met at the Key Symposium in Stockholm, Sweden, on 6 and 7 December 2012, to develop recommendations to harmonize these criteria. The group was led by individuals integral to the development of both the IWG and the NIA-AA criteria. The similarities and differences between the two sets of criteria were identified, and open discussions focused on ways to resolve the differences to yield a harmonized set of criteria.

- **Results**: Based on both published evidence and the group's collective clinical experience, the group was tasked with achieving consensus, if not unanimity, as it developed recommendations for harmonized clinical diagnostic criteria for AD.

- **Conclusion**: The recommendations are to define AD as a brain disorder, regardless of clinical status, and to refer to the clinically expressed disorder, including its prodromal stages.

### Perspectives on the diagnosis and management of functional cognitive disorder: An international Delphi study [^1124GZ5P]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Of note, although only a third of participants said they would perform bedside cognitive testing, this is confounded by the fact that the vignettes already contained some information on cognitive testing, so the chances of performing a cognitive screening test or some mental tasks are probably substantially higher than reported. Some participants nevertheless highlighted that bedside cognitive testing is not always needed if the history strongly suggests FCD, reflecting heterogeneity in clinical practice. They also acknowledge the limitations of the tests. First, people with FCD may sometimes underperform in cognitive tests, especially in the attention and executive control domains. Second, highly educated patients will often not be reassured by normal cognitive scores, which can occur in both scenarios of FCD and neurodegeneration. Participants agreed that the reasoning for cognitive testing needs to be carefully explained to the patient. Further evaluation should focus on the role of bedside cognitive testing and neuropsychological evaluation in FCD, specifically in the pursuit of more positive signs, such as incongruence between a significant drop in a domain where there is a demonstration of function on a daily basis, as in fluency tests with preserved conversational ability.

In line with this, while on one hand, CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers hold promise for a distinction between preclinical AD and non-neurodegenerative symptoms as auxiliary tests, many participants pointed out their limited specificity and sensitivity, high costs, invasiveness, and other challenges.

### Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline on the use of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease within specialized care settings [^111gJQTX]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

- **Guideline scope**: The panel identified two key clinical questions that warrant recommendation in this first iteration of the guideline: Should a blood-based biomarker (BBM) test be incorporated as a triaging test to determine the presence or absence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the diagnostic workup of individuals with cognitive impairment, including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, presenting for specialized care for memory disorders? Should a BBM test serve as a substitute for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis or amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) as a confirmatory test to determine the presence or absence of AD pathology in the diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) presenting for specialized care for memory disorders?

A triaging test refers to a test in which a negative result rules out AD pathology with high probability, whereas a positive result should be confirmed using another method, such as CSF AD biomarkers or amyloid PET. A confirmatory test refers to a test for which a negative result rules out AD pathology, and a positive test confirms AD pathology with high probability.

Input on these questions was gathered during the 2024 Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), where experts in the field provided insights to inform the development of this guideline. This guideline is not intended to serve as a comprehensive clinical pathway or appropriate use recommendations for the broader diagnostic workup or treatment decision‐making in individuals with MCI or dementia. It does not address the use of BBMs for screening purposes, use in non‐specialty settings, or use in people with no cognitive impairments.

### Test your memory (TYM test): Diagnostic evaluation of patients with non-Alzheimer dementias [^112L8gxt]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Dementia is a major health problem, with prevalence increasing as the population ages. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, but many patients have non-Alzheimer dementias. Together, non-Alzheimer diseases represent up to 50% of dementia cases and are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality globally. Examples include dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), behavioral and language variants of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), vascular dementia (VaD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Additionally, AD pathology can present atypically as posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) or logopaenic aphasia. The diagnosis of non-Alzheimer dementia is challenging. Patients with early dementia will typically present to non-specialists who have limited knowledge of less common dementias and the myriad ways they present.

The diagnosis of dementia requires a clinical assessment and examination, which in most healthcare settings includes the completion of a short cognitive test (SCT). It is important that any SCT used is sensitive to different forms of dementia, not just AD. There has been little research into the use of SCTs in the diagnosis of non-Alzheimer dementias. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is widely used and has been extensively investigated as a diagnostic test for dementia, but it may be insensitive to some non-Alzheimer dementias. More recently devised tests, such as the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examinations (ACE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), are sensitive to some non-Alzheimer forms.

### The Italian guideline on diagnosis and treatment of dementia and mild cognitive impairment [^113gFjCH]. Age and Ageing (2024). High credibility.

A timely, accurate diagnosis allows for targeted interventions and appropriate care for people with suspected dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as well as their caregivers. Although most people prefer to be informed about their dementia diagnosis, it can cause emotional distress for both people with dementia (PwD) and their families.

- **Diagnostic research questions**: Four research questions (RQs) were included: two from NG97 and two new ones. Two RQs addressed diagnostic studies evaluating the accuracy of tests used in non-specialist, primary care settings, while the other two focused on tests used in specialist settings.

- **Studies and evaluations**: Overall, 10 studies (3 from the literature update) were included for non-specialist settings and 151 studies for specialist settings. The initial evaluation in a non-specialist setting should include medical history, physical examination, blood tests, and Computer Tomography (CT)/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to exclude potentially reversible or secondary causes of cognitive decline, along with cognitive tests.

- **Recommendations for cognitive tests**: In the case of suspected cognitive decline, physicians in a non-specialist setting should use brief, validated cognitive tests. They should prefer tests translated into Italian (e.g. 6-CIT, TYM) or validated in the Italian population (e.g. GPCOG). They should not rule out cognitive decline based solely on normal cognitive test scores, and cognitive function should be regularly monitored.

All the diagnostic tests considered in the included studies are listed in the Supplementary Table S4.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

- **When should FDG PET imaging be considered**: FDG PET is a measure of cellular glucose metabolism that is usually reduced with specific patterns in patients with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and other neurodegenerative diseases, indicating synaptic dysfunction. As detailed in Recommendation 16, FDG PET may be considered in cognitively or behaviorally impaired patients where the etiological diagnosis is equivocal, with only an intermediate level of diagnostic confidence, or when very high confidence in the etiological diagnosis is needed. This may include individuals at very early clinical stages, such as early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or those with atypical clinical presentations or syndromes. Interpreting FDG PET images requires proficiency and clinical-radiographic correlation; it is not always straightforward, and, like other biomarkers, should incorporate pretest probability based on the clinical presentation, risk profile of the patient, and the possibility of multiple pathologies.

In 2004, CMS approved reimbursement of FDG PET for the purposes of differential diagnosis of AD versus FTLD. For differentiating AD versus FTLD, autopsy studies have shown that FDG PET has 80% to 99% sensitivity, 63% to 98% specificity, and 87% to 89.2% accuracy. For AD versus LBD, FDG PET has 70% to 92% sensitivity, 74% to 100% specificity, and 72% to 96% accuracy. The preponderance of high-level evidence and consensus recommendations indicates that FDG PET adds value to the diagnostic workup of patients with MCI or dementia suspected of being due to neurodegenerative disease.

### Is the time ripe for new diagnostic criteria of cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease? Consensus report of the International Congress on Vascular Dementia working group [^1115b52Z]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Validated clinical diagnostic criteria are important to identify suitable subjects for clinical trials in order to develop new drugs for VCI. Their relevance increases further if treatment strategies are to be developed that target specific pathogenic cerebrovascular mechanisms leading to VCI. Furthermore, lifestyle interventions and other non-pharmacological approaches can only be developed if the target populations are clearly defined.

Efforts towards a consensus on diagnostic criteria and guidelines to account for the heterogeneous nature of VCI, such as the recent International Society for Vascular Behavioural and Cognitive Disorders statement, must be encouraged. However, despite considerable recent advances, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the various dementia forms. Further research is therefore required before definitive criteria and guidelines can be formulated. Additionally, the success of such criteria will ultimately depend on robust pathological and clinical validation and the support of the international research community.

The present paper summarises recent major developments in relation to the clinical diagnosis of VCI. We discuss how this entity is handled in the new DSM-V criteria, how our knowledge about the relevant neuro-pathological changes impacts on the concepts surrounding this diagnosis, and what role fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers play. Further, we briefly summarise the knowledge about risk factors and how they should be addressed in the context of the clinical diagnosis.

### Isolated memory loss in anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^116m3UXi]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

To report a case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis presenting with isolated memory dysfunction, a 29-year-old woman was admitted to the Neurology Department due to memory impairment with a subacute onset. The initial assessment included EEG, neuropsychological tests, and brain MRI. Serum and CSF samples were collected for immunologic studies, and the diagnostic evaluation was completed with a total body PET scan.

The patient's neurologic examination was unremarkable apart from an episodic memory deficit, confirmed by neuropsychological examination. The EEG revealed epileptiform discharges in the temporal lobes, whereas brain MRI showed bilateral temporal lobes hyperintense lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and T2-weighted images. NMDAR-IgG was detected in the patient's serum and CSF by cell-based assay confirming the diagnosis of definite anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The total body PET showed only a slight hypometabolism in the right temporal cortex and in the cerebellar hemispheres. After a course of IV immunoglobulin and corticosteroid therapy, a marked improvement of the memory deficit was observed.

This case shows that anti-NMDAR encephalitis can present with isolated memory loss. Neural antibody testing in these patients could play a pivotal role in early diagnosis and prompt treatment.

### Advancing diagnostic certainty in Alzheimer's disease: A synthesis of the diagnostic process [^112p4jMf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). High credibility.

The typical vs atypical AD presentations show distinct patterns. The most common clinical presentation of AD is a slowly progressive amnestic syndrome. However, some patients present with atypical phenotypes, which include dysfunctions in the visual, language, executive, behavioral, or motor domains. Early-onset AD is defined by symptom onset before the age of 65 years, and these atypical presentations are more common in early-onset AD. Much of clinical diagnosis within medicine relies on pattern recognition. The combination of a younger onset, which is itself rare, and an atypical presentation may lead to a reduction in identifying such cases of AD, resulting in a subsequent delay in diagnosis. In a cohort of young-onset cases with neuropathological AD confirmation, there was a misdiagnosis rate of 53% for those with atypical presentations compared to 4% for patients with a more typical presentation.

The clinical assessment and access to a comprehensive history significantly impact the pre-test probability of a diagnosis of AD. This can prove challenging when patients attend clinics alone or do not have an available or reliable informant. Access to collateral history is essential for making a diagnosis of AD. Patients with cognitive impairment are less likely to convey information regarding their premorbid level of function and cognition and how this has changed over time. Additionally, patients may lack insight into the degree of difficulties they are experiencing. Despite collateral history being a cornerstone of diagnostic assessment, there is little research available.

### Early-onset dementia: Diagnostic challenges [^116PfnDN]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man was brought to our hospital by his family, seeking medical treatment for his long-standing progressive word-finding difficulties, forgetfulness, agitation, and social withdrawal. Despite multiple consultations with physicians, he was mistakenly diagnosed with epilepsy and prescribed multiple anticonvulsants, to which his symptoms were unresponsive. Over the next 10 years, his condition progressed, resulting in severe cognitive impairments and complete dysfunctionality.

An electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment revealed persistent spike and wave activity in the left temporal lobe. Brain MRI showed multiple small bright T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) foci within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres surrounding the ventricular system, as well as some widening of extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid spaces. The patient was finally diagnosed with early-onset dementia and temporal lobe epileptiform abnormalities. This case emphasizes the need for considering a diagnosis of dementia in cognitively impaired patients, even when they are not of an advanced age.

### Mci-to-normal reversion using neuropsychological criteria in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [^111DV796]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2019). Low credibility.

The low mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to cognitively normal (CN) reversion rate in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (2–3%) suggests the need to examine reversion by other means. We applied comprehensive neuropsychological criteria (NP criteria) to determine the resulting MCI to CN reversion rate.

- **Methods**: Participants with CN (n = 641) or MCI (n = 569) were classified at baseline and year 1 using NP criteria. Demographic, neuropsychological, and Alzheimer's disease biomarker variables, as well as progression to dementia, were examined across stable CN, reversion, and stable MCI groups.

- **Results**: NP criteria produced a one-year reversion rate of 15.8%. Reverters had demographics, Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, and risk of progression most similar to the stable CN group and showed the most improvement on neuropsychological measures from baseline to year 1.

- **Discussion**: NP criteria produced a reversion rate that is consistent with, albeit modestly improved from, reversion rates in meta-analyses. Reverters' biomarker profiles and progression rates suggest that NP criteria accurately tracked with underlying pathophysiologic status.

### Pseudodementia, pseudo-pseudodementia, and pseudodepression [^1142qCWS]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Low credibility.

When evaluating a patient who shows evidence of cognitive decline, it is crucial to exclude a number of reversible causes before diagnosing a neurodegenerative pathology. A well-known cause that needs exclusion is depression, which can significantly impair cognition, especially in older individuals and in cases of severe depression. This impairment may mimic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative pathologies. Less commonly, other psychiatric conditions, such as mania, other psychoses, and conversion disorder, can also impair cognition and create a similar clinical presentation. Historically, this phenomenon has been termed "pseudodementia" — a psychiatric condition masquerading as a neurodegenerative disease that is largely reversible when the psychiatric condition resolves or is successfully treated. The term was attributed to Wernicke, although this diagnostic possibility was recognized well before then. Despite a surge of academic interest in the 1980s and 1990s, attention to the topic has now largely waned (see Figure 1).

In this article, we reconsider the empirical evidence for the construct and the reasons for this decline. We argue, in particular, that pseudodementia and other related terms, while not supplanting modern diagnostic criteria, serve a critical role by identifying unique groups of patients with atypical presentations of their disorders and highlighting potential pitfalls in clinical decision-making. We also assert that these terms reflect a number of important considerations…

### Mild cognitive impairment: The Manchester consensus [^113KemWj]. Age and Ageing (2021). Low credibility.

Given the considerable variation in diagnostic and therapeutic practice, there is a need for national guidance on the use of neuroimaging, fluid biomarkers, cognitive testing, follow-up, and diagnostic terminology in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome reflecting a change in cognitive function and deficits on neuropsychological testing, but relatively intact activities of daily living. MCI is a risk state for further cognitive and functional decline, with 5–15% of people developing dementia per year. However, approximately 50% remain stable at five years, and in a minority, symptoms resolve over time.

There is considerable debate about whether MCI is a useful clinical diagnosis, or whether the use of the term prevents proper inquiry into underlying causes of cognitive symptoms, which can include prodromal neurodegenerative disease, other physical or psychiatric illness, or combinations thereof. Cognitive testing, neuroimaging, and fluid biomarkers can improve the sensitivity and specificity of aetiological diagnosis, with growing evidence that these may also help guide prognosis. Diagnostic criteria allow for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to be made where MCI is accompanied by appropriate biomarker changes. However, in practice, such biomarkers are not available in routine clinical practice in the UK. This would change if disease-modifying therapies became available and required a definitive diagnosis but would present major challenges to the National Health Service and similar health systems.

### The diagnosis of young-onset dementia [^114XqazZ]. The Lancet. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of dementia is devastating at any age, but diagnosis in younger patients presents a particular challenge. The differential diagnosis is broad, as late presentation of metabolic disease is common and the burden of inherited dementia is higher in these patients than in patients with late-onset dementia. The presentation of the common degenerative diseases of late life, such as Alzheimer's disease, can be different when presenting in the fifth or sixth decade. Moreover, many of the young-onset dementias are treatable. The identification of causative genes for many of the inherited degenerative dementias has led to an understanding of the molecular pathology, which is also applicable to later-onset sporadic disease. This understanding offers the potential for future treatments to be tailored to a specific diagnosis of both young-onset and late-onset dementia.

### Nationally informed recommendations on approaching the detection, assessment, and management of mild cognitive impairment [^112EtkpT]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Prior to the usual clinical symptoms of dementia, there can be subtle changes in cognitive function that differ from the normal age-related cognitive decline, which has been termed mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The increase in the number of individuals with possible MCI presenting to health care professionals, notably general practitioners (GPs), is projected to rise dramatically in the coming years. With ever-increasing demands on GPs, it is timely to provide information that can be accessed by health care professionals to assist them in making appropriate diagnoses and to provide the most relevant, evidence-based treatment options.

We have provided a comprehensive list of recommendations that aim to address key aspects of MCI in primary care. Specifically, these relate to detection and diagnosis; sharing the diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up; practical interventions to potentially delay progression; and personalizing care planning, engagement, and patient motivation for the long term.

### A 76-year-old man with cognitive and neurological symptoms [^115gTnfs]. Brain Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old man presented with cognitive symptoms, followed by headache and weakness of the lower limbs and left arm. The clinical course was progressive but fluctuating. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a contrast-enhancing lesion 1 cm in diameter was seen in the left temporal lobe. This lesion became attenuated, and a new contrast-enhancing lesion 1 x 2 cm was observed in the left frontal lobe on a subsequent MRI. Following additional tests, treatment with corticosteroids for presumptive neurosarcoidosis was started; however, he soon expired. At autopsy, there was a tumor-like mass in the left frontal lobe. Pathological evaluation revealed a primary T-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS). CNS T-cell lymphomas may be difficult to diagnose, even histologically, due to their frequent small cell morphology and lack of significant atypia.

### The differential diagnosis and treatment of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease [^116F5fMB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Identifying patients at risk for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) remains challenging in clinical practice, even as scientific understanding of dementia advances generally. That said, successfully navigating the associated differential diagnosis in AD is essential, as various causes of cognitive impairment require different treatment strategies. In recent years, the armamentarium in AD has expanded with regulatory approval of a disease-modifying therapy, aducanumab, and may be shifting away from symptomatic treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. Concurrently, the role of biomarkers in AD is increasing, and these entities may soon play a greater role in determining patient eligibility for prophylactic interventions and the likelihood of disease progression.

As the standard of care progresses, clinicians should educate patients and their care providers on the implications of these advances and reinforce lifestyle changes that can delay or prevent the onset of disease in those at risk of AD. In doing so, care providers can deliver the best care possible.

### Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis: Ovarian cancer presenting as an amnesic syndrome [^112jxDeq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) is a rare neurologic manifestation of malignancy, typically presenting with short-term memory loss, seizures, or other limbic system abnormalities. The majority of PLE cases are associated with lung and testicular cancer.

- **Case**: We present the first case of PLE attributable to epithelial ovarian cancer. A 58-year-old woman presented with rapidly progressing short-term memory loss and amnesia. The diagnosis of ovarian cancer was suspected on the basis of computed tomography scan findings. The patient showed dramatic clinical improvement within two weeks of debulking surgery and after the initiation of plasmapheresis and chemotherapy.

- **Conclusion**: Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis is a rare complication of ovarian tumors that is potentially reversible with prompt surgical management of the primary tumor, plasmapheresis, and chemotherapy.

The clinician should then probe further, assessing patient and care partner understanding and appreciation of the presence and severity of cognitive impairment and its possible etiologies. Patients could be asked to describe a typical day in their life. The clinician would then ask a follow-up question such as, "Have you ever had difficulty going about those activities you described because of cognitive changes?" Comparing the patient and care partner's responses to this question will provide insight into differences between patient and care partner perceptions. Clinicians should also assess knowledge of and concern about likely etiologies of symptoms. For example, if patients or their care partner is concerned about a cognitive change, the clinician might say, "It sounds like you have noticed a definite change in your memory and thinking. What do you think might be causing this? Is there a particular condition you are worried about?"

Discussions around any referral (e.g. for neuropsychological evaluation) or testing (e.g. neuroimaging) provide additional opportunities to assess patient understanding and appreciation. A clinician can explore the patient's or care partner's desire for information about the cause of the cognitive problems. A clinician might approach this by saying, "Today you told me that you are having trouble with your short-term memory. Based on your exam, I agree, there are changes in your memory that are beyond what we would expect for your age. I typically recommend a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain to look for causes of memory change".

### Progression to dementia or reversion to normal cognition in mild cognitive impairment as a function of late-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms [^116FF6cf]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an at-risk state for dementia; however, not all individuals with MCI transition to dementia, and some revert to normal cognition (NC). Here, we investigate whether mild behavioral impairment (MBI), the late-life onset of persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), improves the prognostic specificity of MCI.

- **Methods**: Participants with MCI from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set were included. NPS were operationalized with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire to identify participants without NPS and those with MBI (persistent, late-onset NPS). Individuals with late-onset NPS not meeting the MBI persistence criterion (NPS_NOT_MBI) were retained for secondary analyses. Progression to dementia, stable MCI, and reversion to NC after 3 years of follow-up were defined per National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association and Petersen criteria.

- **Results**: The primary sample consisted of 739 participants (NPS- n = 409 and MBI+ n = 330; 75.16 ± 8.6 years old, 40.5% female). After 3 years, 238 participants (33.6%) progressed to dementia, and 90 (12.2%) reverted to NC. Compared to participants without NPS, participants with MBI were significantly more likely to progress to dementia (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.13, 95% CI 1.52–2.99), with an annual progression rate of 14.7% (vs 8.3% for participants with MCI without NPS). Compared to participants without NPS, participants with MBI were less likely to revert to NC (AOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28–0.83, 2.5% vs 5.3% annual reversion rate).

### Is the time ripe for new diagnostic criteria of cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease? Consensus report of the International Congress on Vascular Dementia working group [^117XZ4YJ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Long before Alzheimer's disease was established as the leading cause of dementia in old age, cerebrovascular lesions were known to cause cognitive deterioration and associated disability. Since the middle of the last century, different diagnostic concepts for vascular dementia and related syndromes were put forward, yet no widely accepted diagnostic consensus exists at the time of writing.

- **Discussion**: Several international efforts, reviewed herein, are ongoing to define cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease in its different stages and subtypes. The role of biomarkers is also being discussed, including cerebrospinal fluid proteins, structural and functional brain imaging, and genetic markers. The influence of risk factors, such as diet, exercise, and different comorbidities, is emphasized by population-based research, and lifestyle changes are considered for the treatment and prevention of dementia.

- **Conclusion**: To improve the diagnosis and management of vascular cognitive impairment, further progress has to be made in understanding the relevant pathomechanisms, including shared mechanisms with Alzheimer's disease; bringing together fragmented research initiatives in coordinated international programs; testing if known risk factors are modifiable in prospective interventional studies; and defining the pre-dementia and pre-clinical stages in line with the concept of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.

### Screening for mild cognitive impairment: Comparison of "MCI specific" screening instruments [^112BYJxJ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

As society ages, the prevalence of cognitive impairment (CI) is expected to rise, resulting in increased numbers of older people presenting with memory complaints. Memory loss is a spectrum from subjective memory complaints (SMC), which are characterized by normal cognition on neuropsychological testing, to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. SMC are common, increase with age, and are associated with cognitive decline. MCI represents a heterogeneous group of disorders of memory impairment, characterized by objective and subjective memory loss but preserved function, with variable progression to dementia. Different treatment approaches are recommended depending on where patients fall on the spectrum. Thus, sensitive and specific instruments are required to screen for CI, particularly in busy clinical settings.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a well-established cognitive screen, highly sensitive at differentiating MCI from normal cognition and dementia and is widely validated against the most commonly used instrument, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), in multiple settings, disorders, and languages. Normative population data are also available. The MoCA overcomes the high ceiling effects and educational bias associated with the MMSE, has fewer practice effects, and is available in multiple formats. Although the MoCA is increasingly considered the short cognitive instrument of choice, its use as a screen presents some challenges. It is long, taking at least 10 minutes to complete, and its subtest scores are criticized for having low accuracy.

### Isolated memory loss in anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^112h4634]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

This study reports a case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis presenting with isolated memory dysfunction.

- **Methods**: A 29-year-old woman was admitted to the neurology department with memory impairment of subacute onset. The initial assessment included EEG, neuropsychological tests, and brain MRI. Serum and CSF samples were collected for immunologic studies, and the diagnostic evaluation was completed with a total body PET scan.

- **Results**: The patient's neurologic examination was unremarkable apart from an episodic memory deficit, confirmed by neuropsychological examination. The EEG revealed epileptiform discharges in the temporal lobes, whereas brain MRI showed bilateral temporal lobes hyperintense lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and T2-weighted images. NMDAR-IgG was detected in the patient's serum and CSF by cell-based assay confirming the diagnosis of definite anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The total body PET showed only slight hypometabolism in the right temporal cortex and in the cerebellar hemispheres. After a course of IV immunoglobulin and corticosteroid therapy, a marked improvement of the memory deficit was observed.

- **Discussion**: This case shows that anti-NMDAR encephalitis can present with isolated memory loss. Neural antibody testing in these patients could play a pivotal role in early diagnosis and prompt treatment.

### Biomarkers for cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly people [^112rtZE8]. The Lancet Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The threat of a looming pandemic of dementia in elderly people highlights the compelling need for the development and validation of biomarkers that can be used to identify pre-clinical and prodromal stages of disease in addition to fully symptomatic dementia. Although predictive risk factors and correlative neuroimaging measures will have important roles in these efforts, this review describes recent progress in the discovery, validation, and standardization of molecular biomarkers — small molecules and macromolecules whose concentration in the brain or biological fluids can aid diagnosis at different stages of the more common dementing diseases and in the assessment of disease progression and response to therapeutics. An approach that efficiently combines independent information from risk-factor assessment, neuroimaging measures, and biomarkers might soon guide clinicians in the early diagnosis and management of cognitive impairment in elderly people.

### Early-onset dementia: Diagnostic challenges [^113ZGkiw]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man with no medical comorbidities, who previously worked as an electrician, was initially brought by his family to our psychiatry hospital walk-in clinic seeking help for memory loss over the past 10 years. During this time, the patient's family noted mood swings, social isolation, an unsteady gait, and word-finding difficulties.

Several months after the onset of symptoms, the patient's family observed that his memory loss became more prominent, and he was unable to follow timelines of past events accurately. For instance, he argued that long-ago events had occurred only days prior. The patient also forgot the names of close relatives, maintained poor sleep (less than 3 hours per night), and altered his normal daily routines, such as religious rituals. The family reported increased agitation and anxiety during this period. The patient's functional skills began to decline gradually, and he lost the skills required to perform his job, ultimately resulting in his being laid off. Furthermore, the patient's family reported that he lost his way home on two occasions and was brought home after one day by strangers both times. Approximately five years prior to the presentation, there was an incident during a family gathering when the patient lost consciousness for a few minutes. The patient was later taken to a neurologist in his home country.

When the patient was first examined by a neurologist, an MRI and EEG were performed. The MRI revealed some brain atrophy, while the EEG was normal.

### Multicenter validation of an MMSE-MoCA conversion table [^115xwySW]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence points to the superiority of the MoCA over the MMSE as a cognitive screening tool. To facilitate the transition from the MMSE to the MoCA in clinical and research settings, authors have developed MMSE-MoCA conversion tables. However, it is unknown whether a conversion table generated from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients would apply to patients with other dementia subtypes like vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, the reliability and accuracy of MMSE-MoCA conversion tables have not been properly evaluated.

- **Method**: We retrospectively examined the MMSE-MoCA relationship in a large multicenter sample gathered from three memory clinics in Quebec, Canada, comprising 1492 patients. We produced an MMSE-MoCA conversion table using the equi-percentile method with log-linear smoothing and then cross-validated our conversion table with the ADNI dataset consisting of 1202 patients. We evaluated its accuracy for future predictions.

- **Results**: The MMSE-MoCA conversion table is consistent with previously published tables and has an intra-class correlation of 0.633 with the ADNI sample. However, we found that the MMSE-MoCA relationship is significantly modified by diagnosis (P < .01), with dementia subtypes associated with a dysexecutive syndrome showing a trend towards higher MMSE than other dementia syndromes for a given MoCA score. The large width of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for a new prediction suggests questionable reliability for clinical use.

- **Conclusion**: In this study, we validated a conversion table between MMSE and MoCA using a large multicenter.

### Recommendations for clinical implementation of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease [^115vbm1K]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

- **Determining the need for initial workup and level of concern for AD**: The healthcare provider (HCP) should assess whether the patient has objective cognitive symptoms that warrant further evaluation. If no such symptoms are present and/or if the patient declines further workup, no additional follow-up should be conducted. It may be suggested that the patient be reassessed in 6 to 12 months if the cognitive symptoms persist. If the patient has objective cognitive symptoms and is amenable to further testing, an initial workup should be initiated. This initial workup may occur during the same visit or at a follow-up visit.

The initial workup should include cognitive screening, depression and/or neurobehavioral screening, and routine bloodwork to evaluate for potential treatable causes of cognitive impairment, such as vitamin B12 deficiency and thyroid abnormalities (Figure 1, Step 2). Upon reviewing the results, the HCP should determine the patient's level of risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in accordance with local clinical and practice standards. If AD is suspected as the cause of cognitive impairment, the HCP should discuss the results with the patient and care partner, ensuring their interest in continued workup before proceeding. Conversely, if the patient's cognitive impairment is not thought to be caused by AD, the patient should be evaluated for non-AD causes.

- **Conducting a BBM test in primary or secondary care**: The next step is to conduct a blood-based biomarker (BBM) test in either primary or secondary care (Figure 1, Step 3).

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Clinical and radiological manifestations, pathophysiology, and outstanding questions [^116wEimm]. The Lancet Neurology (2015). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the identification and diagnosis of PRES in patients presenting with specific neurological symptoms and risk factors. This tool is particularly useful in differentiating PRES from other neurological conditions with similar presentations.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the presence of at least one acute neurological symptom, at least one risk factor, specific findings on brain imaging, and the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Acute neurological symptoms may include seizures, encephalopathy, confusion, headache, or visual disturbances. Risk factors encompass severe hypertension or blood pressure fluctuations, renal failure, immunosuppressant therapy, chemotherapy, eclampsia, or an autoimmune disorder. The brain imaging should either be normal, show bilateral vasogenic edema, or cytotoxic edema with a pattern indicative of PRES.

The diagnostic criteria for PRES are met if all four components are present. If any of these components are absent, the diagnostic criteria for PRES are not met, suggesting the need for further investigation into alternative diagnoses. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of PRES, facilitating early recognition and appropriate management of this condition.

### Evaluation of suspected dementia [^113y5oDf]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

As the proportion of persons in the United States older than 65 years increases, the prevalence of dementia will increase as well. Risk factors for dementia include age, family history of dementia, apolipoprotein E4 genotype, cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic anticholinergic use, and lower educational level. Patient history, physical examination, functional assessment, cognitive testing, laboratory studies, and imaging studies are used to assess a patient with suspected dementia.

A two-visit approach is time-effective for primary care physicians in a busy outpatient setting. During the first visit, the physician should administer a screening test such as the verbal fluency test, the Mini-Cognitive Assessment Instrument, or the Sweet 16. These tests have high sensitivity and specificity for detecting dementia and can be completed in as little as 60 seconds. If the screening test result is abnormal or clinical suspicion of another disease is present, appropriate laboratory and imaging tests should be ordered, and the patient should return for additional cognitive testing.

A second visit should include a Mini-Mental State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, and verbal fluency and clock drawing tests, if not previously completed.

### Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline on the use of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease within specialized care settings [^1115uthu]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

The population and setting for this guideline include individuals with objective cognitive impairment (i.e. MCI or dementia) presenting to specialized care settings due to cognitive complaints. Objective cognitive impairment requires objective evidence of cognitive deficits detected by cognitive assessment tools and/or medical examination and provider assessment. It does not include subjective cognitive decline, in which the patient perceives changes in memory or other cognitive domains but performs as expected on cognitive testing, and a trained provider does not detect notable deficits (e.g. aphasia, disinhibition, executive dysfunction) in assessment.

The panel developed recommendations for BBM testing only in individuals with objective cognitive impairment who have already completed a comprehensive clinical workup. This guideline does not extend to cognitively unimpaired individuals, given the lack of clinical relevance for BBM use in this population. The panel made the a priori decision not to use data for cognitively impaired and unimpaired populations combined to inform recommendations. This approach aims to minimize indirectness and account for the fact that test performance could appear more favorable in populations with a bimodal distribution of brain amyloid (i.e. individuals with very low [cognitively unimpaired] or very high [AD-like dementia] brain amyloid levels).

### Relationship between the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination for assessment of mild cognitive impairment in older adults [^111GS32s]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed to enable earlier detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) relative to familiar multi-domain tests like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Clinicians need to better understand the relationship between MoCA and MMSE scores.

- **Methods**: For this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 219 healthy control (HC), 299 MCI, and 100 Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-GO/2 database to evaluate MMSE and MoCA score distributions. We selected MoCA values to capture early and late MCI cases. Stepwise variable selection in logistic regression evaluated the relative value of four test domains for separating MCI from HC. Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) was evaluated as a strategy to separate dementia from MCI. Equi-percentile equating produced a translation grid for MoCA against MMSE scores. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses evaluated lower cutoff scores for capturing the most MCI cases.

- **Results**: Most dementia cases scored abnormally, while MCI and HC score distributions overlapped on each test. Most MCI cases scored ≥ 17 on MoCA (96.3%) and ≥ 24 on MMSE (98.3%). The ceiling effect (28–30 points) for MCI and HC was less using MoCA (18.1%) versus MMSE (71.4%). MoCA and MMSE scores correlated most for dementia (r = 0.86; versus MCI r = 0.60; HC r = 0.43). Equi-percentile equating showed a MoCA score of 18 was equivalent to an MMSE of 24. ROC analysis found MoCA ≥ 17 as the cutoff between MCI and dementia that emphasized high sensitivity (92.3%).
