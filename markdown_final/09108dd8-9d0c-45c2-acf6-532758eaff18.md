## Question

how do you treat sciatica?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat sciatica. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding red flags. Then, I should verify the natural history and prognosis to set expectations. Next, I will review first-line conservative care, including activity, analgesics, and physiotherapy. After that, I need to check when to image and escalate to interventional options. Then, I will examine surgical indications, timing, and comparative effectiveness. I should also consider special populations and mechanism-based care. Finally, I will integrate shared decision-making and a practical algorithm, while double-checking the strength and certainty of the evidence at each step.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and screen for red flags, because I need to ensure we are dealing with true radicular pain rather than somatic referred pain and that there is no emergent pathology. True sciatica typically presents as unilateral leg pain radiating below the knee, often worse than back pain, with dermatomal sensory changes, positive straight-leg raise, and possible myotomal weakness or reflex changes, whereas imaging is not indicated initially unless there are red flags such as cauda equina, progressive motor deficit, infection, or malignancy, in which case urgent MRI is warranted [^113KCa4R] [^111TFJhh].

> Wait, let me verify the natural history before proposing any treatment, because expectations drive management. Most patients with acute sciatica improve substantially within 2–4 weeks, and about two-thirds recover by 2–3 months without invasive treatment, though 20–30% have persistent pain at one year, so I should counsel that early aggressive interventions are not always necessary and that watchful waiting is reasonable in the absence of red flags [^113KCa4R] [^113ycnyi].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative care, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about specific modalities until I check the evidence. Advice to stay active is preferred over bed rest, which offers little benefit and may be harmful with prolonged use, and structured exercise may confer small short-term advantages over simple advice for leg pain, although long-term outcomes are similar, so I will prioritize graded activity and reassurance while avoiding enforced rest [^111neChg] [^116mLF2P]. For analgesia, I need to double-check the data: NSAIDs show at best very small, clinically trivial effects on pain and no clear benefit on disability, with higher adverse event risk, so I should use them cautiously and consider acetaminophen as an alternative when appropriate, while avoiding routine opioids given limited evidence and potential harms in this population [^112sWKPY] [^112HUDiu] [^115VyQ8n]. Regarding physiotherapy, I should confirm the current evidence: contemporary meta-analyses suggest no consistent short-, medium-, or long-term superiority of physiotherapy over control interventions for pain or disability in clinically diagnosed sciatica, likely due to heterogeneity and risk of bias, so I will frame PT as reasonable but evidence-limited, and tailor it to patient preference and function rather than as a guaranteed disease-modifying therapy [^117WRM8d] [^116avvRN] [^111jg71Q].

> I will now examine when to image and escalate, and I need to ensure I align with guideline thresholds. Imaging is generally reserved for patients who fail a trial of conservative care (often 6–8 weeks), have severe or progressive neurologic deficits, or when surgery is being considered, with MRI preferred to avoid radiation and to define a surgical target if needed, recognizing that only a minority of secondary care patients have a clear MRI-clinical concordant surgical indication at presentation [^113KCa4R] [^117YC1dX] [^11242oAe].

> Let me consider interventional options next, and I should confirm the magnitude and duration of benefit. Epidural steroid injections, particularly transforaminal approaches, provide a small, short-term reduction in leg pain and disability over placebo, typically lasting weeks to a few months, and are reasonable for patients with severe radicular pain after failed conservative care or as a bridge to recovery, acknowledging that long-term benefits are uncertain and prognostic factors for response are inconsistent across studies [^111AUGZQ] [^1128dqir] [^114uHHgM]. Hold on, I should verify comparative effectiveness with surgery: in the NERVES randomized trial, TFESI achieved similar 18-week disability outcomes to microdiscectomy at lower cost and with fewer serious adverse events, supporting TFESI as a first invasive option in appropriately selected patients with disc herniation and persistent symptoms [^113BAPqA] [^112GDcim].

> Now, I should review surgical indications and timing, and I need to be precise about expected benefits. Discectomy offers faster relief of leg pain and disability in the immediate to short term, with effects diminishing over time such that long-term outcomes are similar to non-surgical care, so surgery is best justified when rapid improvement is a priority or when non-surgical care fails, and not as a default first-line option [^113UAS6C] [^11234V9U] [^114cxeYD]. Let me double-check timing data: early surgery yields faster recovery compared with prolonged conservative care, but 1-year outcomes are comparable, reinforcing that timing should be individualized based on severity, functional impact, and patient preferences rather than a fixed calendar alone [^114fxZpX] [^113ycnyi]. I should confirm that contemporary trials in chronic sciatica also show superiority of microdiscectomy over standardized nonoperative care at 6 months, which can inform discussions for patients with persistent symptoms beyond the acute window [^111CPR4z].

> But wait, what about special populations and mechanism-based care, since heterogeneity may explain modest treatment effects. In patients with a confirmed neuropathic pain phenotype, combining non-pharmacological strategies may yield better short-term improvements in back pain and disability than single interventions, though leg pain benefits are inconsistent and evidence certainty is low, so I should consider multimodal pain programs when neuropathic features predominate while setting realistic expectations [^113bsyoP]. For acute emergency settings, intravenous paracetamol or morphine can provide short-term pain relief, whereas corticosteroids have not shown benefit at ED discharge, so I should avoid routine systemic steroids in the acute phase unless there is a compelling non-sciatica indication [^1172aFKD]. I need to ensure I do not overstate traction or manipulation; traction has not shown consistent benefit for sciatica, and while manipulation may help some low back pain patients, evidence specific to sciatica is limited and heterogeneous, so I will not prioritize these modalities [^114SVTZ4] [^115Envnu].

> Next, I should review shared decision-making, because preferences and values often drive acceptable trade-offs. Patients frequently desire diagnostic certainty via imaging and may be reluctant to use strong opioids, whereas clinicians may be more comfortable with opioids as a bridge and may differ in their enthusiasm for early surgery or injections, leading to practice variation. Explicitly discussing the rationale, timing, and probabilistic outcomes behind each option can reduce discordance and improve alignment with patient goals [^111fahzD] [^113XqeKP] [^113vqXpj]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse this approach. Stepped-care frameworks emphasize patient-centered deliberation given the uncertainty and heterogeneity of sciatica, reinforcing the need for clear communication about benefits, risks, costs, and recovery trajectories [^117YC1dX] [^113C4etd].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm, and I will double-check that each step is evidence-concordant. Start with education and reassurance about the favorable natural history, advise staying active with avoidance of prolonged bed rest, and provide simple analgesia such as acetaminophen with cautious, time-limited NSAID use if needed, while avoiding routine opioids. If symptoms persist beyond roughly 6–8 weeks or worsen, obtain MRI and consider referral for TFESI or surgical consultation, recognizing that TFESI is a reasonable first invasive step with similar medium-term outcomes to surgery at lower cost. Reserve discectomy for patients prioritizing faster relief, those with persistent incapacitating pain despite appropriate conservative and interventional care, or those with progressive neurologic deficits, with explicit counseling that long-term results are comparable to non-surgical care [^113KCa4R] [^113BAPqA] [^113UAS6C] [^11234V9U]. I should confirm that this aligns with cost-effectiveness modeling, which generally favors stepped approaches beginning with non-opioid conservative care before surgery, supporting the sequence proposed here [^1153ozow].

> Finally, I need to ensure the strength of evidence is transparent. Much of the literature on physiotherapy, pharmacotherapy, injections, and even surgery suffers from low to very low certainty due to risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, so I should communicate uncertainty, discuss probabilities, and revisit decisions as new information emerges or as the patient's preferences evolve over time [^117WRM8d] [^112sWKPY] [^113UAS6C] [^114q2ANE]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that surgery is categorically superior; to correct that, surgery achieves faster relief but converges to similar long-term outcomes, so the choice remains preference-sensitive and context-dependent rather than universally superior [^113UAS6C] [^11234V9U].

Sciatica treatment should follow a **stepped care approach** [^111F2Kgh], starting with **conservative management** (education, activity, NSAIDs) for 6–12 weeks [^114fxZpX], then adding **structured exercise or physiotherapy** if needed [^116mLF2P]. If pain persists, consider **epidural steroid injections** for short-term relief [^111AUGZQ] [^1128dqir]. Surgery (microdiscectomy) is reserved for persistent, disabling symptoms or neurologic deficits, offering faster relief but similar long-term outcomes to conservative care [^114L4it6] [^114fxZpX]. Acupuncture may help some patients but evidence is limited [^116mKXVv]; opioids are not first-line due to risks [^111jfPh3]. Management should be individualized with shared decision-making [^113XqeKP].

---

## Conservative management (first-line)

Conservative care is **first-line** for most patients, with many improving within 6–12 weeks [^113naTCY].

- **Education and reassurance**: Explain the benign course and encourage staying active; avoid prolonged bed rest [^111neChg].

- **Activity and exercise**: Encourage normal activities and graded exercise; structured programs may reduce pain and disability [^116mLF2P].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: NSAIDs are commonly used; evidence is limited and effects are modest, so use cautiously [^112sWKPY] [^112HUDiu].

---

## Physical therapy

Physical therapy is often recommended but **evidence is mixed** [^117WRM8d]; individualized programs may help some patients [^notfound].

- **Exercise therapy**: Core strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic exercise may reduce pain and improve function [^notfound].

- **Manual therapy**: Spinal manipulation may provide short-term relief for some patients [^notfound].

- **Patient selection**: Therapy should be tailored to symptom severity, duration, and patient preference [^114L4it6].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions

Medications can provide symptomatic relief but **evidence is limited** [^115VyQ8n]; use the lowest effective dose and monitor for adverse effects.

| **Medication class** | **Evidence summary** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | Modest short-term pain relief; gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks | Short-term use if tolerated |
| Acetaminophen | Limited evidence; may help mild pain | Consider for mild symptoms |
| Muscle relaxants | Short-term relief; sedation common | Short-term use if needed |
| Opioids | Not first-line; risks outweigh benefits | Avoid or limit use |
| Antidepressants | Limited evidence; may help chronic neuropathic pain | Consider for chronic cases |
| Anticonvulsants | Limited evidence; gabapentin may help chronic pain | Consider for chronic neuropathic pain |

---

## Interventional procedures

Interventions are considered when **conservative care fails** or pain is severe.

- **Epidural steroid injections**: Provide short-term relief; consider for persistent radicular pain [^111AUGZQ] [^1128dqir].

- **Transforaminal epidural steroid injections**: May be effective for disc-related sciatica; consider before surgery [^113BAPqA].

- **Percutaneous disc decompression**: Minimally invasive option for selected patients [^117AHqac].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for **persistent symptoms** or neurologic deficits, with microdiscectomy the standard procedure [^115EuZHV].

- **Indications**: Persistent pain > 6–12 weeks, progressive neurologic deficits, or cauda equina syndrome [^113naTCY].

- **Outcomes**: Faster pain relief and recovery vs conservative care, but long-term outcomes are similar [^114fxZpX] [^113UAS6C].

- **Risks**: Infection, bleeding, nerve injury, recurrence; discuss with patients [^notfound].

---

## Alternative therapies

Acupuncture may provide **short-term relief** for some patients, but evidence is limited and inconsistent [^116mKXVv] [^111intyj].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Education and self-management are **essential**, improving adherence and outcomes [^notfound].

- **Education**: Explain the benign course, activity encouragement, and realistic expectations [^113KCa4R].

- **Self-management**: Home exercises, posture training, and weight management [^116mLF2P].

- **Psychological support**: Address fear-avoidance and anxiety to improve function [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment should be **individualized** based on symptom duration and severity, with longer duration and greater severity prompting earlier escalation. Patient preferences, comorbidities, and contraindications guide safe, acceptable options, and resource availability may influence access to surgery or injections [^113XqeKP].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines endorse a **stepped care approach**, starting with conservative care and escalating as needed [^111F2Kgh]. Shared decision-making is emphasized to align choices with patient values and goals [^113vqXpj]. Multidisciplinary care involving primary care, physiotherapy, pain specialists, and surgery is recommended for complex cases [^112dHsJD].

---

Sciatica treatment should be **stepped and individualized**, starting with conservative care and escalating to interventions or surgery if needed. Most patients improve with conservative management, and surgery offers faster relief but similar long-term outcomes.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^113ycnyi]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

In primary care, about two thirds of people with sciatica recover within two to three monthswithout the need or even an indication for invasive treatments. Therefore, extrapolation of Liu and colleagues' findings to a primary care population would be misleading. Their conclusions should be limited to people with a specific diagnosis of radicular pain with or without radiculopathy, who have likely not responded adequately to non-surgical approaches, or to people with severe pain and a large enough impact on quality of life to warrant secondary care referral. A more appropriate conclusion might be that discectomy could be an option for people with radicular pain (with or without radiculopathy) who present to secondary care settings with a clear indication for surgery.

Despite limitations related to the low certainty of evidence, Liu and colleagues' review raises an important point for clinicians, people with sciatica, and policy makers. Growing evidence for worse surgical outcomes associated with prolonged symptom duration, together with the better short and medium term benefits of discectomy reported in this systematic review, challenge the stepped care approach that offers the least invasive options first to everyone with sciatica. Expedited surgical triage would be preferable for people with discogenic sciatica and a clear indication for surgery when rapid pain relief is a priority. Although many international pathways have this intention, reality is often divergent. Access to specialist services is difficult and delayed in many health systems globally, requiring proactiveness and perseverance from the patient, which is often compromised by their symptoms. Easier and faster access to surgical triage is needed for patients who are most likely to benefit.

Although the new review cannot provide clear treatment recommendations, the findings highlight one of the main obstacles to improving outcomes in this clinical field: sciatica is a heterogeneous condition and no routine clinical measures can consistently predict outcome. This knowledge gap hinders early triage, including to more invasive treatments. Solving the heterogeneity puzzle is the key to helping people with sciatica and clinicians choose the right treatment for them earlier in the disease trajectory, while being fully informed of the benefits and risks of surgery.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116avvRN]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, in patients with clinically diagnosed sciatica, physiotherapy interventions trialed to date provide inadequate evidence to make specific recommendations on their effectiveness in reducing pain or disability. The lack of convincing evidence may be due to several factors including incomplete trial reporting, clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity, and trials lacking high methodological quality. Rather than continuing to perform trials in the heterogeneous population of 'sciatica', future studies should focus on reducing clinical heterogeneity, using contemporary physiotherapy interventions and high methodological quality to hopefully end the roadblock of discovery on the most effective physiotherapy interventions for these patient populations.

Limitations

This review has limitations. Although we included a larger number of trials compared with previous reviews, the certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low. High crossover rates from the non-surgical arm to the surgical arm (ranged from 30% to 54%) occurred in many trials, which means the effects of surgery on clinical outcomes could have been underestimated, particularly in the later time points. As mentioned previously, the included trials are underpowered and inappropriately designed to effectively evaluate adverse event occurrence.

Reporting of non-surgical comparators was generally poor, with most trials not describing what types of treatments participants received, who provided these treatments, how they were provided, and how much treatment they received. For example, the SPORT trial reported the type of non-surgical treatment received by participants (physical therapy (73% of patients), epidural injections (50%), and medical treatments (eg, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; > 50%) without specifying other details. Similarly Bailey and colleagues' trial only reported that education, activity and exercise, oral analgesics, physiotherapy, and epidural glucocorticoid injection were used in the non-surgical group, without providing specific data on the proportion of patients receiving each of these non-surgical treatments. Furthermore, non-surgical treatments varied considerably within and between countries. For example, the use of epidural steroid injections varies widely among different US states, as do referrals to physiotherapy between Denmark and the Netherlands. The two included Chinese trials used traditional Chinese medicine in the non-surgical group, which lacks evidence supporting its effectiveness. In our review, we grouped all non-surgical interventions together, however, these interventions were not only poorly detailed but also highly heterogeneous. Therefore, questions remain as to whether non-surgical treatment provided in the control arms of many trials represents a suboptimal approach to treating sciatica, in addition to the ramifications that this uncertainty would have on its comparison to discectomy. However, evidence is scarce in supporting many non-surgical treatments for sciatica.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117AHqac]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Other than radiographical evidence of disc herniation and corresponding signs or symptoms, the included studies varied in their method of identifying patients who would be considered for surgery. Differences were apparent in the requirement of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment, having incapacitating sciatica, or having persistent (> four months) sciatica. Seven (58.3%) of 12 trials did not specify how they identified patients. Thus, the study populations might vary across included trials. Also, participants were not typical patients with sciatica from the community because they were assessed for eligibility by surgeons.

Evidence update and meaning of the study

Compared with the most recent review, which only pooled data for disability within 24 months, our review provides results on leg pain, disability, back pain, and adverse events from the immediate term to five years after randomisation. Thus, unlike the equivocal benefits previously reported, we found that discectomy was initially beneficial but the effect declined over time, compared with either non-surgical care or epidural steroid injections. Generally, discectomy resulted in faster relief in pain and disability, but only up to 12 months. We also investigated the optimal timing of surgery for sciatica by conducting a subgroup analysis by symptom duration (less or greater than three months). Greater reductions in leg pain were reported in people with symptoms for less than three months at immediate and medium term, however, the differences were not significant. A post hoc exploratory subgroup analysis of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment suggests that trials without specifying the non-surgical treatment in the inclusion criteria reported higher effects in reducing leg pain (immediate term) and improving disability (short term) than did trials with unsuccessful non-surgical treatment.

We presented discectomy primarily because this surgical treatment is the most widely used for lumbar disc herniation. Nevertheless, the choice of surgical treatment by surgeon varies between countries. Thus, in our review, we presented results for a broader range of surgical procedures. Plasma disc decompression showed a moderate effect on leg pain and disability when compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections. Similarly, chemonucleolysis with condoliase was shown to have moderate effects on leg pain and slight effects on disability.

Data synthesis and analysis

We grouped the studies by surgical procedures. Then, within each surgical procedure, comparators were grouped as non-surgical (non-pharmacological or pharmacological) treatment, epidural steroid injections, and placebo or sham surgery (eg, intradiscal injection of saline solution). We presented discectomy as the primary surgical procedure because this procedure is most widely used for sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

Where appropriate, we converted continuous pain and disability outcomes to a common 0–100 scale (0 represents no pain or disability, 100 represents worst pain or disability) (supplemental files 3–5). We pooled data where possible, reported continuous outcomes as mean difference and 95% confidence intervals, and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical heterogeneity was determined with the I² test. A random effects model was used for all pooled comparisons.

Rather than selecting an arbitrary minimum clinically important threshold, we adopted a system of reporting consistent with the recommendations from the American College of Physicians' 2017 guidelines for low back pain. For pain and disability measured on a 0–100 point scale, an effect size of 5–10 points was considered small, 10–20 points moderate, and more than 20 points large. After reviewing the data, we considered effect size below 5 to be negligible.

Subgroup and exploratory meta-regression

We conducted preplanned subgroup analyses of our estimates of treatment effect (leg pain and disability) at each follow-up time to explore the influence of mean duration of symptom (< 3 months or > 3 months), approach of discectomy (micro or open). We also did post hoc subgroup analyses to explore the influence of analgesics in the comparator group (yes or no), small study effects (< 100 participants in each arm), and unsuccessful non-surgical treatment (yes or no).

We performed univariate meta-regression analyses of difference of means (leg pain and disability) on year of publication, duration of symptom, and sample size as continuous variables, in the comparison of discectomy versus non-surgical treatment across all time points.

Patient and public involvement

Due to the lack of funding, patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of this study.

### Efficacy of electroacupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicine on pain intensity for chronic sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^1136rP2m]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is characterized by radiating leg pain extending from the buttock down the course of the sciatic nerve and accompanied by back pain and neurological deficits sometimes. Symptoms of sciatic pain are common with the highest incidence of 40%, and the pain can easily progress to a chronic and recurrent stage, as sciatica can be caused by interference anywhere in the sciatic nerve. Of all patients with sciatica, 85% of cases are associated with a disc disorder. The prevalence of sciatica varies between 1.6% and 43%, with a significantly higher incidence in developing countries. Thus, sciatica is thought to be a major health issue worldwide. In addition to severe disability and work absenteeism, it has a significant impact on medical costs. Surgical treatment has short-term benefits for patients with acute sciatica, but the long-term benefits are not obvious. Besides its high cost is often prohibitive. Conservative treatments (eg, exercise and spinal manipulation) are more acceptable for cost-efficiency and their few adverse reactions. However, the efficacy of them is controversial. Based on the above analysis, safe, economical, and effective treatments are an unmet clinical need for patients with chronic sciatica.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115xwyUk]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction

Two authors extracted data independently and were reviewed by a third author. We extracted data according to the hierarchy of between group differences (ie, mean difference) and 95% confidence intervals, post-treatment means and standard deviations, and then pretreatment to post-treatment within group change scores. When standard deviations were not reported, the Cochrane's RevMan calculator was used to estimate standard deviations. When it was not possible to estimate standard deviations, we borrowed them from a similar study included in the review. When data were not available in the published manuscript, we sought to extract data from the trial registry, if available.

We classified follow-up times into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months). In studies with multiple time points, we extracted data from the time point closest to six weeks and to months three, six, and 12. Outcomes longer than 12 months were also extracted.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity (eg, Numerical Pain Rating Scale, Visual Analogue Scale) and disability (eg, Oswestry Disability Index, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire). Secondary outcomes were back pain intensity, health related quality of life (eg, short form-36), adverse events (any adverse event and serious adverse events as defined by each study), and satisfaction with treatment (eg, Likert Scale).

### Surgery versus prolonged conservative treatment for sciatica [^114fxZpX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lumbar-disk surgery often is performed in patients who have sciatica that does not resolve within 6 weeks, but the optimal timing of surgery is not known.

Methods

We randomly assigned 283 patients who had had severe sciatica for 6 to 12 weeks to early surgery or to prolonged conservative treatment with surgery if needed. The primary outcomes were the score on the Roland Disability Questionnaire, the score on the visual-analogue scale for leg pain, and the patient's report of perceived recovery during the first year after randomization. Repeated-measures analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle was used to estimate the outcome curves for both groups.

Results

Of 141 patients assigned to undergo early surgery, 125 (89%) underwent microdiskectomy after a mean of 2.2 weeks. Of 142 patients designated for conservative treatment, 55 (39%) were treated surgically after a mean of 18.7 weeks. There was no significant overall difference in disability scores during the first year (P = 0.13). Relief of leg pain was faster for patients assigned to early surgery (P < 0.001). Patients assigned to early surgery also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.72 to 2.22; P < 0.001). In both groups, however, the probability of perceived recovery after 1 year of follow-up was 95%.

Conclusions

The 1-year outcomes were similar for patients assigned to early surgery and those assigned to conservative treatment with eventual surgery if needed, but the rates of pain relief and of perceived recovery were faster for those assigned to early surgery.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^116zqjoi]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a common and bothersome medical problem. It typically presents as unilateral gluteal pain that may involve one leg in association with motor or sensory disturbances. Chronic sciatica may cause personal morbidity and negatively impact an individual's quality of life (QOL). The prevalence of sciatica varies among studies, with incidences of 24–40% for different etiologies. The most common cause of sciatica is a herniated or bulging lumbar intervertebral disc. Other nondiscogenic causes that may contribute to sciatica include bony or muscular compression, vascular anomalies, and epidural adhesion. Owing to the diverse origins of sciatica, the most effective treatment for sciatica remains unknown. A recently published guideline (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE]) for treating low back pain with or without sciatica suggests administering noninvasive treatments such as physical therapy, yoga, tai chi, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for first-line management of the condition. However, the NICE guidelines do not suggest patients with sciatica receive acupuncture treatment due to the relatively low-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials.

Acupuncture has been proposed as a treatment resulting in better outcomesfor many muscular and neurological diseases such as fibromyalgia, migraines, chronic pain syndrome, and acute stroke.–Acupuncture maneuvers may elicit a sensation of "de qi" (ie, dull pain, soreness or needling sensation) to achieve analgesia: neural signals are transferred through the peripheral nociceptive pathway, leading to a central neuromodulatory effect.

Nevertheless, there are several debates surrounding acupuncture treatment because there is inadequate evidence to promote its routine use. Some clinical trials and meta-analyses have recently contributed more evidence regarding acupuncture treatment for sciatica.–He et al, in their study of post-partum sciatica, revealed that up to 98% of patients in the treatment group recovered, compared with 24% in the non-acupuncture control group. Zhang et al showed electroacupuncture had greater short- and long-term benefits for chronic discogenic sciatica than medium-frequency electrotherapy. Qiu et al also demonstrated that acupuncture may stimulate the sciatic nerve trunk and effectively relieve pain in patients with discogenic sciatica. Moreover, acupuncture may reduce sciatica pain intensity, increase the pain threshold, enhance the effects of drug, and improve outcomes. The benefits of acupuncture in treating sciatica are well known; however, the possible dose-related response has not been sufficiently explored.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117WRM8d]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Physiotherapy interventions are prescribed as first-line treatment for people with sciatica; however, their effectiveness remains controversial. The purpose of this systematic review was to establish the short-, medium- and long-term effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to control interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica.

Methods

This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42018103900. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PEDro, PubMed, Scopus and grey literature were searched from inception to January 2021 without language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials evaluating physiotherapy interventions compared to a control intervention in people with clinical or imaging diagnosis of sciatica. Primary outcome measures were pain and disability. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers with consensus reached by discussion or third-party arbitration if required. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool with third-party consensus if required. Meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed with random effects models using Revman v5.4. Subgroup analyses were undertaken to examine the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to minimal (e.g. advice only) or substantial control interventions (e.g. surgery).

Results

Three thousand nine hundred and fifty eight records were identified, of which 18 trials were included, with a total number of 2699 participants. All trials had a high or unclear risk of bias. Meta-analysis of trials for the outcome of pain showed no difference in the short (SMD -0.34 [95%CI -1.05, 0.37] p = 0.34, I² = 98%), medium (SMD 0.15 [95%CI -0.09, 0.38], p = 0.22, I² = 80%) or long term (SMD 0.09 [95%CI -0.18, 0.36], p = 0.51, I² = 82%). For disability there was no difference in the short (SMD -0.00 [95%CI -0.36, 0.35], p = 0.98, I² = 92%, medium (SMD 0.25 [95%CI -0.04, 0.55] p = 0.09, I² = 87%), or long term (SMD 0.26 [95%CI -0.16, 0.68] p = 0.22, I² = 92%) between physiotherapy and control interventions. Subgroup analysis of studies comparing physiotherapy with minimal intervention favoured physiotherapy for pain at the long-term time points. Large confidence intervals and high heterogeneity indicate substantial uncertainly surrounding these estimates. Many trials evaluating physiotherapy intervention compared to substantial intervention did not use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

Conclusion

Based on currently available, mostly high risk of bias and highly heterogeneous data, there is inadequate evidence to make clinical recommendations on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica. Future studies should aim to reduce clinical heterogeneity and to use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

### Emergency department interventions for adult patients with low back pain: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^1172aFKD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most low back pain trials have limited applicability to the emergency department (ED) because they provide treatment and measure outcomes after discharge from the ED. We investigated the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions delivered in the ED to patients with non-specific low back pain and/or sciatica on patient-relevant outcomes measured during the emergency visit.

Methods

Literature searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL from inception to week 1 February 2020. We included all randomised controlled trials investigating adult patients (≥ 18 years) with non-specific low back pain and/or sciatica presenting to ED. The primary outcome of interest was pain intensity. Two reviewers independently screened the full texts, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias of each trial using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The overall quality of evidence, or certainty, provided by a set of trials evaluating the same treatment was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, which considers imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness and bias in the evidence.

Results

Fifteen trials (1802 participants) were included with 12 of 15 at low risk of bias (ie, PEDro score > 6). Based on results from individual trials and moderate quality evidence, ketoprofen gel was more effective than placebo for non-specific low back pain at 30min (mean difference (MD) -15.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.0 to -9.0). For those with sciatica (moderate quality evidence), intravenous paracetamol (acetaminophen) (MD -15.7, 95%CI -19.8 to -11.6) and intravenous morphine (MD -11.4, 95%CI -21.6 to -1.2) were both superior to placebo at 30min. Based on moderate quality of evidence, corticosteroids showed no benefits against placebo at emergency discharge for non-specific low back pain (MD 9.0, 95%CI -0.71 to 18.7) or sciatica (MD -6.8, 95%CI -24.2 to 10.6). There were conflicting results from trials comparing different pharmacological options (moderate quality evidence) or investigating non-pharmacological treatments (low quality evidence).

Conclusion

Ketoprofen gel for non-specific low back pain and intravenous paracetamol or morphine for sciatica were superior to placebo, whereas corticosteroids were ineffective for both conditions. There was conflicting evidence for comparisons of different pharmacological options and those involving non-pharmacological treatments. Additional trials measuring important patient-related outcomes to EDs are needed.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113UAS6C]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits over non-surgical care reduced over time. Discectomy might be an option for people who require rapid leg pain relief and disability improvement, when the benefits outweigh the risks and costs related to surgery.

### Surgery or physical activity in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115bRoxp]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous reviews have compared surgical to non-surgical management of sciatica, but have overlooked the specific comparison between surgery and physical activity-based interventions.

Methods

Systematic review using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase and PEDro databases was conducted. Randomised controlled trials comparing surgery to physical activity, where patients were experiencing the three most common causes of sciatica-disc herniation, spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. Two independent reviewers extracted pain and disability data (converted to a common 0–100 scale) and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. The size of the effects was estimated for each outcome at three different time points, with a random effects model adopted and the GRADE approach used in summary conclusions.

Results

Twelve trials were included. In the short term, surgery provided better outcomes than physical activity for disc herniation: disability [WMD -9.00 (95% CI -13.73, -4.27)], leg pain [WMD -16.01 (95% CI -23.00, -9.02)] and back pain [WMD -12.44 (95% CI -17.76, -7.09)]; for spondylolisthesis: disability [WMD -14.60 (95% CI -17.12, -12.08)], leg pain [WMD -35.00 (95% CI -39.66, -30.34)] and back pain [WMD -20.00 (95% CI -24.66, -15.34)] and spinal stenosis: disability [WMD -11.39 (95% CI -17.31, -5.46)], leg pain [WMD, -27.17 (95% CI -35.87, -18.46)] and back pain [WMD -20.80 (95% CI -25.15, -16.44)]. Long-term and greater than 2-year post-randomisation results favoured surgery for spondylolisthesis and stenosis, although the size of the effects reduced with time. For disc herniation, no significant effect was shown for leg and back pain comparing surgery to physical activity.

Conclusion

There are indications that surgery is superior to physical activity-based interventions in reducing pain and disability for disc herniation at short-term follow-up only; but high-quality evidence in this field is lacking (GRADE). For spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis, surgery is superior to physical activity up to greater than 2 years follow-up. Results should guide clinicians and patients when facing the difficult decision of having surgery or engaging in active care interventions. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42013005746.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114cxeYD]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Fig 5
Mean differences (95% CI) for disability in trials assessing the effectiveness of discectomy versus non-surgical treatment. Disability is expressed on a 0–100 scale. Studies are ordered by weight. SE = standard error; CI = confidence interval; IV = inverse variance

Five trials reported outcomes after 12 months. At 24 months, discectomy did not reduce leg pain (−1.1 (−3.6 to 1.4)) or disability (−1.5 (−4.3 to 1.3)) compared with non-surgical treatment. Similar findings were also observed at months 36, 48, 60, and 96 (fig 2, fig 3, fig 4, fig 5).

Secondary outcomes

Five trials reported findings for back pain. Compared with non-surgical treatment, evidence was of very low certainty that discectomy did not reduce back pain at the immediate term (medium difference −6.8 (95% confidence interval −15.3 to 1.6)) and long term (−7.0 (−15.4 to 1.5)), but did so at the short term (−11.0 (−19.6 to −2.5)) and medium term (−10.2 (−18.7 to −1.7); supplemental file 12).

Five trialsreported outcomes for quality of life and fourreported treatment satisfaction (not pooled due to heterogeneity). For quality of life, except for one trial at the short term follow-up, the included trials found no between group differences at all time points. Conflicting results were found for treatment satisfaction (supplemental file 8).

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111vr5QA]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of surgery in patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniations is not without dispute. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of surgery versus conservative therapy (including epidural injections) for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro up to October 2009. Randomised controlled trials of adults with lumbar radicular pain, which evaluated at least one clinically relevant outcome measure (pain, functional status, perceived recovery, lost days of work) were included. Two authors assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane criteria and extracted the data. In total, five studies were identified, two of which with a low risk of bias. One study compared early surgery with prolonged conservative care followed by surgery if needed; three studies compared surgery with usual conservative care, and one study compared surgery with epidural injections. Data were not pooled because of clinical heterogeneity and poor reporting of data. One large low-risk-of-bias trial demonstrated that early surgery in patients with 6–12 weeks of radicular pain leads to faster pain relief when compared with prolonged conservative treatment, but there were no differences after 1 and 2 years. Another large low-risk-of-bias trial between surgery and usual conservative care found no statistically significant differences on any of the primary outcome measures after 1 and 2 years. Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care.

### Surgery versus conservative care for persistent sciatica lasting 4 to 12 months [^111CPR4z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

The treatment of chronic sciatica caused by herniation of a lumbar disk has not been well studied in comparison with acute disk herniation. Data are needed on whether diskectomy or a conservative approach is better for sciatica that has persisted for several months.

Methods

In a single-center trial, we randomly assigned patients with sciatica that had lasted for 4 to 12 months and lumbar disk herniation at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 level in a 1:1 ratio to undergo microdiskectomy or to receive 6 months of standardized nonoperative care followed by surgery if needed. Surgery was performed by spine surgeons who used conventional microdiskectomy techniques. The primary outcome was the intensity of leg pain on a visual analogue scale (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) at 6 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Oswestry Disability Index, back and leg pain, and quality-of-life scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

Results

From 2010 through 2016, a total of 790 patients were screened; of those patients, 128 were enrolled, with 64 in each group. Among the patients assigned to undergo surgery, the median time from randomization to surgery was 3.1 weeks; of the 64 patients in the nonsurgical group, 22 (34%) crossed over to undergo surgery at a median of 11 months after enrollment. At baseline, the mean score for leg-pain intensity was 7.7 in the surgical group and 8.0 in the nonsurgical group. The primary outcome of the leg-pain intensity score at 6 months was 2.8 in the surgical group and 5.2 in the nonsurgical group (adjusted mean difference, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.4; P < 0.001). Secondary outcomes including the score on the Owestry Disability Index and pain at 12 months were in the same direction as the primary outcome. Nine patients had adverse events associated with surgery, and one patient underwent repeat surgery for recurrent disk herniation.

Conclusions

In this single-center trial involving patients with sciatica lasting more than 4 months and caused by lumbar disk herniation, microdiskectomy was superior to nonsurgical care with respect to pain intensity at 6 months of follow-up.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^112GDcim]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

There is considerable uncertainty about the clinical effectiveness of epidurals in sciatica compared with surgery for treatment of herniated lumbar disc. However, transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI), a newer and more precise treatment option, offered promise given that it can deliver the drug in a closer proximity to the site of pathology. We searched PubMed using the term "sciatica epidural steroid" immediately before the initial development of the NERVES protocol in 2013–14 and found that previous evidence supporting TFESI had come from cohort studies or single-centre studies, without clear specification of the non-surgical treatments provided. A meta-analysis from 2015 suggested that non-opioid analgesia, TFESI, and surgery were effective management options for sciatica secondary to uncomplicated herniated lumbar disc. However, the effectiveness of TFESI compared with surgery for herniated lumbar disc was uncertain, leading to wide variation in management guidelines for this common condition.

Added value of this study

NERVES is the first multicentre randomised trial directly comparing surgical microdiscectomy with TFESI on a 1:1 allocation basis as initial invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc. There was no significant difference between TFESI and surgery pathways in clinical outcome, and surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI. Complications of surgery were significant, offsetting any benefits of surgery as an early treatment, whereas only minor adverse events were seen with TFESI.

Implications of all the available evidence

NERVES provides high-quality evidence for a stepwise treatment framework of uncomplicated sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration of up to 12 months. TFESI would be less costly as an initial alternative to surgery for this condition, while achieving similar levels of improved outcomes.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^111dfzmK]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

International guidelines for sciatica recommend a stepped care approach starting with conservative management (ie, physiotherapy and medication), escalating to steroid injections, then surgery when non-surgical treatment has failed or when major radicular weakness is present. Unfortunately, evidence on the effectiveness of both non-surgicaland surgical options is uncertain.

In a linked paper, Liu and colleagues (doi:) report a methodologically sound and balanced systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 randomised clinical trials evaluating the evidence of surgical care for people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. Their meta-analysis suggests that discectomy is statistically significantly superior to non-surgical treatment in reducing leg pain and disability. However, effects were moderate at best (10–20 point reduction on a 100 point scale), but mostly small (5–10 point reduction). The benefits of discectomy were only evident in the short to medium term, with no clinically meaningful effects beyond 12 months.

### Are combined conservative interventions effective in reducing pain, disability and / or global rating of pain in people with sciatica with known neuropathic pain mechanisms? [^113bsyoP]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

National Clinical Guidelines recommend an integrated combination of conservative management strategies for sciatica. However, the efficacy of such combinations have not been established. The purpose of this systemic review with meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of combined conservative (non-pharmacological) compared to single interventions for people with sciatica with a confirmed neuropathic mechanism.

Methods

The systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42023464011. The databases included were the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PubMed, Scopus, APA PsycINFO, and grey literature sources from inception until January 2024. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of combined non-pharmacological interventions in comparison to a control intervention among individuals with sciatica of a neuropathic origin identified using diagnostic or clinical tests. Primary outcomes were back pain, leg pain, and disability. The secondary outcome was global rating of change. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment (using Cochrane ROB2) were assessed by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed with a random effects model with inverse variance weighting used for the metanalysis using SPSS v 29.

Results

3,370 articles were identified, of which 6 were included. Risk of bias was high in one study and had some concerns in the remaining 5 studies for each outcome measure. There was evidence of efficacy for combined interventions for back pain in the short-and long-term (SMD -0.56 (95% CI -0.91, -0.22, p = 0.01, I² = 0.2; SMD -0.44 (95% CI -0.79, -0.1, p = 0.03, I² = 0.00), and for disability in the short term (SMD -0.48 (95% CI -0.92, -0.04, p = 0.04, I² = 0.72). There was no evidence of efficacy for leg pain at any time point ((short term SMD -0.45 (95% CI -0.91, 0.02, p = 0.06, I² = 0.65), medium term (SMD -0.29 (95% CI -1.12, 0.54, p = 0.35, I² = 0.82), long term (SMD -0.40 (95% CI -1.23, 0.44, p = 0.18, I² = 0.57). Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate.

Conclusion

There are few studies that have combined conservative (non-pharmacological) interventions for the management of sciatica with a neuropathic component pain mechanism, as recommended by National Clinical Guidelines. This review indicates that combining conservative (no-pharmacological) management strategies appeared more effective than single interventions for the outcomes of low back pain in the short and long term, and for disability in the short term, but not for leg pain at any time point. The overall low certainty of evidence, suggests that future studies with more robust methodologies are needed.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111F2Kgh]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a common condition with a lifetime prevalence of up to 43%. In approximately 85–90% of cases, a herniated disc causes lumbar nerve root compression or inflammation. Although the prognosis for patients with acute sciatica is generally favourable, 20–30% of patients still experience pain after a year.

Guidelines recommend a stepwise model of treatment for sciatica starting with non-surgical treatment such as exercise, then progressing to pharmacological and interventional treatment if the pain is refractory. When non-surgical treatments have not been effective, surgery can then be considered if radiological findings are consistent with symptoms. Discectomy is the most common surgical treatment for sciatica due to disc herniation. Around 180 000 discectomies are done in the USA per year, and an increasing trend in its use has been reported in many high-income countries over the past 20 years. However, evidence supporting surgical treatment for sciatica is uncertain.

Recent systematic reviews on this topic have several shortcomings. They have collated data from heterogeneous populations (eg, people with lumbar disc herniation, stenosis, and spondylolisthesis), which have distinct clinical courses and require different surgical procedures. Others have excluded studies published in languages other than English, newly published trials, and trials that compared surgery to other commonly used interventional treatments, such as epidural injections. Another network meta-analysis combined data from different time points. A nuanced interpretation of the outcomes for pain and disability was not given. Hence, current evidence supporting surgery for sciatica is undetermined and warrants a comprehensive update. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness or efficacy and safety of surgical treatment, compared with non-surgical treatment, in people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^113dV893]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ACOEM Guidelines — scope and clinical questions for invasive treatments target management of low back disorders among working-age adults and span acute (up to 1 month duration), subacute (1 to 3 months' duration), and chronic (more than 3 months' duration) clinical timeframes; covered conditions include low back pain (LBP), sciatica/radiculopathy, spondylolisthesis, facet arthrosis, degeneration of the disc, failed back surgery syndrome, and spinal stenosis, while several broad categories including congenital disorders or malignancies and specific intraoperative procedures are not addressed. Guidance is organized by treatment phase (acute, subacute, chronic, postoperative) to answer multi-part questions including when, and for what conditions invasive procedures are recommended, when, and for what conditions surgery are recommended, which surgeries are recommended for which conditions, and what management options are recommended for delayed recovery.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^112jSf5S]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study give insight into the critical decision-making steps in the care pathway of sciatica. The two key elements are: (1) diagnosis of the problem and (2) deciding on the type of treatment. The position that patients and their physicians took differed, also within the groups of patients and physicians.

For patients, certainty about their diagnosis was most important. They preferred the evidence of MRI. This is congruent with earlier research, which showed that patients placed much emphasis on the need for a confirmed diagnosis, as a starting point for further treatment decisions. Patients' preference for imaging is well known, although not fully understood. A systematic review of qualitative studies about patients with low back pain and sciatica concluded that for patients, imaging gives more certainty and excludes other possible explanations. The patients we interviewed experienced the first weeks of GP-led conservative treatment as mandatory waiting time before they would receive a scan for confirmation.

Physicians seldom felt that they required imaging to confirm the diagnosis. This holds especially for neurologists and neurosurgeons. This is concurrent with research that showed that 89% of Dutch neurologists only order imaging under specific circumstances, such as after a long period of pain or with an abnormal neurological exam. For 27% of these neurologists, the patient requesting for an MRI is also sufficient reason to order imaging. For physicians, the presentation of sciatica is often so recognisable that confirmation by imaging is not required. Patients find this difficult to grasp.

Among physicians, the timing of intervention was the main subject of discussion. Physicians differed strongly in their opinions about the benefits of surgical or conservative treatment, especially with regard to the timing of surgery. In the Dutch context, the neurologist appears to be the most influential decision-maker here: he or she can accelerate or delay the decision to pursue surgical treatment, and decides about the timing of involvement of the neurosurgeon. Between approximately 6 weeks and 6 months after complaints have started, patients with persisting symptoms see a neurologist, who, with the patient, drives the decision about conservative treatment or surgical intervention. Without referral to a neurosurgeon, surgery is highly unlikely within the Dutch context. Of course, neurosurgeons can delay surgery further. Yet, they are unable to make it happen earlier.

### Prognostic factors associated with outcome following an epidural steroid injection for disc-related sciatica: a systematic review and narrative synthesis [^114uHHgM]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Clinical guidelines recommend epidural steroid injection (ESI) as a treatment option for severe disc-related sciatica, but there is considerable uncertainty about its effectiveness. Currently, we know very little about factors that might be associated with good or poor outcomes from ESI. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise and appraise the evidence investigating prognostic factors associated with outcomes following ESI for patients with imaging confirmed disc-related sciatica.

Methods

The search strategy involved the electronic databases Medline, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO and reference lists of eligible studies. Selected papers were quality appraised independently by two reviewers using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Between-study heterogeneity precluded statistical pooling of results.

Results

3094 citations were identified; 15 studies were eligible. Overall study quality was low with all judged to have moderate or high risk of bias. Forty-two prognostic factors were identified but were measured inconsistently. The most commonly assessed prognostic factors were related to pain and function (n = 10 studies), imaging features (n = 8 studies), patient socio-demographics (n = 7 studies), health and lifestyle (n = 6 studies), clinical assessment findings (n = 4 studies) and injection level (n = 4 studies). No prognostic factor was found to be consistently associated with outcomes following ESI. Most studies found no association or results that conflicted with other studies.

Conclusions

There is little, and low quality, evidence to guide practice in terms of factors that predict outcomes in patients following ESI for disc-related sciatica. The results can help inform some of the decisions about potential prognostic factors that should be assessed in future well-designed prospective cohort studies.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^117YC1dX]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica can be managed both conservatively and surgically. In the Netherlands, sciatica care is organised following the stepped care principle, involving a general practitioner (GP) as gatekeeper for hospital care, and a hospital-based neurologist, before a neurosurgeon is consulted. Therefore, a chain of decisions and referrals precede surgery. Both the diagnostic process and timing of surgical treatment and the (societal) value of surgery over conservative treatment are topics of ongoing discussion, and practice variation has been widely reported. This practice variation may be driven by both differences between and within patient and provider preferences. This makes the management of sciatica of interest. Which preferences of patients and physician(s) shape these decisions?

In the Netherlands, the GP is the point of entry for non-acute health complaints. For sciatica, the GP guideline advises conservative treatment for 6–8 weeks, combining a strategy of watchful waiting, informing the patient and providing painkillers. If the patients' complaints last longer, the GP can refer to a neurologist. Neurologists can confirm the diagnosis and might order imaging. However, the neurologists' guideline advises against imaging, unless surgery is considered or there is doubt about underlying cause or pathology. Recent research showed that only 11% of Dutch neurologists routinely order imaging. Apart from conservative options, the neurologist can also prescribe more invasive pain treatments, usually performed by a pain team. In case of persisting complaints, the patient might be referred to a neurosurgeon or orthopaedic surgeon to consider surgery. The Dutch neurosurgery guideline advices not to perform surgery on patients with less than 8 weeks of complaints, and proposes surgery after more than 6 months of complaints without any proper improvement. In the intermediary period natural recovery could occur. Therefore, a shared decision on treatment should be pursued with the patient. A multidisciplinary guideline exists, of which the implementation faces difficulties.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112AATZJ]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Safety

Eight trials reported at least one safety outcome for discectomy. Low certainty evidence showed no between group differences in the risk of any adverse events between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98); supplemental file 19a). Compared with epidural steroid injections, discectomy had a slightly higher risk of any adverse event (1.76 (1.03 to 3.02); supplemental file 19b). Surgery related complications were reported by seven trials. Dural tears and wound complications were the most frequently reported adverse events (supplemental file 9). All cause mortality was rare and similar between discectomy and non-surgical groups (1.73 (0.19 to 15.36); supplemental files 9). No trials reported any surgery related deaths.

The risks of adverse events in plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis were also similar between the surgical and non-surgical groups. The results could not be pooled because of the low number of studies (supplemental file 9).

Subgroup and meta-regression analyses

Detailed results for the subgroup and exploratory sensitivity analysis are presented in supplemental file 10. Discectomy had smaller effects on leg pain (mean difference −3.1 (95% confidence interval −5.7 to −0.4)) in trials that included analgesics in the comparators than did trials without analgesics (−21.4 (−30.3 to −12.4)) at the medium term. In small studies, discectomy had greater effects on disability (−10.1 (−13.9 to −6.3)) compared with larger studies (−4.4 (−7.7 to −1.0)). A post-hoc analysis indicated that in trials that did not specify unsuccessful non-surgical treatment as a prerequisite of entering the trial, discectomy had larger effects in reducing leg pain at immediate term (−19.3 (−30.4 to −8.2) v −1.2 (−5.5 to 3.1)) and improving disability at short term (−10.6 (−14.0 to −7.3) v −1.3 (−9.8 to 7.3)) than did trials that only included participants who had unsuccessful non-surgical treatment. Mean symptom duration at baseline (less or greater than three months), and the approach of discectomy (micro or open), did not influence treatment outcomes.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^114RJocf]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Study design

An in-depth interview study including patients, general practitioners, neurologists and neurosurgeons.

Objective

To gain insight in decision-making in sciatica care, by identifying patients' and physicians' preferences for treatment options, and the differences between and within both groups.

Summary of background data

Sciatica is a self-limiting condition, which can be treated both conservatively and surgically. The value of both options has been disputed, and the care pathway is known for a substantial amount of practice variation. Most Dutch patients are taken care of by general practitioners before they are referred to hospital-based neurologists, who might refer to a neurosurgeon, who can perform a surgical intervention. Dutch sciatica care thus follows the principles of stepped care, and a cascade of decisions precedes surgery. Better understanding of the decision-making within this cascade might reveal opportunities to improve shared decision-making and to reduce unwarranted practice variation.

Methods

Interviews with 10 patients and 22 physicians were analysed thematically.

Results

While physicians were confident of their clinical diagnosis, patients preferred confirmation trough imaging to exclude other possible explanations. Furthermore, many patients showed reluctance towards the use of (strong) opioids, while all physicians favoured this and underlined the benefits of opioids in the management of sciatica complaints, to buy time and to allow patients to recover naturally. Finally, individual physicians differed strongly in their opinion on benefits and optimal timing of surgical treatment and epidural injections.

Conclusions

Dutch sciatica care is characterised by a cascade of decisions preceding surgery. Preferences differ within and between patients and physicians, which adds to the practice variation. To improve decision-making, physicians and patients should invest not necessarily more in the exchange of options or preferences, but in making sure the other understands the rationale behind them.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica: an abridged cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AUGZQ]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic with meta-analysis OBJECTIVES.: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo injection in reducing leg pain and disability in patients with sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Conservative treatments, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, are typically the first treatment options for sciatica but the evidence to support their use is limited. The overall quality of evidence found by previous systematic reviews varies between moderate and high, which suggests that future trials may change the conclusions. New placebo-controlled randomized trials have been published recently which highlights the importance of an updated systematic review.

Methods

The searches were performed without language restrictions in the following databases from 2012 to 25 September 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and trial registers. We included placebo-controlled randomized trials investigating epidural corticosteroid injections in patients with sciatica. The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity and disability. The secondary outcomes were adverse events, overall pain, and back pain intensity. We grouped similar trials according to outcome measures and their respective follow-up time points. Short-term follow-up (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months) was considered the primary follow-up time point due to the expected mechanism of action of epidural corticosteroid injection. Weighted mean differences (MDs) and risk ratios (RRs) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. We assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach and conducted the analyses using random effects.

Results

We included 25 clinical trials (from 29 publications) providing data for a total of 2470 participants with sciatica, an increase of six trials when compared to the previous review. Epidural corticosteroid injections were probably more effective than placebo in reducing short-term leg pain (MD -4.93, 95% CI -8.77 to -1.09 on a 0–100 scale), short-term disability (MD -4.18, 95% CI: -6.04 to -2.17 on a 0–100 scale) and may be slightly more effective in reducing short-term overall pain (MD -9.35, 95% CI -14.05 to -4.65 on a 0–100 scale). There were mostly minor adverse events (i.e., without hospitalization) after epidural corticosteroid injections and placebo injections without difference between groups (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 0.91–1.42). The quality of evidence was at best moderate mostly due to problems with trial design and inconsistency.

Conclusion

A review of 25 placebo-controlled trials provides moderate-quality evidence that epidural corticosteroid injections are effective, although the effects are small and short-term. There is uncertainty on safety due to very low-quality evidence.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111ALGid]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this review we identified five studies comparing surgery with conservative care. Only one low-risk-of-bias study compared early surgery to prolonged conservative care and demonstrated more relief of leg pain up to 3 months for early surgery, but at 1 year the differences disappeared. The trials of surgery versus usual conservative treatment showed inconsistent findings. One low-risk-of-bias study compared surgery versus conservative treatment and found no differences between the two treatments. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis of these three studies because of the poor data presented in two of the studies. An observational cohort study conducted alongside one trial included 743 patients that received their preferred treatment. Both groups improved substantially over time, but surgery showed significantly better results for pain and function as compared with conservative treatment.

Three of the five studies found an effect in the early postoperative period, which diminished during further follow-up. This is relevant because a faster recovery rate could, besides the clinical benefit, have an economic advantage in a relatively young patient population. A cost-effectiveness study performed alongside the trial of Peul et al. showed that surgery is cost-effective with a willingness to pay 40,000 € as per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). In relation to this, timing of treatment is under debate, but for a reliable analysis of the effect of different timing, information about duration of symptoms is needed. The duration between onset of symptoms and actual treatment is described in four of the five trials. Equally important is the timing of the treatment after diagnosis by protocol or waiting list. This is only reported in two of the trials being 2 weeks. Heterogeneity in the duration of the symptoms or in the timing of treatments introduces a difference in timing of treatment since the onset of complaints and thus bias in the analysis of recovery rate.

### Advice to stay active as a single treatment for low back pain and sciatica [^111neChg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is one of the most common conditions managed in primary care. Restricted activity, rest, and symptomatic analgesics are the most commonly prescribed treatment for low back pain and sciatica.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as single treatment for patients with low back pain.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Musculoskeletal Group's Trials Register and Scisearch, and scanning of reference lists from relevant articles were undertaken. Relevant studies were also traced by contacting authors. Date of the most recent searches: December 1998.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised trials or quasi-randomised trials where the study population consisted of adult patients with low back pain or sciatica, in which one comparison group was advised to stay active. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to collect missing data or for clarification when needed.

Main Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. Advice to stay active was compared to advice to rest in bed in all trials. Two trials were assessed to have low risk of bias and two to have moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. Results from one high quality trial of patients with acute simple LBP found small differences in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference (on a 0–100 scale) 6.0 (95% CI: 1.5, 10.5)] and length of sick leave [WMD 3.4 days (95% CI: 1.6, 5.2)] in favour of staying active compared to advice to stay in bed for two days. The other high quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed for 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high quality trials also compared advice to stay active with exercises for patients with acute simple LBP, and found improvement in functional status and reduction in sick leave in favour of advice to stay active.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has small beneficial effects for patients with acute simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. If there is no major difference between advice to stay active and advice to rest in bed, and there is potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, then it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

### The cochrane review of advice to stay active as a single treatment for low back pain and sciatica [^111G3YM5]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review was conducted within the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as a single treatment for patients with acute low back pain or sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Low back pain is a common reason for consulting a health care provider, and advice on daily activities constitutes an important part in the primary care management of low back pain.

Methods

All randomized studies available in systematic searches (electronic databases, contact with authors, reference lists) were included. Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of the included trials, and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.

Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. In all the trials, advice to stay active was compared with advice for bed rest. Two trials were assessed as having a low risk of bias, and two as having a moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. The results from one high-quality trial of patients with acute, simple low back pain found small differences in functional status (weighted mean difference on a 0 to 100 scale, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.5–10.5) and length of sick leave (weighted mean difference, 3.4 days; 95% CI, 1.6–5.2) in favor of staying active, as compared with advice to stay in bed 2 days. The other high-quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high-quality trials also compared advice to stay active with advice to engage in exercises for patients with acute, simple low back pain, and found improvement in functional status and reduced sick leave in favor of advice to stay active.

Conclusion

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has little beneficial effect for patients with acute, simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. Because there is no considerable difference between advice to stay active and advice for bed rest, and there are potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VyQ8n]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although the knowledge of evidence about surgery has changed in the past decade, we still do not know much about a simpler conservative treatment such as pharmacological interventions for sciatica. A recent clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Societyrecommends that surgery should be considered as a treatment option for persistent and disabling radicular pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc. This recommendation relies on moderate short term benefits from large randomised clinical trials such as those by Peul et aland Weinstein et al, with 283 and 501 patients randomised, respectively. At present, there is a limited number of mainly small trials of pharmacological interventions with typically short term follow-up. For example, the evidence to support the use of anticonvulsants in chronic sciatica arises from a single trial with only 50 participants.

Our principal finding is that there is insufficient evidence to confidently guide the use of any analgesic or adjuvant pain medicine for the effective management of pain and disability in patients with sciatica. Until this changes, we would advise clinicians treating such patients who exhibit clinical features of neuropathic pain to consider evidence based guidelines for neuropathic painand for other patients with sciatica to consider therapeutic recommendations from current guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain.

### Novel approach to characterising individuals with low back-related leg pain: cluster identification with latent class analysis and 12-month follow-up [^116jWeNF]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

This work gives detailed insight into the complexity of LBLP and shows that information on initial presentation can help classify patients into distinct clusters.

Even within a specific condition/presentation such as sciatica, variation is overlooked if only 'average' population measures are considered. Heterogeneous study populations in clinical research can potentially confound outcomes and recent clinical practice guidelines for LBP treatments conclude there is insufficient evidence to better match treatment for presentations of leg pain/sciatica. The clusters identified in this work may represent groups likely to need a different management approach.

Currently management of sciatica is a stepped care approach in those not deteriorating or with signs suggestive of sinister pathology, starting with non-invasive treatments and progressing to more invasive treatment options. Timing and when to move to the next step is not clear, particularly in those with higher pain levels and it still remains unknown which patient will benefit from what intervention at which point (e.g. conservative management/surgery /injection). Two of the clusters represent patients that could preferentially respond to this stepped approach (cluster 2 and 3). Cluster 4 patients may benefit from a more intensive initial approach earlier in their management e.g. specialist opinion regarding more invasive options (surgery/ injections). Patients in cluster 1 and cluster 5 may be more suitable for pain management options that include psychosocial interventions.

Levels of depression and anxiety were highest in the clusters with most severe symptoms, which is unsurprising and levels remained highest in cluster 5 at 12 months. Mechanisms driving the high pain and anxiety are potentially different between the two groups and management should reflect this. The atypical sciatica cluster resembles profiles of patients with persistent/ widespread pain, whereas cluster 4 have a clear diagnosis and in the clinical setting are more likely to be considered for treatment options such as injections and/or surgery.

These clusters could be more homogenous groups that represent uniquely different responders to specific interventions. The next step is to consider optimum management pathways for these clusters and formally test whether different management options improve outcomes.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^11242oAe]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Studies that evaluated plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis were also included, but the small number did not permit firm recommendations. Commendably, the authors carefully rated the certainty of evidence, which was low or very low. The true effect could, therefore, be markedly different from the reported estimates, allowing only weak clinical recommendations. This certainty of evidence is disappointing considering that 11 of the 12 trials evaluating discectomy were reported after the CONSORT reporting guidelines were published. The authors concluded that "discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery".

So, does that mean that people with sciatica should be offered surgery because they will experience more rapid improvements in pain and disability compared with non-surgical interventions? As always, context is key when interpreting study findings. In this systematic review, although not specifically mentioned by the research authors, most of the trials that examined the effect of discectomy recruited patients from secondary care. According to the stepped care approach recommended by international guidelines, secondary care referral should only be initiated for people who have not responded to conservative care or have severe radicular weakness. Furthermore, to be considered for surgery, patients require a surgical indication such as a structural target on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Accordingly, this systematic review included only trials of people with discogenic sciatica diagnosed by MRI. However, only 30% of patients in secondary care have an MRI finding that matches the spinal level predicted by clinical examination and thus represents a clear surgical indication. The results of this systematic review therefore relate to a much smaller and more defined group than the heterogeneous population with sciatica encountered in community healthcare settings.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1121zk4g]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for sciatica.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to June 2022.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment, epidural steroid injections, or placebo or sham surgery, in people with sciatica of any duration due to lumbar disc herniation (diagnosed by radiological imaging).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference -12.1 (95% confidence interval -23.6 to -0.5)) and short term (-11.7 (-18.6 to -4.7)), and small at medium term (-6.5 (-11.0 to -2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (-2.3 (-4.5 to -0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections. For disability, a moderate effect was found at short term, but no effect was observed at medium and long term. The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^117MfqCu]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Results of this prospective, randomized, controlled, pilot study suggests that acupuncture is safe and effective for relieving symptoms and disability in patients with non-acute/chronic sciatica. MAL is as effective as MAH in treating chronic sciatica. MAH treatment seems superior to MAL treatment for sciatica patients with a higher stage of chronicity. However, more extensive case-control studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm with better certainty a dose–response relationship and the impact on chronicity.

### Lumbosacral radiculopathies: conservative approaches to management [^117BhHy9]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of sciatica in Western society and its economic and functional impact make it an important problem to understand for treatment. Such understanding will impact greatly both medical management and decisions regarding activity, which could affect the perceived disability and financial dependence of a patient. This knowledge could be used to direct primary prevention, patient education, and future research efforts in back pain. The article also discusses that such strategies could improve health, decrease disability, and rein in costs.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^111fahzD]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Study Design

An in-depth interview study including patients, general practitioners, neurologists and neurosurgeons.

Objective

To gain insight in decision-making in sciatica care, by identifying patients' and physicians' preferences for treatment options, and the differences between and within both groups.

Summary Of Background Data

Sciatica is a self-limiting condition, which can be treated both conservatively and surgically. The value of both options has been disputed, and the care pathway is known for a substantial amount of practice variation. Most Dutch patients are taken care of by general practitioners before they are referred to hospital-based neurologists, who might refer to a neurosurgeon, who can perform a surgical intervention. Dutch sciatica care thus follows the principles of stepped care, and a cascade of decisions precedes surgery. Better understanding of the decision-making within this cascade might reveal opportunities to improve shared decision-making and to reduce unwarranted practice variation.

Methods

Interviews with 10 patients and 22 physicians were analysed thematically.

Results

While physicians were confident of their clinical diagnosis, patients preferred confirmation trough imaging to exclude other possible explanations. Furthermore, many patients showed reluctance towards the use of (strong) opioids, while all physicians favoured this and underlined the benefits of opioids in the management of sciatica complaints, to buy time and to allow patients to recover naturally. Finally, individual physicians differed strongly in their opinion on benefits and optimal timing of surgical treatment and epidural injections.

Conclusions

Dutch sciatica care is characterised by a cascade of decisions preceding surgery. Preferences differ within and between patients and physicians, which adds to the practice variation. To improve decision-making, physicians and patients should invest not necessarily more in the exchange of options or preferences, but in making sure the other understands the rationale behind them.

### Lumbar disc herniations: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^113R4Ftw]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Lumbar disc herniation is among the most common causes of lower-back pain and sciatica. The cause(s) of lumbar disc herniation and the relation of lumbar disc herniation to back pain and sciatica have not been fully elucidated, but most likely comprise a complex combination of mechanical and biologic processes. Furthermore, the natural history of lumbar disc herniation seems generally to be favorable, leaving the optimum treatment for lumbar disc herniation a debate in the literature. Various nonoperative and operative treatment strategies have been tried with varying degrees of success. Treatment often involves patient education, physical therapy, alternative medicine options, and pharmaco-therapy. If these fail, surgical intervention is usually recommended. A literature search was conducted to evaluate the currently known effectiveness of traditional and novel non-operative and surgical techniques for the treatment lumbar disc herniation and to determine if there are substantive new advantages in these newer contemporary treatments or combinations thereof. A structured approach to treatment of a patient who may have a symptomatic lumbar disc herniation is presented, based on analysis of the current literature. No one method of nonoperative or operative treatment would seem definitively to be superior to another. Appropriate multidisciplinary treatment including behavioral analysis and support may offer the hope of improved outcomes for patients with lumbar disc herniation.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^113XqeKP]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Resuming, Dutch sciatica care is characterised by involvement of multiple stakeholders, uncertainty in the aetiology of the disease and uncertainty about the value of diverse treatment options in each step of the care pathway. As a result, practice variation in sciatica care persists, despite efforts to harmonise care processes. Shared decision-making (SDM) is warranted in this situation, because given the uncertainties, patients preferences are extra important to take into account. However, research on the actual preferences that guide the different stakeholders in their decision-making process is not available. This qualitative study aims to: (1) identify key moments in this care pathway and (2) map the drivers and arguments in the decisions among the involved stakeholders.

### Outcome of invasive treatment modalities on back pain and sciatica: an evidence-based review [^114HNsk8]. European Spine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Within the framework of evidence-based medicine high-quality randomised trials and systematic reviews are considered a necessary prerequisite for progress in orthopaedics. This paper summarises the currently available evidence on surgical and other invasive procedures for low back pain. Results of systematic reviews conducted within the framework of the Cochrane Back Review Group were used. Data were gathered from the latest Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 2. The Cochrane reviews were updated using the evidence summary on surgery and other invasive procedures from the COST B13 European Guidelines for the Management of Acute and Chronic Non-Specific Low Back Pain. Facet joint, epidural, trigger point and sclerosant injections have not clearly been shown to be effective and can consequently not be recommended. There is no scientific evidence on the effectiveness of spinal stenosis surgery. Surgical discectomy may be considered for selected patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc prolapses that fail to resolve with the conservative management. Cognitive intervention Combined with exercises is recommended for chronic low back pain, and fusion surgery may be considered only in carefully selected patients after active rehabilitation programmes during 2 years time have failed. Demanding surgical fusion techniques are not better than the traditional posterolateral fusion without internal fixation.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114fgkNq]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Risk of bias and certainty of evidence

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias) of included trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We assessed funding and conflict of interest statements as part of assessing other bias (eg, industry funded trials without declaration of investigator autonomy was judged to be at high risk; supplemental file 11). We rated the certainty of evidence for each of the outcomes by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework. For each GRADE domain, the quality of evidence was downgraded by one level if a serious flaw was present, that is: risk of bias (> 25% of participants in this comparison were from studies at high risk of bias (supplemental file 3), inconsistency (substantial unexplained interstudy heterogeneity, I² > 50), imprecision (95% confidence interval were 20 points different to the point estimates), and, and small study effects (> 25% of participants were from small studies (< 100 participants per arm)). Certainty of evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. Any discrepancies between the evaluation of risk of bias and certainty of evidence were resolved through consensus, or, when required, by arbitration with a third reviewer.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^115EuZHV]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Management of sciatica varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints remain present for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients for sciatica in presence of a herniated lumbar disc, or severe sciatica with serious or progressive neurologic deficits and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. The primary rationale of surgery for sciatica is that surgery will relieve nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated disc material. The most common type of surgery is open microdiscectomy, surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with or without the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Other minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as endoscopic surgery have recently been developed. In the absence of serious neurologic deficits or for persistent non-radicular low back pain, consensus whether surgery is useful or not has not yet been established. Furthermore, the timing of the intervention with respect to prolonged conservative care has not been evaluated properly.

At present, several randomised trials have been published that have compared surgery with conservative treatment. The objective of this systematic review is to compare and summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgery compared with conservative treatment for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wPE3n]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Apart from the possibility that physiotherapy is indeed not effective for patients with sciatica, there are multiple possible reasons for the lack of evidence. The physiotherapy interventions used in the 11 trials comparing physiotherapy with substantial interventions are not all considered contemporary in line with current clinical guidelines. This is a reflection of a lack of recent physiotherapy trials, with only four of the 11 studies published in the last decade. Current clinical guidelines recommend group exercise and continuation of normal activities; however, bedrest was a component of the conservative treatment arm in two trials. The UK NICE Guidelines find no evidence supporting the use of corsets or belts, but these were a core component in another trial conducted before publication of these guidelines. The physiotherapy interventions are highly heterogeneous and remain unclear in several studies. The Bailey study leaves physiotherapy interventions at the discretion of the treating clinician, and the Peul study refers people to physiotherapy only if they are fearful of movement, leaving uncertainty about how many participants in those trials had active physiotherapy treatment. It could also be argued that patients deemed suitable for surgery are likely to represent a specific subgroup that may be less amenable to physiotherapeutic interventions (e.g. with intractable pain or neurological deficit). Indeed, two trials comparing physiotherapy interventions with surgery included patients who had already failed conservative treatment, raising serious concerns that physiotherapy interventions could possibly succeed in such a population.

A further challenge to progress in treatment is the diagnosis of sciatica itself. There is no agreed definition for sciatica, reflected in the wide range of definitions used in clinical trials, including our review. The broad term 'sciatica' comprises radiculopathy, radicular pain, or somatic referred pain. The differing patient populations bring clinical heterogeneity to most meta-analyses. Unfortunately, the high heterogeneity among studies reduces the confidence in our results. Together with previous systematic reviews with inconclusive findings, our results question the value of continuing to perform clinical trials in heterogeneous groups of patients. Although subgrouping according to risk stratification showed promise in the management of people with non-specific low back pain, this has failed in patients with sciatica. Subgrouping using a mechanism-based approach shows promising signals in patients with neuropathic pain of different aetiologies, but has yet to be examined in sciatica.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111RNn9Z]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We prospectively registered this review on PROSPERO (CRD42021269997) and have followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines.

Data sources and searches

We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from their database inception to June 2022 (supplemental file 1). We also tracked citations on relevant systematic reviews and included studies. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, then full text articles. Disagreements were resolved by consensus (supplemental file 2).

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in adults with sciatica of any duration due to a herniated disc (diagnosed through radiological examination). Eligible interventions were any surgical treatment using any approach, including open, micro, or endoscopic discectomy; percutaneous (plasma) disc decompression; and chemonucleolysis. Comparators were any non-surgical treatment, including non-pharmacological, pharmacological, interventional treatments (eg, epidural injection), or combinations of these. We deemed studies using placebo or sham surgeries as comparators as also eligible. Trials that reported data for pain, disability, or other outcomes of interest (see outcomes section for full details) were included. We did not restrict by language, geography, or publication date.

We excluded studies with mixed populations (eg, lumbar disc herniation and lumbar stenosis) if separate data for lumbar disc herniation could not be obtained. We also excluded studies that enrolled participants with lumbar disc herniation combined with spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis or with any serious spinal pathologies (eg, infection, tumour, fractures, major trauma, systemic inflammatory diseases, or pregnancy related sciatica).

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jfPh3]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

There is at best only low quality evidence to judge the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care. The available evidence does not clearly show favourable effects of NSAIDs, corticosteroids, antidepressants, or opioid analgesics in the immediate term, even compared with placebo. Evidence from a single trial and one meta-analysis with two trials provides some limited support ("low quality" and "moderate quality" evidence) for the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids to relieve pain in the short term in patients with acute sciatica. In one small sample trial there was also limited support ("low quality" evidence) for the short term relief of pain in chronic sciatica with an anticonvulsant drug. At present these data provide a lack of conclusive and high quality evidence to guide the prescription of these drugs for patients with sciatica in primary care.

### Patients' own accounts of sciatica: a qualitative study [^111kAwCN]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

STUDY DESIGN.: Longitudinal qualitative interview study, nested within a back pain cohort study. OBJECTIVE.: Enhance the understanding of patients' own perspectives on living with sciatica to inform improvements in care and treatment outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Reports of patients' own accounts of sciatica and its impact on daily life are still scarce. Research on back pain has shown that it is important to understand how people live with pain and how they perceive interactions with health care professionals and interpret interventions. These types of insights help to improve treatments and their acceptability to patients. METHODS.: In-depth qualitative interviews with 37 people at baseline and 6 and 12 months' follow-up. The interviews covered topics that were derived from the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire and allowed open-ended talk about people's experiences of pain. All interviews were tape-recorded, fully transcribed, and thematically analyzed. RESULTS.: People needed to make sense of sciatica through identifying a cause and having it clinically diagnosed. The impact of sciatic pain was seen to be constant, intense, and all-encompassing. Appreciation of this by clinicians was considered important, as well as the provision of clear information about treatment and prognosis. Expectations about treatment options varied between patients, and people balanced pain relief with adverse effects. CONCLUSION.: Our study highlights patients' own accounts of the distinctiveness, impact, and intrusiveness of their sciatic symptoms. Our findings emphasize the importance of leg pain in identifying a subgroup of back-pain patients more likely to have severe symptoms, be at risk of poor outcome, and who should be considered a priority for early diagnosis and management. Future management of sciatica needs to include listening to patients' stories, offering a credible physical assessment, explanation, and diagnosis of the condition. Explaining the limits to treatment is seen as positively contributing to the partnership between patients and clinicians.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^115dJ6rf]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Results

Four steps in the care process proved relevant for the clinical pathway of patients. These were uncertainty about the diagnosis, analgesia, epidural injections and surgery. Patients and physicians differed in opinion on the subjects of a certain diagnosis and analgesia. They had relatively similar opinions with respect to the different treatment options. Different options existed on the topic of surgical treatment, within both the group of patients as well as the group of physicians. A summary of the positions of patients and physicians on the four steps is presented in table 3.

A summary of the perspectives of patients and physicians on the four main topics

Certainty and diagnosis

After the onset of sciatica, two prominent decisions or conflicts appear, concerning (1) diagnosing sciatica and the need for MRI-imaging to confirm the diagnosis and (2) the appropriate timing for referral to the hospital. Physicians felt confident about diagnosing sciatica, although the GPs mentioned that they sometimes doubted their diagnosis. They would discuss such doubts with their patients and generally would wait to see how symptoms developed. GPs acknowledged that their first objective in patients with subjected sciatica is to help the patient through the first period of pain and restricted mobility, rather than to determine the 'true' diagnosis rapidly. When patients did not improve, or pushed for referral, GPs would refer to a neurologist earlier than the 6–8 weeks suggested in the guideline. However, because of waiting lists, these patients often waited a few weeks before a specialist was available, and the total duration of complaints generally exceeded 6 weeks.

Patients understood the 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment by the GP as mandatory 'waiting time', after which their diagnosis would be confirmed by a specialist and with an MRI scan. When a neurologist deemed the scan to be unnecessary, patients were disappointed. Physicians were conscious of such patient expectations. Some kept refusing, others gave in:

Sometimes you notice within a minute that whatever you say, it won't matter.… And in such cases you can say 'according to the guideline you are not entitled to a scan'. But I am not treating the guideline, I am treating the patient. In my experience, if you do not refer such a patient for a scan, if you do not manage to get the patient to understand, and you kind of quarrel with the patient, next month you will receive information from another hospital and they'll have made the scan.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^114Ask8U]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is usually unilateral radiation pain along the direction of the sciatic nerve, accounting for 13% to 40% in different studies and reviews. Lumbosacral nerve root (L4-S1) inflammation or compression is the main cause. Neuroradiology studies have confirmed that 85% of sciatica is related to disc disease. Most patients report low back pain at the same time as pain. The severity of pain varies from patient to patient along with a sudden or chronic onset mostly. It can extend from below the knee to the toes of the feet. In severe cases, symptoms such as low back pain, decreased muscle strength, and abnormal reflexes may occur, which would cause severe discomfort with limited quality of life and function.

The current focus of treatment is to prevent the disease from becoming chronic through conventional drug treatment and early conservative treatment. However, conventional drugs have a variety of potential adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects. Recently updated clinical guidelines emphasize the role of conservative treatment of sciatica from Denmark, and the US. Surgery which can early relieve pain maybe is an option if the symptoms do not improve after 6–8 weeks of early intervention, but its effect is similar to that of conservative treatment within one year.

Acupuncture is a non-pharmacological therapy used in pain control. At present, acupuncture is widely used in the treatment of sciatica, but the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that acupuncture should not be provided as a non-invasive treatment for patients with sciatica, which is based on the following: i) Relative values of different outcomes; ii) Trade-off between clinical benefits and harms; iii) Trade-off between net clinical effects and costs; iv) Quality of evidence; and v) Other considerations. In terms of the standardized use of acupuncture, there is no internationally recognized evidence and guidance recommendations except for the "Evidence-Based Acupuncture Clinical Practice Guide: Sciatica" from China. However, with the continuous emergence of new research evidence (ie, changes in available interventions, clinical efficacy, or cost), it is necessary to conduct expert consensus based on existing evidence and update appropriately to maintain the trustworthiness of clinical guidelines.

These uncertainties of acupuncture treatment recommendations for sciatica prompted this study to establish an expert consensus based on the clinical investigation and literature review by using the improved Delphi method, which is conducive to unifying the acupuncture principles and putting forward a standard therapeutic protocol for the treatment of sciatica which could be used in future trials and clinical practice.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^115dZYyK]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The term sciatica describes symptoms of pain radiating from the low back to the legs, and it can be associated with sensory and motor deficits. Occasionally, patients only have leg pain with no associated back pain. A prolapsed disc causing compression of lumbar spinal nerve roots is the most common cause of sciatica. Sciatica has a substantial impact on patients and constitutes a considerable health-care, social, and economic burden.

As in many countries, most patients with sciatica in the UK are managed in primary care. For most patients, especially those with a short symptom duration, usual care comprises mostly a stepped-care approach, starting with conservative interventions such as advice, medications, and physiotherapy, with those patients who show no improvement eventually being offered imaging, specialist assessment, and consideration of suitability for invasive treatments (eg, injections or surgery). A longer symptom duration of sciatica is related to worse outcomes following both conservative and surgical treatment. In the absence of a systematic way to identify patients who might need more support in their care, including a referral to specialists for consideration of more invasive treatments, there is considerable variation in practice. The current, mainly stepped care, approach means that most patients have to show no improvement with previous interventions before being considered for further treatments, resulting in delays in referral to spinal specialists.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed up to Dec 31, 2013, with the search terms "stratified care", "sciatica", and "radiculopathy". The search was restricted to English language publications. We found no previous trials of stratified care for patients with sciatica before undertaking our study. Therefore, no systematic review was possible. The evidence considered came from previous research on prognostic stratified care for patients with non-specific lower back pain (STarT Back and IMPaCT Back studies) and a cohort of patients with sciatica (ATLAS study) in the primary care setting, from which we examined the factors predicting referral of patients to specialist spinal services. These previous studies shaped the development of the stratification algorithm (previously published) that was tested in this trial.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128dqir]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines and systematic reviews provide inconsistent recommendations on epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica. Key limitations of existing reviews are the inclusion of trials with active controls of unknown efficacy and failure to provide an estimate of the size of the treatment effect.

Purpose

To determine the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica compared with placebo.

Data Sources

International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections in participants with sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Leg pain, back pain, and disability were converted to common scales from 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability). Thresholds for clinically important change in the range of 10 to 30 have been proposed for these outcomes. Effects were calculated for short-term (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) follow-up.

Data Synthesis

Data were pooled with a random-effects model, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used in summary conclusions. Twenty-five published reports (23 trials) were included. The pooled results showed a significant, although small, effect of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo for leg pain in the short term (mean difference, -6.2 [95% CI, -9.4 to -3.0]) and also for disability in the short term (mean difference, -3.1 [CI, -5.0 to -1.2]). The long-term pooled effects were smaller and not statistically significant. The overall quality of evidence according to the GRADE classification was rated as high.

Limitation

The review included only English-language trials and could not incorporate dichotomous outcome measures into the analysis.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests that epidural corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica. The small size of the treatment effects, however, raises questions about the clinical utility of this procedure in the target population.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Tq2jn]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

If data were available for the same outcome measure from at least two trials, meta-analysis was performed using Revman v5.4. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Random effects models with inverse variance weighting were used to account for the variability of included studies. Heterogeneity was calculated with I² statistics and interpreted as follows: 'might not be important' (0–40%), 'moderate' (30–60%), 'substantial '(50–90%), and 'considerable' (75–100%). We performed separate overall meta-analyses comparing physiotherapy interventions with control interventions for our primary outcomes of pain and disability.

We planned to perform a subgroup analysis according to type of physiotherapy interventions. However, this was impossible as interventions were too heterogeneous to pool. We performed a post hoc subgroup analysis comparing the effect of physiotherapy interventions according to the type of control intervention (minimal vs. substantial). Minimal intervention included advice/education only, GP care, or sham treatment. Substantial intervention included surgery, disc and epidural injections. Due to high risk of bias, we performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis, removing those studies where at least two parameters of risk of bias were rated as high. Results that could not be included in the meta-analysis were narratively described.

### A comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of the treatments for sciatica: a network meta-analysis [^113QLRHj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There remains a lack of a systematic summary of the efficacy and safety of various medicines for sciatica, and discrepancies among these exist.

Objective

The aim of this study is to comprehensively assess the efficacy of and tolerance to several medical options for the treatment of sciatica.

Methods

We performed a network meta-analysis and illustrated the results by the mean difference or odds ratio. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used for indicating the preferable treatments. All data analyses and graphs were achieved via R 3.3.2 and Stata 13.0.

Results

The subcutaneous anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to the epidural steroid + anesthetic in reducing lumbar pain in both acute + chronic sciatica patients and acute sciatica patients. The epidural steroid demonstrated a better ability regarding the Oswestry disability score (ODI) compared to the subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. In addition, for total pain relief, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was inferior to the epidural steroid + anesthetic. The epidural anesthetic and epidural steroid + anesthetic both demonstrated superiority over the epidural steroid and intramuscular steroid. The intravenous anti-TNF-α ranked first in leg pain relief, while the subcutaneous anti-TNF-α ranked first in lumbar pain relief, and the epidural steroid ranked first in the ODI on the basis of SUCRA. In addition, their safety outcome (withdrawal) rankings were all medium to high.

Conclusions

Intravenous and subcutaneous anti-TNF-α were identified as the optimal treatments for both acute + chronic sciatica patients and acute sciatica patients. In addition, the epidural steroid was also recommended as a good intervention due to its superiority in reducing ODI.

### Traction for low-back pain with or without sciatica [^114SVTZ4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Traction is used to treat low-back pain (LBP), often with other treatments.

Objectives

To determine traction's effectiveness, compared to reference treatments, placebo, sham traction or no treatment for LBP.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to October 2006, references in relevant reviews and personal files.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving traction to treat acute (less than four weeks duration), sub-acute (four to 12 weeks) or chronic (more than 12 weeks) non-specific LBP with or without sciatica.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, methodological quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two authors. As there were insufficient data for statistical pooling, we performed a qualitative analysis.

Main Results

We included 25 RCTs (2206 patients; 1045 receiving traction). Five trials were considered high quality. For patients with mixed symptom patterns (acute, sub-acute and chronic LBP with and without sciatica) there is: strong evidence of no statistically significant difference in outcomes between traction as a single treatment and placebo, sham or no treatment; moderate evidence that traction as a single treatment is no more effective than other treatments; limited evidence of no significant difference in outcomes between a standard physical therapy program with or without continuous traction. For LBP patients with sciatica (with acute, sub-acute or chronic pain), there is conflicting evidence in several comparisons: autotraction compared to placebo, sham or no treatment; other forms of traction compared to other treatments; different forms of traction. In other comparisons, there were no statistically significant differences; the evidence is moderate for continuous or intermittent traction compared to placebo, sham or no treatment, and limited for light versus normal force traction.

Implications For Practice

The results of the available studies involving mixed groups of acute, sub-acute and chronic patients with LBP with and without sciatica were quite consistent, indicating that continuous or intermittent traction as a single treatment for LBP is not likely effective for this group. Traction for patients with sciatica cannot be judged effective at present either, due to inconsistent results and methodological problems in most studies. We conclude that traction as a single treatment for LBP is probably not effective.

Implications For Research

Any future research on traction for patients with LBP should distinguish between symptom pattern and duration, and should be carried out according to the highest methodological standards.

### Efficacy and safety of acupuncture and acupuncture-combined therapies in the treatment of sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation: a network meta-analysis [^117FJgPV]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of sciatica, concluding that acupuncture is both effective and safe. However, acupuncture encompasses various techniques, such as fire acupuncture (FA), warm acupuncture (WA), needle knife (NK), and electrostimulation (ES), each of which has demonstrated efficacy to some extent. The foregoing meta-analysis focused solely on pairwise comparisons between two interventions at a time and did not account for the complexity and diversity of available therapeutic strategies. Therefore, the optimal approach for managing sciatica secondary to LDH in clinical practice remains unclear.

Network meta-analysis (NMA), by integrating both direct and indirect evidence across multiple interventions, allows for comprehensive comparative evaluations. This method facilitates a nuanced understanding of the relative efficacy and safety of diverse therapeutic options and aids in identifying the most favorable treatment strategies. To date, no systematic evaluation has been conducted to compare the effectiveness and safety of different acupuncture modalities for sciatica caused by LDH. Therefore, this study employed an NMA to assess the comparative efficacy of various acupuncture monotherapies, acupuncture versus conventional rehabilitation therapies, and acupuncture monotherapy versus combination treatments for LDH-induced sciatica. The aim is to provide robust, evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making and optimize acupuncture-based treatment strategies.

### Physical therapy plus general practitioners' care versus general practitioners' care alone for sciatica: a randomised clinical trial with a 12-month follow-up [^112imvE9]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS), also called sciatica, is a disorder with radiating pain in the leg below the knee in one or more lumbar or sacral dermatomes, and can be accompanied by phenomena associated with nerve root tension or neurological deficits. A prolapsed disc is a frequent cause of LRS, but other causes include spinal or lateral recess stenosis, tumours and radiculitis. The incidence of LRS in the Netherlands is estimated at 5 per 1,000 persons a year.

There is consensus that treatment of LRS in the first 6–8 weeks should be conservative. The exact content of the conservative treatment is, however not yet clear. After the study of Vroomen et al. bed rest is no longer regarded as a treatment option for LRS. Assessed in a recent systematic review was the effectiveness of conservative treatments of LRS. Thirty trials were included that evaluated injections (n = 14), traction (n = 9), physical therapy (PT) (n = 4), bed rest (n = 2), manipulation (n = 2), medication (n = 2) and acupuncture (n = 1) as a treatment for LRS. Because several trials indicated no evidence of an effect it is not recommended to use corticosteroid injections and traction as treatment option. Whether clinicians should prescribe PT, bed rest, manipulation or medication could not be concluded from this review. Therefore, there is no evidence that one type of conservative treatment is clearly superior to others for patients with LRS.

In an previous observational study it was shown that GPs did not adhere to the guideline regarding the referral to PT; almost half of patients with LRS were referred for PT, although this was not recommended in the guideline. No specific characteristic could be identified to explain this referral to PT. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of PT in LRS. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of PT management additional to GP management compared to GP management alone, in patients with acute LRS.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^114arBd1]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Considering that acupuncture is more effective in treating sciatica than traditional treatments; we investigated the dose effect of acupuncture and observed the impact of pain chronicity. We hypothesized that, if acupuncture therapy is effective for pain relief in chronic sciatica, the number of acupoints (ie, dosage) may have a crucial role in pain relief. We also investigated the efficacy of acupuncture in treating sciatica and the impact of pain duration on treatment outcome.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^114VnjGL]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In general, there is evidence that early surgery in patients with sciatica provides for a better short-term relief of leg pain as compared to prolonged conservative care, but the evidence is low quality because of the fact that only one trial investigated this properly. No significant differences were found between surgery and usual conservative care in any of the clinical outcomes after 1 and 2 years, but the evidence is of very low quality. The scarcity of studies as well as the limited quality of the studies does not support the choice for any timing in our current guidelines.

Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care. Also economic evaluations should analyse the economical gain of the potential faster recovery against increased cost and complication rate of surgery.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rtBDN]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care for the management of patients with sciatica.

Design Systematic review.

Data source International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and LILACS.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica.

Data extraction Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions.

Results Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain −12.2, 95% confidence interval −20.9 to −3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief −26.6, −38.3 to −14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10–30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3–23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size.

Conclusions As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

### Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment… [^113naTCY]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Conservative Management For 90 percent of patients with lumbar disk herniation, acute sciatica starts to improve within six weeks and resolves by 12 weeks with conservative care. 15 Several nonsurgical treatments have proven effective in improving symptoms of lumbar disk herniation and should be considered first-line in the first six weeks of conservative management. Bed rest is less effective for sciatica than activity. In general, bed rest should be limited to avoid muscle deconditioning.
16. Several medications have been used to treat lumbar disk herniation pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants have been shown to be effective in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain, but these therapies have not been as extensively studied with lumbar disk herniation pain.

17, 18 Because available studies of NSAIDs with lumbar disk herniation pain provide conflicting conclusions, 19, 20 and because the effectiveness of muscle relaxants and acetaminophen for lumbar disk herniation pain has not been studied, the role of these therapies remains unclear. Systemic corticosteroids are no better than placebo for lumbar disk herniation pain 21 and have no role in conservative management. Opioid analgesics have not been studied for lumbar disk herniation pain, but are generally considered standard conservative therapy for patients with severe, function-limiting pain. Surgical Treatments The indications for emergent surgical intervention for sciatica include cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess, or severe and progressive neuromotor deficits. Patients with no improvement after six weeks of conservative management should undergo MRI or CT.

At this point, appropriate surgical candidates include patients with persistent neuromotor deficit, or severe sciatica with a positive straight-leg-raise test and imaging demonstrating lumbar disk herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. 8, 11, 33. 11 A systematic review and a recent large randomized controlled trial show that surgical diskectomy in carefully selected patients with sciatica from lumbar disk herniation provided faster relief of pain and disability than patients who were treated with conservative management. Surgery has been shown to have greater improvement in pain and disability than conservative treatment in the first two years after surgery, after which the outcomes are no different. 11, 12. Patient Counseling The natural history of lumbar disk herniation reveals that large herniations typically reabsorb with time.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^113mVv47]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this manuscript is to review the current knowledge in terms of retro-trochanteric pain syndrome, make recommendations for diagnosis and differential diagnosis and offer suggestions for treatment options. The terminology in the literature is confusing and these symptoms can be referred to as 'greater trochanteric pain syndrome', 'trochanteric bursitis' and 'trochanteritis', among other denominations. The authors focus on a special type of sciatica, i.e. retro-trochanteric pain radiating down to the lower extremity. The impact of different radiographic assessments is discussed. The authors recommend excluding pathology in the spine and pelvic area before following their suggested treatment algorithm for sciatica-like retro-trochanteric pain. Level of evidence II.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^111intyj]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this study is to establish a consensus based on the consensus of experts to determine the common clinical influencing factors and the best acupuncture parameters for acupuncture treatment of sciatica. The results showed that acupuncture therapy may have a satisfactory effect in improving sciatica. Nearly 90% of experts believe that the current acupuncture treatment can improve the pain and function of sciatica regardless of the severity of the disease that is to minimize the impact of sciatica on patients' life treatment. Although some terms specific to "traditional Chinese medicine" are included in the consensus items, the consensus result still has certain practicability and promotion significance.

According to the final consensus, acupuncture is recommended to improve the clinical symptoms for mild, moderate, and severe sciatica caused by the lumbar disc herniation. This consensus is similar to some previous research results. A single-center, parallel, randomized controlled trial involving 46 patients with sciatica pain for at least 12 weeks found that acupuncture was safer than sham acupuncture in treating chronic sciatica and had a curative effect in improving short-term pain. Two systematic reviews (one included 12 RCTs, 1842 patients; another included 11 RCTs, 932 patients) showed that acupuncture might be more effective in treating sciatica than drug therapy in relieving leg pain.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^113LfU5c]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

There are some limitations in our present review. Firstly, the limited amount of studies, especially those with a low risk of bias, limits the strength of our recommendations. The GRADE approach needs consistent findings in separate studies to raise the level of evidence to 'moderate' or 'high'. The overall quality of the evidence should not be misinterpreted as the quality of an individual study.

A more general problem lies within the methodology of research for the assessment of timing of interventions. Current research models, with the randomised clinical trial as the gold standard, do not allow for a proper analysis of the difference between the time from inclusion (or onset of symptoms) to intervention and prolonged control intervention. The design and analysis of studies is complicated by the difference in cross-over possibilities between the two interventions. Crossing over from conservative treatment to surgery is to be expected for a certain amount of patients. The reverse is also possible as shown in the study of Weinstein et al. The mechanism is however different as crossing over is only counted as surgery did not take place at all.

The clinical data seem to favour surgery slightly; however, the costs of surgery are likely to be higher than conservative treatment for patients or the health care system. Also, potential complications are probably more prevalent and more severe with surgery. Only from a societal perspective it might be more cost-effective because of lower cost of production loss. Evaluating conservative treatment and surgical intervention requires a different set of outcome parameters, including complications, re-surgeries and economical information to allow for a balanced and informed cost-complication-effectiveness decision.

### Tumor necrosis factor-alpha monoclonal antibody, infliximab, used to manage severe sciatica [^111HF2na]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

An open-label study was conducted.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of infliximab, a monoclonal chimeric antibody, against tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) for the treatment of severe sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Evidence from animal studies indicates that TNFalpha plays a role in the pathophysiology of sciatica. Anti-TNFalpha therapy has not been previously evaluated in sciatic patients.

Methods

In this study, 10 patients with disc herniation-induced severe sciatica received infliximab (Remicade 3 mg/kg) intravenously over 2 hours. The outcome was assessed at 1 hour, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months after the infusion and compared to historical control subjects consisting of 62 patients who received saline in a trial of periradicular infiltration for sciatica. Leg pain was the primary outcome, with more than a 75% decrease from the baseline score constituting a painless state. Fisher's exact test and repeated measures analysis of variance were used for statistical analysis.

Results

At 1 hour after the infusion, leg pain had decreased by 50%. At 2 weeks, 60% of the patients in the infliximab group were painless, as compared with 16% of the control patients (P = 0.006). The difference was sustained at 3 months (90% vs 46%; P = 0.014). Infliximab was superior over the whole follow-up period in terms of leg pain (P = 0.003) and back-related disability (P = 0.004). At 1 month, every patient in the infliximab group had returned to work, whereas 38% of the control subjects still were on sick leave (P = 0.02). None of the patients treated with infliximab underwent surgery during the follow-up period. No immediate or delayed adverse drug reactions and no adverse effects related to medication were observed.

Conclusions

Anti-TNFalpha therapy is a promising treatment option for sciatica. There is an urgent need for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether thesepromising early results can be confirmed.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of biological treatments targeting tumour necrosis factor α for sciatica [^116TvjZC]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Systematic review comparing biological agents, targeting tumour necrosis factor α, for sciatica with placebo and alternative interventions.

Methods

We searched 21 electronic databases and bibliographies of included studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs and controlled observational studies of adults who had sciatica treated by biological agents compared with placebo or alternative interventions.

Results

We pooled the results of six studies (five RCTs and one non-RCT) in meta-analyses. Compared with placebo biological agents had: better global effects in the short-term odds ratio (OR) 2.0 (95% CI 0.7–6.0), medium-term OR 2.7 (95% CI 1.0–7.1) and long-term OR 2.3 [95% CI 0.5 to 9.7); improved leg pain intensity in the short-term weighted mean difference (WMD) -13.6 (95% CI -26.8 to -0.4), medium-term WMD -7.0 (95% CI -15.4 to 1.5), but not long-term WMD 0.2 (95% CI -20.3 to 20.8); improved Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) in the short-term WMD -5.2 (95% CI -14.1 to 3.7), medium-term WMD -8.2 (95% CI -14.4 to -2.0), and long-term WMD -5.0 (95% CI -11.8 to 1.8). There was heterogeneity in the leg pain intensity and ODI results and improvements were no longer statistically significant when studies were restricted to RCTs. There was a reduction in the need for discectomy, which was not statistically significant, and no difference in the number of adverse effects.

Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to recommend these agents when treating sciatica, but sufficient evidence to suggest that larger RCTs are needed.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114KBNkX]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Pain radiating from the spine into the leg is commonly referred to as "sciatica". "Sciatica" may be associated with significant consequences for the person living with the condition, imposing a reduced quality of lifeand substantial direct and indirect costs (eg, £1.2–10.6 billion annually in the United Kingdom alone, extrapolated from primary care data).

Of note, there is no consensus on the definition and diagnostic criteria for "sciatica". The term "sciatica" has been used to encompass a range of nerve-related conditions originating from the spine such as radicular pain or painful radiculopathy. Despite the linguistic allusion to neural involvement, "sciatica" has in some instances even been used to encompass somatic referred pain.

Although these pain conditions may overlap, they are discrete entities with differing dominant pain characteristics (eg, nociceptive or neuropathic), which may require specific management approaches. Nevertheless, these terms are often used interchangeably, and these heterogeneous conditions are often amalgamated in clinical trials. Whether or not this amalgamation contributes to the modest treatment effects seen for "sciatica" is unclear.

Two of the main challenges associated with a diagnosis of "sciatica" relate to the inconsistent use of terminology for the diagnostic labels, "sciatica" or radicular pain or painful radiculopathy, and the identification of neuropathic pain. These challenges hinder collective clinical and scientific understanding and clarity regarding these conditions, impact effective clinical communication and care planning, prevent clear interpretation of the scientific literature related to the condition, and ultimately may contribute to the limited efficacy of care for people living with "sciatica". Indeed, most trials on conservative management for people with "sciatica" either show no, or at best, modest effects.

### Advice to stay active or structured exercise in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116mLF2P]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence on comparative effectiveness of advice to stay active versus supervised structured exercise in the management of sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Conservative management of sciatica usually includes interventions to promote physical activity in the form of advice to stay active or exercise, but there has been no systematic review directly comparing the effectiveness of these 2 approaches.

Methods

Data Sources included MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PEDro databases. Studies were randomized controlled trials comparing advice with exercise. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability data were extracted for all time points and converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-ups. The GRADE approach was used to summarize the strength of evidence.

Results

Five trials were included in the meta-analysis, which showed a significant, although small effect favoring exercise over advice for reducing leg pain intensity in the short term (weighted mean difference: 11.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.71–22.16]) but no difference for disability (weighted mean difference: 1.45 [95% confidence interval, -2.86 to 5.76]). Furthermore, there was no difference at intermediate and long-term follow-ups between advice and exercise for patient-relevant outcomes.

Conclusion

There is low-quality evidence (GRADE) that exercise provides small, superior effects compared with advice to stay active on leg pain in the short term for patients experiencing sciatica. However, there is moderate-quality evidence showing no difference between advice to stay active and exercise on leg pain and disability status in people with sciatica in the long term.

### Low back and radicular pain: a pathway for care developed by the British pain society [^112dHsJD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

These consensus guidelines aim to provide an overview of best practice for managing chronic spinal pain reflecting the heterogeneity of low back pain. Most guidelines have covered only one aspect of spinal care and thus have been divisive and potentially worsened the quality of care. Additionally, some of the evidence base is subjective and of poor quality. The British Pain Society low back pain pathway has reached across all disciplines and involved input from patients. It is recognized, however, that there is an urgent need for further good-quality clinical research in this area to underpin future guidelines. Considerable work is still needed to clarify the evidence; however, foundations have been laid with this pathway. Key features include: risk stratification; clarification of intensity of psychological interventions; a logical progression for the management of sciatica; and decision points for considering structural interventions such as spinal injections and surgery.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^11234V9U]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discectomy

Twelve trials (n = 1711 participants) investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment (10 trials) or epidural steroid injections (two trials).

Seven trials reported leg pain and disability outcomes for discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment. Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy resulted in a moderate reduction in leg pain at the immediate term (mean difference −12.1 (95% confidence interval −23.6 to −0.5)) and short term (−11.7 (−18.6 to −4.7)), a small reduction at medium term (−6.5 (−11.0 to −2.1)), but negligible effect at long term (−2.3 (−4.5 to −0.2); table 3, fig 2, fig 3). For disability, discectomy only resulted in small effects at the immediate term (−7.1 (−10.7 to −3.6)), short term (−7.2 (−11.7 to −2.7)), and medium term (−5.4 (−9.4 to −1.4)), but negligible effect at long term (−4.8 (−8.0 to −1.6); table 3 and fig 4, fig 5).

Implications for clinical practice and policy

International guidelines generally recommend surgical treatment for sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation if patients have not responded to comprehensive non-surgical treatment. These recommendations are because many people with acute sciatica will have improvements in their condition over time. Generally, our review supports these recommendations because non-surgical treatment was shown to be able to lead to similar outcomes at long term or even longer follow-ups. However, benefits could vary among different groups of people with sciatica. Attempts have been made to specify who might benefit more from early discectomy for people with sciatica. People with more severe pain in their leg and disability were shown to be more likely to have persistent and debilitating symptoms at 12 months. Thus, this subgroup might benefit from early discectomy because our review has shown that surgical treatment might lead to faster leg pain reduction. Added to that is the evidence that early discectomy is cost effective compared with prolonged non-surgical treatment in the context of the Dutch health system. These findings challenge the notion that non-surgical treatment should always be the first line treatment for sciatica. In people with sciatica who regard rapid pain relief as an important treatment goal, and who feel that the benefits of discectomy outweigh the risks and costs, discectomy could be an early management option.

As a result of the treatment's invasive nature and the substantial costs of surgery, we would encourage clinicians to discuss with their patients that discectomy can provide rapid relief of leg pain, but that non-surgical treatment can achieve similar results, although at a slower pace and with a potential chance of requiring delayed surgery if they do not respond to non-surgical treatment.

Future research

Although discectomy is widely used, the certainty of evidence supporting its use is only low to very low. All trials evaluating discectomy were not blinded and had high crossover rates. Evidence on plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis is limited by the low number of studies and small sample sizes. Large placebo controlled trials evaluating surgical treatment for sciatica have the potential to advance this field. However, the use of placebo controls in surgical trials has challenges. Furthermore, investigations into which group of people with sciatica are likely to benefit from early surgery is also key for clinicians to make individualised recommendations.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TFJhh]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The clinical syndrome of sciatica has been recognised since ancient times. Currently believed to arise from a disorder of the nerve root, the syndrome is known by a range of synonyms such as lumbosacral radicular syndrome, nerve root compromise, nerve root pain, and nerve root entrapment or irritation. Sciatica is considered to be a prognostic indicator of poor outcome among patients with low back painwith a substantial proportion continuing to have persistent pain for two years or longer. The annual prevalence of sciatica is estimated to be between 14%and 2%. While there are a range of definitions of sciatica, the key clinical features that can help clinicians to distinguish it from non-specific low back pain include unilateral leg pain that is worse than the low back pain, pain radiating below the knee, presence of numbness or pins and needles in a dermatomal distribution, positive results on a straight leg raise test, and weakness or reflex changes, or both, in a myotomal distribution.

Analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs are often prescribed for patients with sciatica. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica are about five times more likely to take drugs than those with low back pain only. Drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, systemic corticosteroids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. While guidelines provide clear and generally consistent recommendations for the prescription of drugs for non-specific low back pain, this is not the case for sciatica.

At present the efficacy and tolerability of commonly prescribed analgesic and adjuvant drugs for the management of patients with sciatica has not been established. The problem is that there are no reviews that specifically focus on these drugs that are used in primary care to manage sciatica. Because most guidelines recommend a course of conservative care before surgery is considered, it is imperative to understand what best practice conservative care should entail. In this systematic review we determined the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care (orally, topically, or parentally) in the management of patients with sciatica when compared with other treatment options or no treatment.

### Prevalence of weakness and factors mediating discrepancy between reported and observed leg weakness in people with sciatica [^116zWbYn]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications and future directions

Currently, there is a collective failure to provide effective treatment for people with sciatica. Despite the high prevalence of reported weakness, our clinical tests clearly do not observe signs of weakness to the same degree. This leaves our patients with a symptom that their health professional cannot detect, and likely therefore does not recognise, let alone treat. Future work should focus on understanding the exact nature of reported weakness and its meaning for people with sciatica. More work is needed to adequately measure fatigue, lack of endurance or functional movements in this population. A more complete understanding of the signs and symptoms of weakness in people with sciatica could lead to new and improved treatments for this currently underserved group of people.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for sciatica [^112sWKPY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for the treatment of sciatica. A previous Cochrane review on the efficacy of NSAIDs summarised findings for acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) and sciatica. This is an update of the original review (2008) focusing on people suffering from sciatica.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of NSAIDs in pain reduction, overall improvement, and reported side effects in people with sciatica.

Search Methods

We performed electronic searches up to 24 June 2015 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and two trials registers. We searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews on the topics for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (double-blind, single-blind, and open-label) that assessed the efficacy of NSAIDs in sciatica. We included all trials that compared NSAIDs to placebo, to other NSAIDs, or to other medication. Additional interventions were allowed if there was a clear contrast for the treatment with NSAIDs in the trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. Where feasible we calculated pooled results using Review Manager 5.3. We reported pain relief outcomes using mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI to report global improvement of treatment, adverse effects, and additional medication. We performed a meta-analysis if possible. We assessed level of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 10 trials reported in 9 publications (N = 1651). Only one trial out of 10 was assessed at low risk of bias. Five trials used the currently recommended daily dose for the drug, and two trials used lower daily doses available over the counter. Three trials investigated NSAIDs no longer approved for human use. The follow-up duration was short in all studies but one. Three trials (n = 918) compared the effects of NSAIDs to those of placebo on pain reduction. The pooled mean difference showed comparable pain reduction (visual analogue scale, 0 to 100) in the NSAIDs and placebo groups (MD -4.56, 95% CI -11.11 to 1.99). Heterogeneity was high (I² = 82%), and the quality of the evidence was very low. When we excluded one trial with a short follow-up of eight hours, the mean difference further decreased (MD -0.09, 95% CI -9.89 to 9.71). Three trials (n = 753) compared NSAIDs to placebo regarding global improvement. We found low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo with a risk ratio of 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.27). One trial (n = 214) studied the effect of NSAIDs on disability, finding very low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are no more effective than placebo on disability. Four trials (n = 967) comparing NSAIDs to placebo reported adverse effects, with low-quality evidence that the risk for adverse effects is higher in the NSAID group than in the placebo group (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.93). The adverse effects reported in this review are consistent with those previously reported in the literature.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated systematic review including 10 trials evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs versus placebo or other drugs in people with sciatica reports low- to very low-level evidence using the GRADE criteria. The efficacy of NSAIDs for pain reduction was not significant. NSAIDs showed a better global improvement compared to placebo. These findings must be interpreted with caution, as the level of evidence according to the GRADE classification was very low for the outcome pain reduction and low for global improvement due to small study samples, inconsistent results, imprecision, and a high risk of bias in the included trials. While the trials included in the analysis were not powered to detect potential rare side effects, we found an increased risk for side effects in the short-term NSAIDs use. As NSAIDs are frequently prescribed, the risk-benefit ratio of prescribing the drug needs to be considered.

### Cost-effectiveness of different strategies to manage patients with sciatica [^1153ozow]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this paper is to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for managing patients with sciatica. A deterministic model structure was constructed based on information from the findings from a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, published sources of unit costs, and expert opinion. The assumption was that patients presenting with sciatica would be managed through one of 3 pathways (primary care, stepped approach, immediate referral to surgery). Results were expressed as incremental cost per patient with symptoms successfully resolved. Analysis also included incremental cost per utility gained over a 12-month period. One-way sensitivity analyses were used to address uncertainty. The model demonstrated that none of the strategies resulted in 100% success. For initial treatments, the most successful regime in the first pathway was nonopioids, with a probability of success of 0.613. In the second pathway, the most successful strategy was nonopioids, followed by biological agents, followed by epidural/nerve block and disk surgery, with a probability of success of 0.996. Pathway 3 (immediate surgery) was not cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses identified that the use of the highest cost estimates results in a similar overall picture. While the estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life year are higher, the economic model demonstrated that stepped approaches based on initial treatment with nonopioids are likely to represent the most cost-effective regimens for the treatment of sciatica. However, development of alternative economic modelling approaches is required.

### Sciatica: what the rheumatologist needs to know [^113KCa4R]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a specific diagnosis, and is caused by a herniated lumbar disc in the vast majority of cases. The most important symptom is lower limb pain radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The clinical course of acute sciatica is generally favorable, with most pain and related disability improving within 2–4 weeks with or without treatment. Diagnosis mainly involves history taking and physical examination. Imaging is warranted if there is evidence of an underlying pathology other than disc herniation, such as infection or malignancy, and in patients with severe symptoms that do not improve after 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment. MRI is the preferred imaging modality, as it can visualize soft tissues better than CT and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. Conservative treatment is generally the first-line option in patients with sciatica; however, the currently available evidence does not show any intervention — including a broad range of conservative and surgical approaches — to have clearly superior outcomes. Thus, patient preference seems to be an important factor in the clinical management of sciatica.

Strengths and limitations of review

The strengths of this systematic review include the use of a prespecified protocol, inclusion of trials published in languages other than English, and the use of a highly sensitive search strategy to identify trials for sciatica coupled with search terms related to the nine classes of drugs of interest. We assessed methodological quality with the PEDro scale rather than the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool because the PEDro scale has been shown to have acceptable reliabilityand validity, whereas two studies have reported reliability limitations with the Cochrane tool. One limitation of our study is the possibility of publication bias as we did not attempt to identify unpublished trials that could be found in clinical trials registries and conference proceedings. Another limitation is that we could accommodate trials in only four languages other than English.

A strength of our review over past reviews is that we located 24 randomised clinical trials relevant to our question compared with six, three, and twotrials included in the four previous reviews. Accordingly we provide more precise estimates of treatment effects, specifically for NSAIDs and corticosteroids, and a better description about tolerability of all classes of drug. Including more trials has allowed us to provide a more in-depth evaluation of the pharmacological treatments that have been tested for sciatica in primary care. For example, we have provided information on the efficacy of antidepressants and opioid analgesics whereas previous reviews did not cover these classes of drugs. Another strength of this review is that we quantitatively pooled trials where possible. This allowed us to explore the size of the treatment effect, which is not possible in a qualitative summary. In addition, we were able to assess the overall quality of the evidence with the GRADE approach. Although conclusions of previous reviews were based on a surprising paucity of evidence, our findings are likely to inform the direction of future research in this topic. In pharmacological trials for sciatica, we consider the priorities to include consideration of duration of symptoms, recruitment of large samples, and collection of outcomes relevant to patients. For instance, regarding duration of symptoms it would be reasonable to test corticosteroids and NSAIDs in trials in patients with acute sciatica, whereas given that chronic sciatica includes a neuropathic pain component, anticonvulsant and antidepressants might need to be tested in patients with a chronic condition.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117YRTwY]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Quality assessment

Two reviewers (LD, LK) independently used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess study quality and risk of bias. The tool was piloted on three excluded studies to test agreement of decision-making. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer where required (GJ).

Data extraction

Two reviewers (LD, LK) independently extracted data using a standardised form; consensus was used to resolve any discrepancies. The following information was extracted: author, year, country, characteristics of participants (e.g. age, duration, severity of symptoms), diagnostic criteria, physiotherapy and control intervention (type, frequency and duration). Outcomes were extracted at baseline and follow-up time points. Primary outcomes of interest were pain (e.g. numerical pain rating scale) and disability (e.g. Oswestry disability index). Secondary outcomes were global perceived effect, quality of life, change in neurological function, psychological parameters, adverse events, and dropout rates. Means, standard deviations and sample sizes were extracted for each outcome. If alternative summary statistics were provided, we transformed the data using recommended calculations. If available, outcomes were extracted for different time points, and grouped according to time after randomisation as: short term (< 3 months); medium-term (> 3 months but < 12 months) or long-term (≥ 12 months). If multiple terms were reported within one period, the outcome closest to 7 weeks, 6 months and 12 months was used. When more than one body part was used to assess pain (e.g. leg and back pain), the highest score at baseline was used to reflect patients' dominant symptoms. When more than one outcome measure was used within a trial for a specific outcome of interest, the outcome measure described by the trial authors as their primary measure was used.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115uhhby]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

We used the review methods advocated by the editorial board of the Cochrane Back Review Group. This study searched the following databases from the earliest records to 15 March 2010: International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, CINAHL, and LILACS. Key words related to randomised controlled trial, sciatica, and drugs terms in addition to subject subheadings and word truncations specific for each database were used (see appendix on bmj.com). Electronic searches were supplemented by hand searching reference lists of eligible clinical trials. Our search was restricted to trials published in English, German, Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish. One reviewer screened all relevant titles and abstracts and excluded clearly irrelevant papers, leaving 173 potentially relevant papers. Two reviewers independently evaluated the full reports for eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Study selection

Studies were eligible if they were randomised controlled trials evaluating single or any combination of analgesic or adjuvant pain drugs. For the purposes of this review, we focused on pharmacological interventions that could be administered in primary care settings, which include drugs administered via oral, topical, or parental route (that is, intramuscular injection and intravenous bolus). We excluded trials evaluating procedures that require imaging assistance and the monitoring of anaesthesia monitoring capabilities (for example, epidural, extradural, and intradiscal injections) or that require an extended period of time to be administered with monitoring of the patient's vital signs (for example, intravenous infusion). Eligible comparisons included no treatment, placebo, or other treatment options (for example, other pharmacological treatment, surgery, epidural injections, or other conservative treatment).

### Do MRI findings identify patients with low back pain or sciatica who respond better to particular interventions? A systematic review [^112GLE4b]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal a range of degenerative findings and anatomical abnormalities; however, the clinical importance of these remains uncertain and controversial. We aimed to investigate if the presence of MRI findings identifies patients with low back pain (LBP) or sciatica who respond better to particular interventions.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched. We included RCTs investigating MRI findings as treatment effect modifiers for patients with LBP or sciatica. We excluded studies with specific diseases as the cause of LBP. Risk of bias was assessed using the criteria of the Cochrane Back Review Group. Each MRI finding was examined for its individual capacity for effect modification.

Results

Eight published trials met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of trials was inconsistent. Substantial variability in MRI findings, treatments and outcomes across the eight trials prevented pooling of data. Patients with Modic type 1 when compared with patients with Modic type 2 had greater improvements in function when treated by Diprospan (steroid) injection, compared with saline. Patients with central disc herniation when compared with patients without central disc herniation had greater improvements in pain when treated by surgery, compared with rehabilitation.

Conclusions

Although individual trials suggested that some MRI findings might be effect modifiers for specific interventions, none of these interactions were investigated in more than a single trial. High quality, adequately powered trials investigating MRI findings as effect modifiers are essential to determine the clinical importance of MRI findings in LBP and sciatica (

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RTpwW]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care for the management of patients with sciatica.

Design

Systematic review. Data source International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and LILACS.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions.

Results

Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain -12.2, 95% confidence interval -20.9 to -3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief -26.6, -38.3 to -14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10–30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3–23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size.

Conclusions

As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

### Acupuncture therapy for sciatica: an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analysis [^116mKXVv]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As research on acupuncture for sciatica continues to grow, the number of published SRs/MAs in this field is also increasing. Most findings suggest that acupuncture offers meaningful clinical benefits, supporting its role as a complementary and alternative treatment option for sciatica. However, the overall quality of the current evidence is limited by methodological flaws, risk of bias, and poor reporting standards. To establish stronger clinical recommendations, future studies must generate high-quality, rigorously conducted evidence to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of acupuncture in treating sciatica.

### WITHDRAWN: advice to stay active as a single treatment for low-back pain and sciatica [^117PH3nB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is one of the most common conditions managed in primary care. Restricted activity, rest, and symptomatic analgesics are the most commonly prescribed treatment for low back pain and sciatica.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as single treatment for patients with low back pain.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Musculoskeletal Group's Trials Register and Scisearch, and scanning of reference lists from relevant articles were undertaken. Relevant studies were also traced by contacting authors. Date of the most recent searches: December 1998.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised trials or quasi-randomised trials where the study population consisted of adult patients with low back pain or sciatica, in which one comparison group was advised to stay active. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to collect missing data or for clarification when needed.

Main Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. Advice to stay active was compared to advice to rest in bed in all trials. Two trials were assessed to have low risk of bias and two to have moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. Results from one high quality trial of patients with acute simple LBP found small differences in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference (on a 0–100 scale) 6.0 (95% CI: 1.5, 10.5)] and length of sick leave [WMD 3.4 days (95% CI: 1.6, 5.2)] in favour of staying active compared to advice to stay in bed for two days. The other high quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed for 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high quality trials also compared advice to stay active with exercises for patients with acute simple LBP, and found improvement in functional status and reduction in sick leave in favour of advice to stay active.

Authors' Conclusions

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has small beneficial effects for patients with acute simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. If there is no major difference between advice to stay active and advice to rest in bed, and there is potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, then it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

### Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment choices [^114L4it6]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute lumbar disk herniations are the most common cause of sciatica. After excluding emergent causes, such as cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess, fracture, or malignancy, a six-week trial of conservative management is indicated. Patients should be advised to stay active. If symptoms persist after six weeks, or if there is worsening neurologic function, imaging and invasive procedures may be considered. Most patients with lumbar disk herniations improve over six weeks. Because there is no difference in outcomes between surgical and conservative treatment after two years, patient preference and the severity of the disability from the pain should be considered when choosing treatment modalities. If a disk herniation is identified that correlates with physical findings, surgical diskectomy may improve symptoms more quickly than continued conservative management. Epidural steroid injections can also provide short-term relief.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^113C4etd]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study shows how the stepped care pathway of sciatica patients in the Netherlands is influenced by individual patient and physician preferences. The neurologist appears to be of central influence. To improve SDM, investments should be made in the deliberation about options and preferences and in a better understanding of the underlying rationale for an individual patient and the physician.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jg71Q]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

'Sciatica' is a broad term describing spinally referred pain of neural origin that radiates into the leg. The reported prevalence of sciatica varies widely (1.2–43%), probably due to different diagnostic criteria, reflecting a heterogeneous patient population. Sciatica is a significant burden to healthcare and the economy, as a neuropathic component in low back pain it is not only linked to poorer quality of life, but also increases the already high costs of back pain by a further 67%. Although prognosis is good for most patients, up to 45% continue to have symptoms for 12 months or longer.

Physiotherapy interventions such as exercise, manual therapy and psychological therapy are recommended in clinical guidelines for people with sciatica. However, the available systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions are at least ten years old. For example, study selection in the most recent systematic review comparing surgery versus conservative care ended in 2009. Their results could not be meta-analysed due to poor reporting and clinical heterogeneity. Similarly, a network-meta-analysis concluded its search in 2009, finding no support for the effectiveness of exercise or traction while manipulation may be beneficial. However, the latter was based on a single study only. Prior to this, reviews specifically focusing on conservative management of sciatica were published in 2010 and 2007 and were unable to make strong conclusions on the superiority of any treatment. More recent reviews published in 2015 and 2016 were limited to a subset of physiotherapy interventions (e.g. physical activity versus surgery and exercise versus advice to stay active). A recent review looked at a range of physiotherapy interventions, however the review did not include a meta-analysis.

Of note, sciatica is a heterogeneous condition with no agreed diagnostic criteria. Most reviews to date make no reference to the clinical diagnosis of included study participants rendering it unclear whether patients had confirmed nerve involvement. The objective of this systematic review was therefore to assess the up-to-date evidence on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared with control interventions in people with clinically diagnosed sciatica.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114BiiLV]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Registration

The protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018103900). We are reporting our findings according to the updated guidance for the PRISMA guidance.

Search strategy

We searched the following databases from inception to 29th January 2021: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PEDro, PubMed and Scopus. We also searched grey literature including trial registries (OpenGrey and clinicaltrials.gov). The search strategy was developed in consultation with a medical librarian and included keywords relating to sciatica, physiotherapy and randomised controlled trials (Supplemental Table 1).

Study eligibility

Included studies were randomised controlled trials evaluating physiotherapy interventions compared to a control intervention in people with 'sciatica'. Trials were eligible if study participants were diagnosed with spinally referred leg pain of neural origin. This diagnosis required at least one of the following: positive sensory, myotomal or reflex tests on neurological examination; positive neurodynamic test (e.g. straight leg raise, slump); imaging confirming spinal nerve compromise correlating with symptoms; presence of neuropathic pain determined with neuropathic pain questionnaires; electrodiagnostic testing or quantitative sensory testing suggesting nerve root involvement. Studies which either did not specify how the sciatica diagnosis was made or were simply using pain referral into the leg without other clinical tests confirming a neural component were excluded. No restrictions were made on sciatica symptom duration or intensity. Eligible trials must evaluate physiotherapy interventions such as exercise, manual therapy, physiotherapy-led education, or a combination of these. The control intervention needed to be a non-physiotherapy intervention (e.g. surgery, GP care, other non-physiotherapy care). The control intervention could also be placebo, sham or no intervention. No restrictions were made on language.

Trials that included participants with serious pathology (e.g. cancer, fracture, cauda equina), pregnant women or participants aged below 18 were excluded. Studies evaluating post-surgical physiotherapy were excluded. As recent reviews address the effectiveness of acupuncture for people with sciatica, and acupuncture is not core physiotherapy practice in many countries, trials evaluating acupuncture were excluded.

Study selection

Two reviewers (LD, GJ) screened studies independently. In a first step, titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full texts. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and arbitration by a third reviewer (AS) if required.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for sciatica: an updated cochrane review [^112HUDiu]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on pain reduction, overall improvement, and reported adverse effects in people with sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

NSAIDs are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for sciatica.

Methods

We updated a 2008 Cochrane Review through June 2015. Randomized controlled trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo, with other NSAIDs, or with other medication were included. Outcomes included pain using mean difference (MD, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]). For global improvement and adverse effects risk ratios (RR, 95% CI) were used. We assessed level of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

Ten trials were included (N = 1651). Nine out of 10 trials were assessed at high risk of bias. For pain reduction (visual analog scale, 0 to 100) NSAIDs were no more effective than placebo (MD -4.56, 95% CI -11.11 to 1.99, quality of evidence: very low). For global improvement NSAIDs were more effective than placebo (RR 1.14 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.27], low quality of evidence). One trial reported the effect of NSAIDs on disability with very low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are no more effective than placebo. There was low-quality evidence that the risk for adverse effects is higher for NSAID than placebo (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.93).

Conclusion

Our findings show very low-quality evidence that the efficacy of NSAIDs for pain reduction is comparable with that of placebo, low-quality evidence that NSAIDs is better than placebo for global improvement and low-quality evidence for higher risk of adverse effects using NSAIDs compared with placebo. The findings must be interpreted with caution, due to small study samples, inconsistent results, and a high risk of bias in the included trials.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^113yXFzx]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herniated lumbar disc resulting in back and leg pain travelling below the knee, sciatica, or radiculopathy is a worldwide burden to society. The condition affects an estimated 11% of patients presenting to their primary-care provider worldwide, with an annual prevalence estimated to be 2.2%. Generally, outcomes are favourable and 80% of patients improve with conservative care within 12–24 months. However, given that patients affected by this condition are typically aged 40–45 years, there is a risk of loss of livelihood if it is not managed promptly.

Treatment options have been considered by various expert-led guidelines, but no consensus exists for transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) due to a scarcity of class I evidence. Generally, once analgesia and lifestyle-modifying treatments have failed, steroid nerve root injections and surgical microdiscectomy are recommended for severe persistent cases. Stepwise care approaches based on treatment with non-opioids have been identified as likely to represent a more cost-effective approach than strategies involving direct referral for disc surgery; however, evidence for a stepwise treatment progression involving TFESI is scarce. Following various randomised trials comparing surgical treatments with non-surgical therapy, surgery is often deemed the most successful treatment option, leading to more than 10 000 discectomy procedures per year in the UK and 190 000 such procedures in the USA. The costs to the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for microdiscectomy (requiring patients to be hospitalised for 2 nights, on average) are approximately £4500 compared with £700 for TFESI.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111HRyc2]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The duration and intensity of the conservative treatment is poorly described in the included studies. There are many treatment regimens and modalities available for conservative treatment of sciatica varying from steroids to traction to physiotherapy interventions. Evidence from systematic reviews of conservative interventions for sciatica fail to identify the effect of one intervention over the other, however, large studies with a low risk of bias are scarce. In order to make an informed decision about the clinical homogeneity of the included comparisons, detailed information about the treatments is essential and the denomination "conservative treatment" is not sufficient.

Three narrative reviews which examined choice of surgery or conservative care concluded that surgery is indicated in presence of persistent neuromotor deficit. Both Awad and Moskovich and Legrand et al. suggested to let the patient make an informed choice. The review of Awad and Moskovich was published before publication of three of the studies included in this review. Although the publication of Legrand et al. was in 2007, this study did not include two studies published before that date. Gregory et al. promoted surgery with persistent neuromotor deficit or severe sciatica with a positive straight-leg-raise test and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. Although published in October 2008, this study did not include three studies published before that date. Both reviews did not describe their search strategy, selection methods or quality assessments of the included studies and are therefore, potentially, prone to bias.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^113BAPqA]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Background

The optimal invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc remains controversial, with a paucity of evidence for use of non-surgical treatments such as transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) over surgical microdiscectomy. We aimed to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of these options for management of radicular pain secondary to herniated lumbar disc.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 11 spinal units across the UK. Eligible patients were aged 16–65 years, had MRI-confirmed non-emergency sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration between 6 weeks and 12 months, and had leg pain that was not responsive to non-invasive management. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either TFESI or surgical microdiscectomy by an online randomisation system that was stratified by centre with random permuted blocks. The primary outcome was Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) score at 18 weeks. All randomly assigned participants who completed a valid ODQ at baseline and at 18 weeks were included in the analysis. Safety analysis included all treated participants. Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the EuroQol-5D-5L, Hospital Episode Statistics, medication usage, and self-reported resource-use data. This trial was registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN04820368, and EudraCT, number 2014–002751–25.

Findings

Between March 6, 2015, and Dec 21, 2017, 163 (15%) of 1055 screened patients were enrolled, with 80 participants (49%) randomly assigned to the TFESI group and 83 participants (51%) to the surgery group. At week 18, ODQ scores were 30.02 (SD 24.38) for 63 assessed patients in the TFESI group and 22.30 (19.83) for 61 assessed patients in the surgery group. Mean improvement was 24.52 points (18.89) for the TFESI group and 26.74 points (21.35) for the surgery group, with an estimated treatment difference of -4.25 (95% CI -11.09 to 2.59; p = 0.22). There were four serious adverse events in four participants associated with surgery, and none with TFESI. Compared with TFESI, surgery had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £38737 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and a 0.17 probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

Interpretation

For patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc, with symptom duration of up to 12 months, TFESI should be considered as a first invasive treatment option. Surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^113vqXpj]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

The interviewed sciatica patients were reluctant to use strong painkillers. This is congruent with earlier research that reports relatively reserved use of opioids in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, the use of analgesia has increased dramatically over the last decades. Broad concern has risen about opioid use and epidemics of opioid deaths, especially in the USA. In the Netherlands, this does not seem an immediate problem, as problematic use of opioids is relatively rare and at the fourth-lowest level in the EU. This study suggests that physicians were less scared of opioids than their patients.

Implications for practice

This study gives some indications for why practice variation still prevails in sciatica treatment. Personal preferences of patients and physicians guide decisions, within the boundaries set by guidelines and evidence. Based on this observation, SDM, as a strategy to reduce unwarranted practice variation, can be improved. A basic model to reach SDM is by following three steps: choice talk, option talk and decision talk. While Dutch patients are aware that there is a choice in this situation and do form individual preferences, this study suggests that the underlying, supporting process of deliberation is not fully developed. As a result, individual preferences of either the patient or the physician guide the care pathway more strongly than acknowledged or preferrable. To improve SDM Dutch physicians and patients should invest not necessarily more in the exchange of options or preferences, but in making sure the other understands the rationale behind them, as well as the applicability of the situation to the patient's individual context. This means not only presenting the treatment options, but an in depth discussion of which option is most fitting for what situation, and why both parties in the conversation think so. The revised model of the three steps of SDM places active listening and deliberation at the centre. Implementation of this improved model would possibly bridge the gap between patients and physicians in this stage of decision-making. Implementing SDM in clinical practice takes training, practice and requires adjustment in the way physicians were used to work. For the implementation of SDM in this care pathway, explicating the benefits and risks, adjusted to the situation of the patient, could be included more prominently in the clinical guidelines.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112unCo8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for sciatica.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to June 2022.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment, epidural steroid injections, or placebo or sham surgery, in people with sciatica of any duration due to lumbar disc herniation (diagnosed by radiological imaging).

Data extraction and synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference −12.1 (95% confidence interval −23.6 to −0.5)) and short term (−11.7 (−18.6 to −4.7)), and small at medium term (−6.5 (−11.0 to −2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (−2.3 (−4.5 to −0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections. For disability, a moderate effect was found at short term, but no effect was observed at medium and long term. The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Effectiveness of conservative treatments for the lumbosacral radicular syndrome: a systematic review [^115Envnu]. European Spine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with a lumbosacral radicular syndrome are mostly treated conservatively first. The effect of the conservative treatments remains controversial. To assess the effectiveness of conservative treatments of the lumbosacral radicular syndrome (sciatica). Relevant electronic databases and the reference lists of articles up to May 2004 were searched. Randomised clinical trials of all types of conservative treatments for patients with the lumbosacral radicular syndrome selected by two reviewers. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality and the clinical relevance. Because the trials were considered heterogeneous we decided not to perform a meta-analysis but to summarise the results using the rating system of levels of evidence. Thirty trials were included that evaluated injections, traction, physical therapy, bed rest, manipulation, medication, and acupuncture as treatment for the lumbosacral radicular syndrome. Because several trials indicated no evidence of an effect it is not recommended to use corticosteroid injections and traction as treatment option. Whether clinicians should prescribe physical therapy, bed rest, manipulation or medication could not be concluded from this review. At present there is no evidence that one type of treatment is clearly superior to others, including no treatment, for patients with a lumbosacral radicular syndrome.
