## Question

What's a clearer way to express multiple CNS drug?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a clearer way to express the phrase "multiple CNS drug". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly makes the original phrase ambiguous. Then, I should verify the consensus terminology and definitions from high-credibility sources. Next, I will assess the temporal component and risk framing, especially regarding concurrent exposure. After that, I will tailor the phrasing to different audiences and purposes. Finally, I will recommend a replacement term and provide implementation guidance for documentation and communication, making sure to double-check that each element aligns with established criteria and safety communications.

> Let me consider why "multiple CNS drug" is problematic. It is grammatically incomplete, lacks a quantitative threshold, does not specify whether use is concurrent versus sequential, omits mechanistic class definition, and fails to communicate the risk signal that usually motivates concern here, such as falls, cognitive impairment, and respiratory depression. Hold on, I should verify whether the field already has a standard term that encodes these elements; if so, using that would avoid ambiguity and support comparability across studies and clinical programs [^111gTXQx] [^114aMgxV].

> I need to check the established terminology. The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria–aligned term is central nervous system-active polypharmacy, typically operationalized as the concurrent use of three or more medications from specified CNS-active classes and treated as potentially inappropriate in older adults because of elevated risks including falls, impaired cognition, and respiratory suppression or death. Wait, let me verify the classes and the threshold: the JAGS literature describes antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-seizure medications, benzodiazepines, opioids, nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists or so-called z-drugs, and skeletal muscle relaxants, with the quantitative threshold of three or more agents, and many studies operationalize exposure as more than 30 consecutive days to capture chronic concurrent use. Hmm, I initially thought there were eight distinct categories, but let me correct that: the categories are sometimes listed as seven when anti-seizure medications encompass antiepileptics and when z-drugs are named explicitly as the nonbenzodiazepine BZRA class; the practical set is unchanged for measurement and safety purposes. I should confirm the prevalence signal too: among older adults with dementia, exposure of this type has been common, with material durations in some cohorts [^111gTXQx] [^114aMgxV].

> Next, I should review the temporal and concurrency dimension. The phrase "consecutive use" can be misread; wait, let me verify the intent in epidemiologic definitions. In the JAMA operationalization, "longer than 30 days consecutively" refers to overlapping exposure to three or more CNS-active medications maintained over at least 30 continuous days, which distinguishes simultaneous exposure from sequential trials and better captures risk relevant to falls and neurocognitive effects. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — the threshold is for concurrent use over a sustained period, not merely any three fills scattered over time [^114aMgxV].

> I will now examine context-appropriate phrasing so the term fits the audience and purpose. For geriatrics and dementia care or research, I should use "CNS-active polypharmacy" and, on first use, define it quantitatively to align with Beers-based criteria. For regulatory or medication-safety warnings, "concomitant use of multiple CNS depressants" is clearer because it directly flags additive sedation and respiratory risk, mirroring FDA labeling. For general medicine documentation that is not geriatric-specific, "multiple concurrent CNS medications" specifies simultaneity without overcommitting to a geriatric threshold. For patient-facing materials, I should translate to "taking three or more brain-affecting medicines together" to preserve the numeric cutoff while improving accessibility. Wait, I should double-check that each phrasing has a supporting precedent or safety rationale before I settle on it, especially for the regulatory and patient versions [^112QHbY5] [^113b7jFp] [^111qPKdD].

> But wait, what if the clinical concern is specifically about respiratory depression, sedation, and next-day impairment rather than broader neurocognitive harms. In that case, I need to explicitly signal the high-risk combinations that intensify harm, particularly when opioids or oxybate salts are involved with benzodiazepines, z-drugs, sedating antidepressants or antipsychotics, antiepileptics, or muscle relaxants. Let me verify the FDA language: labeling for oxybate products and pregabalin warns of additive CNS depression, hypotension, and potentially fatal respiratory suppression with concomitant CNS depressants, and z-drugs add next-day impairment and complex sleep behaviors, so the risk phrase "concomitant CNS depressants" accurately directs clinician attention to interaction risk and mitigation such as dose reduction, regimen interruption, or avoidance. I should confirm that patient activity restrictions, like driving avoidance, are captured by these labels too, which they are [^113b7jFp] [^112QHbY5] [^1131CiXX].

> Now, I should articulate how to implement the preferred terminology in practice. Let me first confirm the primary recommendation: replace "multiple CNS drug" with "CNS-active polypharmacy" and define it on first use as three or more concurrent CNS-active medications from the specified classes. I need to ensure chronicity is explicit when intended; specifying more than 30 consecutive days captures ongoing exposure in line with research definitions. I should also document which classes are represented and flag elevated-risk combinations when opioids are present, because the harm profile escalates. Finally, to support safer care, I should pair the term with communication and deprescribing strategies, since clinician–patient dialogue and shared decision making improve uptake of deprescribing recommendations in older adults with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Hold on, I should verify that these communication-centric deprescribing recommendations are evidence-aligned and recent, which they are in contemporary frameworks and guidance [^114aMgxV] [^112QHbY5] [^1173U8GL] [^115w9MVK].

> Let me reconsider why these expressions are superior to the vague original phrasing. They provide mechanistic specificity by naming CNS-active classes, quantitative clarity with a threshold that can be screened in medication reconciliation, and an embedded risk signal that aligns with falls, cognitive adverse effects, and respiratory harm. I should double-check that standardization enables measurement and quality improvement; indeed, using the Beers-based threshold allows consistent surveillance, and the observed prevalence in dementia cohorts underscores the clinical importance of identifying and addressing this exposure pattern [^112QHbY5] [^114aMgxV].

> Next, I should review operational implications for care teams. Primary care clinicians often author a large proportion of days of CNS-active polypharmacy in older adults with dementia, so targeting reconciliation, taper plans, and nonpharmacologic alternatives in primary care is high yield. Meanwhile, in acute and emergency settings, explicit recognition of CNS-active polypharmacy as a falls and delirium risk factor supports prevention strategies and discharge planning. I need to ensure these practice points map to observed prescribing patterns and frontline safety concerns before concluding, which they do [^11385Fxb] [^115BpJ2Z].

> Final recommendation: I should confirm that the replacement term is consistent across contexts and sufficiently flexible. Replace "multiple CNS drug" with "CNS-active polypharmacy", defined as three or more concurrent CNS-active medications, and specify duration when relevant; when the risk message is the priority, use "concomitant use of multiple CNS depressants"; translate to plain language for patients as "taking three or more brain-affecting medicines together" and immediately couple this with a brief explanation of key risks and a deprescribing plan where appropriate. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — ensure the first mention always includes the explicit definition and the implicated classes so readers know exactly what is meant in that clinical document or study [^112QHbY5] [^113b7jFp] [^111qPKdD].

---

A better way to refer to "multiple CNS drugs" is **CNS-active polypharmacy** [^112QHbY5] or **concurrent CNS-active medications** [^114aMgxV]. These terms are **more precise and clinically accepted**, and they **emphasize the risks** of additive CNS effects — including sedation, cognitive impairment [^112QHbY5], and respiratory depression [^113b7jFp] [^112QHbY5]. They also align with guideline language and support clear communication about monitoring and deprescribing [^113KBHYv] [^112JdsBS] [^115w9MVK] [^1173U8GL].

---

## Alternative terminology

Several **alternative terms** are commonly used in clinical practice and the literature to describe the concurrent use of multiple CNS-active medications [^114aMgxV]:

- **CNS-active polypharmacy**: This term specifically refers to the concurrent use of multiple CNS-active medications [^114aMgxV], emphasizing the potential risks associated with polypharmacy, such as drug interactions, adverse effects, and cognitive impairment [^112QHbY5].

- **Concurrent CNS-active medications**: This phrase highlights the simultaneous use of multiple CNS-active drugs, drawing attention to the need for **careful monitoring** [^113KBHYv] and management of potential interactions and side effects.

- **CNS polypharmacy**: Similar to CNS-active polypharmacy, this term emphasizes the use of multiple CNS medications and the associated risks [^116PrNU7].

- **Multiple CNS-active agents**: This term specifically refers to the use of multiple medications that act on the central nervous system, highlighting the potential for additive or synergistic effects [^114bA4T4].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

The concurrent use of multiple CNS-active medications carries **significant clinical implications and risks**, including:

- **Increased risk of adverse drug reactions**: Combining multiple CNS medications can lead to additive or synergistic effects [^111gTXQx], increasing the risk of adverse reactions such as sedation, cognitive impairment [^114aMgxV], respiratory depression, and falls [^114bA4T4].

- **Drug interactions**: CNS medications often interact pharmacodynamically and pharmacokinetically [^111gTXQx], potentially leading to serious complications such as respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation [^113b7jFp] [^114bA4T4].

- **Cognitive impairment and falls**: CNS polypharmacy is associated with an increased risk [^114aMgxV] of cognitive impairment, falls, and functional decline, particularly in older adults [^112QHbY5] [^115BpJ2Z].

- **Respiratory depression**: The concurrent use of CNS depressants, such as benzodiazepines, opioids, and sedative-hypnotics [^111gTXQx], significantly increases the risk of respiratory depression [^113b7jFp], which can be life-threatening [^114bA4T4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize careful **monitoring**, regular **medication reviews**, and **deprescribing strategies** for patients on multiple CNS-active medications:

- **Regular medication reviews**: Guidelines recommend regular medication reviews [^113KBHYv] to assess the appropriateness of CNS medications, identify potential drug interactions [^112JdsBS], and reduce polypharmacy [^116PrNU7].

- **Deprescribing strategies**: Deprescribing, the process of tapering or discontinuing unnecessary medications [^113KBHYv], is recommended to reduce polypharmacy [^112JdsBS] and minimize the risk of adverse drug reactions [^115w9MVK].

- **Patient-centered approach**: Guidelines emphasize the importance of involving patients in decision-making [^113KBHYv], considering their preferences, goals, and clinical circumstances when managing CNS polypharmacy [^112JdsBS] [^1173U8GL].

---

## Communication strategies

Effective **communication** is essential [^1173U8GL] when discussing multiple CNS-active medications. Use clear, concise language to explain the risks and benefits of CNS polypharmacy so patients understand the consequences of concurrent use, and provide education on potential side effects, drug interactions, and the importance of adherence [^116fQPzM]. Engage in **shared decision-making** [^113YikWH] to review options, risks, and benefits, and schedule regular follow-up to monitor progress, assess medication effectiveness, and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

---

## Conclusion

Preferred terminology for "multiple CNS drugs" includes **CNS-active polypharmacy** [^112QHbY5] or **concurrent CNS-active medications** [^114aMgxV]. These terms are **more precise and clinically accepted**, and they emphasize the risks of additive CNS effects, including sedation, cognitive impairment [^114aMgxV], and respiratory depression [^112QHbY5] [^111gTXQx] [^114bA4T4]. They also align with guideline language and support clear communication about monitoring and deprescribing [^113KBHYv] [^112JdsBS].

### Clinician contributions to central nervous system-active polypharmacy among older adults with dementia in the United States [^112QHbY5]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Approximately one in ten adults aged 65 years and older in the United States have dementia. Although the prevalence of dementia is declining, the total number of persons living with dementia (PLWD) will more than double from over 6 million in 2020 to nearly 14 million people by 2060.

Central nervous system (CNS)-active polypharmacy — defined by the 2019 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria as the use of three or more medications from any of the following classes: antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-seizure medications, benzodiazepines, opioids, nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists ("z-drugs" hereafter), skeletal muscle relaxants — is considered potentially inappropriate for older adults due to serious associated risks, including fall-related injury, impaired cognition, and respiratory suppression or death, especially when involving opioids. Given these risks, the high rate of prescribing to PLWD is startling: in 2018, 14% of community-dwelling PLWD were exposed to more than 30 consecutive days of CNS-active polypharmacy, with a significant proportion exposed for an entire year and many prescribed four or more such medications concurrently.

Reducing CNS-active polypharmacy is a complicated problem because multiple clinicians may be prescribing the multiple drug classes, and each clinician presumably believes that they are prescribing appropriately. To investigate the distribution of CNS-active prescribing to PLWD across clinicians and to help develop potential clinician-facing interventions, we build on our prior work by first updating our understanding of this issue.

### Xywav [^113b7jFp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

XYWAV is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Clinically significant respiratory depression and obtundation have occurred in adult patients taking sodium oxybate (the same active moiety as XYWAV) at recommended doses in clinical trials and may occur in patients treated with XYWAV at recommended doses. XYWAV is contraindicated in combination with alcohol and sedative hypnotics. The use of XYWAV with other CNS depressants, including but not limited to opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, sedating antidepressants or antipsychotics, sedating anti-epileptic drugs, general anesthetics, muscle relaxants, and/or illicit CNS depressants, may increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, syncope, and death.

If use of these CNS depressants in combination with XYWAV is required, dose reduction or discontinuation of one or more CNS depressants (including XYWAV) should be considered. In addition, if short-term use of an opioid (e.g. post- or perioperative) is required, interruption of treatment with XYWAV should be considered.

Healthcare providers should caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles or airplanes, until they are reasonably certain that XYWAV does not affect them adversely (e.g. impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills). Patients should not engage in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination, such as operating machinery, a motor vehicle, or flying an airplane, for at least 6 hours after taking XYWAV.

### Prevalence of central nervous system-active polypharmacy among older adults with dementia in the US [^114aMgxV]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Community-dwelling older adults with dementia have a high prevalence of psychotropic and opioid use. In these patients, central nervous system (CNS)-active polypharmacy may increase the risk for impaired cognition, fall-related injury, and death.

The objective of the study was to determine the extent of CNS-active polypharmacy among community-dwelling older adults with dementia in the US.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Cross-sectional analysis of all community-dwelling older adults with dementia identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnosis codes. The study included 1,159,968 individuals with traditional Medicare coverage from 2015 to 2017. Medication exposure was estimated using prescription fills between October 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018.

- **Exposures**: Part D coverage during the observation year (January 1-December 31, 2018).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the prevalence of CNS-active polypharmacy in 2018, defined as exposure to three or more medications for longer than 30 days consecutively from the following classes: antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics, and opioids. Among those who met the criterion for polypharmacy, the duration of exposure, number of distinct medications and classes prescribed, common class combinations, and the most commonly used CNS-active medications were determined.

### Patient factors associated with new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in multimorbid US older adults using multiple medications [^114EMSjS]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Further, these findings have implications for the design of interventions aimed at reducing the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and deprescribing interventions. Prior medication optimization interventions in older adults more broadly have had little or no effect on clinical outcomes, such as mortality or cognitive impairment. Evidence on interventions in multimorbid older adults using multiple medications remains scarce.

Interventions designed to optimize prescribing also may need to be multifaceted, as they should aim at changing behaviors of different stakeholders (e.g. patients, physicians, pharmacists, etc) and should involve different components (i.e. medication review, education/training, and use of different tools/instruments). Such interventions must not only solve medication-related problems (e.g. PIM prescribing) but must also target the underlying mechanisms that lead to these problems (e.g. complexity). Consequently, while not all of the above-mentioned factors are modifiable, the knowledge of their association with PIM prescribing must be built into medication optimization interventions and may be even more important for this more complex population.

### Lyrica [^111gTXQx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Inform patients about the risk of respiratory depression, noting that the risk is greatest for those using concomitant central nervous system (CNS) depressants, such as opioid analgesics, or in those with underlying respiratory impairment. Teach patients how to recognize respiratory depression and advise them to seek medical attention immediately if it occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Dizziness and somnolence**: Counsel patients that Lyrica may cause dizziness, somnolence, blurred vision, and other CNS signs and symptoms. Accordingly, advise patients not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have gained sufficient experience with Lyrica to gauge whether it affects their mental, visual, and/or motor performance adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **CNS depressants**: Inform patients who require concomitant treatment with central nervous system depressants, such as opiates or benzodiazepines, that they may experience additive CNS side effects, such as respiratory depression, somnolence, and dizziness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Advise patients to avoid consuming alcohol while taking Lyrica, as Lyrica may potentiate the impairment of motor skills and sedating effects of alcohol.

### The hidden sister of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease: A review on nonmotor fluctuations [^117Wt7YM]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Only a few years after the introduction of levodopa, the first descriptions of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia related to dopaminergic therapy appeared. In Parkinson's disease (PD), attention turned to their management, which had dampened the euphoria of the "levodopa miracle". It soon became clear that neuropsychiatric, autonomic, and sensory features also tend to develop fluctuations after chronic exposure to l-dopa. The diversity of fluctuating nonmotor symptoms, their largely subjective nature, coupled with a frequent lack of insight, led to difficulties in identification and quantification. This may explain why, despite the high impact of nonmotor symptoms on patient autonomy and quality of life, evaluation of nonmotor fluctuations is not part of clinical routine.

In view of the lack of specific validated assessment tools, detailed anamnesis should ideally be coupled with an evaluation in both ON and OFF drug conditions. The mechanisms of nonmotor fluctuations are not well understood. It is thought that they share dopaminergic presynaptic pharmacokinetic and postsynaptic pharmacodynamic mechanisms with the classical motor complications but involve different neural pathways. Although symptoms fluctuate with dopaminergic treatment, serotonin and norepinephrine denervation, as well as interactions between neurotransmitter systems, probably contribute to their diversity. The lack of validated tools for assessment of these phenomena explains the almost complete absence of treatment studies. Management, largely resulting from expert opinion, includes psychiatric follow-up and nondopaminergic drugs.

### Central nervous system findings on functional magnetic resonance imaging in patients before and after treatment with anticholinergic medication [^116hCSRi]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Anticholinergic medications are commonly used to treat urinary urgency and frequency. Muscarinic receptors are located beyond the detrusor muscle. In this study, we measured changes in central nervous system activity in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms treated with tolterodine or a placebo.

A total of 20 female patients with urinary frequency were randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with tolterodine or a placebo. Functional magnetic resonance imaging based on blood oxygenation level dependent imaging of the brain during bladder filling was performed before and after treatment. For each patient, the bladder was filled by a urethral catheter and emptied 5 times.

Multiple brain areas showed significant activation with bladder filling compared to the empty state, and many areas also showed deactivation. Overall brain activation with bladder filling was decreased after treatment in both groups. After treatment, two areas of the parietal cortex (precuneus and postcentral gyrus) showed significantly greater activity in patients treated with tolterodine compared to the placebo. Two areas of the cerebellum (anterior lobe and culmen) showed significantly greater activity in the placebo group, and these were also areas of significant deactivation in the tolterodine group.

Brain activity changes and the areas of activation after treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with an anticholinergic medication or placebo are different in the two groups. Whether this finding represents action at the central nervous system level remains to be fully understood.

### Development of a model of medication review for use in clinical practice: Bristol medication review model [^112JdsBS]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Medicines are a fundamental intervention used by health services to improve health and well-being. In patients with long-standing or multiple health problems, the use of many medications — polypharmacy — is commonplace. If used appropriately, polypharmacy may lead to improvements in clinical outcomes; however, it may also be associated with adverse consequences, including hazardous prescribing and reduced quality of life.

The process of medicine optimisation ensures that medicines are used in the most effective and safe manner possible. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society outlines four guiding principles to achieve this, applicable to both frontline care and service development: understanding the patient's experience, ensuring evidence-based choice of medicines, ensuring the safety of medicine use, and embedding medicine optimisation in routine practice. Medication review forms a critical part of this process, defined by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as "a structured, critical examination of a person's medicines with the objective of reaching an agreement with the person about treatment, optimising the impact of medicines, minimising the number of medicine-related problems, and reducing waste". Other definitions may be more focused; for example, the Pharmaceutical Care Network of Europe considers reviews to "entail detecting drug-related problems and recommending interventions". The structure and content of reviews also vary depending on the nature of clinical information available and the involvement (or lack thereof) of patients in the review process.

### Polypharmacy: Evaluating risks and deprescribing [^113KBHYv]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Polypharmacy, defined as the regular use of at least five medications, is common in older adults and younger at-risk populations, increasing the risk of adverse medical outcomes. Several risk factors can lead to polypharmacy.

- **Patient-related factors**: These include having multiple medical conditions managed by multiple subspecialist physicians, having chronic mental health conditions, and residing in a long-term care facility.
- **Systems-level factors**: These involve poorly updated medical records, automated refill services, and prescribing to meet disease-specific quality metrics.

Tools that help identify potentially inappropriate medication use include the Beers criteria, STOPP (Screening Tool of Older People's Prescriptions), START (Screening Tool to Alert to Right Treatment), and the Medication Appropriateness Index. No tool or strategy has proven superior in improving patient-related outcomes and decreasing polypharmacy risks.

Monitoring patients' active medication lists and deprescribing any unnecessary medications are recommended to reduce pill burden, risks of adverse drug events, and financial hardship. Physicians should view deprescribing as a therapeutic intervention, similar to initiating clinically appropriate therapy. When deprescribing, physicians should consider patient and caregiver perspectives on therapy goals, including views on medications, chronic conditions, and preferences regarding prescribing to slow disease progression, prevent health decline, and address symptoms. Point-of-care tools can aid physicians in deprescribing.

### Clinician contributions to central nervous system-active polypharmacy among older adults with dementia in the United States [^11385Fxb]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Low credibility.

In this cross-sectional analysis of Medicare claims data, one quarter of persons living with dementia (PLWD) who experienced central nervous system (CNS)-active polypharmacy had all of their medications prescribed by a single clinician, whereas individual clinicians prescribed nearly half of all such polypharmacy days. Primary care clinicians prescribed the majority of medications that contributed to CNS-active polypharmacy for PLWD. The most high-yield strategies to reduce such polypharmacy should focus on supporting prescribing to PLWD in primary care settings.

### What is polypharmacy? A systematic review of definitions [^114i5g1a]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

While the addition of the duration of therapy or healthcare setting to a count of medicines in the definition of polypharmacy provided more specific definitions, it did not offer further clarity or consistency. The use of five or more medications in definitions typically included a period of time, such as 90 days or more. Duration in definitions identified patients with long-term or chronic medication use, potentially highlighting those at greatest risk of medication-related problems. Definitions that incorporated a healthcare setting often used a count of five or more medications, applying this at times such as hospital discharge. These definitions were largely based on dispensing data to assess the prevalence and incidence of polypharmacy, rather than using an evidence-based approach for determining the appropriateness of therapy. The setting added little to existing definitions of polypharmacy in terms of medication rationalization and harm minimization.

A recent commentary on polypharmacy noted that despite a large body of literature confirming that patients are increasingly taking numerous medications, numerical definitions do not ascertain the clinical appropriateness of therapy or the process of rationalizing these medications. The author argued that when each medication can be linked to practice guidelines for chronic conditions in a given patient, using a numerical cut-off to define polypharmacy becomes irrelevant.

### Evidence supporting the best clinical management of patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy: A systematic guideline review and expert consensus [^112LSMss]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The complexity and heterogeneity of patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy render traditional disease-oriented guidelines often inadequate and complicate clinical decision-making. To address this challenge, guidelines have been developed on multimorbidity or polypharmacy. We conducted a systematic guideline review using the Ariadne principles for managing multimorbidity as an analytical framework. The information synthesis included a multistep consensus process involving 18 multidisciplinary experts from seven countries.

We included eight guidelines (four each on multimorbidity and polypharmacy) and extracted about 250 recommendations. The guideline addressed:

- **Identification of the target population**: Risk factors.

- **Assessment of interacting conditions and treatments**: Medical history, clinical and psychosocial assessment including physiological status and frailty, reviews of medication, and encounters with healthcare providers highlighting informational continuity.

- **Incorporation of patient preferences and goal setting**: Eliciting preferences and expectations, the process of shared decision-making in relation to treatment options, and the level of involvement of patients and carers.

- **Individualized management**: Guiding principles on the optimization of treatment benefits over possible harms, treatment communication, and the information content of medication/care plans.

- **Monitoring and follow-up**: Strategies in care planning, self-management and medication-related aspects, communication with patients.

### ECTRIMS/EAN guideline on the pharmacological treatment of people with multiple sclerosis [^116TL2uj]. Multiple Sclerosis (2018). High credibility.

The 2018 ECTRIMS/EAN guidelines detail the medical management of multiple sclerosis, focusing on disease-modifying therapies. Specifically, they address the initiation of certain drugs for patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The choice of agent is tailored based on patient characteristics and comorbidities, disease severity, drug safety profile, and drug accessibility, decided jointly with the patient. The recommended drugs include:

- **Interferon therapies**: Interferon β-1b and interferon β-1a, available subcutaneously and intramuscularly
- **Recombinant forms**: Peginterferon β-1a
- **Injectable preparations**: Glatiramer acetate
- **Oral medications**: Teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate
- **Therapies for active disease**: Cladribine and fingolimod
- **Monoclonal antibodies**: Daclizumab, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, and alemtuzumab

### What is polypharmacy? A systematic review of definitions [^116PTkqh]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

While the most commonly used definition of polypharmacy is being on five or more medicines, definitions are variable, which can cause confusion for researchers as well as clinicians in practice. Numerical definitions of polypharmacy do not account for specific comorbidities present and make it difficult to assess safety and appropriateness of therapy in the clinical setting. There is a need for an internationally agreed definition of polypharmacy. The results indicate the need for a shift towards the term 'appropriate polypharmacy' using a holistic approach of assessing medication use in context of comorbidities present, according to best available evidence in order to optimize health outcomes.

### What is polypharmacy? A systematic review of definitions [^112RYCE4]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The results of this systematic review show significant heterogeneity in the definition of polypharmacy. Definitions ranged from numerical counts only, to numerical counts for a given duration of therapy or setting, and descriptive terms such as minor, moderate, major, and excessive polypharmacy. The lack of a clear and universal definition of polypharmacy, as well as terms like minor, moderate, and major polypharmacy, makes it challenging for healthcare professionals to assess and consider efficacy and safety issues within the clinical setting.

The most commonly reported category of definitions for polypharmacy and associated terms was numerical only. The most commonly used term was polypharmacy, defined as five or more medications by 46.4% of studies (51 articles). There was a wide range of numerical-only definitions of polypharmacy, ranging from two or more medications to 11 or more medications. However, most studies do not elucidate the clinical basis for using a numerical count, such as five or more medications, to define polypharmacy and its potential to rationalize medication use and optimize health outcomes. It has been postulated that while the term polypharmacy has evolved over time, the basis for the definition is simply more drugs being prescribed or taken than are clinically appropriate in the context of a patient's comorbidities. It is commonly reported that as the number of prescribed drugs increases, so do the chances of adverse drug events and the likelihood of harm. However, the specific number of drugs taken is not itself indicative.

### Communication as a key component of deprescribing: Conceptual framework and review of the literature [^1173U8GL]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Deprescribing, the process of identifying and discontinuing potentially harmful or unnecessary medications, is a key component of caring for older persons. Communication is central to deprescribing. This study's objectives were to create a conceptual framework for deprescribing communication and to apply the framework to evaluate and explore potential uses of communication in deprescribing.

- **Methods**: The consensus development working group comprises an international set of 14 experts in geriatrics, clinical pharmacology, communication, community outreach, and care partner stakeholders. Critical literature reviews describe (a) components of communication used in deprescribing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and (b) the content of studies examining deprescribing communication, knowledge, attitudes, and values.

- **Results**: The framework demonstrates that communication extends beyond interactions between clinicians and patients. Communication can occur at the health system level, involving methods such as patient-specific feedback materials and academic detailing. Communication can also occur at the community level, involving entities such as pharmaceutical companies, the internet, community groups, and guidelines. Evaluation of the summary of RCTs against the framework demonstrates that intervention studies overwhelmingly focus on communication in individual clinical and health system-based encounters. Evaluation of the summary of observational studies demonstrates that there has been little study of the communication methods and styles themselves.

- **Conclusions**: (Content appears to be incomplete)

### Polypharmacy and deprescribing: Challenging the old and embracing the new [^112nFTWD]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Studies have suggested that for deprescribing to succeed, it requires effective communication that resonates with patients and caregivers. How clinicians communicate about deprescribing may affect to what extent patients and caregivers understand and involve themselves with the process. When patients are fully informed about the risks and benefits of available treatments and are engaged in decision-making, they are more likely to accept deprescribing recommendations.

In order to increase engagement of patients and caregivers in deprescribing conversations and facilitate shared decision-making, multiple tools including fact sheets, leaflets, decision aids, and option grids have been developed. However, many important limitations of these tools have been identified, such as their above-average reading level, unbalanced information on the potential benefits and harms of deprescribing, and lack of elicitation of patients' treatment goals and preferences. Further research is needed to understand how best to engage and communicate information about deprescribing to patients and caregivers, taking into account factors such as health literacy and cognitive abilities. Co-designing materials with patients and carers may engage and incorporate their personalized needs and concerns, given the mounting evidence that patient-centered care and shared decision-making can improve patient satisfaction, adherence, quality of life, and overall health outcomes.

### Triumeq PD [^1158Ge4k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling, including the Medication Guide and Instructions for Use.

- **Drug interactions**: Triumeq or Triumeq PD may interact with many drugs. Therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription, nonprescription medication, or herbal products, including St. John's wort [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Hypersensitivity reaction**:
	- Inform patients that a Medication Guide and Warning Card summarizing the symptoms of the abacavir hypersensitivity reaction and other product information will be dispensed by the pharmacist with each new prescription and refill of Triumeq or Triumeq PD. Instruct the patient to read the Medication Guide and Warning Card every time to obtain any new information that may be present about Triumeq or Triumeq PD. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.
	- Instruct patients to carry the Warning Card with them.
	- Explain how to identify a hypersensitivity reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Medication Guide].
	- Advise that if they develop symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction, they should call their healthcare provider right away to determine if they should stop taking Triumeq or Triumeq PD.
	- Warn that a hypersensitivity reaction can worsen and lead to hospitalization or death if Triumeq or Triumeq PD is not immediately discontinued.
	- Emphasize not to restart Triumeq or Triumeq PD or any other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction.

### Percocet [^116P4zse]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Percocet should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Percocet for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions, such as the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries, require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Percocet. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

### New horizons in deprescribing for older people [^113YikWH]. Age and Ageing (2019). Low credibility.

Deprescribing has gained interest recently, driven by an ageing population with an increasing number living with multiple long-term conditions. This, coupled with disease-specific guidelines derived from clinical trials in younger people, has led to an increase in exposure to polypharmacy and the associated therapeutic burden. Older people, especially those living with frailty, tend to experience lower efficacy of these medications along with a higher risk of adverse drug effects. Explanations for these differences include the physiological effects of frailty, drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions, and reduced medication adherence.

Adverse drug reactions often go unnoticed and can trigger further prescribing. Certain medications have been recognized as potentially inappropriate for people with frailty, yet their use remains common. Evidence suggests that many older people are open to the concept of reducing medications. Deprescribing should be based on a shared decision-making approach. Trials at the time of writing have suggested that it can often be achieved without harm. However, at the time of writing, there are few data to support improvements in hospitalization or mortality rates.

There is some evidence that deprescribing may reduce polypharmacy, improve medication adherence, reduce financial costs, and improve quality of life. In the future, it will be necessary to grow the evidence base and improve public and clinician awareness of the potential benefits of deprescribing. This will require excellent teamwork and communication between all of those involved in the prescribing and administration.

### Writing directly to patients, the time is now-but how [^111qPKdD]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

While writing directly to patients may be viewed as a common-sense approach to improving patient understanding and the clinician–patient relationship, why is the uptake so varied? Using medical language is an important part of our clinical decision-making techniques, taught early on in our training. This technique aims to help us digest and assimilate complex information into memorable storylines or illness scripts. After utilizing medical language for clinical reasoning, we need to make this information accessible to our patients and other healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in their care.

HCPs may worry that clear communication between clinicians could be lost without precise medical terminology and translating this into plainer language may require significant time. We do not advocate for writing multiple letters for different audiences for the same encounter. Instead, we argue that it is possible to meet the needs of all stakeholders without jeopardizing clinical accuracy or placing unmanageable demands on HCPs' time. For instance, a list of medical diagnoses may be provided at the top of the letter, with the main text containing a summary of the consultation that is understandable by the patient. Messages and requested actions for primary care colleagues need to be communicated clearly and included in the same correspondence. Messages to help motivate and engage patients, and remind them of the agreed-upon care plan, should also be included. Such an approach may save administrative time spent correcting artificial intelligence/human-generated typographical errors and save time overall.

### Lorazepam [^115GSPhF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central nervous system (CNS) depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other CNS depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression, interfering with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia and causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness compared to those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). On rare occasions (3/1580), patients were unable to provide personal identification in the operating room upon arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period.

Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580) of cases. One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. Occasionally, patients complained of dizziness, diplopia, and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. On occasion, patients experienced prolonged recovery room stays due to excessive sedation.

### Interventions for improving medication-taking ability and adherence in older adults prescribed multiple medications [^116fQPzM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Older individuals taking multiple medications represent a large and growing portion of the population. Managing such medications can be challenging, particularly for elderly individuals who experience higher rates of comorbidity, as well as physical and cognitive impairments, compared to younger adults. Good medication-taking ability and adherence are necessary to ensure the safe and effective use of medications.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve medication-taking ability and/or medication adherence in older community-dwelling adults prescribed multiple long-term medications.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from inception until June 2019. We also searched grey literature, online trial registries, and reference lists of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cluster-RCTs. Eligible studies tested interventions aimed at improving medication-taking ability and/or medication adherence among people aged ≥ 65 years (or with a mean/median age > 65 years), living in the community or transitioning from hospital back into the community, and taking four or more regular prescription medications (or with a group mean/median of more than four medications). Interventions targeting carers of older people who met these criteria were also included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently reviewed abstracts and full texts.

### Pamelor [^112qhqHR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Antidepressant medications are essential for treating depression and other related illnesses. It is crucial to communicate with a healthcare provider before discontinuing any antidepressant, as stopping them suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms. Patients, along with their families or caregivers, should thoroughly discuss the advantages of treating depression and the potential risks if it is left untreated. It's beneficial to explore all treatment options with a healthcare provider beyond just the use of antidepressants.

Antidepressants may have side effects that need careful consideration. A healthcare provider should always be consulted regarding any side effects associated with the antidepressant prescribed. Additionally, antidepressants may interact with other medications. It is crucial to be aware of all medications being taken, maintaining a comprehensive list to share with a healthcare provider, and to refrain from starting new medications without prior consultation.

For pediatric cases, not all antidepressants are FDA-approved for children. Therefore, it is imperative to have a detailed discussion with a child's healthcare provider to understand the medication's safety and appropriateness.

If you have any questions or need to report side effects, it is advisable to seek medical advice from your doctor. Side effects can also be reported to the FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088.

### Lamictal XR [^116AbVWt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Potential medication errors**: Medication errors involving Lamictal XR have occurred. In particular, the names Lamictal or lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of Lamictal. To reduce the potential for medication errors, write and say Lamictal XR clearly.

Depictions of the Lamictal XR extended-release tablets can be found in the Medication Guide. Each Lamictal XR tablet has a distinct color and white center, and is printed with "Lamictal XR" and the tablet strength. These distinctive features serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors. Lamictal XR is supplied in round, unit-of-use bottles with orange caps containing 30 tablets. The label on the bottle includes a depiction of the tablets that further communicates to patients and pharmacists that the medication is Lamictal XR and the specific tablet strength included in the bottle.

The unit-of-use bottle with a distinctive orange cap and distinctive bottle label features serves to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help to reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are Lamictal XR each time they fill their prescription.

### Patient factors associated with new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in multimorbid US older adults using multiple medications [^111antN2]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The prevalence of older adults is growing in the United States and many countries globally, in large part because of increasing life expectancy. At the same time, the prevalence of multimorbidity, commonly defined as having ≥ 2 chronic conditions, is also on the rise. Accordingly, due to the association between multimorbidity and age, multimorbidity is becoming increasingly common in older adults. Multimorbidity poses one of the greatest challenges to health systems because multimorbid patients often have complex healthcare needs and worse health outcomes, including higher rates of mortality, disability, lower quality of life, and adverse drug events. Another challenge associated with multimorbidity is the increasing number of medications that patients need to take to manage their conditions.

Multimorbid patients often have polypharmacy, i.e. the use of ≥ 5 medications. For instance, 39% of community-dwelling US older adults have polypharmacy. Polypharmacy increases the risk of using potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). PIMs are drugs for which the risk of potential adverse events is greater than the clinical benefits, particularly when there are safer or more effective alternatives recommended for use in older adults. Specifically, PIMs are associated with an increased risk of adverse drug events, falls, and cognitive impairment, as well as greater use of healthcare services (e.g. hospitalizations or emergency department visits) and healthcare costs.

Contributors to the prescribing of PIMs are multifaceted. For example, provider and [Content cut off].

### Patient factors associated with new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in multimorbid US older adults using multiple medications [^113Xspzr]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Several demographic and clinical characteristics are associated with the new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in older patients who were naïve to PIMs (e.g. age of ≥ 85 years, male sex, and number of ambulatory visits). This also indicates that patients with more complex health problems may be at a higher risk of new PIM prescribing. Central nervous system drugs, cardiovascular drugs, anticholinergics, and endocrine drugs were the most commonly prescribed PIMs during the 90-day follow-up period. Due to the potential negative outcomes associated with the use of PIMs, these study findings should inform the creation of interventions to improve coordination of care and reduce the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in older multimorbid adults with polypharmacy.

### An anticholinergic burden score for German prescribers: Score development [^112Zpn4H]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Studies show that over 50% of elderly patients take five or more drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter. A cross-sectional study in Germany revealed that 62% of people aged 65 or older suffer from multimorbidity. This combination of multimorbidity and polypharmacy leads to a higher risk for drug-drug interactions and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Hence, the use of drugs should be considered carefully in geriatric patients. Part of this consideration should be to avoid potentially inappropriate medications.

Drugs with anticholinergic properties are part of inappropriate medications for geriatric patients. The anticholinergic activity of multiple drugs adds up to the so-called anticholinergic burden (ACB). Older patients are more prone to anticholinergic side effects than younger patients. Due to reduced metabolic capacity and slowed elimination in older patients, drugs are eliminated more slowly, in addition to age-related reductions in cholinergic transmissions. The permeability of the blood-brain-barrier increases, which leads to a higher drug concentration in the central nervous system. Central nervous ADRs may especially increase the risk of falls, including blurred vision, confusion, or tremors. More severe anticholinergic side effects include tachyarrhythmia, hallucinations, delirium, and cognitive impairment. Other ADRs like dry mouth, constipation, and urinary retention might reduce the quality of life. Several reviews indicate a higher risk for falls, cognitive decline, and delirium with an increased ACB of older patients.

### Towards an understanding of the burdens of medication management affecting older people: The MEMORABLE realist synthesis [^115gHeVf]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The number and proportion of older people in the United Kingdom population continues to increase, as does multi-morbidity and polypharmacy among them. This reflects global trends. Multi-morbidity, defined as two or more long-term conditions, and polypharmacy, which involves five or more medications or a complex regimen if fewer, are inherently complex and challenging to manage.

For older people, living with multi-morbidity and polypharmacy can be burdensome and may significantly reduce their quality of life. Polypharmacy is associated with an increase in drug-related adverse events and non-adherence, both of which can be costly for health services. Informal or family carers who support older people find that helping them with complex medication management can be an onerous responsibility. Practitioners, many of whom continue to work with models of illness or in services that are tailored to acute treatment, face a growing workload as this population of older people and their family carers require sustained management and support.

Practitioners also encounter additional stresses from time and financial pressures, a decline in workforce numbers, as well as the reorganisation of health and care amid changing financial and political circumstances. Structural and operational problems persist despite the need for extended, coordinated management that supports older people living with multiple long-term conditions. The delivery of older people's health and care appears to be fragmented. NHS England recently launched the National Health Service Long Term Plan.

### Polypharmacy stewardship: A novel approach to tackle a major public health crisis [^116PrNU7]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2023). Low credibility.

With growing global concern regarding medication-related harm, WHO launched a global patient safety challenge, Medication Without Harm, in March 2017. Multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and fragmented health care (i.e. patients attending appointments with multiple physicians in various health-care settings) are key drivers of medication-related harm, which can result in negative functional outcomes, high rates of hospitalization, and excess morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with frailty older than 75 years. Some studies have examined the effect of medication stewardship interventions in older patient cohorts but focused on a narrow spectrum of potentially adverse medication practices, with mixed results. In response to the WHO challenge, we propose the novel concept of broad-spectrum polypharmacy stewardship. This is a coordinated intervention designed to improve the management of multimorbidities, taking into account potentially inappropriate medications, potential prescribing omissions, drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, and prescribing cascades, aligning treatment regimens with the condition, prognosis, and preferences of the individual patient. Although the safety and efficacy of polypharmacy stewardship need to be tested with well-designed clinical trials, we propose that this approach could minimize medication-related harm in older people with multimorbidities exposed to polypharmacy.

### Schizophrenia: Overview and treatment options [^111A7uWq]. P & T (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on schizophrenia:

- **Definition**: Schizophrenia is defined as a complex psychiatric condition characterized by symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and impaired cognitive functions.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of schizophrenia is unclear; however, in utero disorders (such as infections, obstetric complications, and fetal disturbances), along with genetic and environmental factors (including childhood trauma, social isolation, economic adversity, and discrimination), have been implicated.

- **Epidemiology**: The annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the U.S. is 5.1 per 1,000 individuals.

- **Disease course**: Abnormalities in neurotransmission of neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate), particularly dopamine, result in either hyperdopaminergic function in the caudate nucleus or hypodopaminergic function in the frontal lobe. In addition to these, a complex interaction of the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, mesocortical, and tuberoinfundibular pathways leads to negative symptoms, positive symptoms, and cognitive deficits. Detectable physical changes in brain tissue are also observed.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: After a 10-year follow-up, 80% of schizophrenic patients require readmission after their first discharge. Non-adherence to antipsychotic medication in the first year is associated with a 64% relapse rate, while adherence during the first year is associated with a 27% relapse rate.

### Ramelteon [^116dWteF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions**: Inform patients that severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with ramelteon. Describe the relevant signs/symptoms and advise seeking immediate medical attention if any such occurrences happen.

- **Sleep-driving and other complex behaviors**: There have been reports of individuals getting out of bed after taking a sleep medication and driving their cars while not fully awake, often with no memory of the event. If a patient experiences such an episode, it should be reported to their doctor immediately, as "sleep-driving" can be dangerous. This behavior is more likely to occur when sleep medications are taken with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants. Other complex behaviors, such as preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex, have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sleep medication. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.

- **Endocrine effects**: Patients should consult their healthcare providers if they experience cessation of menses or galactorrhea in females, decreased libido, or problems with fertility. Describe the relevant signs/symptoms and advise seeking medical attention if any such occurrences happen.

- **Administration instructions**: Patients should be advised to take ramelteon tablets within 30 minutes prior to going to bed and should confine their activities to those necessary to prepare for sleep.

### AVN-101: A multi-target drug candidate for the treatment of CNS disorders [^115ZgnLb]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

The lack of efficacy of many new highly selective and specific drug candidates in treating diseases with poorly understood or complex etiology, such as many central nervous system (CNS) diseases, has encouraged the development of multi-modal (multi-targeted) drugs. This manuscript describes the molecular pharmacology, in vitro ADME, pharmacokinetics in animals and humans (part of the Phase I clinical studies), bio-distribution, bioavailability, in vivo efficacy, and safety profile of the multimodal drug candidate, AVN-101.

We have developed a next-generation drug candidate with a multi-targeted mechanism of action to treat CNS disorders. AVN-101 is a very potent 5-HT 7 receptor antagonist (Ki = 153 pM), with slightly lesser potency toward 5-HT 6, 5-HT 2A, and 5HT-2C receptors (Ki = 1.2–2.0 nM). AVN-101 also exhibits a rather high affinity toward histamine H1 (Ki = 0.58 nM) and adrenergic α2A, α2B, and α2C (Ki = 0.41–3.6 nM) receptors.

AVN-101 shows good oral bioavailability and facilitated brain-blood barrier permeability, low toxicity, and reasonable efficacy in animal models of CNS diseases. The Phase I clinical study indicates that AVN-101 is well tolerated when taken orally at doses of up to 20 mg daily. It does not dramatically influence plasma and urine biochemistry, nor does it prolong the QT ECG interval, thus indicating low safety concerns. The primary therapeutic area for AVN-101 to be tested in clinical trials would be Alzheimer's disease. However, due to its anxiolytic and anti-depressive activities, there is a strong rationale for it to also be explored in other therapeutic areas.

### Association between polypharmacy and dementia - A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173dRd5]. Aging & Mental Health (2019). Low credibility.

The association between polypharmacy and dementia is controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to summarize existing literature concerning the association between polypharmacy and dementia.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching the EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and International Pharmaceutical Abstract databases using terms related to polypharmacy and dementia. A meta-analysis was performed using random effect models.

- **Results**: Seven studies were included in this meta-analysis. The included studies were of medium to high quality with a potential for publication bias. A strong association between polypharmacy and dementia was found (pooled adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.30 (95% CI: 1.16–1.46), I² = 68%). Excessive polypharmacy was also strongly associated with dementia (pooled aRR = 1.52 (95% CI: 1.39–1.67), I² = 24%). Pooled risk estimates from this meta-analysis showed that polypharmacy was associated with dementia. Although the causality of the relationship cannot be concluded from this analysis, the finding encourages the use of multidimensional assessment tools for dementia that include the number of medications as a component.

### Rapid fire: Polypharmacy in the geriatric patient [^115BpJ2Z]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). High credibility.

Increasing prescription drug use trends in the United States affect patients across all ages, but especially the geriatric population. As patients age, they are at an increased risk for adverse events due to natural changes in body composition and organ function, increased sensitivity to medications, and a higher chance of adverse events from drug-drug interactions and polypharmacy. Falls are common and can increase morbidity and mortality in this group.

To mitigate falls, it is imperative to have a comprehensive approach to screening home medication lists. One should be aware of and avoid high-risk medications and deprescribe agents that are potentially inappropriate for this patient population.

### Prevalence and factors associated with polypharmacy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1153pQV7]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Identifying any polypharmacy is the first step towards assessing whether polypharmacy is inappropriate. Several strategies can be employed to reduce inappropriate prescribing or inappropriate polypharmacy. Medication review by pharmacists, physicians, or multidisciplinary teams, education and training, and the use of screening tools to identify potentially inappropriate prescribing, such as the Screening Tool of Older Persons' Potentially Inappropriate Prescription (STOPP), have all been found to be effective for reducing polypharmacy in various populations.

Digital technologies, for example, automatically generated alerts in electronic prescribing programs, have shown promising results in lowering polypharmacy in various settings but have not been widely adopted or investigated. Most of these studies focus on interventions to reduce polypharmacy in settings of greatest concern, such as among older adults or those in residential care settings. However, interventions to reduce polypharmacy vary widely, and the most effective aspects of interventions are still unclear.

Deprescribing does not appear to increase adverse outcomes, but whether reducing polypharmacy results in improved outcomes is not as clear. Studies incorporating clinical outcomes have had mixed findings on the effects of deprescribing on the quality of life, falls, disease-specific outcomes, and hospitalizations. Several reviews of interventions to reduce polypharmacy found no effect on all-cause mortality.

Polypharmacy is a complex issue and may differ in appropriateness and implications for medically complex individuals.

### Developing a measure of polypharmacy appropriateness in primary care: Systematic review and expert consensus study [^115GsL9K]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Use of multiple medications in a single individual (polypharmacy) is a global phenomenon, creating new challenges for many health services, driven by increasing levels of multimorbidity and a culture of single-condition guideline-based prescribing.

Polypharmacy is associated with several undesirable consequences. However, we have previously demonstrated that the association between polypharmacy and adverse outcomes is attenuated in the most multimorbid individuals. This suggests that overly simplistic analyses of polypharmacy, relating simple medication counts to adverse outcomes, may be misleading. Polypharmacy is typically measured using arbitrary numeric thresholds, but these fail to capture medication appropriateness; therefore, more sophisticated approaches accounting for clinical context are required.

A number of prescribing indicators that assess medication appropriateness are considered to have face validity and may have value in improving quality and reducing adverse outcomes. However, such indicators generally do not account for multiple drug use and do not measure polypharmacy per se. In addition, explicit 'drug specific' indicators (e.g. Beers criteria) do not apply to all patients, and implicit measures (e.g. the Medication Appropriateness Index) require time-consuming input from an experienced clinician.

There is therefore a need to develop a valid and reliable means of measuring polypharmacy that takes account of clinical appropriateness. Further, a framing of polypharmacy appropriateness (rather than appropriate or inappropriate polypharmacy) is required.

### Polypharmacy in children and young people with life-limiting conditions from 2000 to 2015: A repeated cross-sectional study in England [^116fxWoQ]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2022). Low credibility.

Polypharmacy is often appropriate for children with life-limiting conditions. However, it is associated with an increase in hospitalizations, inappropriate prescribing, and can affect the quality of life for children and their families as they manage complex medication schedules. Despite this, little is known about polypharmacy in this population.

- **Objective**: To describe the prevalence and patterns of polypharmacy in children with a life-limiting condition in a nationally representative cohort in England.

- **Methods**: This observational study included children (aged 0–19 years) with a life-limiting condition in a national database from 2000 to 2015. Common definitions of polypharmacy were used to determine prevalence each year based on unique and regular medications. Hierarchical regression analyses explored factors associated with polypharmacy.

- **Results**: Data on 15,829 individuals were included. Each year, 27%-39% of children were prescribed ≥ 5 unique medications, and 8%-12% were prescribed ≥ 10. Children with respiratory (OR 7.6, 95%CI 6.4–9.0), neurological (OR 2.8, 95%CI 2.4–3.2), or metabolic (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.7–2.8) conditions were more likely than those with a congenital condition to experience polypharmacy. Factors associated with higher prevalence included increasing age, diagnosis with a life-limiting condition under one year of age, having > 1 life-limiting or chronic condition, and living in areas of higher deprivation.

- **Conclusion**: Children with life-limiting conditions have a high prevalence of polypharmacy, with certain children at greater risk.

### Lyrica CR [^114bA4T4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Inform patients about the risk of respiratory depression, especially in those using concomitant central nervous system (CNS) depressants, such as opioid analgesics, or in those with underlying respiratory impairment. Educate patients on recognizing respiratory depression and advise them to seek medical attention immediately if it occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Inform patients that Lyrica CR may cause dizziness, somnolence, blurred vision, and other CNS signs and symptoms. Advise them not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in hazardous activities until they have gained sufficient experience with Lyrica CR to determine whether it adversely affects their mental, visual, and/or motor performance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **CNS depressants**: Inform patients who require concomitant treatment with CNS depressants, such as opiates or benzodiazepines, that they may experience additive CNS side effects like respiratory depression, somnolence, and dizziness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Advise patients to avoid consuming alcohol while taking Lyrica CR, as it may potentiate the impairment of motor skills and sedating effects of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7)].
