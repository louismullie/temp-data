B. Sri Lakshmi
C. Kali
D. Mahavira

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which goddess is worshipped during the festival of Divali (Diwali). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Diwali represents culturally and religiously. Then, I should verify which deity is most centrally associated with Diwali worship. Next, I will examine the provided references for any direct mentions of Diwali and its goddess. After that, I should consider the alternative options (Durga, Kali, Mahavira) and whether they fit the Diwali context. Finally, I will synthesize a confident answer and note any limitations in the supplied sources.

> Let me first confirm the cultural context. Diwali is the Hindu festival of lights, typically celebrated with lamps and lights, and it is strongly associated with prosperity and auspiciousness; this aligns with worship of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, rather than with deities of power or destruction like Durga or Kali, or with non-Hindu figures like Mahavira [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the direct evidence in the provided materials. I initially thought none of the references explicitly name Lakshmi in relation to Diwali, but hold on, I should double-check. On closer inspection, a communications psychology article discussing human–light interactions explicitly lists Diwali among festivities where light plays a significant religious role, which supports the traditional association of Diwali with light, prosperity, and by extension Lakshmi worship, even if Lakshmi is not named outright in that source [^03d25e20].

> I need to check the alternatives carefully. Durga and Kali are major Hindu goddesses, but they are not the primary deities of Diwali; Durga is central to Navaratri/Durga Puja, and Kali to Kali Puja, which often coincides with Diwali in some regions but remains a distinct observance. Mahavira, meanwhile, is a Jain Tirthankara, not a Hindu goddess, so he does not fit the question of which goddess is worshipped during Diwali. Thus, these options do not match the core Diwali deity association [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize. Given the cultural logic of Diwali as a festival of lights and prosperity, and the partial but supportive reference linking Diwali to light-centric religious practice, the most consistent and widely accepted answer is Sri Lakshmi. The other choices either belong to different festivals or to a different religious tradition altogether, so they should be excluded [^notfound].

> Final answer: B. Sri Lakshmi.

---

The correct answer is **B. Sri Lakshmi**. Diwali is primarily a Hindu festival of lights centered on worshipping **Lakshmi**, the goddess of wealth, prosperity, and fortune [^notfound]. Families perform Lakshmi Puja on the main night of Diwali to invite her blessings for abundance and well-being. While other deities may be honored regionally, Lakshmi is the principal goddess of Diwali.

## Significance of goddess Lakshmi in Diwali

Lakshmi is the Hindu goddess of wealth, prosperity, fortune, and abundance. During Diwali, devotees worship her to seek **blessings for financial prosperity, success, and overall well-being**. The festival marks her return to Earth, and devotees believe that worshipping her during Diwali brings good fortune and prosperity to their homes and businesses.

---

## Rituals and traditions associated with Lakshmi worship during Diwali

Several rituals and traditions are associated with Lakshmi worship during Diwali:

- **Lakshmi Puja**: On the main night of Diwali, families perform Lakshmi Puja, offering prayers, flowers, sweets, and incense to the goddess. Homes and businesses are cleaned and decorated to welcome her.

- **Lighting of diyas (lamps)**: Lighting oil lamps and candles is a significant tradition during Diwali, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. It is believed that Lakshmi is attracted to light and cleanliness.

- **Rangoli**: Colorful rangoli designs are created at the entrance of homes to welcome Lakshmi and bring good luck.

- **Offering of sweets and fruits**: Devotees offer sweets, fruits, and other delicacies to Lakshmi as a gesture of gratitude and devotion.

---

## Regional variations in Lakshmi worship during Diwali

While Lakshmi is the primary goddess worshipped during Diwali, regional variations exist in different parts of India:

- **North India**: In North India, Lakshmi is worshipped alongside Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, to ensure prosperity and success.

- **South India**: In South India, Lakshmi is worshipped as the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and special prayers are offered to her.

- **West India**: In Gujarat and Maharashtra, Lakshmi worship is accompanied by the celebration of the new year, with devotees seeking her blessings for a prosperous year ahead.

## Conclusion

Diwali is primarily associated with the worship of **goddess Lakshmi**, the Hindu goddess of wealth, prosperity, and fortune. Devotees worship her to seek blessings for financial prosperity, success, and overall well-being. The festival is marked by various rituals and traditions, including Lakshmi Puja, lighting of diyas, and creating rangoli designs. While regional variations exist, Lakshmi remains the central figure of worship during Diwali.

The arrival of the monsoon is celebrated as a festival in Tamil Nadu, the southern part of India. The rain is believed to bring prosperity to the people whose livelihood is mainly dependent on agriculture. Farmers celebrate the onset of the monsoon as a gesture of gratitude, looking for an abundant yield by offering prayers at riverbanks, lakes, and ponds to become full by the rains. These are the main sources of water during the dry season. People celebrate by lighting lamps, praying to their deities, offering flowers, and floating lamps to the river goddess. The association of this ritual with prosperity is common, and the history of this practice dates back to ancient times. These festivals are commonly noticed in rural areas and villages situated on riverbanks, which is exceptional because it brings families, friends, and people together.

### Culture and hallucinations: overview and future directions [^94a1866b]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Typically, such sensory experiences of the immaterial are understood as contacts with gods, spirits, or the dead. While many such experiences never enter the historical record, others take on broad public meaning. Lourdesbecame a major healing shrine because a young girl, Bernadette Soubirous, reported that she saw the Virgin Mary there, and many people came to believe that indeed she had. The shrines of Fatima and Medjugore similarly draw millions of worshippers who believe that the Virgin appeared to specific individuals so that they saw her with their eyes and who come to worship and request favor from the Virgin at a place where her immaterial body was perceived with the physical human senses.

To become available as plausible experiences of the divine, such hallucinations must conform to local cultural expectations. The local population at Lourdes, expected Mary to act like a benign mother; had Bernadette reported seeing the blindingly powerful figure Mary was understood to be toward the end of the Middle Ages, the 19th-century French population would probably not have believed that she had seen the Virgin. At the same time, in each vision locale, a kind of fluid and evolving microculture develops, in which some features partake of a broader pattern — known through literature, visual media, and shared pilgrims — but others are idiosyncratic and innovative. At Lourdes, Bernadette behaved oddly, scratching up the earth to find the spring that would later become the focal point of pilgrimage. Tavessimilarly demonstrates that as the 19th century progressed, the capacity to hear God or the dead speak became more acceptable for ordinary Christians as spiritualism became a popular movement and began to change the way people thought about the human psyche. The same holds true in the way people become identified as religious experts. For example, the shaman-to-be usually must report certain kinds of phenomena that are understood by his or her broader social world to be the appropriate signs of the spirit. For example, among an Amazonian people called the Bororo, the novice shaman is identified when he has a dream of soaring high above the earth, like a vulture, and seeing the fiery cloud of smoke that indicates an attacking illness. Then, he must see a stone or anthill move, and he must hear a voice, when alone in the forest, that asks him where he is going.

### Kumbh mela religious gathering as a massive superspreading event: potential culprit for the exponential surge of COVID-19 cases in India [^f1d335cf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the grim state of the country before the onset of the event, there had been no significant talks or measures as to halt or limit the Kumbh Mela celebration, which became a cause for global concern. Critics attributed the reluctance of the Indian Prime Minister to cancel the mass gathering to the possible backlash from Hindu religious leaders since priests, seers, and ascetics play a significant role in gathering Hindu votes during elections. Uttarakhand's former chief minister stated that he had initially planned to limit the celebration into a symbolic event as public health experts initially warned of new COVID-19 variants and the continued threat of the disease. However, this plan did not materialize as he was replaced by a new chief minister days before the festival who remarked that the blessings of Ma Ganga or the river goddess would protect them from the virus.

As the second wave continues to ravage across India, several countries around the world have lent their help and support by sending out vaccines, drugs, oxygen concentrators, ventilators, and other necessary resources despite the shortage and increasing demand of medicines and hospital supplies globally. The Indian Prime Minister stated that oxygen will also be transported to hospitals from reserves that are under the military. An operation named "Co-jeet" was recently launched by the armed forces to aid the inoculation drive and to strengthen the anti-COVID-19 action plan by providing health-based resources to various states, which include transporting oxygen and providing medical assistance. The government has also been constantly pressing the public to get vaccinated because only 19% of its population received at least a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine and just 7% are fully inoculated as of July 31, 2021. Unlike other countries, India is still far from achieving herd immunity because of the slow vaccination rollout despite being the largest source of COVID-19 vaccines in the world. In addition, the government also urged its people to exercise extreme caution because of the surfeit of infections that continues to hit India. Complacency of the people has also further aggravated the problem at hand.

This paper reviews burns that occur because of specific social habits and traditions; religious beliefs and activities; social events and festivals; and traditional medical practices. A literature review did not reveal any article that specifically reviews such burns. These injuries are not only interesting (being nation-specific) but are also important with regards to implementation of preventive measures in various countries around the world.

### "As the dew is dried up by the morning sun, so are mankind's sins at the sight of himalaya" [^50198f1f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Early paubhas were representations of religious traditions. To promote meditation, they were hung in private altars, temples, and monasteries or were carried by monks in ceremonial processions. They were rectangular, mostly uniform in size and, as they were intended for three-dimensional presentation, free of rigid frames or easels. Content, color, and proportion followed prescribed rules. Floral borders were common as was brilliant red. A main deity heavy with symbolic elements occupied the center of the composition and was surrounded by smaller less symbolic figures. The intent of the artist was iconography that would ease the path toward enlightenment. Painters for the most part remained anonymous.

Festival Banner on this month's cover of Emerging Infectious Diseases is a scroll painting in the paubha tradition. It was likely paraded in one of the many festivals popular in Nepal to celebrate Hindu or Buddhist gods or goddesses, honor relatives, or mark the beginning or end of the agricultural cycle. The banner was part of a set depicting the Seven Mothers, important shaktis (feminine energies) motivating and empowering male Hindu gods. This banner shows Vaishnavi, the shakti consort of Vishnu. Also known as Adh Kanwari (eternal virgin), she attained great powers through meditation and prayer. Shaded by a multiheaded cobra hood, she traveled through the universe on the back of a mythical water monster (makara).

### Kumbh mela religious gathering as a massive superspreading event: potential culprit for the exponential surge of COVID-19 cases in India [^dc019b44]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

India, a predominantly Hindu country that occupies the greater part of South Asia, recently celebrated the Kumbh Mela or the "festival of pitcher", a very significant religious gathering of millions of Hindu devotees and sages at the country's riverbanks on April 1 to April 30, 2021, despite the threat of exponential surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the country. Being the second most populous country in the world with roughly one-sixth of the world's population, India also became the second most affected country during the COVID-19 pandemic on April 12, 2021, while the country was in the middle of a month-long religious celebration. As of July 31, 2021, there are already 31,654,584 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India, with 424,384 deaths.

This grand religious gathering is usually celebrated on certain auspicious days in the Hindu calendar, which typically commences in January. However, because of the pandemic, the Indian government opted to postpone the event to April and shorten the festival duration to only 30 days from the usual, which is 100 days or more. It was also reported that weeks before the festival started, an impending second wave of COVID-19 cases was overtaking India and appeals to cancel the festival began circulating in the country. However, this was shut down by the government as the Prime Minister continued inviting devotees and assured them that it was clean and safe. As such, an overwhelming number of devotees, paying no visible observance to COVID-19 protocols, attended the religious gathering. Although the festival was postponed to a later date and shortened to 1 month, the Kumbh Mela still attracted millions of Hindu pilgrims across the country because of its religious significance and cultural traditions.

### Contextualizing ancient texts with generative neural networks [^e6388aaa]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Aeneas' performance across the three epigraphic tasks for this inscription effectively demonstrates its receptiveness to distinctive geographical, chronological, linguistic, and cultural features (Extended Data Fig. 2). Aeneas' dating average for this altar is 214, which is well within the 10-year range the model is trained on, and its top-3 geographical attributions are Germania superior (correct), Germania inferior and Pannonia superior. Looking at Aeneas' attribution saliency maps, there is a clear focus on the historically specific personal names of two consuls serving that particular year (Gentiano et Basso cosulibus) and the worshipped goddesses (Deab(us) Aufan(iabus)) whose cult is particularly well-attested in the regions identified by Aeneas. The saliency map of the image of this inscription also shows interesting results, highlighting a focus on the altar's shape, layout and architectural-iconographical elements. This is a sound choice: the beneficiarii altars tend to have standardized designs (this particular altar corresponds to type D described by Frenzin CSIR De II 4). Finally, wishing to test Aeneas' capacity to restore arbitrary text lengths, we artificially damaged 8 characters (' loci pro '): Aeneas' top-5 predictions for this unknown character restoration sequence are all contextually and linguistically accurate, with its first restoration hypothesis (pro) being the more commonly attested version of the formula ' Tutelae pro salute ', while the second hypothesis captures the more uncommon version of the formula ' Tutelae loci pro salute ' — the correct restoration for this inscription.

### Behavioural determinants of physiologically-relevant light exposure [^03d25e20]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Light also plays a significant part in religion or cultural practices, reflected in festivities such as celebration of the summer solstice, Saint Lucy's Day in Scandinavia, or the festival of Diwali in Hinduism. Other practices are weather magic and sun worship, use of candles and light in religious ceremonies, or orientation of religious buildings and temples towards the sun. Some cultures also honour solar deities (e.g. Helios in Greek mythology, Amun Ra in ancient Egypt, Apollo in Roman times, Yarhibol in Mesopotamia).

On the other hand, the absence of light — darkness — also influence spatio-temporal behaviours, for example, in public spaces like squares or footpaths (e.g. changed perception of safety and reassurance, reduced stationary activities, decreased use of public spaces after sunset) –.

In brief, humans have long been using light to achieve or meet specific needs, have interacted with light sources (electric, sunlight, candles, fires) and crafted and manipulated light. The circadian neuroscience field has yet to appreciate this notion and move beyond a simple input-output relationship.

Box 1 Human-light interactions as affordances

Human interactions with light can also be thought of as affordances, a concept introduced by psychologist James J. Gibson in the 1970s as part of his ecological approach to perception. Affordances refer to the potential actions or uses that an object (e.g. the light switch), environment, or stimulus (e.g. the light environment, the sun) offers to an individual based on their perception and understanding of its properties to meet certain needs. The concept emphasises the perception-action loop (e.g. the light switch offers the option to turn on, dim or turn off the light at different times for different purposes), highlighting how individuals perceive and understand the world based on their own abilities (e.g. understanding that a switch controls/manipulates light), individual and cultural experiences (attitudes towards light), and context and location (e.g. living outdoors without electricity does not provide the affordances of a light switch; see also Fig. 3).

### Does god make it real? Children's belief in religious stories from the judeo-christian tradition [^4757cbbb]. Child Development (2011). Low credibility.

Four- to 6-year-old children (N = 131) heard religious or nonreligious stories and were questioned about their belief in the reality of the story characters and events. Children had low to moderate levels of belief in the characters and events. Children in the religious story condition had higher levels of belief in the reality of the characters and events than did children in the nonreligious condition; this relation strengthened with age. Children who used God as an explanation for the events showed higher levels of belief in the factuality of those events. Story familiarity and family religiosity also affected children's responses. The authors conclude that God's involvement in a story influences children's belief in the reality of the characters and events in that story.

### Religiosity and spirituality development: an accelerated longitudinal design [^184bf8c4]. The Gerontologist (2024). Medium credibility.

It is well accepted that older individuals report greater religiosity and spirituality (R/S) than younger individuals, although this conclusion is complicated by the distinct, multidimensional nature of R/S. Indeed, religiosity entails various convictions, rituals, and lifestyles that are shared within congregations that are seeking relationships with divine beings, whereas spirituality refers to individualized convictions, rituals, and lifestyles that support the formation and maintenance of relationships with divine beings. Religious individuals hold beliefs and live out values that are in accordance with their specific doctrines, and often engage in several communal and independent religious practices as a result. Spiritual individuals feel a divine presence in their lives, either through major life events or everyday experiences, and may or may not seek understanding of such experiences in the context of organized religiosity. Whether individuals identify as religious, spiritual, or both, however, they may engage in various forms of religious/spiritual coping as they navigate daily hardships.

### The circumcision of jesus christ [^aa451aee]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We study the controversies manifested in religious writings, art, sculpture and music as well as the theological disputes surrounding the circumcision of Jesus Christ.

Materials and Methods

Data are derived from relevant historical and theological articles.

Results

Jesus Christ was circumcised as a Jew on the 8th day after his birth. Until 1960 the Catholic church celebrated the day as Circumcision Day. In medieval times the holy foreskin was worshipped in many European churches.

Conclusions

Christianity never condoned the ritual of circumcision and established the sacrament of baptism in its place.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^da8f8504]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Validity issues and robustness checks

In what follows, we describe how we have addressed possible validity issues.
In our analyses, we have assumed that the cohort differences with younger cohorts being less religious than older cohorts are caused by cohort effects and not life-cycle effects. This assumption may be criticized. We acknowledge that the evidence corroborating the assumption is stronger for western than for non-western countries. However, proponents of a life-cycle argument would have to explain why - if their assumptions were correct - in very religious countries, people would have more participation as they age, in medium religious countries, people would have more participation, importance, and belonging as they get older, and in very secular countries, the population would increase affiliation as it ages. It seems unlikely that someone would try to make such an argument.
Another issue for our analysis concerns measurement invariance. Indicators of religiosity may be non-comparable across countries since the actions, beliefs and values measured mean something different in different religions. In congregational religions such as Christianity or Islam religionists gather for public rituals in a community or congregation and often see their identity strongly in terms of this community. In non-congregational religions such as Shinto, Buddhism or Hinduism, the emphasis lies more on individual practice and public rituals are seen as beneficial, but not necessary. Public rituals are not held in a regularly occurring religious service of a group (or congregation); rather, individuals and families seek out temples and shrines when they feel the need to do so. There is often no felt belonging to an imagined large confessional group, but there may be the strong feeling of belonging to an ethnic or caste group; furthermore, individuals and especially families have links to specific temples or shrines; however, they may also worship at other places and to gods, buddhas, or kamis of different religious traditions. –. The effect may then be that, assuming a real latent level of religiosity, the indicator over- or underestimates religiosity. We address the problem by analyzing cohort differences, comparing an older and a younger cohort in every country. This controls for possible bias. The problem remains, however, when we construct our measure of country secularity where biased estimators may bias the positioning of the countries. To address this point, we conduct robustness tests with different ways of constructing country secularity (Supplementary Methods 7). On the subject of measurement invariance, our model makes an additional point. Studies that test measurement invariance for religiosity items over a large number of countries and that assume all countries to be "at the same time" may get it wrong. They may conclude that there is measurement invariance, while, in fact, countries are at different points in time on the secular transition and therefore must show different correlational structures.
An important question is the choice of indicators of religiosity. What we measure with "importance of religion in one's life" is an indicator for personal religiosity in a very broad sense including religious beliefs and personal practices such as prayer. These different elements, and especially belief variables vary strongly across different religious and cultural areas. We have therefore chosen to use only one indicator both in the Pew study and the WVS/EVS data, whose meaning seems to be relatively well comparable across cultures and who clearly taps personal religiosity. As a robustness check, we investigate how well our results hold when measuring the "importance" dimension in two other ways: (a) with a composite measure of importance of religion and prayer; and (b) with a composite measure of importance of religion, importance of god, belief in god, and self-description as a religious person (Supplementary Methods 8).
We do not use a measure of modernization (e.g. the HDI index) as an independent variable, since we do not seek to causally explain secularization. Neither do we use such an indicator as a control, since we do not expect the secular transition to happen independently of modernization. Controlling for modernization (e.g. with an indicator such as the HDI) would then introduce bias rather than reduce it.
We model our three dependent variables using a sigmoid (inverse logit) function. We chose the logit function due to its intuitive interpretability compared to alternative link functions. However, one might question whether the results would differ under alternative specifications. A good alternative candidate would be the probit function (non-parametric functions are not feasible because of the relatively small number of countries). In Supplementary Methods 9 we show graphically that results look very similar with probit. AIC measures of logit and probit are also very close.
Our results are furthermore robust with respect to (a) varying the cut point with respect to cohorts; (b) varying the cut points with respect to attendance and importance of religion; (c) including or excluding the controls; including or excluding imputed values; including or excluding the weights in WVS/EVS data. (Supplementary Methods 10, 11, 12).

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^f029db6b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Dependent variables

The dependent variable in the single cross-sectional analyses is the percentage difference of religiosity between "older" (40 +) and "younger" (under 40) individuals. We calculate this difference separately with the dichotomous religiosity indicators weekly ritual attendance (or not), seeing religion as very important in one's life (or not), and identifying with a religion (or not). Distinguishing only two age-cohorts - "younger" and "older" - permits illustrating broad trends in a simple way. We conduct robustness checks to show that different thresholds do not change results substantively.

Religious participation was measured, in the Pew surveys, with slightly different wordings for different religions. The general formulation for non-Muslim populations was "Aside from weddings and funerals how often do you attend religious services… more than once a week, once a week, once or twice a month, a few times a year, seldom, or never?" In the East Asia survey, which included Vietnam (a country not usually considered part of this geographic region), the most prevalent religions, including Buddhism, do not emphasize weekly communal worship to the degree that is common in Abrahamic religions. Respondents in these countries were asked separate questions about whether they generally go to a shrine, temple, church, or monastery. If respondents in East Asia said "yes" to at least one of these measures, we classify them as regular participants in religious rituals. For Jews, the beginning of the question was phrased as: "Aside from special occasions like weddings, funerals and bar mitzvahs, how often do you attend Jewish religious services at a synagogue, temple, minyan or Havurah". For Muslims, one of the slightly differing wordings was: "On average, how often do you attend the mosque for salah? More than once a week, once a week for Friday afternoon Prayer, once or twice a month, a few times a year, especially for Eid, seldom or never?". In the WVS/EVS, religious attendance was measured with the question "How often do you attend religious services?". The response options were "more than once a week", "once a week", "once a month", "only on special holy days", "once a year", "less often", "never/practically never".

### A qualitative study about the gendered experiences of motherhood and perinatal mortality in mountain villages of Nepal: implications for improving perinatal survival [^74863fd0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Talking to parents in favour of the wife is considered the sign of a weak man, a weak son who is teased as a henpecked husband. In a post interview chat, it was evident that this young father felt that he would be mocked by his neighbours and other men in the village if he started listening to his wife and supporting her in her day-to-day work.

A few women were neglected and verbally abused by their husbands and mothers-in-law after losing their babies, so they started living with their maternal family:

It is very sad. Neither my husband nor my mother-in-law treats me well. He frequently shouted at me, and beat me. I don't feel safe to go there. I am staying with my mother. I don't know when I could return to my in-law's home. (16 year-old mother)

It was noted that these women accept the indifference and neglect from their husbands and mothers-in-law as their fate (Bhagya).

3. **Perception of childbirth as a polluted event**: Birth in Gotha (cowshed), and giving birth alone

The time around childbirth and after birth up to three weeks is perceived as a polluted period, locally called Juthosutka. During this time women are strictly forbidden to worship their God (Dewata), and must avoid observing festivals and rituals. Such a perception of pollution and giving birth in Gotha is considered culturally safe in the villages at a time when policies discuss the need for skilled attendance and institutional births as strategies to address poor quality of care and high perinatal mortality. Gotha refers to the ground floor of a house where the family keeps cattle, goats, sheep and chicken. If the Gotha has any spare space, they also store firewood, grass and fodder. Women give birth in a corner of the Gotha, usually a short distance from the cattle. Some houses have a separate room on the ground floor, which they normally use for storing grass and firewood for the rainy season. It normally has only one entrance, little ventilation, and often no doors. The floor is usually damp and rough, and very cold in winter. Women give birth on old and worn-out dirty rugs, or they use dry straw on the floor.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^3ba510b2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

That having been said, African countries are still very religious and there is no African country approaching the middle or the end of the secular transition. Thus, only the future can tell whether they will take the third step, as predicted by our model. All European countries are in medium or later stages of the secular transition; for these countries, both our statistical and historical evidence do indeed suggest a P-I-B trajectory. In these countries, participation started to drop in the 19th century, the drop in finding religion important followed subsequently, and the drop in religious belonging started in the 1960s.

Religious decline in countries with different historical religions

The secular transition and the P-I-B sequence manifest in countries with traditionally Christian, Buddhist/Hindu, and Muslim backgrounds, although traditionally Muslim countries only exhibit the first two stages (P-I) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Methods 2). In 69% of the world's countries and territories, Christians are the largest religious group. Accordingly, most countries in our datasets are traditionally Christian, and these countries span the range of the secular transition. Here, the P-I-B sequence is most clearly visible. While our dataset includes fewer traditionally Buddhist and Hindu countries, the P-I-B sequence remains discernible. We acknowledge that participation in acts of worship at temples within Asian religions differs from participation in congregational religions. For this reason, we employed a specialized measure tailored to East Asian societies in order to accurately assess participation in that region (see the methods section under dependent variables below). Notably, when using data specifically designed to measure participation at Buddhist sites, we observe the same age-related patterns in attendance that are evident in religions emphasizing congregational worship. This is particularly remarkable given that some scholars have argued that concepts such as participation or belonging are not or only with difficulty applicable to non-congregational Asian religions such as Buddhism or Hinduism –.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^6df4d979]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Religiosity tends to decline across generations. However, religious decline is more pronounced in some countries and the diminishing aspects of religion vary by context. To explain such variation, we extend the general secular transition model, which proposes that countries undergo a similar process of secularization beginning at different points in time. We explain that secular transition happens in three steps: first, public ritual participation declines; second, the importance of religion to individuals declines; and third, people shed religious affiliation. We test this model using datasets from surveys in 111 countries (Pew Research Center), 58 countries (World Values Survey and European Values Study (WVS/EVS)), and a subset of 17 countries measured in at least five WVS/EVS waves. We show the model fits countries with Christian, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist pluralities. While Eastern post-Soviet countries deviate from this pattern, traditionally Muslim countries appear to follow its early stages. However, we recommend caution in interpreting longitudinal claims, due to limited data.

### Belief in divine healing can be a barrier to antiretroviral therapy adherence in Uganda [^d6799a44]. AIDS (2007). Low credibility.

Although recent data suggest high levels of adherence to expanding antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes in resource-limited settings, the culture-specific barriers to adherence are poorly understood. In a prospective observational study, we found that 1.2% of patients discontinued ART because of a belief in spiritual healing. Spiritual beliefs should be an important part of ART adherence counselling in resource-limited settings, requiring close collaboration between HIV care programmes and religious leaders to identify common goals and ensure successful treatment.

### The impact of mass gatherings and events on emergency department admissions: a systematic literature review [^0824b126]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mass gatherings, including major sporting events, music festivals, and other large gatherings, are integral to cultural and social life but can significantly impact local healthcare services. Understanding the effect of these events on emergency department (ED) admissions is crucial for effective resource planning and public health preparedness.

Objectives

This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to investigate the influence of mass gatherings on ED admissions, focusing on the overall and category-specific ED metrics associated with these events.

Methods

Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive database search spanning 2012–2024 using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, ProQuest, Scopus, Springer, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct. We identified 14 relevant studies on mass gatherings and ED presentations from various countries. BERT natural language processing and manual screening were used to achieve over 90% efficiency in excluding irrelevant articles.

Results

Fourteen studies show ED visits vary during mass gatherings: some events see 7.5–37% drops, while others, especially music festivals and religious gatherings, reach spikes up to 83% (during Umrah). Substance-related cases rise (up to 10%), trauma accounts for up to 34%, and surges often occur 4–12 hours postevent. Music festivals feature more substance-related cases, while religious gatherings see higher medical and respiratory admissions.

Conclusions

The findings indicate varying impacts on ED utilization during mass gatherings, with some events showing fewer overall visits and others reporting spikes, particularly in trauma and substance-related cases. The review highlights the need for postevent surge preparedness, advocating coordinated planning with organizers and targeted public health interventions.

### Effect of a doctor working during the festive period on population health: natural experiment using 60 years ofepisodes (the TARDIS study) [^2236eef3]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To examine the effect of a (fictional) doctor working during the festive period on population health.

Design

Natural experiment.

Setting

England, Wales, and the UK.

Main Outcome Measures

Age standardised annual mortality rates in England, Wales, and the UK from 1963, when the BBC first broadcast Doctor Who, a fictional programme with a character called the Doctor who fights villains and intervenes to save others while travelling through space and time. Mortality rates were modelled in a time series analysis accounting for non-linear trends over time, and associations were estimated in relation to a new Doctor Who episode broadcast during the previous festive period, 24 December to 1 January. An interrupted time series analysis modelled the shift in mortality rates from 2005, when festive episodes of Doctor Who could be classed as a yearly Christmas intervention.

Results

31 festive periods from 1963 have featured a new Doctor Who episode, including 14 broadcast on Christmas Day. In time series analyses, an association was found between broadcasts during the festive period and subsequent lower annual mortality rates. In particular, episodes shown on Christmas Day were associated with 0.60 fewer deaths per 1000 person years (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.99; P = 0.003) in England and Wales and 0.40 fewer deaths per 1000 person years (0.08 to 0.73; P = 0.02) in the UK. The interrupted time series analysis showed a strong shift (reduction) in mortality rates from 2005 onwards in association with the Doctor Who Christmas intervention, with a mean 0.73 fewer deaths per 1000 person years (0.21 to 1.26; P = 0.01) in England and Wales and a mean 0.62 fewer deaths per 1000 person years (0.16 to 1.09; P = 0.01) in the UK.

Conclusions

A new Doctor Who episode shown every festive period, especially on Christmas Day, was associated with reduced mortality rates in England, Wales, and the UK, suggesting that a doctor working over the festive period could lower mortality rates. This finding reinforces why healthcare provision should not be taken for granted and may prompt the BBC and Disney+ to televise new episodes of Doctor Who every festive period, ideally on Christmas Day.

### Social media usage reveals recovery of small businesses after natural hazard events [^cbc1c8bb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Observed downtime in Kathmandu

The 2015 Gorkha earthquake was one of the worst natural hazard events in Nepalese history, killing around 9,000 people, and injuring nearly 22,000 people. It occurred on April 25th, with a magnitude of Mw 7.8. Its epicentre was located 77 km North West of Kathmandu (east of the Gorkha district). Hundreds of aftershocks were reported following the earthquake, five of which registered Mw above 6. The most notable aftershock occurred on the 12th of May, killing a further 200 people and injuring a further 2500. 8.1 million Nepalese citizens were thought to be affected by the earthquake. The event affected the whole country, with notable damage to historical buildings in the northwestern part of Kathmandu.

Our method estimates a downtime of 48 days over the entire city of Kathmandu after the Gorkha earthquake in 2015 (see Fig. 4a). We detect shorter downtimes in other times of the year, further supporting the validity of our method (see Supplementary Table 1). Indeed, the majority of the Nepalese people (84.7%) practice Hinduism and celebrate multiple festivals throughout the year. The main festival, Dashain, is celebrated for two weeks in September or October and is of such importance to the religious and cultural identity of the country, that businesses and other organisations are completely closed for 10 to 15 days to celebrate. As a result, we detect downtime during Dashain for each year in which we have data.

### WA15 To absent friends: a people's festival of storytelling and remembrance [^9427aa3a]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Communities play a key role in supporting members through difficult times, yet bereaved individuals often experience social isolation. Palliative care services should make efforts to develop community capacity to support bereaved people. Rituals of remembrance build solidarity. There are indications that many people would like to talk more openly about dead loved ones but are restricted by cultural norms.

Aim

To create a time of year when remembering dead loved ones is socially accepted and supported within mainstream culture.

Methods

To Absent Friends, a People's Festival of Storytelling and Remembrance was held across Scotland, 1–7 November 2014. Efforts were made to promote the festival, but not to control the form of people's participation.

Results

A wide variety of events took place including community-based activities and high profile participation, for example from the Royal Scottish National Orchestra quartet, and the Scottish Rugby Union.

Conclusion

A public festival in celebration and remembrance of dead loved ones has resonance for many people in Scotland and should grow in future years.

### Reintegration of Ebola survivors into their communities-firestone district, Liberia, 2014 [^610ca129]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Survivor Reintegration Process

Plans for reintegration into the community begin before the survivor leaves the ETU, with a goal of helping the family and home community accept the survivor's return. For 1 or 2 days before a survivor is released from the ETU, Firestone's reintegration team travels to the survivor's home and meets with neighbors and community leaders to discuss the plan to bring the survivor home. At this meeting, the team educates the community about Ebola transmission, emphasizing that survivors are no longer ill and have been declared free from Ebola. The team encourages and answers questions and addresses community concerns to help ensure that survivors are welcomed and not stigmatized. If the survivor is a child, the team also ensures that appropriate guardians have been identified and that the child will be able to continue attending school. The team and community then plan a program to receive the survivor back into the community.

On the day of reintegration, Firestone's medical director, the ETU coordinator, and other medical staff members bring the survivor to the community, accompanied by the reintegration team, radio station personnel, and clergy (Figure 1). If the survivor is a Firestone employee or an employee's dependent, work supervisors and teammates also attend. Representatives from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare are also invited, and community members decorate the survivor's home with traditional palm leaves to signify the festive occasion.

The formal program begins with prayers and a praise and worship session, led by the community and clergy members. A local community leader makes opening remarks and officially welcomes the survivor home. The Firestone Health Services medical director speaks about the survivor's recovery and about the importance of seeking immediate medical attention when one gets sick. Representatives from the county health team and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare emphasize ongoing education and response efforts. The tone throughout the event is celebratory; holding a separate pre-integration meeting in the preceding days ensures that community concerns and questions have been addressed before the survivor's arrival.

### Emergence of medicine for mass gatherings: lessons from the hajj [^d67680fd]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Although definitions of mass gatherings (MG) vary greatly, they consist of large numbers of people attending an event at a specific site for a finite time. Examples of MGs include World Youth Day, the summer and winter Olympics, rock concerts, and political rallies. Some of the largest MGs are spiritual in nature. Among all MGs, the public health issues, associated with the Hajj (an annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia) is clearly the best reported-probably because of its international or even intercontinental implications in terms of the spread of infectious disease. Hajj routinely attracts 2·5 million Muslims for worship. WHO's global health initiatives have converged with Saudi Arabia's efforts to ensure the wellbeing of pilgrims, contain infectious diseases, and reinforce global health security through the management of the Hajj. Both initiatives emphasise the importance of MG health policies guided by sound evidence and based on experience and the timeliness of calls for a new academic science-based specialty of MG medicine.

### The painful sacrifice: the epidemiology of hand injuries during the holy festivals in the sultanate of Oman – A 10-year case-control study [^47f9b036]. Hand (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The human hand is an important functional and sensory organ. Its complex anatomy reflects its important functional capabilities. Many Muslim countries observe the holy festivals with a traditional sacrifice of an animal in order to share the meat (basic commodity) with beloved ones. During such festivals hand injuries have been reported to increase. This study aimed to compare cases and controls of hand injuries treated at the national trauma center in the Sultanate of Oman during a 10-year time period.

Methods

This is a case-control retrospective review for 10 years in the Sultanate of Oman. The cases were all hand injuries registered and assessed at Khoula Hospital in the Sultanate of Oman during the 3 days of both holy festivals from January 2004 to December 2013. Controls were hand injuries registered and assessed at Khoula Hospital in the Sultanate of Oman during nonfestival days. Data were extracted and collected from the Emergency Department database. A descriptive and comparative analysis was done.

Results

There were 1091 cases reviewed in this study. Knife laceration was 2.4 more common during holy festivals than any other time. Extensor tendon injuries were 2.7 more common during holy festivals than nonfestival times. Thumb and index fingers constituted around 40% of the total injuries. Of all patients reviewed, 85% were treated and discharged home without admission.

Conclusion

Holy festivals in the sultanate of Oman are risky times for hand injuries. Knife lacerations are more common during such times than any other times. Emergency and plastic services should be aware of the pattern of hand injuries during such times in order to prepare and plan services accordingly.

### Teaching to the converted: religious belief in the seminar room [^e4843eb9]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2006). Low credibility.

It is not unknown for participants in discussions of ethics to prefix their claims with a profession of their religious faith - to say, for instance, "Well, I'm a Christian/Muslim/whatever, so I think that… " Other participants in the debate may well worry about how to respond without the risk of giving offence or appearing ad hominem. Within a teaching environment, the worry may be even more acute. Nevertheless, it is suggested in this paper that such worries should not be allowed to impede debate; moreover, a teacher who let such prefixes pass without critique would be considered a poor teacher. In fact, a kind of duty for a teacher of ethics is to be contrary and to play the apostate.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^ab33838c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

It is well established that religion declines in Western countries. The secular transition model provides a prominent theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. It suggests that religiosity declines over roughly 200 years, mirroring the demographic transition. The model links modernization, particularly institutional and technological innovation, to a decline in the symbolic and social functions of religion. As secular institutions offer more efficient solutions to life's problems — e.g. biomedicine replacing religious healing, welfare states replacing spiritual reassurance — religion loses functional relevance. This transformation is assumed to occur not primarily by individuals abandoning religion during their adult life, but by an intergenerational breakdown of religious socialization.

The model of the secular transition is compatible with ideas from evolutionary anthropology, specifically mechanisms involving credibility enhancing displays (CRED's). The central idea of CRED's is that individuals will believe and imitate others with a higher probability if these others back up their words with hard-to-fake deeds. Especially in religion, where supernatural entities are notoriously invisible, CRED's are thought to be of primary importance. The link of this insight to our model is as follows: Because of the increasing efficiency of secular goods, parents may still teach their children religiosity — but stop backing it up with religious behavior. This will lead children to drop their religiosity levels.

Previous studies testing this model have focused on western countries that happen to have Christian majorities. These studies have confirmed that different western countries enter the secular transition at different points in time and that aggregate religiosity declines via cohort replacement –

It has been unclear whether the model of the secular transition can be extended to the non-western world and to countries with non-Christian majorities –. While it has been shown that younger generations in most countries around the world tend to be less religious than older generations, these differences do not show up reliably with all indicators of religiosity. For instance, Senegal shows age gaps in participation in worship services but no similar age gaps in the importance of religion or belonging (identifying with a religion). The Netherlands has age gaps in belonging only, Portugal across all three, and countries like Tanzania or Kazakhstan show no marked cohort differences in any of these indicators. It has remained a puzzle, why this should be the case.

### Religious meddling: a comment on skene and parker [^8d886583]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2002). Low credibility.

The question of churches resorting to the courts to influence public policy is one that concerns the appropriate role of the courts and the appropriate conduct of religious authorities. I agree with Skene and Parker that there is no principled legal reason to exclude such interventions out of hand; but my comments are principally addressed to the political and religious reasons for being rightly concerned about such activity. These advert both to the nature of the liberal democratic compromise and to the nature and scope of religious authority (at least within Christianity).

Brazil — destination overview — The country is divided into 5 geographic regions, 27 federative units, and 5,570 municipalities, with 203 million people and 85% residing in urban areas. The national border measures 16,886 km (10,492 miles) and contains 33 twin cities; borders include 9,320 km (5,791 miles) of rivers and 5,568 km (3,460 miles) of watershed. Although classified as an upper-middle-income country, Brazil is a nation of extremes, and social and economic disparities impose different and unique challenges to travelers. Lack of sanitation and safe water affects 15 million people living in cities, and about 25 million people in rural areas must walk long distances to reach a safe water source. With a coastline of 7,491 km (4,655 miles), Brazil is famous for its beaches and folkloric festivals, and during 2019–2023 it was among the 3 most visited countries in South America.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^4aee4cc9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We have presented a revised model of secular transition according to which cohorts drop dimensions of religiosity in a specific order over time, abandoning higher involvement dimensions sooner than lower involvement dimensions. According to the model, religiosity differences show up first in public ritual attendance, then private importance of religiosity, and finally nominal belonging (the P-I-B sequence). The model implies rationality in the sense of dropping more costly religious traits first (Supplementary Discussion 1).

This model addresses the puzzle of variation in cohort differences across countries and indicators of religiosity worldwide. It predicts that a country at a certain threshold of modernization will enter a secular transition process. During this process, younger cohHorts become consecutively less religious than older cohorts.

The P-I-B sequence can be perceived in traditionally Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu, as well as traditionally Christian countries. In traditionally Christian countries, the full sequence can be observed. In traditionally Muslim countries, only the two first steps become apparent. In traditionally Buddhist/Hindu countries, the sequence is clearly discernible, but the estimations for participation are to be interpreted with caution since participation was measured differently in different surveys. The P-I-B sequence can furthermore be demonstrated both for women and men.

One group of countries does not follow the predictions of the model: eastern, post-communist countries. We argue that the specific history of a communist past with state repression and a societal crisis in 1990, has led to a transitory nationalist-religious upswing that currently masks the longer secular transition trend.

### Epilepsy during the middle ages, the renaissance and the enlightenment [^e7ec82f7]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to pinpoint the views on epilepsy as a disease and symptom during medieval times and the Renaissance. A thorough study of texts, medical books and reports along with a review of the available literature in PubMed was undertaken. With the exception of some early Byzantine doctors in the East and some of the representatives of Arab medicine, scientific views and observations on epilepsy in the West were overrun by the domination of the Catholic Church. This led to the formulation of superstitious views of the disease; epileptics were considered possessed and, therefore, only religious methods could possibly cure it. Near the end of the fourteenth century, physicians were emancipated from Catholic intervention. The Renaissance is marked by a plethora of new treatises on epilepsy regarding the mechanisms of epileptic convulsions, the connection with various clinical conditions such as tumors and venereal diseases and the collection of interesting cases.

### Perceived causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes and remedies adopted by kalenjin women in rural Kenya [^c30426cd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Social causes

This category involves blaming other people for causing adverse pregnancy outcomes and is a common feature of non-industrialised and smaller-scale societies, where interpersonal conflicts are frequent. The common forms of these are witchcraft, sorcery and "evil eyes". In witchcraft, certain people are believed to possess a mystical power to harm others and this power is inherited, either genetically or by membership of a particular kinship group. Sorcery, as defined by Helman, is the power to manipulate and alter natural and supernatural events with the proper magical knowledge and performance of rituals, and this is different from witchcraft. Sorcery is often practised among one's social world of friends, family or neighbours, and is often based on envy. Evil eyes, or a "wounding eye", relates to the fear of envy in the eyes of the beholder. The possessors of evil eye are usually believed to harm unintentionally and are often unaware of their powers and are unable to control them. The influence of evil eye, as explained by Helman, is avoided or counteracted by means of devices calculated to distract its attention, and by practices of sympathetic magic. The social aetiology of illness also includes physical injuries, such as poisoning or battle wounds, inflicted by other people. Furthermore, it can be stress or actions caused by spouse, children, friends, employer or colleagues and neighbours. It can also be contagious diseases transmitted by other people.

Supernatural causes

Here a pregnancy complication is ascribed to the direct actions of supernatural entities, such as gods, spirits or ancestral shades. In the gods aetiology, illness is described as a reminder from God for a behavioural lapse or sinful behaviour. The cure in this case involves acknowledging the sins and vowing to improve one's behaviour. In the case of spiritual causes, disease-bearing spirits strike unexpectedly causing a variety of symptoms in their victims. Their invasion is unrelated to the individual's behaviour, who is therefore considered blameless and worthy of sympathetic help from others. In the case of ancestral shades causes, a pregnancy complication is ascribed to spirits of the ancestors whom they have offended and diagnosis takes place in a divinatory séance.

### Lead in spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders sampled from home investigations for children with elevated blood lead levels-north carolina, 2011–2018 [^e55ff43d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Lead poisoning prevention professionals should educate parents about the potential for lead exposure from spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders by making educational materials available in several languages at festivals, places of worship, and other community centers. Keeping ceremonial powders out of reach of children can prevent their accidental consumption, and testing of children who consume spices or herbal remedies regularly might lead to earlier detection of elevated BLLs. Lead investigators should sample these products during investigations and attempt to document product origin and level of consumption. Increasing testing of spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders for heavy metals by food safety regulators at the port of entry when these substances are imported into the United States might reduce the occurrence of lead poisoning associated with these substances. §§ Because these products are sold nationwide, setting a national maximum allowable limit for lead in spices and herbal remedies might further reduce the risk for lead exposure from them.

### Kumbh mela religious gathering as a massive superspreading event: potential culprit for the exponential surge of COVID-19 cases in India [^c18a9d1f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

The Kumbh Mela is a significant religious gathering of millions of Hindu devotees in India. It is celebrated on certain auspicious days in the Hindu calendar and attracts millions of pilgrims across the country. Despite the religious intention of millions of Hindu devotees, it raised public health concerns as it became a massive superspreading event for COVID-19. Being the second most populous country, India became the second most affected country during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the arrival of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and the presence of the double mutated variant, which was first identified in India, the Kumbh Mela probably aggravated the country's COVID-19 situation which resulted in an uncontrollable second wave. Several cases of COVID-19 across India had been contact-traced to returnees from the event who acted as a nidus to help spread the infection. As a consequence, India's healthcare system was severely challenged as a result of the overwhelming hospitalizations and increasing fatalities resulting in an acute manpower shortage in healthcare along with the depletion of drugs and medical supplies despite being one of the largest pharmaceutical hubs globally. Leaders and governments around the world should learn from India's experience and thereby take preventive measures to manage potential superspreading events to curb the spike of COVID-19 cases.

To improve both the present and future situation of Afghanistan to fight COVID-19, we suggest the following measures:
1) Continuing quarantine status in major cities of Afghanistan
2) Increasing the medical equipment and devices for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease
3) Increasing the number of and training healthcare workers
4) Informing people through media such as television, radio, web pages, etc
5) Setting up more centers for the diagnosis and treatment in other states
6) Implementing social distancing and more restrictions on travel
7) Strengthening the detection and isolation of patients
8) Closing mosques, congregational prayers, Jumu'ah prayer (Friday prayer), and religious places
9) Providing cash and noncash aid to vulnerable and low-income individuals.

Although Afghanistan has faced many difficulties in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, implementing these measures may maximize its defense againts COVID-19 pandemic.

### Firework-related injuries in tehran's persian wednesday eve festival (chaharshanbe soori) [^da069527]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Fireworks are the leading cause of injuries such as burns and amputations during the Persian Wednesday Eve Festival (Chaharshanbeh Soori).

Objectives

This study was designed to explore the age of the high-risk population, the type of fireworks most frequently causing injury, the pattern of injury, and the frequency of permanent disabilities.

Methods

This cohort study was performed by Tehran Emergency Medical Services at different medical centers all around Tehran, Iran, in individuals referred due to firework-related injuries during 1 month surrounding the festival in the year 2007. The following information was extracted from the patients' medical records: demographic data, the type of fireworks causing injury, the pattern and severity of the injury, the pre-hospital and hospital care provided for the patient, and the patient's condition at the time of discharge. In addition, information on the severity of the remaining disability was recorded 8 months after the injury.

Results

There were 197 patients enrolled in the study with a mean age of 20.94 ± 11.31 years; the majority of them were male. Fuse-detonated noisemakers and homemade grenades were the most frequent causes of injury. Hand injury was reported in 39.8% of the cases. Amputation and long-term disability were found in 6 and 12 cases, respectively. None of the patients died during the study period.

Conclusion

The fireworks used during a Chaharshanbe Soori ceremony were responsible for a considerable number of injuries to different parts of the body, and some of them led to permanent disabilities.

### Religious development from adolescence to early adulthood among muslim and christian youth in Germany: a person-oriented approach [^00b2b03f]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Religious self‐categorization

Religious self‐categorization was assessed with a single item "What is your religion?" at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (No religion), 2 (Buddhism), 3 (Christianity), 4 (Christianity: Catholic), 5 (Christianity: Protestant), 6 (Hinduism), 7 (Islam), 8 (Judaism), 9 (Sikhism), and 10 (Other religion).

Religiosity

Religiosity was assessed with three items capturing its key components (i.e. public involvement, private practices, importance). We combined these widely used items and examined overall religiosity which — according to meta‐analyses — is the most common approach to studying religiosity (e.g. Hardy et al; Yonker et al.). The first item, "How important is religion to you?", was assessed at Waves 1–7. The response options were 1 (Very important), 2 (Fairly important), 3 (Not very important), and 4 (Not at all important). The second item, "How often do you visit a religious meeting place (e.g. a church, a mosque, a synagogue or a temple)?", was assessed at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (Never), 2 (Occasionally (but less than once a month)), 3 (At least once a month), 4 (At least once a week), and 5 (Every day). The third item, "How often do you pray?", was assessed at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (Never), 2 (Occasionally (but less than once a month)), 3 (At least once a month), 4 (At least once a week), 5 (One to four times a day), and 6 (Five times a day or more). We rescaled the first and third items to a five‐point scale with higher values indicating greater religiosity. Across time, the items loaded on a single factor explaining between 73.8% and 77.8% of the variance. Cronbach's α across waves ranged from.82 to.85. We computed mean scores for Waves 1–3 and 5–7.

### Worship attendance and the disability process in community-dwelling older adults [^2d2c491d]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

We examined the contribution of religious involvement to age-related declines in health by examining the association of worship attendance with measures of different stages in the disability continuum.

Method

Participants included 5,863 Black and White older adults from the Chicago Health and Aging Project. Worship attendance was coded in 3 levels: very frequent (several times a week or more), frequent (several times a month), and infrequent (several times a year or less). Measures of disability included self-reported instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and activities of daily living (ADL) disability as well as observed physical function.

Results

In multiple regression models adjusted for demographic factors, compared with those with infrequent worship attendance, those with frequent or very frequent attendance had lower levels of IADL and ADL disability and higher levels of physical performance at baseline. These associations remained significant in models that adjusted for health and cognitive status. There was no association between frequency of worship attendance and change in disability or physical function over time.

Discussion

These results suggest that more frequent worship attendance does not contribute to slowing the progress of disability in late life. Future research is needed to better understand the development of the differences in disability associated with worship attendance observed at baseline.

### A practical approach to the family that expects a miracle [^44b42316]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

When a patient is extremely ill and/or dying, and the family expects a miraculous recovery, this situation can be very challenging to physicians, particularly when there is certainty that the miracle will occur through divine intervention. A practical approach is therefore provided to clinicians for engaging families that anticipate the miraculous healing of a sick patient. This strategy involves exploring the meaning and significance of a miracle, providing a balanced, nonargumentative response and negotiation of patient-centered compromises, while conveying respect for patient spirituality and practicing good medicine. Such an approach, tailored to the specifics of each family, can be effective in helping a family come to a place of acceptance about the impending death of their loved one.

### The hajj and COVID-19: how the pandemic shaped the world's largest religious gathering [^df6d2608]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

The Hajj pilgrimage, one of the five pillars of Islam, is held in Saudi Arabia in the second week of Dhu'l-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar. It is one of the world's largest mass gatherings, constituting more than 2.5 million Muslim pilgrims from more than 180 countries. The COVID-19 pandemic posed a significant public health threat for such mass gatherings. Thus, a health risk assessment for the 2020 Hajj was held by the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health and the WHO Collaborating Centre for Mass Gatherings Medicine, which concluded that foreign pilgrims should be excluded from the 2020 Hajj and that the number of pilgrims should be significantly reduced. Timely decisions allowed the Saudi government to conduct the Hajj, despite an initial postponement. However, the number of pilgrims was significantly downscaled, and extensive new protocols were set in place because of the pandemic. This article aims to shed light on the challenges faced and efforts made by Saudi Arabia to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 during the religious proceedings of the Hajj.

### The dark bridal canopy [^108edb72]. Annals of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Physician narratives in family medicine have the potential to convey the vibrant spirit of our field and provide meaningful insights into disease, illness, suffering, and the nature of healing. They may also complement empirical research, education, and practice through their integrative, expressive nature. This true story depicts a challenge faced by the author while serving as a family physician in a desolate, desert region in Israel's southern Aravah Valley (south of the Dead Sea), where he was privileged to practice for a decade. The episode, a fatal car crash in which a newlywed Druse woman (a member of a secretive sect) was killed, involved much more than just the terse details listed in the emergency log. An example of a family medicine physician-and-self drama, this piece takes the reader beyond the basic medical facts into the experience and sensations of the event. It also provides a stark contrast to the usual medical description and emphasizes the importance of stories as reflective opportunities for improving health care, sustaining ourselves as practitioners, and maintaining the vitality of our field.

### The film festival "AUSNAHME | ZUSTAND" (state of emergency) – do feature films and documentaries on mental health reduce stigma and influence help-seeking attitudes? [^87d35d8a]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

The study aims at evaluating the impact of the Germany-wide film festival "AUSNAHME|ZUSTAND" on social distance and help-seeking attitudes of the adolescent audience. The festival, on the subject of mental health, was staged for the second time, aiming to give a podium to the topic mental health and to inform and entertain an adolescent audience that has not been in close contact with the subject before. A pre-post test was carried out to look for the effect of feature films and documentaries on social distance of the audience towards people with mental illness and on the change in help-seeking attitudes. A total of 532 young people with a mean age of 15.6 were questioned during the film festival in Leipzig. As the results show, the effect on the viewers׳ social distance and their help-seeking attitudes strongly depend on the content of the feature films and documentaries. Two films improved attitudes – one both social distance and help-seeking, one only help-seeking. One film increased social distance, and two films did not affect either outcome. Age, gender, and knowing someone with mental health problems also turned out to be decisive factors influencing the development of social distance and help-seeking attitudes. Feature films or documentaries about mental illness can reduce social distance or influence help-seeking attitudes, but effects strongly depend on the particular film.

### Food availability, perceived food environment and social norm perceptions of healthy and vegetarian food consumption at a public music festival in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional study [^8e814657]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The majority of the food and beverages available at the festival were unhealthy. Vegetarian food was available but consisted mostly of fries. Overall, participants perceived the FE as unsupportive of healthy food consumption while their perception of the FE for vegetarian food consumption was more neutral. Participants had weak descriptive and injunctive SN perceptions of healthy and vegetarian food consumption. Still, they perceived stronger injunctive than descriptive SNs for healthy and vegetarian food consumption. They perceived stronger descriptive and injunctive norms for vegetarian compared with healthy food consumption. Last, participants who found the perceived FE more supportive of healthy and vegetarian food consumption also found it more common (descriptive SN) and appropriate (injunctive SN) to consume these foods.

The availability of healthy food and beverages at the festival was very low (7.6%). These findings match the literature on food availability and consumption in out-of-home settings. There was a better availability of vegetarian food (46.4%) compared with healthy food at the festival, but it could be improved by increasing the diversity and healthiness of vegetarian options, which were mostly unhealthy (fries, sweet pastries, fried savoury snacks). This could contribute to the protein transition as FEs with large varieties of vegetarian dishes contribute to reducing meat consumption. While this study evaluated the healthiness and sustainability of the food available at a public music festival, it should be noted that food consumed at festivals constitutes an occasional event, as opposed to food consumed on a daily basis. Hence, the impact of the food offered and consumed during festivals on the overall diet of people may be limited. Also, these results should ideally be compared with other studies on food at planned events or in out-of-home settings.

Hajj environmental hazards — sun exposure and heat require prevention; sunscreens and appropriate clothing are recommended during the day, and the average high temperatures during June–September are ≥ 43°C (110°F). More than 1300 heat-related deaths were recorded during the 2024 Hajj, and hajjis might walk up to approximately 35–40 miles (approximately 55–65 km) over the 5 days; about 45% of pilgrims walk during the Hajj rituals. Counsel pilgrims to stay well-hydrated, wear sunscreen, and seek shade or use umbrellas when possible, and note that religious leaders have ruled that it is permissible for hajjis to perform some rituals after sunset; except for a pilgrim's required presence on Arafat on the 9th day of Dhul Hijjah, most other compulsory rituals can be postponed, done by proxy, or redeemed by paying a penalty.

### Counting the ways that aboriginal and torres strait islander older people participate in their communities and culture [^813ff0ab]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Demographic Characteristics and Participation

Participation across all cultural events and activities was greatest among females (see Author Note 5), except for fishing and hunting where participation was higher for males. For age, there was an inverse relationship between increasing age and the proportion of older adults reporting participation, with the eldest age group of older adults less likely to participate in ceremonies, NAIDOC week, sports carnivals, festivals/carnivals, fishing, hunting, gathering wild plants/berries, arts/crafts, music/dance/theater. However, the 65+year age group had the highest proportion of individuals writing/telling stories of the three groups. The proportion of people reporting involvement in organizations did not differ across age groups.

In univariate analysis, there were regional differences with a greater proportion of respondents in remote areas partaking in ceremonies, funerals/sorry business, sports carnivals, fishing, hunting, gathering wild/plants and berries, and writing/telling stories. However, participation in NAIDOC week activities, festival/carnivals, involvement in Aboriginal or Torres Strait organizations, arts/crafts, and music/dance/theater did not differ among remote and nonremote residents.

### Food availability, perceived food environment and social norm perceptions of healthy and vegetarian food consumption at a public music festival in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional study [^2cc85fa9]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

While the vast majority of food and beverages at the festival were unhealthy (92.4%), participants' perceptions were mixed. Some perceived healthy food as sufficiently available (33.1%) while others did not (37.8%). This discrepancy could be attributed to several factors. First, participants may have had a different understanding of healthy food. Second, participants were not asked what their expectations were regarding the FE at the festival (eg, with low expectations, the actual situation may seem satisfying). Third, participants were not asked about their reference point when evaluating their perceptions of the FE. Fourth, not all participants may have been aware of the food available at the festival or may have obtained food elsewhere. Finally, researchers approached visitors at different locations. The direct surroundings of a participant when filling in the survey may have impacted their perceptions of the FE.

Participants perceived weak descriptive SNs for healthy and vegetarian food, with the perceived descriptive SNs for healthy food being weaker than those for vegetarian food consumption. This suggests that they did not see other visitors consuming vegetarian food and even less healthy food. This is probably a reflection of the direct FE, which most likely hampered visitors to display healthy or vegetarian food consumption. These findings are in line with prior findings indicating that SNs on food consumption may be steered by the FE. Empirical evidence has shown that SNs are physically embedded in FEs and might influence food consumption. In another study, participants living in neighbourhoods with more fast-food outlets reported stronger descriptive and injunctive SNs about fast-food consumption, which were associated with higher fast-food intake.

Participants perceived stronger injunctive than descriptive SNs endorsing healthy and vegetarian food consumption. Nonetheless, their perception of injunctive SNs for healthy food consumption remained weak (mean = 2.93; SD = 0.78), suggesting that they still thought it was rather inappropriate to eat healthy food at the festival. They might be used to eating unhealthy food in out-of-home settingsor might associate festivals with the consumption of unhealthy food. Enjoying a special occasion (eg, a party) was identified as the most important reason for people to enjoy unhealthy snacks.

### Food availability, perceived food environment and social norm perceptions of healthy and vegetarian food consumption at a public music festival in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional study [^66ba8376]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Results

Substudy 1: food availability

There were 75 food stands within the festival's perimeters (350 000 m²), of which 51.8% were owned by food providers not permanently vested in Wageningen. 69.4% of the food stands were specialised in fast-food (N = 36; 48%) or alcoholic beverages (N = 20; 26.7%).

In total, the food stands offered 627 food and beverage items, which included 274 (43.7%) food and 353 (56.3%) beverage items. Most available beverages were alcoholic beverages (N = 147 (23.4%)) and sugar-sweetened beverages (N = 84 (13.4%)). The most available foods were (1) fried savoury snacks (N = 90 (14.4%)); (2) fast-food sandwiches (N = 57 (9.1%)) and (3) non-fried sweet pastries (N = 27 (4.3%)). Of the entire assortment at the festival, 556 (92.4%) food and beverage items were classified as unhealthy and 46 (7.6%) as healthy. When considering only food items, 0.8% were classified as healthy. Almost half (n = 122, 46.6%) of the food assortment was vegetarian, but this amounted to 37.4% when fries (offered 24 times) were excluded. The main vegetarian options available were fries, sweet pastries and fried savoury snacks. The majority of vegetarian food items were classified as unhealthy (N = 113 (98.3%)). Of the entire food assortment at the festival, one food item (0.4%) contained fish or seafood. This item was entitled 'fish and chips with sauce ravigote' and was classified under the food group 'composed dishes' (table 1).

### Induced abortion in the world: 1. perception of abortion throughout the centuries and by religions [^06e9a3a0]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Induced abortion has religious, moral, and cultural dimensions that place it at the center of major ethical debates. The interest of women caught in the middle of this never-ending controversy requires that a dialogue replaces current confrontation. To promote such dialogue, we decided to write a mini-series to review important aspects of abortion. First, we will turn to history to explore the root of the controversy, which may enable the disentangling of the complexity of the issue. In the second essay we describe how the 20th century witnessed the progressive legalization of abortion. In the third essay we will articulate how we see the possibility of a common ground between those favoring and those opposing abortion. Induced abortion has been attempted from the dawn of civilization and it is mentioned in Egyptian, Greek, and Roman writings, although the frequency of the practice and its success are not known. The world's principal religions did not view abortion favorably, but the strength of prohibition was not uniform. Within Christianity, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches are currently totally opposed, whereas Protestant denominations are more nuanced in their disapproval. The anti-abortion stance of Muslim countries seems to be at variance with the view of the majority of traditional scholars, who would allow abortion in the early stages of pregnancy (up to 4months, or in the first 40days). The Orthodox Jewish view bans abortion except when the life of the mother is at risk, whereas Reformed Judaism is more open. Hinduism is also opposed to abortion with few exceptions: severe fetal abnormalities, presence of a life-threatening condition for the woman, in case of rape or incest. Confucianism stresses the importance of the family and reverence for life but also shows concern and compassion for the welfare of the pregnant woman; these positions are balanced when responding to the challenge of deciding about abortion.

### Patienthood in medieval tuscany: beliefs and cures [^b8396d2d]. Medical Humanities (2016). Low credibility.

This paper focuses on intersections of holy and sick bodies in the Tuscan Middle Ages to examine how the faithful accessed miraculous cures from contact with, or belief in, the relics of the saints. Rather than examine the relationship between the long dead martyrs (whose relics were abundant), however, it will look at the relationship between relatively recent saints and their devotees. The miracles discussed are traditional-that is, they are found in the lives of many saints and are not exceptional. It is hoped, however, that by concentrating on Tuscany, some insights can be secured on the relationship between Tuscan individuals of the late middle ages and those of their community who were recognised, either officially or through vox populi, as saints.

### Quiet healing [^6ea524ff]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Both physicians and patients want deeply healing doctor-patient relationships. Too often, though, the ever-expanding demands of medical practice combine with the defenses of the patient to create doctor-patient isolation. Eastern and Western cosmologies and traditions may encourage different approaches to human interaction and healing. At times, probing the patient with more questions may open up a story vital to transformative healing. However, this narrative essay uses a personal experience as a patient of a Japanese traditional healer and Zen practitioner to explore the value of a quiet approach to patient care.

### Sarah orne jewett's depictions of women in a changing medical profession: nan prince and almira todd [^a66cbaf5]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

Like Nan who returns to her village after medical school instead of taking a prestigious job in Canada, Almira's healing mission lies at home. Almira is portrayed as both a physical and psychological healer for her neighbours. She shows great patience and respect for the mentally ill in ways that only another member of their own community could — she seems accustomed to their idiosyncrasies and understands their diseases in the context of region's decay. Though Almira does what she can to alleviate her patient's psychic suffering, she sympathises with her patients through an attitude of acceptance. Reflecting this attitude, The Country of the Pointed Firs has been described by critics as an elegy for Almira's dying profession, way of life, community and friends. 31

Like her herbalism, the psychological aspects of Almira's work are tied to ancient spirituality. Jewett deepens the association of Almira's practice with ancient medicine and spiritual healing when she compares Almira to the sibyls and caryatids of ancient Greece. 32 The term 'sibyl' aligns Almira to cathartic religious healings performed by the Delphic oracle in early Antiquity. Later in Greek culture it became the responsibility of playwrights to provide the audience with cathartic psychological and social healing through emotional experiences of pity and fear. This Classical concept was employed in psychological discourse during Jewett's lifetime to describe how narrative can lead to emotional closure and healing through the experience of repressed emotions. 33

Through empathy and catharsis, Almira's recurrent role as a narrator of and a listener to others' stories brings social and psychological wholeness to the members of her community. Like Almira's herbal treatments, the physiological efficacy of spiritual, social and psychological practices are now a subject of much scientific study. Psychotherapy, mindfulness and meditation are being investigated by contemporary medicine — benefits include improved immunity and cardiac function. 34 Medical schools are emphasising empathy as a way to improve patient outcomes. 35 Surprisingly, even certain aspects of Jewett's animistic view have gained quantitative relevance as the field of epigenetics explores how psychosocial trauma, like the trauma experienced by the widows and sailors of Dunnet Landing, has the ability to alter human gene methylation. 36

### Food availability, perceived food environment and social norm perceptions of healthy and vegetarian food consumption at a public music festival in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional study [^4075dfad]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Municipalities worldwide are seeking to create healthy and sustainable living environments to improve public and planetary health, as they have a responsibility to enhance and protect their community's well-being. With festivals becoming more popular in the past decade, municipalities in the Netherlands are exploring the potential of public policies to improve the food availability at planned events (eg, festivals). So far, public policies for planned events have mainly focused on economic development, place marketing and tourism. While some local governments have sought ways to restrict alcohol and drug use at festivals through public policies, improving the availability and accessibility of healthy and sustainable food remains largely unaddressed. Sustainable, environmentally friendly diets can be achieved by lowering the intake of animal-based proteins, through the consumption of vegetarian food for instance. One of the challenges hindering the development of food policies for festivals is the lack of a comprehensive understanding by municipalities of the extent to which unhealthy and unsustainable foods are prevalent and how visitors perceive this. Besides, the pathways through which festival food environments (FEs) could shape food consumption on site remain unclear.

While festival FEs have been understudied, other out-of-home settings are known to offer mainly unhealthy foodand have been associated with unhealthy and unsustainable food consumption. A Swedish music festival successfully banned meat, which reduced the festival's ecological footprint by 40%. Another study found that the majority of visitors to an Australian music festival declared having consumed unhealthy food, regardless of healthy eating intentions. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, only one study has evaluated the food availability at a planned event. This study showed that the 2016 Rio Olympic games offered mostly unhealthy food and beverages, despite 'healthy choice' claims in the Rio 2016 policy.

There is also a lack of studies regarding visitors' perceptions about the physical FE. Besides, physical FEs may shape the social FE (eg, social norms, SNs), which may shape food consumption. These data are important for the design, implementation and evaluation of FE policies and are highly valued by policy and key decisions-makers. They allow for the exploration of people's experiences and perceptions of physical and social FEs, which enriches our understanding of the way people interact with their FE. This can ultimately provide insights into ways to design effective policies for improved nutrition.

### The urologist's guide to religion and male factor fertility treatment [^bc61a7b0]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To create a reference guide for six of the major U.S. religions for use by reproductive health specialists to provide patient-centered care for a culturally diverse patient population.

Materials and Methods

We utilized primary source reviews of various religious texts and verified electronic databases to examine perspectives on use of, in vitro fertilization (IVF), intrauterine insemination (IUI), sterilization procedures such as vasectomy and tubal ligation, and surrogacy for six major U.S. religions: Catholicism, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, and Islam. Each statement of religious belief was either taken directly from primary source documents or cross-referenced across several secondary sources to ensure accuracy. Perspectives were compiled into a reference document and table for clinical use.

Results

Most religions have focused statements concerning assisted reproduction and vasectomy. While there are caveats for most religions, IVF and IUI are largely opposed only by the Catholic church, surrogacy is not permissible in the LDS Church, Catholic Church, and Islam, and vasectomy is not permissible for the Catholic Church, LDS Church, Judaism, and Islam. Similarly, tubal ligation is also not permitted for these religions with the exception of Judaism of which while vasectomy is considered a violation of the Torah, sterilization of a woman is not explicitly discussed in the old testament. Instead, a rabbinic decree states permanent female sterilization as against the views of the faith. The religions with the most lenient rules concerning reproduction and permanent contraception explored include Buddhism and Hinduism each of which have no reservations pertaining to IVF, IUI, surrogacy, or permanent sterilization.

Conclusion

Religion often plays a significant role in patients' attitudes towards use of ART, permanent sterilization, and surrogacy. Familiarity with the religious beliefs and perspectives is important for the reproductive health specialist in order to provide appropriate counseling for their patients.

Impact Statement

A summative reference guide can help provide patient-centered care for reproductive health and family planning.

### The health and economic impact of fireworks-related injuries in iran: a household survey following the new year's festival in tehran [^879fd22b]. Injury (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fireworks are used worldwide as a part of national and cultural celebrations. Personal use of fireworks is associated with serious injuries. The "Last Wednesday Eve Festival" is celebrated on the evening before the last wednesday of the Persian calendar year. In recent years, fireworks have been widely used during the festival, which has resulted in injuries. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors of fireworks-related injuries associated with the Last Wednesday Eve Festival, in Tehran, Iran.

Methods

A household survey of residents of greater Tehran, using a random cluster sampling design was performed. Number of fireworks-related injuries, expenditures for fireworks and medical treatment of fireworks-related injuries, length of hospital stay for treatment of these injuries and the personal property damage was gathered.

Results

Interviews were conducted of 2475 households in greater Tehran. At least one member of 19.8% of these households had used fireworks during the 2007 Last Wednesday Eve Festival. Fireworks-related injuries were more common among households whose members had used homemade fireworks than among households whose members had used only commercially made fireworks (OR = 16.5, 95% CI: 5.7–47.5). Forty-five households reported that they had sustained personal property damage caused by fireworks during the festival, costing a mean of US$ 36.60. Households with at least one injured member spent a mean of US$ 441.90 for medical care and a mean of US$ 70.80 for other expenses related to seeking medical care. The overall incidence of fireworks-related injury among household members was 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1–0.3%). Fireworks-related injury incidence was highest in the 10–19 age group. The total estimated number of fireworks-related injuries in Tehran during the 2007 Last Wednesday Eve Festival was approximately 17,000. Among the 20 injured individuals, 4 persons (20.0%) were hospitalised for a mean of 2.8 days.

Conclusions

The personal use of fireworks in Iran is associated with serious injuries and non-trivial economic costs. This study is the first to describe the incidence and economic costs of fireworks-related injuries in a major city in Iran using a population-based survey. To prevent these injuries, individuals should attend public fireworks displays conducted by professionals rather than engage in personal use of fireworks.

### Food availability, perceived food environment and social norm perceptions of healthy and vegetarian food consumption at a public music festival in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional study [^ab7cdca2]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Objective

To gain insight into the food availability, the perceived food environment, and social norm perceptions in favour of healthy and vegetarian food consumption at a festival.

Design

Two cross-sectional substudies were conducted to audit food and beverages at the festival, and to measure visitors' perceptions of the festival food environment (accessibility, affordability, availability, diversity, quality) and their social norms perceptions via a mobile survey.

Setting

Public music festival, the Netherlands.

Sample

75 food stands and 153 adult festival visitors.

Results

75 food stands offered 627 food and beverage items, of which 92.4% were not supportive of a healthy diet. Of all food items, 46.6% were vegetarian (including 20% fries). Participants especially perceived the festival food environment as unsupportive of healthy choices. They also had weak descriptive and injunctive social norm perceptions in favour of healthy and vegetarian food consumption. However, they had stronger descriptive (t(152) = -5.5; p < 0.001) and injunctive norm perceptions (t(152) = -4.5; p < 0.001) of vegetarian food consumption (mean descriptive social norm perception = 2.42; SD = 0.82; mean injunctive social norm perception = 3.14; SD = 0.78), than healthy food consumption (mean descriptive social norm perception = 2.10; SD = 0.76; mean injunctive social norm perception = 2.93; SD = 0.78). Participants had stronger injunctive than descriptive social norm perceptions of healthy (t(152) = -12.4; p < 0.001) and vegetarian (t(152) = -11.3; p < 0.001) food consumption. Participants' perceived food environment and their perception of social norms were positively correlated.

Conclusion

The festival's food environment appears unsupportive of healthy and vegetarian food consumption. The limited availability of healthy and vegetarian food coincided with weak social norm perceptions encouraging their consumption, particularly descriptive norms that arise from observing others. The food environment may stand in the way of developing descriptive norms for the consumption of healthy and vegetarian food, as people can only see others consume food that is available. Implementation of public event policies could support healthier, more sustainable festivals.

### Bat and lyssavirus exposure among humans in area that celebrates bat festival, Nigeria, 2010 and 2013 [^3bfdc35b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Twice a year in the Idanre area of Nigeria, a 1-day bat festival takes place in which boys and men enter into designated caves to capture bats, typically with their bare hands (Figure 1). Captured bats are cooked and eaten, sold in markets, and used in cultural ceremonies. Pathogen spillover from bats to humans might occur during these festivities, given that some Nigerian bats harbor lyssaviruses such as Lagos bat virus and other pathogens such as Bartonella rousetti. Furthermore, the most frequently identified bat species roosting in the festival caves is the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), which is a reservoir for Marburg virus and Sosuga virus (,–).

Bat hunters and bats captured during a bat festival, Idanre area, Nigeria, 2013. A) Bat hunters with slingshots and bats captured during a bat festival. B) Bats captured during a bat festival. C) Bat hunter with a bat captured during a bat festival.

We evaluated bat and lyssavirus exposure among humans in the area around Idanre, Nigeria. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of bat contact, to identify factors associated with bat contact, to assess knowledge about batborne infections and health precautions related to bats, to determine whether febrile illnesses occur following the bat festival, to determine whether abortive lyssavirus infections occur, and to identify whether lyssaviruses circulate among bats in the festival caves.

### Effectiveness of an educational program on decreasing burns and injuries in persian festival of fire: a burden of diseases approach [^d9552ef7]. Burns (2019). Medium credibility.

Chaharshanbeh souri is a historical Persian firework festival which has several health and financial damages for Iranians near celebration of New Year. In this study we tried to find effectiveness of Chaharshanbeh souri educational campaign on decreasing burden of injuries due to fireworks of this day. In this before-after study, an educational campaign was done for 2017 focusing on children and students. Data of a registry which was designed for gathering information of injuries and mortalities of this festival was used to show effectiveness of the program. Disability adjusted life years was calculated and compared before and after intervention. The results of this study showed that mean age of injuries was increased from 27.75 to 32.65 years and DALY decreased significantly after the intervention (P = 0.0460) showing that the intervention was effective. Educational programs might be effective to decrease burden of injuries related to Chaharshanbeh souri festival.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^ad747278]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Cultural zones

Following Haerpfer, we distinguish the following nine cultural zones: English-speaking, Latin America, Catholic Europe, Protestant Europe, African-Islamic, Baltic, South Asian, Orthodox and Confucian. We use operationalization of the Inglehart/Welzeltradition since this typology has been empirically shown to be important. We do not use the variables historical religion and cultural zones in the same models because of too much overlap.

Government support, government regulation, and government discrimination are measured with the respective variables from the RAS dataset. Government support measures "different ways a government can support religion including financial support, policies which enforce religious laws, and other forms of entanglement between government and religion". Government regulation measures "different ways governments regulate, restrict, or control all religions in the state including the majority religion". Government discrimination measures "restrictions that are placed on the religious institutions and practices of religious minorities that are not placed on the majority group". We have dichotomized the three continuous variables, distinguishing a high (1) and a low value (0). Government support of religion may suppress country secularity, while government regulation and discrimination may boost it –.

Gender

We use both the (self-reported) dichotomous variable gender (female = 1, male = 0), and the gender ratio expressed as the percentage of women in the respective population or subpopulation. A large literature shows that women are more religious than men in western countries, even when controlling for various socio-structural variables. A world-wide assessment, however, suggests that such a gender gap is mainly present in traditionally Christian countries. In our models, we use gender ratio as a control variable. See Supplementary Methods 3 where it is shown that the P-I-B is robust to including or excluding the control variable gender ratio (and other control variables). See furthermore Supplementary Methods 4, where the P-I-B sequence is calculated separately for women and men.

### Indian = hindu? The development of nationalist attitudes among hindu and muslim children in India [^3be83864]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

Many political movements across the world today define citizenship in exclusionary ethnic or religious terms. This study extends research on ethnic-national associations in adults to children, adding to the relatively sparse literature on the development of national associations in children and in nonwestern contexts. Explicit and implicit religious-national associations were examined in a sample of 160 nine- to sixteen-year-olds (79 Hindu; 81 Muslim) in Gujarat, India. Results suggest that while Hindu children show a strong Indian = Hindu association by age 9, Muslim children appear to be buffered from this association. Furthermore, this association uniquely predicts variance in children's attitudes about social policy and their concept of nationality, above and beyond their age, religion, and intergroup attitudes.

### Mobile radiography at a music festival [^53c1da67]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Limb injuries are common at music festival sites and traditionally patients seen by on-site medical services require referral to hospital emergency departments for radiographic exclusion of bony injury. This takes clinical personnel off site, increases demand on local emergency departments and is inconvenient for revellers. This is an audit of the use of a portable digital radiography system at the Virgin music festival in Staffordshire over a 3-year period.

SCUBA diving is a popular recreational sport. Although serious injuries occur infrequently, when they do knowledge of diving medicine and/or where to obtain appropriate consultation is essential. The emergency physician is likely to be the first physician contact the injured diver has. We discuss 8 subjects in diving medicine which are contemporary, yet may have controversies associated with them. From this information the physician dealing primarily with the injured diver will have a basis for understanding and managing, as well as where to find additional help, for his/her patients' diving injuries.

### Scaling up stigma? The effects of antiretroviral roll-out on stigma and HIV testing. early evidence from rural tanzania [^a328d158]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2009). Low credibility.

Collective denial: "AIDS doesn't exist. We just bewitch each other"

The belief that a wide array of diseases can be caused by witches as a consequence of jealousy or revenge is widespread in this community. Some community leaders referred to a disease from the past ("Kondela"), which looked like AIDS, was caused by witches and could be cured by Traditional Healers specialised in "divination".

In the past the Sukuma called it "Kondela". A person slims and looks like s/he is HIV positive, but s/he is not. It's a disease similar to AIDS caused by medicines of the witches. It is often used if you quarrel with someone… if s/he has got that medicine s/he bewitches you. (VA1, trade centre, male)

Contrary to PLHA, people suffering from "Kondela" were not feared or blamed for a condition which was perceived to have been caused "to" them and not "by" them. This contributed to a situation of collective denial with a negative effect on VCT uptake.

Their relationship with him/her is good because they believe that s/he is bewitched… because they don't really believe that this person has AIDS. If they really knew that this person has AIDS it's tough in the village. S/he is not taken care of. They say: "s/he wanted it, s/he liked it". They know that s/he got it through sex. (VA7, semi rural, female)

They had false beliefs that perhaps s/he is bewitched… s/he says: "I have no disease, they are lying, they didn't check it well… " (healthcare provider 4, female)

if s/he dies… one group will say it's AIDS… but his/her close relatives will oppose it: "it wasn't AIDS, it was "this and this" (witchcraft)… s/he has passed away on unidentified diseases… and s/he wasn't even checked. (VL5, trade centre, male)

### Counting the ways that aboriginal and torres strait islander older people participate in their communities and culture [^bdd6ba3e]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Demographic and Good Spirit Good Life Components Associating With Each Event and Activity

Univariate analyses presented in Supplementary Table 1 reveal that the demographic and Good Spirit Good Life components reported by survey respondents varied across each of the six activities and six events. Males had twofold greater odds of participating in fishing and hunting, while significant lower odds of attending sorry business, NAIDOC, festivals/carnivals, gathering wild plants/berries, arts/crafts, and music/dance/theater. Both 55–64- and 65+-year-old groups reported lower participation in Sports carnivals than the 45–54-year-old group, with the 65+ group also reporting lower participation in fishing and gathering wild/plants or berries relative to the youngest group. The 65+ group did, however, have 56% greater odds of writing/telling stories than the youngest group. Those in remote areas had greater odds for participation in ceremonies funerals/sorry business, sports carnival, fishing, hunting, gathering wild plants/berries; however, participation in NAIDOC, organizations, festivals or carnivals and activities of arts/crafts, music/dance/theater, and written/told stories did not differ by remoteness. Older people recognizing homelands and those identifying with cultural groups had higher odds or participation across all events and activities. Fishing was the only event or activity associated with self-reported good health. Being able to have a say in community was associated with higher odds of participation in most events or activities, as was having a family member removed. Participating in organizations and gathering wild berries/plants associated with higher odds of also reporting discrimination.

### Contention and collaboration: the tenuous encounter of modern ayurveda and Western medicine in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries [^ac804b68]. Medical Humanities (2024). Medium credibility.

Complementary medicine systems are ascending to rapid popularity as the twenty-first century progresses. Often adapted from ancient systems of healing such as Ayurveda, these modern alternative medical movements reappraise millennia-old health traditions that found their inception at the confluence of religious philosophy and herbal healing. Naturally, contemporary global economic forces and a desire to market traditional medicine products in an enticing fashion have characterised how historic traditional medicine systems are presented in the modern context. By establishing a vision of complementary medicine born from ancient traditions, it becomes clear how traditional methods of healing can contend with Western biomedicine-the prevailing standard of care around the globe. The claims made by both sides parry along a line of scientific validity, efficacy and regulatory purview. India, the birthplace of Ayurveda and an epicentre of contemporary medical education, is a prime arena to study the friction between biomedicine and traditional medicine. In this piece, I focus on the modernisation of Ayurveda and how it has found conflict with allopathic medicine. I posit that Ayurveda has re-emerged since the early twentieth century as a key tenet of Indian modernity: and in doing so has found contention with Western medicine. I furthermore argue that despite existing discord, the two medical traditions are not inherently antithetical. They can be synergistic, so long as healthcare delivery and education recognise the limits of each and focus on coaction rather than contradiction.

### Bat and lyssavirus exposure among humans in area that celebrates bat festival, Nigeria, 2010 and 2013 [^b4c963f7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The occurrence of purposeful human interactions with bats, such as hunting for food (e.g. bushmeat), has been identified in several parts of the world and can pose a risk to human health through spillover of zoonotic pathogens from bats to humans. We therefore investigated bat and lyssavirus exposures among humans in an area of Nigeria that celebrates a biannual bat festival. Overall, we found that persons who interact with bats in this area are likely at risk for phylogroup II lyssavirus exposures, and public health precautions are warranted.

Although nearly two thirds of households enrolled in our study had > 1 household members who had ever had bat contact, only about one quarter of households reported having > 1 household members who had ever participated in the bat festival. This finding strongly suggests that a sizable proportion of the human population in the area has had bat exposures unrelated to the bat festival. Furthermore, 10% of persons living within households enrolled in our community surveys had previously had bat contact and 2% had been bitten by a bat. We do not know whether the bat contact and bat bites among these persons are related to participation in the bat festival or to interactions with bats from the festival caves. Because entry into the festival caves is allowed only during the bat festivals, we suspect that many of these persons have had interactions with bats that are not from the festival caves. Regardless, these person-level data on the prevalence of bat contact and bat bites are likely an underestimate of the true prevalence of bat contact and bat bites in the area; persons with a history of bat interactions might not have been available or were not referred by other household members so they were not enrolled in the study, or persons who have had such bat interactions might have failed to report them when responding to the survey.

### Bat and lyssavirus exposure among humans in area that celebrates bat festival, Nigeria, 2010 and 2013 [^db7d1fec]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Although some respondents reported a febrile illness after the 2013 bat festival, this finding was not associated with having recent bat contact or recent participation in the bat festival. We recommend caution in interpreting these findings. A variety of bat species, including R. aegyptiacus, which we identified in the festival caves, are known reservoirs for a range of potential pathogens, including filoviruses and coronaviruses. It is therefore plausible that at least some zoonotic pathogens are present in bats residing in the festival caves and that these pathogens can spill over into humans. Furthermore, the data we present on febrile illness are a snapshot from 2013, and given that excretion of virus in bats can be episodic, the risk of batborne infections may vary over time.

We did not find neutralizing antibodies to lyssaviruses in any person in the study, other than 2 persons who had neutralizing antibodies to rabies virus, perhaps reflecting prior rabies vaccination that was not recalled during the survey or abortive infection from bites of rabid dogs. Thus, we found no evidence of abortive phylogroup II lyssavirus infections among humans in this study, despite the high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to phylogroup II lyssaviruses among bats in the festival caves and that many persons in the area frequently interact with bats. This result is perhaps not surprising. First, as previously explained, we suspect that many interactions with bats among the population are unrelated to the bat festival and unrelated to bats from the festival caves (although bat hunters who participated in the 2013 bat hunter survey, by definition, would have had interaction with bats from the festival caves). The data we present on the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to phylogroup II lyssaviruses among bats are specific to bats from the festival caves and cannot be generalized to other bat populations in the area; the prevalence of these antibodies in other bat populations with which humans also interact might be lower than that for bats from the festival caves. Second, in the Amazon, where abortive lyssavirus infections have been documented, humans likely experience bat bites on a more continuous basis because of the predatory nature of vampire bats. In contrast, the bat festival in this part of Nigeria occurs at discrete times, leading to a lower frequency of bat bites and thus lower risk of lyssavirus exposure. Finally, the dates of the bat festivals vary each year and are determined based on traditional wisdom. Whether the bat festival timing, as determined by cultural leaders, implicitly accounts for periods of lower risk of batborne infections to festival participants warrants further investigation by an interdisciplinary team of biologists and anthropologists.

### Linking coping strategies to locally-perceived aetiologies of mental distress in Northern Rwanda [^bf485f7e]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

'Christians used to come home to pray for me. They really prayed for me… [Also] I took traditional medicines… My neighbours told me to go to traditional healers because they believed I was poisoned [uburozi]… Traditional medicines helped me because I no longer have nightmares… ' (Bizi)

Moreover, for the magical causes, some KIs believed that modern medicine at hospitals is not an appropriate treatment. For them, the treatments that can address the magical causes are spiritual healing and traditional medicine, but not modern medicine.

'They [neighbours] were afraid that if I went to modern hospital, I could get medicines which did not correspond to my illness… They added that modern hospitals are not effective in treating patients who are poisoned'. (Bizi)

However, at the same time, some KIs also acknowledged the effectiveness of modern medicine at hospitals for ihahamuka (trauma) which is caused by the genocide in 1994. Keza talked about a female genocide survivor who was taken to the hospital during the genocide memorial meeting and acknowledged the role of hospitals in the treatment of ihahamuka. However, Keza herself had never gone to the hospital for her own ihungabana (mental disturbance) which was caused by her brother's death in traffic accident.

Keza: 'People suffering from ihungabana are taken to the hospital and doctors provide them with advice. Some are even injected with serum depending on their situation… She [the genocide survivor] saw many horrible things, many people including her own family members being killed in front of her own eyes. So, you understand that the levels of our ihungabana can't be the same'.

### Food availability, perceived food environment and social norm perceptions of healthy and vegetarian food consumption at a public music festival in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional study [^ecc98dda]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Their perception of the injunctive SNs for vegetarian food consumption was stronger (mean: 3.14) than for healthy food, indicating that vegetarian food consumption was seen as more appropriate. This may be due to age, gender and education level. Prior studies reported more vegetarians and flexitarians among younger adultsand highly educated women. While 11% of participants identified as vegetarian, a larger proportion may have been flexitarian. Besides, 55% of participants were female, 40.5% were young adults and 53% were highly educated.

Participants who perceived the FE as more supportive of healthy and vegetarian food consumption also perceived stronger descriptive and injunctive SNs for healthy and vegetarian food consumption. This could indicate that their perception of the FE influenced their SN perceptions or vice versa. Both measures may influence food consumption. Previous studies have found associations between perceptions of an unhealthy FE and fast-food consumption, and associations between vegetarian food consumption and perceived SNs.

Recommendations for policy and research

The findings from this study can serve as input to develop public policies for improved food availability at festivals (eg, guidelines for proportion of healthy/unhealthy food and types of food providers). Inspiration can be taken by what has been done to restrict alcohol and drugs at festivals. Besides, the majority of festival visitors perceived a low availability and accessibility of affordable healthy food, which may encourage policy makers to take initiatives.

Additional research on the availability of healthy and vegetarian food at festivals is needed to validate current findings. More research is also needed to determine how the availability of healthy and vegetarian food at festivals influences consumption on site and daily food consumption in the future. Besides, future research could examine the association between the perceived FE and perceived SNs for healthy and vegetarian food consumption, and their eventual influence on actual food consumption at festivals. Similar studies have been conducted to examine the association between FEs, SNs and food consumption. More research is needed to evaluate the impacts of public policies for festivals targeting food. This study can serve as a baseline to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of such policies.

### Impact of fast-track discharge from cardiothoracic intensive care on family satisfaction [^da026567]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Factors significantly affecting dissatisfaction in our study were those in questions 9, 13, and 14, which is similar to the findings of Damghi et al. Discomfort related to the waiting area was found to affect satisfaction in other studies where relatives experienced "the emotional hell of waiting". In our hospital, the waiting area is a long way from the cardiothoracic ICU. This area is also small and shared with those visiting the coronary care, catheterization, and high-dependency units. Because of the high number of day-case procedures, waiting is often busy during the day.

Demographic and cultural variables

Qatar's population is multinational, and was estimated to be approximately 1.6 million in June 2010. Major ethnic groups include Arabs, those from the Indian subcontinent, and also the Philippines. Major religions include Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism. The majority of the Qatari population is Muslim, a tradition in which family is the basic subunit, with close relations between family members. Islamic traditions encourage supporting and visiting those who are sick. Muslims believe that critical illness and death are God's will, and that family prayers can help overcome these life crises. No single authority exists in the culture of the Indian sub-continent, and diverse opinions and actions are observed. The ideal of longevity is a motive for families to demand life-supporting measures. Many Eastern religions support reverence for the deceased and accept death as a natural event. Compassion is a biphasic act between families and patients in these cultures. Cultural and religious norms suggest lower demands by families of patients in the ICU because acute illness is perceived as predestined and not the caregiver's fault.

### Association of behavior with noise-induced hearing loss among attendees of an outdoor music festival: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^9d2a4f8a]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

To date, factors associated with noise-induced hearing loss at music festivals have not yet been analyzed in a single comprehensive data set. In addition, little is known about the hearing loss-associated behavior of music festival attendees.

Objectives

To assess which factors are associated with the occurrence of a temporary threshold shift (TTS) after music exposure and to investigate the behavior of music festival attendees.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective post hoc analysis gathered data from a randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted on September 5, 2015, at an outdoor music festival in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Adult volunteers with normal hearing were recruited via social media from August 26 through September 3, 2015. Intention to use earplugs was an exclusion criterion. Of 86 volunteers assessed, 51 were included. This post hoc analysis was performed from October 3, 2016, through February 27, 2017.

Interventions

Music festival visit for 4.5 hours.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a TTS on a standard audiogram for the frequencies 3.0- and 4.0-kHz. Multivariable linear regression was performed to determine which factors are associated with a TTS. A questionnaire on behavior, hearing, and tinnitus was distributed to the participants before and after the festival visit.

Results

A total of 51 participants were included (18 men [35%] and 33 women [65%]) with a mean (SD) age of 27 (6) years. Mean (SD) threshold change across 3.0 and 4.0 kHz was 5.4 (5.7) dB for the right ear and 4.0 (6.1) dB for the left ear. Earplug use (absolute difference in the left ear, -6.0 dB [95% CI, -8.7 to -3.2 dB]; in the right ear, -6.4 dB [95% CI, -8.8 to -4.1 dB]), quantity of alcohol use (absolute difference per unit in the left ear, 1.1 dB [95% CI, 0.5 to 1.7 dB]; in the right ear, 0.7 dB [95% CI, 0.1 to 1.4 dB]), drug use (absolute difference in the right ear, 6.0 dB [95% CI, 0.9 to 11.1 dB]), and male sex (absolute difference in the right ear, 4.1 dB [95% CI, 0.3 to 5.9 dB]) were independently associated with hearing loss, with earplug use being the most important factor. Unprotected participants reported significantly worse subjective hearing performance and tinnitus after the festival visit than did participants using earplugs (Cramer V, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47–0.79] and 0.39 [95% CI, 0.16–0.62], respectively). In the earplug group, the perceived loudness (r = -0.72; 95% CI, -1.00 to -0.43) and appreciation (r = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.78) of music and speech perception (r = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.35) were correlated with the duration of earplug use.

Conclusions and Relevance

The present study identified nonuse of earplugs, use of alcohol and drugs, and male sex as associated with a TTS at an outdoor music festival. Physicians should consider these factors to raise awareness about the combined risk of attending music festivals without using earplugs while consuming alcohol and/or drugs. The intention to use earplugs was correlated with the loudness and appreciation of music with earplugs, which may advocate for the use of personalized earplugs.

### Polarization is the psychological foundation of collective engagement [^900fe1e3]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Connecting polarization and protest

Our arguments about the links between polarization and protest become clearer in the context of the history of the last ~15 years. In late 2010, a local Tunisian protest rapidly spread leading to regime change in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, and civil war in Syria. Images of unprecedented anti-government street protests were taken from camera phones to video sharing SNSs (YouTube) and then back across the Arab world through satellite television. These movements achieved change by using technologies that showed dissent as normal, allowed activists to plan action on the street, and promoted revolutionary versions of national identity. In late 2010, Tunisian activists were expressing their version of how they wanted the world to be in video and rap music(much as 16th Century Lutherans challenged the Catholic Church with printed pamphlets and folk music). The Tunisian revolution encapsulates our six propositions (Box 2).

The rapid, massive growth of the anti-regime movement was possible because online technologies provided people with a platform for group discussion. Social media have both informational uses (people can share information to coordinate and organize events) but also play an important role in the social affirmation of opinion. This platform enabled people to share their dissent (creating the conditions for the polarization of opinion) and to organize protests. At the time, new technologies also disrupted the mechanisms for repressing (anti-regime) free speech and (protest) assembly. The Egyptian government could seek to disconnect the country from the internet, but it could not stop protesters from organizing protests in Tahrir Square by SMS. These channels allowed group polarization to occur despite the regime's efforts to the contrary. Repression works by preventing people from interacting with each other(Proposition 1 linking to Proposition 5), precisely because it prevents the polarization of (anti-regime) opinion.

### Pharmacist compliance with therapeutic guidelines on diagnosis and treatment provision [^48e80551]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Limitations

There are 4 main limitations to this study. First, the scenarios selected may not be generalized to the provision of other types of over-the-counter medication. Standardized patients were university undergraduate students from Queensland University of Technology recruited for this study, so inferences drawn may not represent the interactions with other members of the population (eg, different age cohorts). Second, the frequency of noncompliant treatment may be influenced by seasonality or demand (eg, influenza season), which is not well accounted for in our study because data were collected during a short period of time (a few weeks). In particular, research has shown that demand for EHC is substantially higher during weekends, the summer holiday, and major festivals, which is likely the result of increased (unsafe) sexual activities. Although all data collection for scenario 1 was conducted within the Queensland school term with no major festival, we observed an association between the weekend effect and noncompliant behavior. Third, the present study did not capture comparative data on patient-physician interaction and compliance behavior. It is unclear if, for example, overuse of EHC by pharmacists is simply a supply response to market forces imposed by physician behavior. Fourth, it must be noted that there is a gamut of external information (eg, aesthetic, emotive, or contextual factors) involved in the pharmacist-patient interaction that simply cannot all be captured entirely for the purposes of such quality improvement studies.

### Outbreak of salmonellosis associated with consumption of pulled pork at a church festival-hamilton county, Ohio, 2010 [^ddb1e625]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

On June 18, 2010, Hamilton County Public Health (HCPH), a local health department in Ohio, began receiving reports of gastrointestinal illness from persons who attended a church festival held during June 11–13 in a suburban community of Hamilton County. HCPH investigated and confirmed the existence of a foodborne outbreak associated with consumption of pulled pork prepared in a private home and sold at the church festival. Sixty-four attendees with gastroenteritis were identified. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) was found in stool specimens from three patients; no other pathogen was found. Because the outbreak was identified after the church festival had concluded, the environmental investigation was limited to interviews of food handlers. The primary public health interventions consisted of 1) active surveillance for additional cases of salmonellosis associated with the festival, 2) consultation with the festival organizers and food vendors to ensure the pork product was not resold or consumed elsewhere, 3) education of the festival organizers and food vendors about relevant public health regulations and food safety practices, 4) traceback of the implicated product to the retailer in Indiana, and 5) notification of the Indiana State Department of Health. The results of the investigation call attention to the public health implications of unregulated food service at events such as church festivals, which generally are exempt from public health inspection and licensure in Ohio. Food sold in such environments might place populations at risk for foodborne illness.

The following case is unfortunately typical of the Jogini and sheds light on a potentially disastrous public health problem in rural South India.

### Ramadan education and awareness in diabetes (READ) programme for muslims with type 2 diabetes who fast during ramadan [^d2cb4d3f]. Diabetic Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

During Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to dusk for one lunar month. The majority of Muslim diabetic patients are unaware of complications such as hypoglycaemia during fasting. The safety of fasting has not been assessed in the UK Muslim population with diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of Ramadan-focused education on weight and hypoglycaemic episodes during Ramadan in a Type 2 diabetic Muslim population taking oral glucose-lowering agents.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed two groups. Group A attended a structured education programme about physical activity, meal planning, glucose monitoring, hypoglycaemia, dosage and timing of medications. Group B did not. Hypoglycaemia was defined as home blood glucose < 3.5 mmol/l.

Results

There was a mean weight loss of 0.7 kg after Ramadan in group A, compared with a 0.6-kg mean weight gain in group B (P < 0.001). The weight changes observed were independent of the class of glucose-lowering agents used. There was a significant decrease in the total number of hypoglycaemic events in group A, from nine to five, compared with an increase in group B from nine to 36 (P < 0.001). The majority were in patients treated with short-acting sulphonylureas (group A-100%, group B-94%). At 12 months after attending the programme, glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) reduction were sustained in group A.

Conclusions

Ramadan-focused education in diabetes can empower patients to change their lifestyle during Ramadan. It minimizes the risk of hypoglycaemic events and prevents weight gain during this festive period for Muslims, which potentially benefits metabolic control.

### Emergency department patient burden from an electronic dance music festival [^5b7f5fc2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Electronic dance music (EDM) festivals are increasingly common and psychoactive substance use is prevalent. Although prehospital care can obviate the transfer of many attendees to health care facilities (HCFs), little is known regarding the emergency department (ED) burden of patients presenting from EDM festivals.

Objectives

This study describes the patient volume, length of stay (LOS), and presenting complaints of patients from a 3-day EDM festival in close proximity to an area ED.

Methods

Medical charts of patients presenting to one HCF from an EDM festival were reviewed for substances used, ED LOS, and sedative medications administered. Additionally, preparedness techniques are described.

Results

Over the 3-day festival, 28 patients presented to the ED (median age 21 years; range 18–29 years). Twenty-five had complaints related to substance use including ethanol (n = 18), "molly" or "ecstasy" (n = 13), and marijuana (n = 8). Three patients required intensive care or step-down unit admission for endotracheal intubation, rhabdomyolysis, and protracted altered mental status. The median LOS for discharged patients was 265 min (interquartile range 210–347 min). Eleven patients required the use of sedative medications, with cumulative doses of 42 mg of lorazepam and 350 mg of ketamine. All patients presented within the hours of 5:00 pm and 2:15 am.

Conclusion

The majority of ED visits from an EDM festival were related to substance use. ED arrival times clustered during the evening and were associated with prolonged LOS. Few patients required hospital admission, but admitted patients required high levels of care. HCFs should use these data as a guide in planning for future events.

### There is always something new out of Africa [^9b9a2324]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

"In order to make people look, you have to make it extraordinary". Twin's interpretation of this tightly woven cultural fabric had immediate and wide popular appeal. His works, usually intense personal variations of Yoruba myth often interspersed with his own life story, were well received at home and abroad and inspired many followers and imitators. He exhibited in France, Finland, and Japan. But he also experienced the downside of fame, along with financial and other difficulties. He fled Nigeria and traveled to the United States, where he settled for a while in Philadelphia. His work, again recognized and appreciated, is now found in museums around the world.

"I was doing it because that was what came from my mind", the artist said referring to his subject matter, the unseen. His approach was syndetic, circuitous, and surprising. He started working on one end of the canvas and continued until every bit of the surface was covered, leaving the impression that more could always be added. He reveled in complexity and used it to engage the viewer. "I want to make a picture where the more you look, the more you see". Still and always a musician, he found a rhythm and danced to it, creating dynamic and repetitive patterns in a seemingly endless continuous design. "It is helpful to have something else to do after you've made a mistake", he advised. "You come back, and the mistake is fixed. Your subconscious will solve it". Continuous engagement opens up the world.

The title The Lazy Hunters, and the Poisonous Wrestlers, Lizard Ghost and the Cobra of the painting on this month's cover suggests a scene from some Yoruba tale but offers no further explanation. Like the plot in a folk opera with spoken parts along with music and dance, such as some that the artist himself may have participated in, it involves the common people, hunters, bumping into the extrahuman in the "bush of ghosts". They are clearly at a disadvantage as they huddle in the corner under the serpent in the ferocious lizard claws of his imagination, affirming that African myths with animals are often about the strengths or foibles of people.

### Outbreak of salmonellosis associated with consumption of pulled pork at a church festival-hamilton county, Ohio, 2010 [^c654a4f9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

On June 18, 2010, Hamilton County Public Health (HCPH), a local health department in Ohio, began receiving reports of gastrointestinal illness from persons who attended a church festival held during June 11–13 in a suburban community of Hamilton County. HCPH investigated and confirmed the existence of a foodborne outbreak associated with consumption of pulled pork prepared in a private home and sold at the church festival. Sixty-four attendees with gastroenteritis were identified. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) was found in stool specimens from three patients; no other pathogen was found. Because the outbreak was identified after the church festival had concluded, the environmental investigation was limited to interviews of food handlers. The primary public health interventions consisted of 1) active surveillance for additional cases of salmonellosis associated with the festival, 2) consultation with the festival organizers and food vendors to ensure the pork product was not resold or consumed elsewhere, 3) education of the festival organizers and food vendors about relevant public health regulations and food safety practices, 4) traceback of the implicated product to the retailer in Indiana, and 5) notification of the Indiana State Department of Health. The results of the investigation call attention to the public health implications of unregulated food service at events such as church festivals, which generally are exempt from public health inspection and licensure in Ohio. Food sold in such environments might place populations at risk for foodborne illness.
