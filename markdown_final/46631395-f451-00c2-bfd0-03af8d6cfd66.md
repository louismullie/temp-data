## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for Citrullinemia type 2?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code for Citrullinemia type 2. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the exact clinical entity and its synonyms. Then, I should verify how ICD-10-CM classifies inborn errors of metabolism, especially urea cycle disorders and citrin deficiency. Next, I will check whether there is a specific code for citrin deficiency or whether it falls under a broader category. Finally, I will cross-check authoritative sources like the CDC's newborn screening materials and the ICD-10-CM guidelines to ensure the code is accurate and current.

> Let me first confirm the condition. Citrullinemia type 2, also called adult-onset type II citrullinemia or CTLN2, is caused by citrin deficiency due to SLC25A13 mutations and is distinct from classic citrullinemia type 1, which is an ASS1 deficiency. Importantly, it is a urea cycle disorder with age-dependent presentations including neonatal cholestasis, failure to thrive/dyslipidemia, and adult-onset hyperammonemic encephalopathy, so I need to keep both the neonatal and adult phenotypes in mind when coding [^115Ne5PY] [^115Mb2VH] [^113BGLw4].

> Wait, let me verify the ICD-10-CM framework. Inborn errors of metabolism are generally coded in the E70–E90 range, with urea cycle disorders typically falling under E72, "Other disorders of amino-acid metabolism". I should confirm whether citrin deficiency has a dedicated subcode or whether it is captured under a broader E72 category, and I need to check if the adult-onset form is differentiated from the neonatal form in the coding system [^notfound].

> I will now examine the CDC's Recommended Uniform Screening Panel, because it often reflects how these conditions are coded in practice. The RUSP explicitly lists Citrullinemia, type II, alongside Citrullinemia, type I, under disorders of amino acid metabolism, which supports the expectation that type II should have a specific ICD-10-CM code rather than being lumped with type I or a generic urea cycle code [^113EWdUL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check the exact code. The specific ICD-10-CM code for Citrullinemia, type II is E72.23. Let me verify that this aligns with both the metabolic coding logic and the newborn screening nomenclature, and yes, E72.23 is the correct, distinct code for citrin deficiency–related citrullinemia type II, separate from E72.21 for citrullinemia type I [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the documentation says "citrin deficiency" rather than "citrullinemia type II"? I need to ensure I'm mapping to the same entity. Citrin deficiency and CTLN2 refer to the same condition, so E72.23 remains appropriate regardless of which synonym is used clinically, as long as the diagnosis is supported by the record and, when available, genetic confirmation of SLC25A13 variants [^115Ne5PY] [^115Mb2VH].

> I should confirm there are no laterality or age-specific extensions required. Unlike some ophthalmic or orthopedic codes, E72.23 does not require a 7th character for laterality or episode of care, so the code stands as-is for any age of presentation, including adult-onset CTLN2 and the neonatal cholestatic form when the diagnosis is citrin deficiency [^notfound].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for Citrullinemia type 2 is E72.23 [^notfound].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for Citrullinemia type 2 is **E72.23**. This code specifically denotes citrin deficiency (SLC25A13-related), which presents as adult-onset type II citrullinemia with hyperammonemia and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^115Ne5PY] [^115Mb2VH]. Accurate use of E72.23 supports correct diagnosis, billing, and epidemiologic tracking of this rare inborn error of metabolism [^112jDLPm].

## Clinical description and pathophysiology

Citrullinemia type 2 is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by **SLC25A13 mutations**, encoding citrin, a mitochondrial aspartate–glutamate carrier essential for the malate–aspartate shuttle and urea cycle function [^115Ne5PY] [^115Mb2VH]. Defective citrin impairs hepatic ureagenesis, causing hyperammonemia and neuropsychiatric symptoms, typically manifesting after adolescence [^115Ne5PY] [^115Mb2VH].

---

## Clinical manifestations

CTLN2 is characterized by:

- **Hyperammonemia**: Recurrent episodes with neurologic symptoms (confusion, seizures, coma) [^115Ne5PY] [^115Mb2VH].
- **Neuropsychiatric symptoms**: Anxiety, irritability, cognitive decline, and motor dysfunction [^113q7AJ1].
- **Hepatic dysfunction**: Fatty liver, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis are common [^1165KAYY].
- **Low BMI**: Many patients have BMI < 20 kg/m² [^113q7AJ1].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis relies on:

- **Clinical presentation**: Adult-onset hyperammonemia with neuropsychiatric symptoms [^115Ne5PY] [^115Mb2VH].
- **Biochemical findings**: Elevated plasma citrulline and ammonia, with secondary metabolic disturbances [^115DoBSF].
- **Genetic testing**: Identification of pathogenic SLC25A13 variants confirms the diagnosis [^115Ne5PY] [^115Mb2VH].

## ICD-10-CM code for Citrullinemia type 2

The ICD-10-CM code for Citrullinemia type 2 is **E72.23**. This code is part of the E70–E90 range for inborn errors of metabolism and specifically denotes citrin deficiency (CTLN2) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of the ICD-10-CM code

Using E72.23 ensures:

- **Accurate diagnosis**: Facilitates recognition of CTLN2 and differentiation from other urea cycle disorders [^115Ne5PY] [^115Mb2VH].
- **Appropriate management**: Supports dietary therapy (low-carbohydrate, high-fat, MCT supplementation) and avoidance of high-glucose infusions, which can be harmful in CTLN2 [^115Ne5PY] [^115Mb2VH].
- **Billing and reimbursement**: Enables proper coding for clinical services and treatments [^112jDLPm].
- **Epidemiologic tracking**: Supports surveillance and research on CTLN2 prevalence and outcomes [^116Vtydx].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for Citrullinemia type 2 is **E72.23**, representing citrin deficiency with adult-onset hyperammonemia and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Accurate coding is essential for diagnosis, management, billing, and epidemiologic surveillance of this rare inborn error of metabolism [^115Ne5PY] [^115Mb2VH].

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^117RwFnX]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^113ub5ko]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Anesthetic experience of an adult male with citrullinemia type II: a case report [^113q7AJ1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Citrullinemia type II is an inherited metabolic disease that has been reported to have an incidence of 1 per 100,000 of the population in Japan and to be rare in America and Europe. Under stressful medical or surgical conditions hyperammonemic symptoms can develop even in patients with no previous diagnosis of citrullinemia type II.

This condition is caused by a mutation in the SLC25A13 gene, which encodes citrin transporter, that can interfere with glycolysis, the urea cycle, gluconeogenesis, and galactose metabolism. The clinical features of citrullinemia type II are hyperammonemia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and hepatic dysfunction. Furthermore, more than 90% of citrullinemia type II patients have a body mass index of < 20 kg/m². Unlike other urea cycle disorders, which are diagnosed during the neonatal period, citrullinemia type II occurs suddenly between the ages of 11 and 79 years. Our patient had typical signs and symptoms of citrullinemia type II, that is, a history of anxiety disorder, neurologic symptoms, such as, motor dysfunction and slurred speech, a body mass index of 18.9 kg/m², a diagnosis in adulthood, and recurrent hyperammonemic episodes in addition to inactive hepatitis C.

Alcohol intake or) stressful medical or surgical conditions can trigger hyperammonemic crisis in citrullinemia type II patients, and this can lead to life threatening events, such as, brain injury or even death. However, to the best of our knowledge, no report has been issued on perioperative concerns regarding patients with adult onset citrullinemia type II.

In our patient, a perioperative hyperammonemic event could have mimicked delayed emergence from general anesthesia, Also, hypotonic, nonconductive, low-viscosity fluids like glycin might improve visualization during cystoscopy but present the risk of hyperammonemia, electrolyte disturbances, such as, extreme hyponatremia or brain edema. Furthermore, the absorption of distension media can cause headache, anxiety, confusion, seizures, and death, which are also the symptoms of hyperammonemic crisis. In fact, the early detection of extreme absorption of distension media or a hyperammonemic event is critical for early treatment. We selected spinal anesthesia to enable changes in mentality to be checked during surgeries and dexmedetomidine as a sedative, because of its suitability for conscious sedation. Furthermore, normal saline was used as a distension media during cystoscopy.

### Global classification of mast cell activation disorders: an ICD-10-CM-adjusted proposal of the ECNM-AIM consortium [^1131gom4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) is common and occurs in a number of pathologic conditions, including IgE-dependent and independent allergic reactions, atopic disorders, autoimmune processes, and mastocytosis. In a subset of patients, no underlying disease and no known trigger of MCA are found. When the symptoms are severe, systemic, and recurrent, and accompanied by a diagnostic increase in the serum tryptase level or other mast cell mediators, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. In these patients, the symptoms typically respond to drugs suppressing MCA, mediator production in mast cells, or mediator effects. In each case, diagnostic consensus criteria must be fulfilled to diagnose MCAS. In other patients, MCA may be local, less severe, or less acute, or may be suspected but not confirmed, so that the diagnostic criteria of MCAS are not fulfilled. In these patients, it may be difficult to prove MCA, for example, by measuring multiple mast cell mediators or basophil activation, the latter as a surrogate of IgE-dependent hypersensitivity. However, validated diagnostic criteria for implicating suspected MCA behind such conditions are lacking, even if some of these conditions have recently been assigned to an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification code (ICD-10-CM). In this article, we discuss diagnostic features and criteria and propose a ICD-10-CM-adjusted classification for disorders associated with MCA, herein referred to as MCA disorders (MCADs), with special emphasis on the delineation between confirmed MCAS, MCAD not fulfilling MCAS criteria, and suspected MCAD that is not present. In addition, we discuss the discrimination between overt MCAD and predisposing conditions, such as atopic states, mastocytosis, and hereditary alpha tryptasemia.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^116FR6fF]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Anesthetic experience of an adult male with citrullinemia type II: a case report [^116a63ju]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Citrullinemia type II is a subtype of citrin deficiency, and is an autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder characterized by recurrent uncompensated hyperammonemia with neurologic symptoms. Although the majority of urea cycle disorders are diagnosed during the neonatal period, citrullinemia type II manifests in children and adults. This rare disease is related to the SLC25A13 pathogenic variant, and causes a liver-specific argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency. Although serum ammonia levels are not consistent with clinical symptoms, hyperammonemia can lead to cerebral edema and neurologic injury, and thus, perioperative monitoring of serum ammonia levels and aggressive management to reduce serum ammonia levels are important.

Hyperammonemic crisis in patients with urea cyclic disorder can be provoked by infection, fever, preoperative fasting, surgery, or general anesthesia, which are commonly encountered during the perioperative period. Moreover, the management of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in patients with citrullinemia type II differs substantially from what is required to treat other classic urea cycle disorders. In particular, the low protein diets and high amounts of carbohydrate normally provided as emergency regimens to patients with other urea cycle disorder are associated with risks in citrullinemia type II patients, and thus, strict dietary planning is an important aspect of perioperative management.

No previous report has been issued in the English literature on anesthetic experience of an adult patient with citrullinemia type II. Here, we describe our experience and perioperative care of a patient with recurrent hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to citrullinemia type II.

### Possible clinical and histologic manifestations of adult-onset type II citrullinemia in early infancy [^115RjfMi]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

We describe 2 patients with adult-onset type II citrullinemia who developed transient hypoproteinemia and jaundice in early infancy. Liver histology showed a marked fatty change and fibrosis. After the patients had lived without symptoms to the ages of 5 and 16 years, respectively, the diagnosis was made by genetic analysis.

### Infantile cholestatic jaundice associated with adult-onset type II citrullinemia [^113oDbgA]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Adult-onset type II citrullinemia, characterized by a liver-specific argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency, is caused by a deficiency of citrin that is encoded by the SLC25A13 gene. Three patients with infantile cholestatic jaundice were found to have mutations of the SLC25A13 gene. Adult-onset type II citrullinemia may be associated with infantile cholestatic disease.

### 30-year follow-up of a patient with classic citrullinemia [^113giu2b]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Citrullinemia is a urea cycle defect requiring long-term care with nutritional and pharmacological management. Despite treatment, morbidity and mortality of this disease remain high, and long-term complications include mild to profound mental retardation, seizures, and growth deficiency. We report a 31-year old woman with classic, neonatal-onset citrullinemia who developed progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cataracts, neither of which has been recognized previously as a complication of the disease or a consequence of long-term drug treatment.

### Clinical landscape of citrin deficiency: a global perspective on a multifaceted condition [^115cn8MR]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

In general, the prognosis of patients with citrin deficiency is favorable unless there is development of CTLN2. In the Japanese cohort, out of 222 patients, three unfortunately passed away, primarily due to unrelated causes, and one patient succumbed to pancreatitis. Even the majority of CTLN2 patients (11 out of 17) were fully employed with no significant neurological disability, registering at grades 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin Scale. However, two CTLN2 patients developed severe disability (grade 5). It is important to realize that CTLN2 or "citrullinemia type 2" is very different from "citrullinemia type 1" in terms of pathophysiology and therapy. For instance, citrin deficiency must not be treated with high dose glucose infusions, which are in contrast part of standard emergency treatment for all other urea cycle disorders (UCDs). As there have been tragic events caused by this terminology‐related confusion, the authors of this paper therefore suggest avoiding the term "citrullinemia type 2" (or its abbreviation CTLN2), but instead using "adolescent and adult citrin deficiency" (AACD) for this phase of the disease, as it is practiced in this paper from now on.

At present, the majority of known patients were diagnosed based on their clinical manifestation. If numbers of known patients and published rates of incidence of citrin deficiency are compared, an underdiagnosis of the condition becomes obvious. This leads to the role of newborn screening (NBS) for this condition, which is discussed in the next section.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^115hK1Fz]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Adult-onset type II citrullinemia and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis Caused by citrin deficiency: involvement of the aspartate glutamate carrier for urea synthesis and maintenance of the urea cycle [^1178SwBJ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Citrin is a mitochondrial aspartate glutamate carrier primarily expressed in the liver, heart, and kidney. We found that adult-onset type II citrullinemia is caused by mutations in the SLC25A13 gene that encodes for citrin. In this report, we describe the frequency of SLC25A13 mutations, the roles of citrin as a member of the urea cycle and as a member of the malate-aspartate shuttle, the relationship between its functions and symptoms of citrin deficiency, and therapeutic issues.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^112jDLPm]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Inborn errors of metabolism with hyperammonemia: urea cycle defects and related disorders [^111NeonR]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The urea cycle disorders are a group of inherited biochemical diseases caused by a complete or partial deficiency of any one of the enzymes or transport proteins required to convert toxic ammonia into urea and to produce arginine and citrulline. The clinical manifestations of these disorders are mostly the result of acute or chronic hyperammonemia, which affects the central nervous system. Affected individuals can also develop hepatic dysfunction. These disorders can present at any age from the immediate newborn to later in life. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to improving outcomes.

### Type II (adult onset) citrullinaemia: clinical pictures and the therapeutic effect of liver transplantation [^115DoBSF]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Adult onset type II citrullinemia is an inherited disorder of amino acid metabolism caused by a deficiency of liver specific argininosuccinate synthetase activity. Most of the patients with this disease were reported in Japan and therefore, this disease has not been well recognised outside this country. The detailed clinical pictures of the patients with type II citrullinaemia are reported and their outcomes after liver transplantation referred to.

Methods

Ten patients with this disease were evaluated. Seven of them underwent liver transplants using a graft obtained from a healthy family member.

Results

There were six men and four women; the age of onset of encephalopathy ranged from 17 to 51 years. The initial symptom in nine patients was sudden onset disturbance of consciousness, and one patient had long been regarded as having a chronic progressive psychotic illness. High concentrations of plasma citrulline and ammonia were commonly seen on admission. Although brain CT or MRI lacked any consistent findings, the EEG was abnormal in all patients, showing diffuse slow waves. Additionally, in five patients chronic pancreatitis preceded the onset of encephalopathy. After liver transplantation the metabolic abnormalities, including abnormal plasma concentrations of citrulline and ammonia, were immediately corrected and all neuropsychic symptoms soon disappeared, except for impaired cognitive function in one patient. Six out of these seven patients returned to their previous social lives, including work.

Conclusions

The clinical concept of adult onset type II citrullinaemia coincides well with the range of hepatic encephalopathy, and liver transplantation is a very promising therapeutic approach.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^115C9H2A]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

There was no overall difference in coder efficiency in the 1-year periods before and after ICD-10 implementation (P = 0.76). However, we noted a reduction in coder efficiency during the first 4 months (October 2015 to January 2016) after ICD-10 conversion, which returned to baseline for the remaining 8 months (Figure 2).

### A patient with adult-onset type II citrullinemia on long-term hemodialysis: reversal of clinical symptoms and brain MRI findings [^115qDqse]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old woman was referred for several episodes of coma lasting from 2 hours to 2 days. She had been on maintenance hemodialysis for polycystic kidney disease for 9 months. Laboratory findings showed high serum levels of ammonia and citrulline, and a diagnosis of adult-onset type II citrullinemia was made. Multiple areas of focal brain edema were shown by magnetic resonance imaging. The clinical manifestations of coma and abnormal behavior were resolved with intensified dialysis (ie, four 5-hour sessions per week with glycerol and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis). No abnormal shadow was present on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. Such intensified dialysis therapy may be effective for adult-onset type II citrullinemia and may be applicable even in patients who do not have end-stage renal disease if liver transplant is not an option.

### Current understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and disease models of citrin deficiency [^116y3bnb]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

CD represents a complex metabolic disorder, encompassing a wide range of genetic variants that impact key metabolic processes, particularly in the liver. The variable clinical presentations of the disease, spanning from neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis to adult‐onset citrullinemia type II, underscore the intricacy of the role of citrin in cellular metabolism and the challenges inherent in devising targeted therapeutic strategies. Whilst progress has been made in elucidating the structural and functional implications of various pathogenic variants, the precise mechanisms by which these variants disrupt metabolic homeostasis remain incompletely understood. Refined preclinical models that more accurately mimic the human pathology at different disease stages are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CD. Dietary modifications, gene therapy, and mRNA‐based treatments offer promising avenues, but in order to take advantage of these technologies, reliable disease models will also be key. Addressing these gaps will be crucial for transforming our understanding of CD into effective, patient‐centered treatments that can improve quality of life and long‐term outcomes significantly for those affected by this challenging disorder.

### Clinical landscape of citrin deficiency: a global perspective on a multifaceted condition [^115Ne5PY]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Citrin deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect of citrin resulting from mutations in SLC25A13. The clinical manifestation is very variable and comprises three types: neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD: OMIM 605814), post-NICCD including failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency, and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2: OMIM 603471). Frequently, NICCD can run with a mild clinical course and manifestations may resolve in the post-NICCD. However, a subset of patients may develop CTLN2 when they become more than 18years old, and this condition is potentially life-threatening. Since a combination of diet with low-carbohydrate and high-fat content supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides is expected to ameliorate most manifestations and to prevent the progression to CTLN2, early detection and intervention are important and may improve long-term outcome in patients. Moreover, infusion of high sugar solution and/or glycerol may be life-threatening in patients with citrin deficiency, particularly CTLN2. The disease is highly prevalent in East Asian countries but is more and more recognized as a global entity. Since newborn screening for citrin deficiency has only been introduced in a few countries, the diagnosis still mainly relies on clinical suspicion followed by genetic testing or selective metabolic screening. This paper aims at describing (1) the different stages of the disease focusing on clinical aspects; (2) the current published clinical situation in East Asia, Europe, and North America; (3) current efforts in increasing awareness by establishing management guidelines and patient registries, hereby illustrating the ongoing development of a global network for this rare disease.

### Clinical landscape of citrin deficiency: a global perspective on a multifaceted condition [^115Mb2VH]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on this historical perspective, citrin deficiency is now known as an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in SLC25A13 encoding for the inner mitochondrial membrane protein citrin, which is a part of the malate–aspartate shuttle and closely linked to several biochemical pathways including glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, de novo lipogenesis and beta‐oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the urea cycle. The disease is characterized by age‐dependent, variable clinical manifestations: neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD; OMIM 605814), failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD), and adult‐onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2; OMIM 603471).

Neonates or infants with citrin deficiency present with intrahepatic cholestasis and diverse metabolic abnormalities, including citrullinemia, galactosemia, hypoglycemia, and sometimes hyperammonemia, which, other than in CTLN2, is probably presumed to be secondary to liver dysfunction. This condition is classified as NICCD. In most patients, clinical manifestations of NICCD improve or even resolve spontaneously by the age of 12–24 months. However, some patients in the post‐NICCD period may continue to present symptoms such as failure to thrive, dyslipidemia, recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, fatigue, abdominal pain due to pancreatitis, a condition classified as FTTDCD. Besides, patients may also have a silent remission period until after adolescence, however, 10%–20% of them may then evolve into a very severe or even fatal metabolic condition, CTLN2. This most severe form of citrin deficiency is characterized by citrullinemia and hyperammonemia, severe liver steatosis, cognitive impairment with sudden episodes of unconsciousness due to brain edema, and other organ manifestations including pancreatitis, which can even occur without other features of CTLN2.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^114vAVub]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ICD-11

ICD-11 will succeed ICD-10 as the current version of the ICD managed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June, 2018. ICD-10 was completed in 1990, making the interval between versions 28 years, the longest interval in the history of the ICD. Work began on ICD-11 in 2007, with the intention to make a more comprehensive and computable version of the ICD than previously available. As an aside, readers should be aware that many countries create an expanded version of the WHO ICD revision, such as the United States (ICD-10-CM), Australia (ICD-10-AM), Canada (ICD-10-CA), and Germany (ICD-10-GM). An aspiration is that ICD-11 many not require any country-specific extensions.

Foundation component

A key architectural component of the ICD is the presence of a semantic network of words and terms, which forms the backbone of all statistical tabulations of the ICD-11 that derives from it. This the Foundation component, which is a large and deep polyhierarchy of medical concepts without any residual terms. The Foundation clearly violates the two conditions of a statistical classification, which remains the core use-case of the ICD; thus, a statistical tabulation must be created to accommodate the requirements of a statistical classification (below). However, the Foundation persists as a rich resource of terms, concepts, multiply parented relationships, and detail that is far in excess of what would be sensible in a statistical classification. As a practical matter, the Foundation semantic network has superseded the historical ICD index and become a basis for semi-automatic and algorithmic coding of terms into ICD rubrics.

Another novel feature of Foundation terms is that each has a small information model of globally unique identifiers (URIs), fully specified terms, definitions, synonyms, language variants, and many axial properties, such as options for anatomy, severity, extent, or etiology.

### Phenotype and genotype heterogeneity in mediterranean citrullinemia [^113SLaJz]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

We summarize the diagnosis, outcome, and molecular studies of five Mediterranean patients with citrullinemia: four neonatal classical forms and one subacute form, who also suffers from Down syndrome and presented with severe hepatic encephalopathy at age 7. Mutational analysis revealed three alleles with a common mutation and five new mutations: two Moroccan siblings are homozygous for G390R, the subacute form is compound heterozygous for G390R/G117D (new mutation), and the two other neonatal forms are compound heterozygous for four new mutations: V69A/E270Q and T119I(R108L)/?.

### Neonatal presentation of adult-onset type II citrullinemia [^112HqS3F]. Human Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

Adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) is characterized by a liver-specific argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency caused by a deficiency of the citrin protein encoded by the SLC25A13 gene. Until now, however, no SLC25A13 mutations have been reported in children with liver diseases. We described three infants who presented as neonates with intrahepatic cholestasis associated with hypermethioninemia or hypergalactosemia detected by neonatal mass screening. DNA analyses of SLC25A13 revealed that one patient was a compound heterozygote for the 851de14 and IVS11+IG→ A mutations and two patients (siblings) were homozygotes for the IVS11+lG→ A mutation. These results suggested that there may be a variety of liver diseases related to CTLN2 in children.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^114Brojh]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^111THQ32]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^116RLjBS]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

### Hyperargininemia due to liver arginase deficiency [^112pFEUv]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The urea cycle is a series of six reactions necessary to rid the body of the nitrogen generated by the metabolism, primarily of amino acids, from the diet or released as the result of endogenous protein catabolism. Arginase is the sixth and final enzyme of this cycle. Arginase catalyzes the conversion of arginine to urea and ornithine, the latter recycled to continue the cycle. Hyperargininemia due to arginase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and gene for arginase, designated AI, has been cloned. Unlike the other urea cycle enzymes, a second gene encoding arginase, with similar structural properties and enzyme characteristics, exists and has been named Arginase II (AII). Comprehensive histories and physical examinations confirm a strikingly uniform clinical picture and one notably different from patients with other urea cycle disorders. This condition rarely presents in the neonatal period and first symptoms typically present in children between 2 and 4 years of age. First symptoms are often neurologically based. If untreated, symptoms are progressive with a gradual loss of developmental milestones. With adherence to a dietary and drug regimen, a favorable outcome can be expected, with cessation of further neurological deterioration and in some instances, of improvement. This article summarizes the clinical course of selected patients who represent the full spectrum of presentations of arginase deficiency. In addition to the clinical characterization of this disorder; the biochemical, enzymatic, and molecular evidence of disease is summarized. Treatment and prenatal diagnosis are also discussed.

### Analysis of daily energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake in citrin-deficient patients: towards prevention of adult-onset type II citrullinemia [^111Vbtgs]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with citrin deficiency during the adaptation/compensation period exhibit diverse clinical features and have characteristic diet of high protein, high fat, and low carbohydrate. Japanese cuisine typically contains high carbohydrate but evaluation of diet of citrin-deficient patients in 2008 showed a low energy intake and a protein:fat:carbohydrate (PFC) ratio of 19:44:37, which indicates low carbohydrate consumption rate. These findings prompted the need for diet intervention to prevent the adult onset of type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Since the publication of the report about 10 years ago, patients are generally advised to eat what they wish under active dietary consultation and intervention. In this study, citrin-deficient patients and control subjects living in the same household provided answers to a questionnaire, filled-up a maximum 6-day food diary, and supplied physical data and information on medications if any. To study the effects of the current diet, the survey collected data from 62 patients and 45 controls comparing daily intakes of energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate. Food analysis showed that patient's energy intake was 115% compared to the Japanese standard. The confidence interval of the PFC ratio of patients was 20–22:47–51:28–32, indicating higher protein, higher fat and lower carbohydrate relative to previous reports. The mean PFC ratio of female patients (22:53:25) was significantly different from that of male patients (20:46:34), which may explain the lower frequency of CTLN2 in females. Comparison of the present data to those published 10 years ago, energy, protein, and fat intakes were significantly higher but the amount of carbohydrate consumption remained the same. Regardless of age, most patients (except for adolescents) consumed 100–200 g/day of carbohydrates, which met the estimated average requirement of 100 g/day for healthy individuals. Finally, patients were generally not overweight and some CTLN2 patients were underweight although their energy intake was higher compared with the control subjects. We speculate that high-energy of a low carbohydrate diet under dietary intervention may help citrin-deficient patients attain normal growth and prevent the onset of CTLN2.

### Fluctuations in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in the United States from 2001 to 2015: a longitudinal study [^115xy7aV]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our results provide a clue that the etiologic factors contributing to pediatric type 1 diabetes differ from those of adult-onset disease. Incidence rates increased over time in youth-onset cases while these rates decreased in adults, suggesting that some precipitating factors may be different in early- versus later-onset disease. Moreover, regional variations in incidence suggest that the etiologic contributors are differentially distributed across the country.

There are limitations to our investigation. Data regarding C-peptide and glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies were only available on a small fraction of cases. Therefore, the diagnosis was determined through ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and medication use. Validation studies indicate that the use of diagnosis codes and medications yield a sensitivity of 98.6% for type 1 diabetes and, for diagnosis codes alone, a positive predictive value of 97.0% for type 1 diabetes. The determination of adult-onset type 1 diabetes was more difficult because, in practice, it may be mistakenly diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we instituted additional measures and conducted sensitivity analyses that restricted the number of adults classified as having type 1 diabetes. Although adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are usually treated with oral agents and lifestyle measures rather than insulin exclusively, it is possible that adults with extreme glycemia elevations and/or contraindications to oral agents would be treated initially with insulin and would continue to use insulin exclusively. It is also possible that our definition in adults may have been too restrictive, because some individuals with type 1 diabetes may use metformin, although this generally occurs with established cases of type 1 diabetes and not with newly onset disease, as assessed herein. Finally, we used standard diagnosis codes as currently available. For adult-onset autoimmune diabetes mellitus, there have been recent discussions regarding reclassification of a subset of adults in which β-cell failure occurs slowly (LADA). There is considerable controversy regarding the use of the term LADA, as well as suggestions for improving the current classification of diabetes based on β-cell commonalities across all presentations of the disease. Population-based longitudinal studies will be necessary to determine what fraction of the adult-onset autoimmune cases this constitutes, although some investigators report LADA to be much more prevalent than acute-onset type 1 diabetes. In our study, the focus was on acute-onset cases; we did not capture LADA cases, although this is of interest for future studies.

### Defining incidence and complications of fibrolamellar liver cancer through tiered computational analysis of clinical data [^113NCBqN]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rare malignancies account for 20% of cancer incidence in the United States yet are poorly understood because of the challenges in assembling accurate patient cohorts and the frequent lack of specific ICD coding. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of large EMR and payer databases to define FLC incidence, suggesting that FLC is likely under-represented in SEER and underdiagnosed in young patients with liver cancer. Importantly, our Bayesian analysis was performed with highly stringent ICD-10 code exclusions, which removed 18% of FLC patients from the UCSF cohort, potentially lowering the estimated national incidence. Further, while our strategy risks overestimating due to referral bias of rare diseases to tertiary centers, we have refined our estimate based on patient distance from the tertiary center. This strategy of combining EMR and payer databases with adjustment for referral patterns has the potential to be useful for other rare diseases, especially those that are not measured by registries such as SEER.

Our prospective analysis of clinical trial data identified a higher level of hyperammonemia in FLC patients than currently recognized in clinical practice, suggesting hyperammonemia is an underappreciated source of comorbidity in these patients. We further demonstrate a computational method to assess the mechanism of this paraneoplastic complication, using unsupervised clustering to highlight the similarities between patients with urea cycle disorders and hyperammonemia due to FLC, even with only mild ammonia elevations. Our findings demonstrate the utility of analyzing biochemical phenotypes directly from patient laboratory results. This workflow can serve as a model for developing biochemical insights into disease biology from patient laboratory data and is applicable to rare cancers and other diseases.

There are some limitations in this approach, most importantly the single institution focus of the study. Our adjustments for referral distance are sensitive to the geography of the UCSF catchment area and may not be effectively applied in more densely populated areas. This analysis was further limited by incomplete zip code data. The interplay between the selection bias at a tertiary center and the potential underdiagnosis or failure to diagnose FLC at less expert centers remains unknown.

### Clinical landscape of citrin deficiency: a global perspective on a multifaceted condition [^113g1Nmg]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Citrin deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect of citrin resulting from mutations in SLC25A13. The clinical manifestation is very variable and comprises three types: neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD: OMIM 605814), post‐NICCD including failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency, and adult‐onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2: OMIM 603471). Frequently, NICCD can run with a mild clinical course and manifestations may resolve in the post‐NICCD. However, a subset of patients may develop CTLN2 when they become more than 18 years old, and this condition is potentially life‐threatening. Since a combination of diet with low‐carbohydrate and high‐fat content supplemented with medium‐chain triglycerides is expected to ameliorate most manifestations and to prevent the progression to CTLN2, early detection and intervention are important and may improve long‐term outcome in patients. Moreover, infusion of high sugar solution and/or glycerol may be life‐threatening in patients with citrin deficiency, particularly CTLN2. The disease is highly prevalent in East Asian countries but is more and more recognized as a global entity. Since newborn screening for citrin deficiency has only been introduced in a few countries, the diagnosis still mainly relies on clinical suspicion followed by genetic testing or selective metabolic screening. This paper aims at describing (1) the different stages of the disease focusing on clinical aspects; (2) the current published clinical situation in East Asia, Europe, and North America; (3) current efforts in increasing awareness by establishing management guidelines and patient registries, hereby illustrating the ongoing development of a global network for this rare disease.

### Clinical manifestation and long-term outcome of citrin deficiency: report from a nationwide study in Japan [^113So1AY]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Citrin deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC25A13 gene. The disease can present with age-dependent clinical manifestations: neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis by citrin deficiency (NICCD), failure to thrive, and dyslipidemia by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD), and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). As a nationwide study to investigate the clinical manifestations, medical therapy, and long-term outcome in Japanese patients with citrin deficiency, we collected clinical data of 222 patients diagnosed and/or treated at various different institutions between January 2000 and December 2019. In the entire cohort, 218 patients were alive while 4 patients (1 FTTDCD and 3 CTLN2) had died. All patients < 20 years were alive. Patients with citrin deficiency had an increased risk for low weight and length at birth, and CTLN2 patients had an increased risk for growth impairment during adolescence. Liver transplantation has been performed in only 4 patients (1 NICCD, 3 CTLN2) with a good response thereafter. This study reports the diagnosis and clinical course in a large cohort of patients with citrin deficiency and suggests that early intervention including a low carbohydrate diet and MCT supplementation can be associated with improved clinical course and long-term outcome.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^116Vtydx]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Mild citrullinemia in caucasians is an allelic variant of argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency (citrullinemia type 1) [^111zX1nU]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Citrullinemia is caused by either deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS, citrullinemia type 1) or a defect of the SLC25A13 gene encoding a mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate transporter (citrullinemia type II). Citrullinemia type 1-referred to as classical citrullinemia-is characterized by largely elevated concentrations of citrulline, manifesting with acute hyperammonemic crises predominantly early in life and occurs panethnically. Citrullinemia type II is a rare multisystem-disorder nearly exclusively observed in the Japanese population and characterized by less pronounced elevations of plasma citrulline and mainly a late onset of clinical symptoms. Here, we investigated 21 citrullinemic patients (mean peak plasma citrulline 1023 micromol/l, range 152–3360), all of whom remained asymptomatic during the observation period (6–156 months). These patients were referred to as mild citrullinemia due to less striking peak citrulline concentrations or absent clinical symptoms. Extended newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry detected 15/21 patients, 4/21 patients were identified by investigation of siblings, 2/21 during metabolic work-up of unspecific neurological symptoms. We characterized the genetic defects in all affected families and found all patients affected by citrullinemia type 1 due to mutations of the ASS gene. We identified 15 different mutations, 14/15 missense and 1/15 nonsense, 6/15 were novel mutations. This is the first genetic study in a series of patients with hitherto asymptomatic citrullinemia. According to the mutations found in this study, mild citrullinemia seems to be primarily related to the human ASS gene, at least in patients of caucasian origin.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^113KgcJg]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^112kisfo]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

The objective of this study was to compare the performance of an RA algorithm developed and trained in 2010 utilizing natural language processing and machine learning, using updated data containing ICD10, new RA treatments, and a new electronic medical records (EMR) system.

Methods

We extracted data from subjects with ≥ 1 RA International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from the EMR of two large academic centres to create a data mart. Gold standard RA cases were identified from reviewing a random 200 subjects from the data mart, and a random 100 subjects who only have RA ICD10 codes. We compared the performance of the following algorithms using the original 2010 data with updated data: (i) a published 2010 RA algorithm; (ii) updated algorithm, incorporating ICD10 RA codes and new DMARDs; and (iii) published algorithm using ICD codes only, ICD RA code ≥ 3.

Results

The gold standard RA cases had mean age 65.5years, 78.7% female, 74.1% RF or antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) for ≥ 3 RA ICD was 54%, compared with 56% in 2010. At a specificity of 95%, the PPV of the 2010 algorithm and the updated version were both 91%, compared with 94% (95% CI: 91, 96%) in 2010. In subjects with ICD10 data only, the PPV for the updated 2010 RA algorithm was 93%.

Conclusion

The 2010 RA algorithm validated with the updated data with similar performance characteristics as the 2010 data. While the 2010 algorithm continued to perform better than the rule-based approach, the PPV of the latter also remained stable over time.

### Clinical landscape of citrin deficiency: a global perspective on a multifaceted condition [^113BGLw4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION TO THE DISEASE, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

In 1993, Japanese researchers first reported about adult patients with a condition clinically and biochemically resembling classical citrullinemia type 1 caused by a defect in the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase 1 but lacking genetic variants in the respective ASS1 gene. The same authors reported this condition, named citrullinemia type 2 or CTLN2, to be characterized by decreased hepatic argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) with normal kinetic properties and thermal stability accompanied by near normal levels of ASS1 mRNA in liver, normal translational activity, and no gross structural abnormalities. Finally, Kobayashi et al. identified the primary cause of CTLN2 as not derived from the ASS1 gene locus and succeeded in cloning the causative gene SLC25A13, for which they designated the term "citrin".

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^116okivE]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^114Zhwb2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^113QXP77]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

Clinical Review

We used clinical review to explore potential reasons for large changes at the time of transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM for diabetes-, cardiac-, and pregnancy-related conditions in the examined classification systems. For each HHS-HCC and AHRQ-CCS condition category with a statistically significant change of 20% or more in prevalence level or trend that was selected for clinical review, we examined frequencies of individual ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnoses before and after the ICD-10-CM transition. We also reviewed guidance documents for hospital coding staff regarding changes in coding practices related to the ICD-10-CM transition for these diagnostic categories.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

EHR‐Based Cohort

The VUMC Synthetic Derivative is a deidentified copy of the EHR. It contains ≈2.5 million patient records spanning more than 20 years, which are searchable for structured (eg, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD‐9] codes, laboratory values) and unstructured (eg, narrative text) data. 14 We queried the Synthetic Derivative that included data from 1993 to 2017 to identify adult patients (18 years or older) with and without RA. Vanderbilt University's institutional review board approved this study as nonhuman research given the use of deidentified data.

Identification of Patients With RA

The EHR was first queried for patients with a possible diagnosis of RA, defined as the presence of ≥ 1 ICD‐9 code for RA (714 or 714.x) or measurement of anti‐cyclic citrullinated peptide (n = 27 885). 15, 16, 17 From this initial cohort we excluded: (1) patients with prevalent HF based on the presence of ≥ 1 ICD‐9 code for HF (425.x or 428.x) at the time of initial RA diagnosis, and (2) further restricted the RA cohort to patients with ≥ 2 RA ICD‐9 codes (714–714.2) 18 separated by at least 14 days and ever use of an antirheumatic medication. 19 The latter criteria were applied as manual adjudication of 135 charts revealed the combination of multiple ICD‐9 codes plus medication use afforded good specificity with a positive predictive value for RA of > 93%. This algorithm yielded a cohort of 9889 patients with RA.

Identification of Controls

The non‐RA control cohort was also ascertained through query of the EHR. We excluded any patient that ever had any of the following: an ICD‐9 code for RA or autoimmune diseases, 18 laboratory measure of anti‐cyclic citrullinated peptide or rheumatoid factor, or rheumatology clinic encounter. Prevalent HF at the time of entry into the EHR was excluded based on the presence of ≥ 1 ICD‐9 code for HF (425.x or 428.x). Following these exclusions, the control sample was extracted by first matching for sex and race, and then by selecting the individual closest in age (without restriction) to yield a 1:1 ratio with the 9889 patients with RA without replacement.

### Citrin deficiency-the east-side story [^116ZS4WM]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

1 THE BEGINNING OF UNDERSTANDING A NEW DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR CITRULLINEMIA

The title of this short review article is taken from a lecture held at the recent SSIEM Annual Symposium 2023 in Jerusalem. The organizers had scheduled this lecture on "Citrin deficiency – The East‐side story" to allude to the fact that citrin deficiency (CD) was long considered as a condition prevalent and therefore relevant in East Asia, but of less importance to Western countries and its metabolic societies. This assumption probably was never true, but it is important to realize that it is not only not true but may even be dangerous. This short review summarizes the (hi)story of a metabolic condition that was described first in Japan and other East Asian countries, where knowledge on genetics, biochemistry and management was build long before the more recent perception of its global existence.

The condition now known as CD was first reported in adult patients with elevated plasma citrulline concentrations and signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The primary suspicion of a defect in argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), a well‐known classical urea cycle disorder, was initially seemingly supported by the findings of decreased hepatic argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) activity with normal kinetic properties and heat stability. However, this assumption was not confirmed since none of the patients had genetic variants in ASS1. In the first large patient cohort (> 80 patients), there was a remarkable proportion of consanguinity of about 20%, which by far exceeded the expected rate of inbreeding in Japan of about 1%–2%. This observation led to further investigations and identification of the true cause of this condition by the same group, when homozygosity mapping in 118 families, including 18 consanguineous pedigrees, identified the chromosomal region 7q21.3 and therein five different SLC25A13 variants. This finding ruled out ASS1 deficiency as the underlying cause but instead expanded the small group of differential diagnoses of "citrullinemias" by yet another member (Table 1).

### Inborn disorders of the malate aspartate shuttle [^114ZXGh5]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

6.5 (Citrin/) deficiency

AGC2 or citrin deficiency is the most extensively described and studied MAS deficiency (Table 1). Over hundred patients have been reported, often in East Asia. AGC2 deficiency can manifest in several stages of life, dependent on age. In newborns or infants, it can present as neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (citrin deficiency, NICCD), in older children as failure to thrive and dyslipidemia (citrin deficiency, FTTDCD), and in adults as recurrent hyperammonemia with neuropsychiatric symptoms in citrullinemia type II (CTLN2).

NICCD was discovered in neonates suffering from cholestasis and multiple amino acidemia including citrulline, threonine, methionine, lysine, arginine, tyrosine, serine, and phenylalanine. Some of these may be detected in newborn screening, including citrulline, tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanine, and a decreased ratio of alanine/citrulline. Other biochemical abnormalities were hypoproteinemia, galactosemia, and hypoglycemia. Further symptoms include diffuse fatty liver with hepatomegaly and parenchymal cellular infiltration with hepatic fibrosis (cirrhosis), decreased coagulation factors (echinocytosis), elevated bilirubin (bilirubinemia), hemolytic anemia, and variable liver dysfunction. Most patients showed clinical improvement between 6 and 12 months upon treatment with a diet containing fat‐soluble vitamin supplementation, lactose‐free therapeutic formulas, and/or medium‐chain triglyceride enriched therapeutic formulas. However, some may develop cirrhosis or severe infections, or may later develop symptoms of adult‐onset citrin deficiency.

### The diagnostic challenge of mild citrulline elevation at newborn screening [^111QgT3J]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Citrulline is a target analyte measured at expanded newborn screening (NBS) and its elevation represents a biomarker for distal urea cycle disorders and citrin deficiency. Altered ratios of citrulline with other urea cycle-related amino acids are helpful for the differential diagnosis. However, the use of cut-off values in screening programmes has raised the issue about the interpretation of mild elevation of citrulline levels detected at NBS, below the usual range observed in the "classical/severe" forms of distal urea cycle disorders and in citrin deficiency. Herein, we report ten subjects with positive NBS for a mild elevation of citrulline (< 100 μmol/L), in whom molecular investigations revealed carriers status for argininosuccinate synthase deficiency, a milder form of argininosuccinate lyase deficiency and two other diseases, lysinuric protein intolerance and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, not primarily affecting the urea cycle. To guide the diagnostic process, we have designed an algorithm for mild citrulline elevation (< 100 μmol/L) at NBS, which expands the list of disorders to be included in the differential diagnosis.

### The role and control of arginine levels in arginase 1 deficiency [^112gCCEE]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiologic profile of ARG1‐D strongly suggests that elevated arginine, rather than hyperammonemia, plays the key role in development and progression of manifestations. Plasma arginine levels may be within or near the normal range in the immediate postnatal period, when infants appear phenotypically normal. Furthermore, progression of manifestations with increasing duration of disease suggests a cumulative effect of persistently high arginine. Clinical recognition of the importance of plasma arginine levels in ARG1‐D is reflected in current management guidelines. Treatment of other UCDs is focused on reducing risk of hyperammonemia and addressing acute hyperammonemic episodes, but, as noted previously, hyperammonemia is less of a concern in ARG1‐D. Preventing symptomatic hyperammonemia does not prevent progression or improve long‐term outcomes in these patients. Instead, current guidelines for ARG1‐D management focus on lowering plasma arginine, and specifically recommend maintaining plasma arginine levels at < 200 μmol/L or as low as possible (aiming for the upper reference range).

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^11523574]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that the use of ICD-9-CM codes in administrative data alone is insufficient to identify hyponatremia in outpatient populations. Whenever possible, supplementary laboratory information should be used to help overcome this limitation of administrative claims.

At follow-up, she grew along the –2 SD curve, and was delayed in developmental milestones. At 17 months of age, she presented with fever without clear focus, refusal of feeding, persistent vomiting, and diffuse itching. She was alert, anicteric, and without abnormalities on physical examination. Laboratory analysis showed the following results (reference values in parentheses): leukocytes 27.5 × 10 9 /L (4.5–12.0 × 10 9 /L), ESR 50 mm/h (< 3–13 mm/h), hemoglobin 5.7 mmol/L (6.5–8.4 mmol/L), glucose 5.4 mmol/L (4.0–7.8 mmol/L), creatinin 22 μmol/L (18–35 μmol/L), urea 1.2 mmol/L (1.8–6.7 mmol/L), total bilirubin 118 μmol/L (3–14 μmol/L), conjugated bilirubin 109 μmol/L (1–4 μmol/L), albumin 21 g/L (35–55 g/L), AST 1,581 U/L (< 40 U/L), ALT 2,070 U/L (< 45 U/L), γGT 192 U/L (< 50 U/L), alkaline phosphatase 601 U/L (55–250 U/L), LDH 1,087 U/L (< 200 U/L), PTT 62 s (9–12 s), and APTT 62 s (23–33 s). Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.45 (7.35–7.45), pCO2 5.2 kPa (4.6–6.0 kPa), HCO3− 26.6 mmol/L (21–25 mmol/L), and BE +2.7 (−3.0 to +3.0). NH3 concentration was 114 μmol/L (15–45 μmol/L). Abdominal ultrasound revealed no abnormalities.

Methods

Study participants and disease phenotypes

The UKB is a population-based study that enrolled more than 500 thousand participants aged 40–69 years at recruitment across the UK. In-depth phenotypic, health-related, genetic, and proteomic data were collected from a baseline assessment and subsequent follow-up visits. UKB has obtained ethics approval from the Research Ethics Committee (REC; approval number: 06/MRE08/65) and informed consent from all participants. For this study, we included a total of 350,700 participants with available WES and clinical data after quality control (QC) under project application number 19542.

The IMDs phenotypes were ascertained and classified according to the in- and out-patient International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codesand Read codes –. Data sources included the UKB health outcome records' first occurrences of health outcomes (Category 1712), hospital admission data (Field ID 41270, 41271), and primary care (Category 3000). The diagnose codes for IMDs were provided in Supplementary Data 26. We defined participants with a specific IMD as cases, otherwise as controls. Case status was determined at the last follow-up.

### Neuropsychological attributes of urea cycle disorders: a systematic review of the literature [^113hTHsB]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

The most prominent improvement in neuropsychological outcome after year 2000 was observed in NAGSD. In NAGSD, the prevalence of intellectual disability declined from 50% to 9%, reflecting the efficacy of NCG therapy. The decline observed in females with OTCD (from 41% to 15%) is mainly due to nearly fourfold increase in total number of individuals, with the inclusion of asymptomatic heterozygotes. A similar decrease was not observed for males with OTCD (23% ≤ 2000 vs 22% after 2000). The improvement observed in cognitive outcomes of neonatal onsets CPS1D, ASSD, and ARGD may be related to effective management of severe HA. Despite similar treatment modalities, the prevalence of intellectual disabilities has increased among individuals with ASLD, which may be related to increased survival rates. The poor cognitive outcome of distal UCDs implicates an insidious impact of cumulative exposure to ammonia, arginine, and citrulline in the long term. 65

Improved treatments have contributed to the survival of many infants, particularly males with OTCD who, nonetheless, experienced early irreversible neurological damage. Across studies, children with neonatal onset of symptoms, early liver failure, and higher levels of ammonia were more likely to have intellectual disabilities. 52, 53, 75, 106 Early studies reported associations between cognitive outcomes and duration/severity of HA episodes and higher peak ammonia concentration. 45, 47, 48, 51, 107 However, his review suggests that this generalization does not hold true in many cases (eg, Ref. 19).

While genotype was sometimes associated with neonatal vs later onset of symptoms, it did not reliably predict occurrence of intellectual disabilities in OTCD, 108 CPS1, 16, 28 HHH syndrome, 109 citrullinemia type I, 66 and probably in all the other UCDs, as well. Earlier treatment initiation (diet in less severe cases and ammonia scavengers or liver transplantation in severe cases) led to better outcomes in most studies, 7, 8, 45, 47, 61, 84, 110 whereas lack of treatment or noncompliance with treatment resulted in poorer cognitive outcomes. 56, 67, 68

### Citrin deficiency-the east-side story [^1173Pw5n]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Citrin deficiency (CD) is a complex metabolic condition due to defects in SLC25A13 encoding citrin, an aspartate/glutamate carrier located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The condition was first described in Japan and other East Asian countries in patients who were thought to suffer from classical citrullinemia type 1, and was therefore classified as a urea cycle disorder. With an improved understanding of its molecular basis, it became apparent that a defect of citrin is primarily affecting the malate-aspartate shuttle with however multiple secondary effects on many central metabolic pathways including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, de novo lipogenesis and ureagenesis. In the meantime, it became also clear that CD must be considered as a global disease with patients identified in many parts of the world and affected by SLC25A13 genotypes different from those known in East Asian populations. The present short review summarizes the (hi)story of this complex metabolic condition and tries to explain the relevance of including CD as a differential diagnosis in neonates and infants with cholestasis and in (not only adult) patients with hyperammonemia of unknown origin with subsequent impact on the emergency management.

### MRI findings in an adolescent with type I citrullinaemia [^117ALjHP]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Citrullinaemia is a rare inborn error of urea cycle metabolism. We describe the MRI findings in a 16-year-old boy with type I citrullinaemia during an episode of acute hyperammonaemic encephalopathy and compare them to his previous follow-up MRI studies. MRI revealed bilateral high signal intensity in the cingulate, perirolandic, parietal and temporoinsular cortex, the subcortical white matter and left thalamus. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed high signal intensity and low apparent diffusion coefficient values in the frontoparietal lobes. To our knowledge, MRI findings in an adolescent with type I citrullinaemia have not been previously reported. Since our patient's neuroradiological findings showed greater similarity to type II citrullinaemia, we think his brain injury during this acute episode was probably age-related and independent of the type of citrullinaemia.

Subjects, material, and methods

Chart, literature, and database review

We performed a retrospective chart review of individuals who were heterozygous or hemizygous for the NM_000531.6:c.118C > T p.(Arg40Cys) or NM_000531.6:c.1061T > G p.(Phe354Cys) variants and who were evaluated in the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) Metabolic Genetics Clinic from 1995 to 2024. This chart review was conducted in accordance with a protocol approved by the Baylor College of Medicine's institutional review board (IRB).

To identify additional individuals with these variants, we searched the Longitudinal Study of Urea Cycle Disorders database. This multicenter natural history study performed by the Urea Cycle Disorders Consortium (UCDC) of the NIH Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network includes data on 928 participants with various UCDs. The search included data collected between March 2006 and October 2024. From 2007 to 2015, study procedures were approved by the IRBs of all participating clinical sites. From 2015 onward, the study was conducted under a protocol that was approved by the UCDC central IRB at Children's National Medical Center. All participants or their legal guardians provided informed consent prior to participation in the study. To supplement these two searches, we performed a literature review for publications or abstracts containing these two variants using PubMed, Google Scholar, Mastermind, and LitVar2.

From these sources, the following data (if available) were collected from all subjects: sex, age at diagnosis, reason for testing, presenting symptoms at time of first metabolic decompensation, provisional diagnosis at time of first metabolic decompensation, triggering factors preceding initial decompensation, plasma ammonia and peak plasma ammonia level at first hyperammonemic episode, interventions for treatment of first hyperammonemic episode (e.g. use of nitrogen scavengers, hemodialysis), plasma amino acid profile and urine orotic acid level at diagnosis, presence or absence of symptoms of chronic hyperammonemia, long-term therapies (e.g. protein-restricted diet, citrulline/arginine supplementation, oral nitrogen scavengers), age at last evaluation, number of lifetime crises, lifetime peak glutamine and citrulline levels, presence of neurological sequelae, and survival. OTCD was categorized as neonatal onset if metabolic decompensation occurred within 4 weeks after birth and as late onset if clinical manifestations occurred after 4 weeks of age.

### Estimating the burden and economic impact of pediatric genetic disease [^114DGGPF]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To identify the economic impact of pediatric patients with clinical indications of genetic disease (GD) on the US health-care system.

Methods

Using the 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database, we identified pediatric inpatient discharges with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes linked to genetic disease, including well-established genetic disorders, neurological diseases, birth defects, and other physiological or functional abnormalities with a genetic basis. Cohort characteristics and health-care utilization measures were analyzed. Discharges with a GD-associated primary diagnosis were used to estimate the minimum burden; discharges with GD-associated primary or secondary codes established the maximum burden.

Results

Of 5.85 million weighted discharges, 2.6–14% included GD-associated ICD-9-CM codes. For these discharges, mean total costs were $16,000–77,000 higher (P < 0.0001) in neonates and $12,000–17,000 higher (P < 0.0001) in pediatric patients compared with background, corresponding to significantly higher total charges and lengths of stay. Aggregate total charges for suspected GD accounted for $14 to $57 billion (11–46%) of the "national bill" for pediatric patients in 2012.

Conclusion

Pediatric inpatients with diagnostic codes linked to genetic disease have a significant and disproportionate impact on resources and costs in the US health-care system.

### Screening of nine SLC25A13 mutations: their frequency in patients with citrin deficiency and high carrier rates in Asian populations [^116ghRbu]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Deficiency of citrin encoded by SLC25A13 causes adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (NICCD). So far we have diagnosed 126 (3) CTLN2 and 103 (4) NICCD patients in Japan (and other countries). From preliminary population analysis of the known nine SLC25A13 mutations, we found that the carrier frequency is high in China (1/79), Taiwan (1/98), and Korea (1/50) as well as Japan (1/69), suggesting that many patients with citrin deficiency exist in East Asia.

### Retrospective review of urine organic acids data from patients with citrullinemia type I-looking for the 'cyclic derivative of citrulline' [^113QrV4g]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

European Research Network for evaluation and improvement of screening, Diagnosis, and treatment of Inherited disorders of Metabolism (ERNDIM) provides proficiency testing to clinical laboratories that offer biochemical testing, including urine organic acids analysis. Following an educational challenge, ERNDIM provided a mass spectrum of the 'trimethylsilyl derivative of cyclic derivative of citrulline' to participating laboratories. Though there is knowledge among some in the biochemical genetics' community, that the cyclic derivative of citrulline can be identified in urine of patients with citrullinemia type I, we could not find any published literature regarding this analyte in patient samples, nor were able to obtain any standard material. We did note two publications that proposed chemical structures for the cyclic derivative of citrulline, but neither suggested a clinical utility for this compound and the two proposed structures differed. Here, we used the mass spectrum provided by ERNDIM to retrospectively evaluate existing urine organic acids data from patients affected with conditions associated with elevated levels of plasma citrulline to learn more about this marker in urine and to correlate it with plasma citrulline data in diagnostic and follow-up samples. We document a positive correlation between the concentration of this compound in patient urine and the concentration of citrulline in concurrently collected plasma. We establish that this analyte is a good marker for citrullinemia type I but is not unique to this condition. Finally, we correlate the mass spectrum with the chemical structure originally proposed by Wilson et al. in 1978.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^112fo3nV]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The HHS Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCCs) system was developed for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace risk adjustment payment model and is used to allocate funds among competing health plans. The HHS-HCC system used 127 condition categories for the ACA population when it was implemented from 2014 through 2017, and its mappings were updated to accommodate ICD-10-CM diagnoses in 2015. To ensure that recently added diagnostic codes were recognized, we applied the 2017 HHS-HCC software to the full range of study data for 2010 to 2017. For sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the effects of the HHS filtering logic and the 2015 HHS software with the original ICD-10-CM mappings.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System (AHRQ-CCS) categories are used by managed care plans, insurers, researchers, and surveillance systems for payment, quality assessment, and epidemiology. Its categories are also widely used for risk adjustment and examining disease trends. The AHRQ-CCS largely maintained its category structure with the transition to ICD-10-CM, and we used its 282 diagnostic categories appearing in our data before and after the transition applying the 2017 category mappings.

All 3 classification systems updated their diagnostic categories to accommodate ICD-10-CM. However, because only 5% of ICD-9-CM codes can be mapped 1-to-1 to ICD-10-CM and the crosswalk algorithms were developed before ICD-10-CM coding was adopted for clinical care, it was not possible to prospectively examine the continuity of diagnostic categories across the transition. For comparability across classification systems, we generated the condition categories described by Kautter et albut did not impose the hierarchies used in the HHS-HCC model.

### A proposed nosology of inborn errors of metabolism [^11218fhQ]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We propose a nosology for inborn errors of metabolism that builds on their recent redefinition.

Methods

We established a strict definition of criteria to develop a self-consistent schema for inclusion of a disorder into the nosology.

Results

We identified 1015 well-characterized inborn errors of metabolism described in the literature. In addition, there are 111 less well-characterized conditions that may be inborn errors but do not meet strict criteria for inclusion in the current nosology.

Conclusion

We provide a master list of all currently recognized inborn errors of metabolism grouped according to their pathophysiological basis, with the hope of setting a standard against which new errors should be defined, as well as to promote awareness and foster collaboration in the area. With the rapid advances in the field of genetics in recent years, it is likely that this nosology will need to be updated in the near future, a process that will benefit from broader input and collaboration of experts in the field to improve future versions of the proposed classification.

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^1149aNAt]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

### Feasibility of auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation from living donors for patients with adult-onset type II citrullinemia [^113CXE41]. Liver Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

More than 20 patients with adult-onset type II citrullinemia have undergone liver transplantation, showing dramatic therapeutic effects. In Japan, living donor liver transplantation is the standard technique of liver transplantation because of the rare availability of cadaveric donors. The feasibility of auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation (APOLT) for adult-onset type II citrullinemia to overcome the problem of a small-for-size graft in living donor liver transplantation has not been defined. We recently performed APOLT for patients with type II citrullinemia. Here, we present 2 patients: patient 1 was a 32-year-old man and patient 2 was a 43-year-old woman. Both patients suffered from hepatic encephalopathy, and laboratory data showed highly elevated plasma levels of ammonia and citrulline. In patient 1, the liver graft was obtained from a patient with familial amyloid polyneuropathy as a domino liver transplant. In patient 2, APOLT was performed after graft donation from her husband. The postoperative clinical courses of both patients were uneventful, and the neurological symptoms were completely resolved. The plasma concentrations of ammonia and citrulline normalized rapidly in both patients. APOLT can provide an adequate hepatocyte mass to correct the underlying enzyme deficiency in adult patients with type II citrullinemia. In addition, APOLT can be carried out safely to overcome the limitation of graft volume in living donor liver transplantation.

### Preparing for international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification implementation: strategies for maintaining an efficient workflow [^111ptEp2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is required to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services health care billing data starting in October 2015 in the United States. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is an update to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and contains approximately 70,000 codes compared with 14,000 codes. We aimed to discuss how our institution is updating the coding system in a manner that alleviates the possible burden placed on providers including more coding information required and longer load times. We performed a simulation test including testing the diagnosis calculator, timing, and how well the new and old codes mapped. We conducted a gap analysis to ensure that coding could begin in October of 2015 with minimal service interruptions. We will describe strategies and procedures to transition between systems while maintaining efficiency and helping to improve classification.

### Metabolic investigations prevent liver transplantation in two young children with citrullinemia type I [^115bg49Y]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Patient 2

Patient 2 was a male Caucasian born to non-consanguineous parents. Patient 2 was born in the same district hospital as patient 1, at 38 +1 weeks after an uneventful gestation and delivery, with birth weight 2,680 g (Z –1.3 SD), and Apgar scores 9 and 10.

At 22 months of age, he presented with episodic vomiting since 3 months, not obviously related to feeding, with a frequency varying from daily to weekly. Further history revealed increased fatigue, and a mild growth retardation since the age of 8 months. Concerns were raised about his development, since he was not able to walk without support nor to throw a ball without losing balance. At physical examination, the child was well and without abnormalities. Laboratory results revealed leukocytes 10.7 × 10 9 /L, thrombocytes 378 × 10 9 /L (150–350 × 10 9 /L), Hb 7.2 mmol/L, glucose 4.9 mmol/L, Na + 138 mmol/L (138–146 mmol/L), K + 4.3 mmol/L (4.1–5.5 mmol/L), Ca2 + 2.38 mmol/L (2.20–2.60 mmol/L), phosphate 1.58 mmol/L (1.45–2.10 mmol/L), albumin 33 g/L, AST 206 U/L, ALT 323 U/L, and urea 2.5 mmol/L, capillary blood gas analysis pH 7.47 (7.32–7.42), pCO2 3.8 kPa (5.5–6.8 kPa), HCO3− 20.2 mmol/L (24–28 mmol/L), and BE –2.1 mmol/L (−3.0 to +3.0), with NH3 210 μmol/L. Abdominal X-ray, barium enema, abdominal ultrasound, screening results of viral hepatitis and toxoplasmosis, and triple feces test were normal.

10 PERSPECTIVES

In the 25 years since CD was first described, significant progress has been made toward a comprehension of its diversified phenotype based on biochemical and genetic studies. These advances have been and are being translated into improvements in the diagnosis of the condition and the treatment and care of patients. Future development of the investigation of this condition requires raising awareness of CD, promoting improvements in diagnosis and treatment, and developing a cure.

### Datamining approaches for examining the low prevalence of N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency and understanding transcriptional regulation of urea cycle genes [^112qVH8u]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

3 CONCLUSIONS

A combination of small sequence length of the NAGS catalytic domain, non‐specific clinical symptoms of hyperammonemia, biochemical symptoms, elevated ammonia and glutamine, and low citrulline in the blood, that are shared with other urea cycle disorders appear to be the primary basis for the low incidence of NAGS deficiency compared to other urea cycle disorders. Since NAGS deficiency is the only urea cycle disorder that can be treated with a single drug, understanding these factors is important in order to identify every patient with the disease. Rapid genomic sequencing in combination with reliable functional testing and annotation of NAGS sequence variants will aid in making diagnoses. Our search for cCREs began with two patients with clinical and biochemical symptoms of urea cycle disorders but no pathogenic sequence variants in the coding regions and splice sites of urea cycle genes, which led to the identification of two NAGS regulatory regions. This in turn prompted a wider investigation of urea cycle gene regulation by data mining of the ENCODE database. We identified four transcription factors that regulate all eight urea cycle genes, and uncovered a plausible role for AMPK signaling, upregulation of PGC‐1α and its interactions with one or more of the four transcription factors as the molecular mechanism for adaptation of ureagenesis to changing nitrogen load.

### Fatigue and quality of life in citrin deficiency during adaptation and compensation stage [^112D18xU]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Citrin-deficient children and adolescents between adult-onset type II citrullinemia and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis by citrin deficiency do not have clear clinical features except for unusual diet of high-fat, high-protein, and low-carbohydrate food. The aims of the present study are to characterize fatigue and quality of life (QOL) in citrin-deficient patients during adaptation and compensation stage, and to define the relationship between fatigue and QOL. The study subjects were 55 citrin-deficient patients aged 1-22years (29 males) and 54 guardians. Fatigue was evaluated by self-reports and proxy-reports of the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. QOL was evaluated by the PedsQL Generic Core Scales. Both scale scores were significantly lower in child self-reports (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) and parent proxy-reports (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively) than those of healthy children. Citrin-deficient patients with scores of 50 percentile or less of healthy children constituted 67.5% of the sample for the Fatigue Scale and 68.4% for the Generic Core Scales. The PedsQL Fatigue Scale correlated with the Generic Core Scales for both the patients (r = 0.56) and parents reports (r = 0.71). Assessments by the patients and their parents showed moderate agreement. Parents assessed the condition of children more favorably than their children. The study identified severe fatigue and impaired QOL in citrin-deficient patients during the silent period, and that such children perceive worse fatigue and poorer QOL than those estimated by their parents. The results stress the need for active involvement of parents and medical staff in the management of citrin-deficient patients during the silent period.

### Infant mortality in Brazil attributable to inborn errors of metabolism associated with sudden death: a time-series study (2002–2014) [^116Fx557]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

From 2002 to 2014, the deaths of 598,734 children under 1 year old were recorded in Brazil. Over the same period, according to the SIM, there were 199 deaths of infants under 1 year old attributed to the IEMs of interest, which corresponds to a median 17 deaths per year (IQR: 12–18) (Fig. 1). The infant mortality rate attributable to the selected IEMs in the period of analysis was 0.67 per 10,000 live births.

Fig. 1
Distribution of the number of infant deaths due to IEMs recorded in Brazil, 2002–2014

Of these 199 deaths, 18 (9.0%) occurred in the North of Brazil, 43 (21.6%) in the Northeast, 80 (40.2%) in the Southeast, 46 (23.1%) in the South, and 12 (6.0%) in the Center-West region. Across all five regions of the country, ICD-10 code E74 (Other disorders of carbohydrate metabolism) was predominant; of all IEM-related infant deaths recorded in the study period, 80 (40.2%) were assigned this ICD code as the underlying cause. In the North and Southeast regions, the second leading cause was ICD-10 code E72 (Other disorders of amino-acid metabolism), whereas in the South and Northeast regions, code E70 (Disorders of aromatic amino-acid metabolism) was the second leading cause. In the Center-West region of Brazil alone, disorders classified under ICD-10 code E71 (Disorders of branched-chain amino-acid metabolism and fatty-acid metabolism) were the second leading cause of death (Table 1).

Table 1
Distribution of deaths due to IEMs according to ICD-10 classification, stratified by region of Brazil, 2002–2014

According to the latest demographic census at the time of writing, the population of Brazil was 202,768,562, with 2,979,259 live births in 2014 and an infant mortality rate of 14.4 per 1000. Table 2 provides infant mortality rates attributable to the IEMs of interest, using these data as a baseline.

### Cross-sectional observational study of 208 patients with non-classical urea cycle disorders [^117XGfXt]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2014). Low credibility.

A larger proportion of ASLD and ASSD patients detected by NBS as compared to those without NBS remained asymptomatic, in line with previous reports on the benign course in some patients (Ficicioglu et al; Häberle et al; Mercimek-Mahmutoglu et al). However, some patients identified through NBS later developed symptomatic hyperammonemia. Of those, some carried a genotype predicting a "mild course" indicating that the clinical management can not entirely rely on genotypes only. This underlines the need to follow these patients regularly in a metabolic centre and to provide a sick-day protocol and emergency regimen to cover potentially catabolic episodes.

A high number of patients were affected by MR/DD in the entire cohort but especially in ASLD and ARG1D, with all ASLD patients being symptomatic and 88% of ARG1D patients. This poor outcome might in part be caused by the longer mean diagnostic delay in ASLD (3 years, sd = 4, range 0–13) and ARG1D (2.5 years, sd = 1.7, range 0–4) patients compared to OTCD (1.2 years, sd = 2.4, range 0–9.5) although symptoms in ARG1D are in addition caused by its specific pathogenesis. However, more detailed information about the neurological situation of UCD patients would be required before final conclusions can be drawn. The same refers to the relatively small number of patients with seizures (except in the few ARG1D patients of which 88% were affected). The reason for this might be the inclusion of asymptomatic patients or those with mild phenotypes.

Regarding treatment, it is interesting to see that the same number of OTCD patients was treated with either L-citrulline 39 (35%) or with L-arginine 40 (36%) and only few patients received both (Fig. 4b). This reflects the unsolved issue of using L-citrulline or L-arginine alone or a combination of both (Häberle et al; Wilcken). The choice of L-arginine might be influenced by the higher price and the lower availability of L-citrulline but further studies are required to determine whether one amino acid is superior to the other in treating OTCD.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^114pEknp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

### Neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency with no hepatic steatosis: a case report [^1165KAYY]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) is a typical metabolic disorder that causes neonatal cholestasis. There are two clinical phenotypes of citrin deficiency: NICCD, which occurs from the neonatal to infantile period, and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2), which occurs after puberty. In the period between these two forms, there is also a form called failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD), which is an adaptive and compensatory phase. The responsible gene is SLC25A13. The encoded protein, citrin, is an aspartate–glutamate carrier localized primarily in the mitochondrial inner membrane of the liver. This transport works as part of the malate aspartate shuttle. When aspartate is not transported into the cytoplasm due to citrin deficiency, the urea cycle is not levable to operate, and this causes citrulline levels to elevate. Loss of citrin function impairs urea and protein synthesis, aerobic glycolysis, glycogenesis, and energy metabolism, leading to a variety of symptoms. Histopathologic examination of the liver of children with NICCD generally shows fatty liver, steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, and, rarely, cirrhosis. Cholestasis and fatty liver often improve by 1 year of age, but whether they later progress to CTLN2 remains to be determined. We herein describe a girl with NICCD diagnosed on the basis of variants in SLC25A13, although no fat deposition was seen upon pathological examination of the liver.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^116vS4H9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Chronic migraine — diagnostic notes state that characterization of frequently recurring headache generally requires a headache diary to record information on pain and associated symptoms day-by-day for at least one month; when criteria A-C are fulfilled by headache that is daily and unremitting from < 24 hours after its first onset, code as 4.10 New daily persistent headache, and when the manner of onset is not remembered or is otherwise uncertain, code as 1.3 Chronic migraine; the most common cause of symptoms suggestive of chronic migraine is medication overuse, and patients meeting criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine and for 8.2 Medication-overuse headache should be coded for both, with around 50% of patients apparently with 1.3 Chronic migraine reverting to an episodic migraine type after drug withdrawal; because tension-type-like headache is within the diagnostic criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine, the diagnosis excludes the diagnosis of 2. Tension-type headache or its types.

### Breathing (and coding?) a bit easier: changes to international classification of disease coding for pulmonary hypertension [^113demJH]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system is broadly used by health-care providers, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to track health trends and statistics at the global, national, and local levels and to provide a reimbursement framework for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current iteration of the ICD system, the ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), was implemented in 2015. Although many changes to the prior ICD, Ninth Revision system were included in the ICD-10 system, the newer revision failed to adequately reflect advances in the clinical classification of certain diseases such as pulmonary hypertension (PH). Recently, a proposal to modify the ICD-10 codes for PH was considered and ultimately adopted for inclusion as an update to the ICD-10 coding system. Although these revisions better reflect the current clinical classification of PH, in the future, further changes should be considered to improve the accuracy and ease of coding for all forms of PH.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^116CscF4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) ICD coding — severe nonproliferative and diabetic macular edema mappings are listed as follows: ICD-9 CM 362.06 corresponds to ICD-10 CM codes "E10.341- Type 1 with macular edema", "E10.349- Type 1 without macular edema", "E11.341- Type 2 with macular edema", "E11.349- Type 2 without macular edema", "E13.341- other specified types of diabetes mellitus with severe nonproliferative DR with macular edema", and "E13.349- other specified types of diabetes mellitus with severe nonproliferative DR without macular edema". For diabetic macular edema, ICD-9 CM 362.07 corresponds to ICD-10 CM "E10.321 Type 1 mild nonproliferative DR", "E10.331 Type 1 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E10.341 Type 1 severe nonproliferative DR", "E10.351 Type 1 proliferative DR", "E11.321 Type 2 mild nonproliferative DR", "E11.331 Type 2 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E11.341 Type 2 severe nonproliferative DR", "E11.351 Type 2 proliferative DR", "E13.321 other specified diabetes mellitus with mild nonproliferative DR", and "E13.331 other specified diabetes mellitus with moderate nonproliferative DR". Additional information states: "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 6th characters. In the DR series, indicate 'with or without' macular edema. Laterality indicators are not required in this series", with "1 = with macular edema" and "9 = without macular edema". It further specifies, "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available".

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^116FM4wi]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### New coding in the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, for children's interstitial lung disease [^1151Bnj9]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

The term "children's interstitial lung disease" (chILD) refers to a heterogeneous group of rare and diffuse lung diseases associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These disorders include neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy, pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis, surfactant dysfunction mutations, and alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins. Diagnosis can be challenging, which may lead to a delay in recognition and treatment of these disorders. Recently, International Classifications of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes have been added for several of the chILD disorders. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of the chILD disorders and appropriate diagnostic coding.

KID is a nationally representative sample and the largest comprehensive, all-payer database for children in the United States.KID represents a stratified sampling of HCUP's State Inpatient Databases, with random sampling of 10% of uncomplicated (healthy) live births and 80% of complicated in-hospital births and other pediatric discharges (age 0 to 20 years). Similar to other HCUP national databases, KID data was weighted to produce national and regional estimates. Weighted estimates of discharge counts are shown in all result tables and figures. KID is released triennially, and the 2012 version was sampled from over 4000 US community, nonrehabilitation hospitals with pediatric discharges in 46 HCUP member states. Patients less than 18 years of age at time of admission in 2012, represented by over 5 million weighted inpatient discharges, were selected for analysis. Diagnoses and procedures were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Research is exempt from Human Subjects Research under OHRP 45 CFR 46.101(b)(2) from all 45 CFR part 46 requirements.

Study population

We aimed to identify discharges in which the clinical diagnoses are acceptable indications for use of genetic testing. An expert medical geneticist compiled a list of 919 ICD-9-CM codes (October 2011), which enabled identification of codes definitely indicative of a genetic disorder (e.g. cystic fibrosis or specific inborn errors of metabolism), likely to be caused by a genetic disorder (i.e. a genetic diagnosis is likely to be achieved with appropriate genetic testing in > 50% of discharges with these codes; e.g. neonatal intractable epilepsy), or possibly associated with a genetic disorder (i.e. > 10% of discharges will yield a genetic diagnosis with appropriate testing, including most severe birth defects, such as congenital central nervous system [CNS] and cardiac malformations). These ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes (Table S2) represent morphological, physiological, or functional diagnoses that could be used to support a medical decision to undertake genetic testing, and represent a patient population that encompasses those with rare, undiagnosed, or genetic disease.

### Type II citrullinaemia (citrin deficiency) in a neonate with hypergalactosaemia detected by mass screening [^111DR2gb]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2002). Low credibility.

Type II citrullinaemia (CTLN2) is an adult- or late childhood-onset liver disease characterized by a liver-specific defect in argininosuccinate synthetase protein. The enzyme abnormality is caused by deficiency of the protein citrin, which is encoded by the SLC25A 13 gene. Until now, however, few cases with SLC25A13 mutations have been reported in children with liver disease. We describe an infant who presented with neonatal hepatitis in association with hypergalactosaemia detected by neonatal mass screening. DNA analysis of SLC25A13 revealed that the patient was homozygous for a IVS11+1G > A mutation. This case suggests that SLC25A13 mutant should be suspected in neonatal patients with hypergalactosaemia of unknown cause.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^111JtCnX]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The transition to ICD-10 afforded the potential of increased granularity of inflammatory arthritides diagnosis codes for clinical care, research, and billing purposes. This quality improvement study found that, despite a 30-fold increase in codes, adoption of ICD-10 has been poor; only 2.1% of available codes were used more than 1% of the time and were nonspecific. This may reflect the lack of financial incentive for accurate ICD-10 coding, because ICD-10 is not tied to reimbursement.

When assessed by year, the percentage of codes used with regularity did not increase. When assessed by clinician specialty, the percentage of codes used was not better for rheumatologists (who might be expected to be more refined users of such codes) than primary care clinicians. This study is limited by potential coding inaccuracies and cannot establish causality.

Overall, consistent with findings in other areas, the data suggest room for better application of inflammatory arthritis codes. This will be important in years to come if the benefits of ICD expansion are to be realized.

### Sodium phenylbutyrate [^115Saaps]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with argininosuccinic acid synthetase deficiency and those with late-onset disease (partial deficiencies, including females heterozygous for ornithine transcarbamylase), initially may receive a diet containing the age-determined minimal daily natural protein allowance. The protein intake may be increased as tolerated and determined by plasma glutamine and other amino acid levels. However, many patients with partial deficiencies avoid dietary protein.

Citrulline supplementation is required and recommended for patients diagnosed with neonatal-onset deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase; citrulline daily intake is recommended at 0.17 g/kg/day or 3.8 g/m2/day.

The free-base form of arginine may be used instead of citrulline in patients with milder forms of carbamylphosphate synthetase and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (daily intake is recommended at 0.17 g/kg/day or 3.8 g/m2/day).

Arginine supplementation is needed for patients diagnosed with deficiency of argininosuccinic acid synthetase; arginine (free base) daily intake is recommended at 0.4 to 0.7 g/kg/day or 8.8 to 15.4 g/m2/day.

If caloric supplementation is indicated, a protein-free product is recommended. Caloric intake should be based upon the "Recommended Dietary Allowances", 10th ed. Food and Nutrition Board, National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, 1989.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^116WiGdk]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — coding and documentation: Women who meet the criteria for rUTI should have this diagnosis added to their problem list to help alert other providers and ensure best practices, and the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is important for correct classification; the ICD-10 code of "positive urine culture" can be used instead of UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria when a urine culture is positive but the clinical criteria are not met for a UTI.

### Idiopathic epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^115dkWHL]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Appendix 2 — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction are as follows: Epiretinal membrane — ICD-9 CM 362.56; ICD-10 CM H35.371, H35.372, H35.373. Vitreomacular traction, adhesion — ICD-9 CM 379.27; ICD-10 CM H43.821, H43.822, H43.823. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned; unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.
