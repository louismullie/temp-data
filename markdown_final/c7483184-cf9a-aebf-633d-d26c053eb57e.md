## Question

Is chromium picolinate safe

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chromium picolinate is safe. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the chemical form and dose range because trivalent chromium behaves differently from hexavalent chromium and safety depends on dose and formulation. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence on efficacy and safety signals from randomized trials and systematic reviews. Next, I will examine case reports and mechanistic concerns, including nephrotoxicity, genotoxicity, and drug interactions. After that, I need to consider special populations such as those with renal impairment, pregnancy, and pediatrics. Finally, I will integrate regulatory positions and professional guidelines to synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring advice and caveats about product quality and stacking of supplements.

> Let me first confirm the basics: chromium picolinate is trivalent chromium (Cr III), which is far less toxic than hexavalent chromium (Cr VI), and typical supplemental doses range from about 200 to 1000 micrograms per day, which is above the Estimated Average Requirement but within ranges studied in trials. Importantly, oral absorption of trivalent chromium is low, roughly 0.4–2.5%, which limits systemic exposure at typical oral doses [^114yL3Mj] [^1144GpgT] [^117WKqFS].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality safety signal from randomized data. The Cochrane review of nine RCTs in overweight/obese adults found no consistent pattern of adverse events across 200–1000 microgram doses, with only isolated serious adverse events that were not clearly attributable to chromium, and concluded there was no reliable evidence to define safety definitively, which signals uncertainty rather than established harm at these doses [^1144GpgT].

> I should double-check metabolic safety signals in people without diabetes, because harm could manifest as altered insulin sensitivity. Multiple randomized studies in non-obese, non-diabetic adults found that chromium picolinate did not improve insulin sensitivity and, in those with the highest serum chromium levels, was associated with worsening insulin sensitivity, suggesting a possible paradoxical effect in some individuals. This is a cautionary signal rather than proof of harm, but it argues against routine use in people without a clear indication [^115vyHwz] [^115hYrhJ] [^113e8GnN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical toxicity. I need to check for case-level harms. There is a well-documented case of acute tubular necrosis requiring dialysis temporally linked to a multi-ingredient supplement containing chromium picolinate; causality is complicated by other components, but it remains a credible nephrotoxic signal and a reminder that product quality and polypharmacy matter. Additionally, chromium picolinate can impair levothyroxine absorption when co-ingested, which is clinically actionable for patients on thyroid replacement [^113N7tHU] [^116moT57] [^113huPzN].

> I will now examine mechanistic and genotoxic concerns. In vitro and cell-based studies suggest chromium picolinate can generate reactive oxygen species and cause DNA damage, particularly in the presence of vitamin C, raising theoretical carcinogenic risk. However, these findings have not translated into clear epidemiologic harm in humans, and the clinical relevance remains uncertain, so I should frame this as a theoretical risk rather than established clinical toxicity at typical oral doses [^11341d1F] [^113ZmKWN].

> Next, I should review special populations. For renal impairment, I need to ensure caution because chromium is renally cleared; parenteral nutrition literature shows that excessive chromium exposure correlates with reduced GFR in children, and although that pertains to IV exposure, it supports avoiding high-dose oral chromium in CKD and considering dose reduction or avoidance in significant renal disease. For pregnancy and lactation, there are no adequate human data, so risk–benefit assessment should be conservative. For pediatrics, safety data are sparse, and routine supplementation is not supported [^114qh3CN] [^117WKqFS] [^113U9eK7] [^112F7gHB].

> Let me consider drug–nutrient interactions and product quality issues. Beyond the levothyroxine interaction, patients often use multiple supplements with overlapping ingredients, risking excess intake; I should confirm that patients disclose all products and avoid stacking chromium from multiple sources. Moreover, dietary supplements are not preapproved for safety or efficacy, so product purity and contamination vary, which can introduce unexpected risks [^113huPzN] [^112hGWhF] [^116C8pGv].

> I should confirm where regulators and guidelines land. The FDA has not established a Tolerable Upper Intake Level for trivalent chromium, and professional diabetes guidelines state that routine chromium supplementation cannot be recommended due to inconsistent efficacy and uncertain long-term safety. This aligns with a cautious stance rather than a prohibition [^116b9vdn] [^116YYTrx].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is risk-stratified. For generally healthy adults without diabetes, routine chromium picolinate supplementation is not supported and may worsen insulin sensitivity in some; if used, stay at or below 200–400 micrograms per day, avoid in CKD, separate from levothyroxine by several hours, and monitor for gastrointestinal upset or unusual symptoms. For adults with type 2 diabetes, evidence is mixed and modest at best; if considered as an adjunct, use 200–1000 micrograms per day for a limited trial with close monitoring of glucose and A1C, and discontinue if no benefit is observed. For pregnancy, lactation, pediatrics, and severe renal disease, avoid supplementation outside of a research or medically supervised context [^1144GpgT] [^115emm1v] [^112Jdumo] [^116moT57] [^114qh3CN].

> But wait, what if the patient is already taking chromium and feels better? I should double-check for placebo effects, concurrent changes in diet or activity, and product stacking before attributing benefit, and I should document baseline labs and symptoms if we attempt a supervised trial. Given the low oral bioavailability, serum chromium testing is not routinely informative for clinical decision-making, so clinical response and safety monitoring should guide continuation or discontinuation [^114yL3Mj] [^115LMpFj].

---

Chromium picolinate is **generally safe at typical doses** (200–1,000 mcg/day) for most adults when used short term, with minimal adverse effects reported in clinical trials [^1144GpgT] [^115emm1v]. However, **high doses (> 1,000 mcg/day) or prolonged use may cause renal or hepatic injury**, and rare cases of acute tubular necrosis have been reported [^113N7tHU]. It may also cause gastrointestinal upset, headaches, and skin irritation, and can interact with medications such as levothyroxine, reducing its absorption [^116moT57]. People with kidney or liver disease, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and those on interacting medications should avoid supplementation or consult a clinician before use.

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

### Common adverse effects

Common adverse effects include **gastrointestinal symptoms** — nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and bloating — especially at higher doses [^notfound]. Headaches and dizziness have also been reported, though these are generally mild and transient. Skin rash or irritation may occur, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin or allergies.

---

### Serious adverse effects

Serious adverse effects are rare but include **renal toxicity** — acute tubular necrosis has been reported in isolated cases, particularly with high-dose or prolonged use [^113N7tHU]. Hepatic effects, such as elevated liver enzymes, have also been reported in rare cases, especially with prolonged high-dose supplementation. Hypoglycemia may occur, particularly in individuals with diabetes or those taking glucose-lowering medications.

---

### Long-term safety concerns

Long-term safety concerns include **chronic kidney disease**, as prolonged high-dose supplementation may pose a risk, particularly in individuals with pre-existing renal impairment. Potential carcinogenicity has been suggested by in vitro studies indicating DNA damage at high concentrations, although human data are limited and inconclusive [^11341d1F]. Nutritional imbalances may occur with excessive intake, potentially interfering with the absorption of other essential minerals such as iron and zinc.

---

## Factors influencing safety

Several factors influence the **safety of chromium picolinate** supplementation:

- **Dose and duration**: Higher doses (> 1,000 mcg/day) and prolonged use increase the risk of adverse effects.
- **Individual susceptibility**: Individuals with pre-existing kidney or liver conditions, diabetes, or those taking certain medications may be more susceptible to adverse effects.
- **Product quality**: Variability in supplement quality and contamination can impact safety.

---

## Special populations and precautions

Certain populations should exercise **caution or avoid** chromium picolinate supplementation:

- **Pregnant and breastfeeding women**: Safety data are limited; therefore, supplementation is not recommended.
- **Individuals with kidney or liver disease**: High-dose supplementation may exacerbate existing conditions.
- **Individuals with diabetes**: Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is recommended due to potential hypoglycemia.

---

## Drug interactions

Chromium picolinate may interact with certain medications, including **levothyroxine**, where co-administration can reduce absorption and efficacy; separate dosing by several hours is recommended [^116moT57]. It may also enhance the effects of insulin and other glucose-lowering agents, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, and may compete with iron for binding sites, potentially affecting iron absorption.

---

## Regulatory status and guidelines

The **FDA does not regulate** chromium picolinate as a drug, and its safety and efficacy are not rigorously evaluated before marketing. Professional organizations such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics advise caution and recommend consulting healthcare providers before supplementation [^1169gfqf].

---

Chromium picolinate is **generally safe at recommended doses** for short-term use, but high doses or prolonged use carry risks of renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal effects. It may interact with medications such as levothyroxine and insulin, and vulnerable populations should use caution or avoid it.

### Chromium picolinate supplementation for overweight or obese adults [^1144GpgT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity is a global public health threat. Chromium picolinate (CrP) is advocated in the medical literature for the reduction of bodyweight, and preparations are sold as slimming aids in the USA and Europe, and on the Internet.

Objectives

To assess the effects of CrP supplementation in overweight or obese people.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the China Journal Full text Database and the Chinese Scientific Journals Full text Database (all databases to December 2012), as well as other sources (including databases of ongoing trials, clinical trials registers and reference lists).

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they were randomised controlled trials (RCT) of CrP supplementation in people who were overweight or obese. We excluded studies including children, pregnant women or individuals with serious medical conditions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance. Screening for inclusion, data extraction and 'Risk of bias'assessment were carried out by one author and checked by a second. We assessed the risk of bias by evaluating the domains selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting bias. We performed a meta-analysis of included trials using Review Manager 5.

Main Results

We evaluated nine RCTs involving a total of 622 participants. The RCTs were conducted in the community setting, with interventions mainly delivered by health professionals, and had a short- to medium-term follow up (up to 24 weeks). Three RCTs compared CrPplus resistance or weight training with placebo plus resistance or weight training, the other RCTs compared CrP alone versus placebo. We focused this review on investigating which dose of CrP would prove most effective versus placebo and therefore assessed the results according to CrP dose. However, in order to find out if CrP works in general, we also analysed the effect of all pooled CrP doses versus placebo on body weight only. Across all CrP doses investigated (200 μg, 400 μg, 500 μg, 1000 μg) we noted an effect on body weight in favour of CrP of debatable clinical relevance after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment: mean difference (MD) -1.1 kg (95% CI -1.7 to -0.4); P = 0.001; 392 participants;6 trials; low-quality evidence (GRADE)). No firm evidence and no dose gradient could be established when comparing different doses of CrP with placebo for various weight loss measures (body weight, body mass index, percentage body fat composition, change in waist circumference). Only three studies provided information on adverse events (low-quality evidence (GRADE)). There were two serious adverse events and study dropouts in participants taking 1000 μg CrP, and one serious adverse event in an individual taking 400 μg CrP. Two participants receiving placebo discontinued due to adverse events; one event was reported as serious. No study reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no current, reliable evidence to inform firm decisions about the efficacy and safety of CrP supplements in overweight or obese adults.

### Chromium effects on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in persons at risk for diabetes mellitus [^115emm1v]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effects of daily chromium picolinate supplementation on serum measures of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in patients at high risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, modified cross-over clinical trial with 6-month sequences of intervention and placebo followed by a 6-month postintervention assessment. Adult patients with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or metabolic syndrome were enrolled. Participants received 6-month sequences of chromium picolinate or placebo at 1 of 2 dosages (500 or 1000 mcg daily). Primary outcome measures were change in fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose during oral glucose tolerance testing, fasting and 2-hour insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Secondary outcomes included anthropometric measures, blood pressure, endothelial function, hemoglobin A1c, lipids, and urinary microalbumin.

Results

Fifty-nine participants were enrolled. No changes were seen in glucose level, insulin level, or HOMA-IR (all P > .05) after 6 months of chromium at either dosage level (500 mcg or 1000 mcg daily) when compared with placebo. None of the secondary outcomes improved with either chromium dosage compared with placebo (P > .05).

Conclusions

Chromium supplementation does not appear to ameliorate insulin resistance or impaired glucose metabolism in patients at risk for type 2 diabetes and thus is unlikely to attenuate diabetes risk.

### Chromium supplementation in non-obese non-diabetic subjects is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity [^115vyHwz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, pharmacological doses of chromium picolinate therapy do not improve insulin sensitivity in normal non-diabetic subjects. Indeed, it appears that subjects for whom chromium supplementation produced high serum chromium levels paradoxically had a worsening of their insulin sensitivity. We do not have information regarding the mechanism by which high serum chromium levels decreases insulin sensitivity. We can say that it is unlikely to be due changes in expressions of genes that have been identified to be involved in the insulin signaling pathway.

If this finding of worsening insulin sensitivity with high serum chromium levels is confirmed then it is possible that the widespread use of chromium supplements may be contributing to, rather than ameliorating, insulin resistance in the population.

### Acute tubular necrosis associated with chromium picolinate-containing dietary supplement [^113N7tHU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of acute tubular necrosis associated with the use of a chromium picolinate-containing dietary supplement.

Case Summary

A 24-year-old white male who had been ingesting a dietary supplement (Arsenal X) for 2 weeks during his workout sessions developed acute renal failure. Radiologic investigation showed the presence of a solitary right kidney, and an open renal biopsy confirmed features of acute tubular necrosis. He developed significant renal impairment that required hemodialysis. He was also treated with plasmapheresis and steroids, as a diagnosis of pulmonary-renal syndrome was entertained early in the disease course, which was subsequently ruled out. The patient ultimately recovered and, on outpatient visits, was noted to have normal renal function.

Discussion

The use of dietary supplements has become increasingly popular in the US, and these supplements are not subject to stringent premarketing testing or postmarketing surveillance. The main ingredients in the supplement discussed here were chromium picolinate, Sida cordifolia, synephrine, and guarana. An objective causality assessment using the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable association between the use of this supplement and the development of acute renal failure in this patient.

Conclusions

Current information regarding the beneficial effects of trivalent chromium is not very robust; therefore, use of this agent cannot be recommended at this time. This report serves as an important reminder to the public, as well as healthcare providers, of potential nephrotoxic reactions to dietary supplements.

### Chromium supplementation in non-obese non-diabetic subjects is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity [^113e8GnN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

We studied the effect of chromium picolinate on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a well-characterized population of non-obese non-diabetic subjects. We did not find evidence that serum chromium levels had a significant impact on insulin sensitivity in this population, nor did we find evidence that high chromium excretion was associated with insulin resistance. In investigating the use of daily chromium picolinate supplementation as a modulator of insulin action, we could find no evidence for a beneficial effect of this compound. Our principal finding was that those subjects with the highest levels of serum chromium following treatment had worsening of insulin sensitivity rather than an improvement. This negative effect of chromium supplementation was highlighted when we divided the chromium treated subjects into two groups using the medial serum chromium value of 3.1 μg/L – the subjects with the higher chromium levels had greater reduction in insulin sensitivity than the lower chromium levels. There were no obvious baseline characteristics that identified individuals who were likely to have greater serum levels of chromium. The increase in insulin resistance could not explained by weight gain or alterations in lipid levels.

### Chromium picolinate supplementation attenuates body weight gain and increases insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 diabetes [^112Jdumo]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Chromium picolinate (CrPic) supplementation has been suggested to improve glycemia, but there are conflicting reports on efficacy. We sought to determine the effect of CrPic on insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and body composition in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Thirty-seven subjects with type 2 diabetes were evaluated. After baseline, subjects were placed on a sulfonylurea (glipizide gastrointestinal therapeutic system 5 mg/day) with placebo for 3 months. Subjects were then randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either the sulfonylurea plus placebo (n = 12) or the sulfonylurea plus 1,000 microg Cr as CrPic (n = 17) for 6 months. Body composition, insulin sensitivity, and glycemic control were determined at baseline, end of the 3-month single-blind placebo phase, and end of study.

Results

Subjects randomized to sulfonylurea/placebo, as opposed to those randomized to sulfonylurea/CrPic, had a significant increase in body weight (2.2 kg, P < 0.001 vs. 0.9 kg, P = 0.11), percent body fat (1.17%, P < 0.001 vs. 0.12%, P = 0.7), and total abdominal fat (32.5 cm(2), P < 0.05 vs. 12.2 cm(2), P < 0.10) from baseline. Subjects randomized to sulfonylurea/CrPic had significant improvements in insulin sensitivity corrected for fat-free mass (28.8, P < 0.05 vs. 15.9, P = 0.4), GHb (-1.16%, P < 0.005 vs. -0.4%, P = 0.3), and free fatty acids (-0.2 mmol/l, P < 0.001 vs. -0.12 mmol/l, P < 0.03) as opposed to sulfonylurea/placebo.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that CrPic supplementation in subjects with type 2 diabetes who are taking sulfonylurea agents significantly improves insulin sensitivity and glucose control. Further, CrPic supplementation significantly attenuated body weight gain and visceral fat accumulation compared with the placebo group.

### Chromium picolinate and biotin combination improves glucose metabolism in treated, uncontrolled overweight to obese patients with type 2 diabetes [^115U2V3T]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chromium and biotin play essential roles in regulating carbohydrate metabolism. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination of chromium picolinate and biotin on glycaemic control.

Methods

Four hundred and forty-seven subjects with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA(1c) ≥ 7.0%) were enrolled and received either chromium picolinate (600 microg Cr(+3)) with biotin (2 mg), or matching placebo, for 90 days in combination with stable oral anti-diabetic agents (OADs). Major endpoints were reductions in HbA(1c), fasting glucose, and lipids. Safety and tolerability were assessed.

Results

Change in HbA(1c) was significantly different between treatment groups (p = 0.03). HbA(1c) in the chromium picolinate/biotin group decreased 0.54%. The decrease in HbA(1c) was most pronounced in chromium picolinate/biotin subjects whose baseline HbA(1c) ≥ 10%, and highly significant when compared with placebo (-1.76% vs - 0.68%; p = 0.005). Fasting glucose levels were reduced in the entire chromium picolinate/biotin group versus placebo (-9.8 mg/dL vs 0.7 mg/dL; p = 0.02). Reductions in fasting glucose were also most marked in those subjects whose baseline HbA(1c) ≥ 10.0%, and significant when compared to placebo (-35.8 mg/dL vs. 16.2 mg/dL; p = 0.01). Treatment was well tolerated with no adverse effects dissimilar from placebo.

Conclusions

These results suggest that the chromium picolinate/biotin combination, administered as an adjuvant to current prescription anti-diabetic medication, can improve glycaemic control in overweight to obese individuals with type 2 diabetes; especially those patients with poor glycaemic control on oral therapy.

### Chromium supplementation in non-obese non-diabetic subjects is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity [^115hYrhJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of chromium supplements is widespread for the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus but there are conflicting reports on efficacy, possibly reflecting discrepant effects across different populations. In the present studies, we test the hypothesis that chromium supplementation raises serum chromium levels and correspondingly improves insulin sensitivity.

Methods

A double blind placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted on 31 non-obese, normoglycemic subjects. After baseline studies, the subjects were randomized to placebo or chromium picolinate 500 μg twice a day. The primary endpoint was change in insulin sensitivity as measured by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included fasting lipids, blood pressure, weight, body composition measured by DXA scan.

Results

After 16 weeks of chromium picolinate therapy there was no significant change in insulin sensitivity between groups (p = 0.83). There was, however, a strong association between serum chromium and change in insulin resistance (β = -0.83, p = 0.01), where subjects with the highest serum chromium had a worsening of insulin sensitivity. This effect could not be explained by changes in physiological parameters such as body weight, truncal fat and serum lipids with chromium therapy.

Conclusions

Chromium therapy did not improve insulin sensitivity in non-obese normoglycemic individuals. Further, subjects who have high serum chromium levels paradoxically had a decline in insulin sensitivity. Caution therefore should be exercised in recommending the use of this supplement.

Trial registration

The study was registered on the NIH registry (clinicaltrials.gov) and the identifier is NCT00846248

### Chromium picolinate improves insulin sensitivity in obese subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome [^112Nyx3g]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Trivalent chromium (1000 microg), as chromium picolinate, given without change in diet or activity level, caused a 38% mean improvement in glucose disposal rate in five obese subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome who were tested with a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. This suggests that chromium picolinate, an over-the-counter dietary product, may be useful as an insulin sensitizer in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome.

### Chromium supplementation in non-obese non-diabetic subjects is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity [^112vkANv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Chromium or placebo treatment

After completion of baseline tests, subjects were randomized to chromium picolinate or placebo 500 μg twice daily for 16 weeks and the tests repeated. Both the investigators and the subjects were blinded. This daily dose of chromium picolinate was chosen because it was reported in one study that 1000 μg daily dose had greater efficacy than a 200 μg daily dose. The chromium picolinate and placebo were supplied by Nutrition21 Inc. (Purchase, NY 10577). Adherence was assessed by pill count. We also measured fasting chromium levels in serum and spot urine at the end of the study.

### Trace elements in glucometabolic disorders: an update [^114yL3Mj]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Chromium

General aspects

The importance of chromium (Cr) for glucose metabolic regulation has been seen in clinical states of relatively severe Cr deficiency, characterized by impaired glucose tolerance, fasting hyperglycaemia and eventually lipid disorders. Severe deficiencies are mostly limited to parenteral nutrition but analysis of diet plans currently in use in United States reveals a lack of Cr in many diets, potentially linked to various chronic diseases. The safe and adequate daily intake of Cr was considered to be in the range 50–200 mg. However, now 30 mg/d seems a newly admitted value. Cr is found in relatively high amounts in barley. Cr is poorly absorbed and only toxic in high doses, depending on the milieu, the tissues and the valence of the metal: hexavalent Cr is highly toxic whereas the in vivo toxicity of trivalent Cr is debated. After a period of intense utilization, Cr seems to be less popular nowadays, as recently reviewed. Studies performed over the last 20 years in both animals and humans have been largely criticized and whether Cr is indeed an essential element has been questioned.

Cr has no effect in healthy individuals and, because these are not Cr-deficient, there is no need for supplementation. Cr has been administered and tested in various forms such as Cr-chloride, Cr-nicotinate, Cr-proprionate, Cr-histidinate or Cr-picolinate, the latter being by far the best investigated form because of its solubility in water at neutral pH. However in acidic milieu it hydrolyzes and it has been shown that only about 1% of absorbed Cr is found in the bloodstream. Most of the studies published about biological effects of Cr have indeed used Cr-picolinate. Recently new forms aimed at improving Cr bioavailability have been investigated: a complex of Cr and D-phenylalanine, Cr-dinicocysteinate and a combination of Cr and biotin.

### Chromium picolinate balances the metabolic and clinical markers in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115dB8b8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complicated disease and is considered as a severe global health problem affecting 30% of adults worldwide. The present study aimed to evaluate changes in oxidative stress, adipokines, liver enzyme, and body composition following treatment with chromium picolinate (CrPic) among patients with NAFLD.

Participants and Methods

The current randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 46 NAFLD patients with the age range of 20-65years. Patients were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either 400µg CrPic tablets in two divided doses of 200µg (23 patients) or placebo (23 patients) daily for 12weeks. The participants' body composition and biochemical parameters were evaluated at the baseline and after 12weeks.

Results

Serum levels of liver enzymes reduced significantly only in the CrPic group (P < 0.05 for all), but not between the groups after the intervention. Besides, there were significant differences between the study groups regarding body weight and body fat mass, total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, leptin, and adiponectin post-intervention (P = 0.017, P = 0.032, P = 0.003, P = 0.023, P = 0.012, P = 0.003, and P = 0.042, respectively). However, glutathione peroxidase and resistin levels did not differ significantly between groups (P = 0.127 and P = 0.688, respectively).

Discussion and Conclusion

This study showed that consuming 400µg/day of CrPic for 12weeks in patients with NAFLD causes a significant change in leptin, adiponectin, oxidative stress (expect glutathione peroxidase), and body weight, compared to baseline. Nevertheless, it does not affect liver enzymes. Therefore, the CrPic supplementation may improve adipokines, some anthropometric indices, and oxidative stress in patients with NAFLD.

### Chromium treatment has no effect in patients with poorly controlled, insulin-treated type 2 diabetes in an obese Western population: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111iosBM]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Chromium treatment has been reported to improve glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in specific populations of patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chromium treatment on glycemic control in a Western population of insulin-dependent patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

In this 6-month double-blind study, patients with an HbA(1c) (A1C) > 8% and insulin requirements of > 50 units/day were randomly assigned to receive treatment with placebo or 500 or 1,000 mug chromium daily in the form of chromium picolinate. The primary efficacy parameter was a change in A1C. Secondary end points were changes in lipid profile, BMI, blood pressure, and insulin requirements.

Results

In this per-protocol analysis (n = 46), the decrease in A1C was approximately equal across the three groups (0.4%). All patients had a BMI > 25 kg/m(2). No differences were found in the secondary end points. We found a weak relationship between an increasing serum chromium concentration and improvement of the lipid profile.

Conclusions

There is no evidence that high-dose chromium treatment is effective in obese Western patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Effect of chromium supplementation on insulin resistance and ovarian and menstrual cyclicity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^1141BAtP]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

In women with polycystic ovary syndrome, chromium picolinate (200 microg/d) improves glucose tolerance compared with placebo but does not improve ovulatory frequency or hormonal parameters. This pilot study indicates that future studies in the polycystic ovary syndrome population should examine higher dosages or longer durations of treatment.

### Chromium supplementation in non-obese non-diabetic subjects is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity [^111MediD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

The present studies were performed to test the hypothesis that chromium supplementation would raise serum chromium levels and correspondingly improve insulin sensitivity. We therefore performed a double blind placebo controlled clinical trial of chromium picolinate therapy in a non-diabetic, non-obese population, and employed the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp to precisely measure insulin sensitivity. We studied this population because of the presence of a range of insulin sensitivities, the likelihood that insulin resistance could result from multiple factors beyond overt obesity, and the previously established relationship between insulin sensitivity and chromium excretion in non-obese, non-diabetic subjects.

### Using physical activity to advance a career in clinical nutrition [^117VvDzP]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Zinc is a component of more than 200 metalloenzymes, some of which are involved in energy metabolism during physical activity. Limited evidence suggested that low-zinc intakes can impact physical performance with no evidence of a mechanism. I tested the hypothesis that low dietary zinc intake reduces the activity of RBC carbonic anhydrase, a zinc-dependent enzyme, thus adversely affecting cardiorespiratory function and metabolic responses during exercise in physically active men. Based on reported estimates of zinc intakes of elite athletes, we fed diets low and supplemented with zinc to physically active men in a double-blinded cross-over trial. Serum zinc and RBC zinc concentrations, total carbonic anhydrase activity, and the activities of the carbonic anhydrase I and II isoforms in RBCs decreased significantly when the men consumed the low-zinc diet. When dietary zinc was low, the volunteers with the largest reduction in carbonic anhydrase activity did not complete the 45-min submaximal exercise test. Heart rate, ventilatory volume, and ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and carbon dioxide were significantly increased when the men consumed the low-zinc diet. These findings demonstrate that marginal zinc intake, common among physically active adults, adversely affects cardiorespiratory function and can limit aerobic exercise performance.

During a management training assignment at the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Disease, Van Hubbard presented me with the advertised claims that supplemental trivalent chromium as chromium picolinate independently caused fat loss and muscle gain. I carried out a double-blind supplementation study using the standard dose of over-the-counter supplements of chromium (picolinate and chloride), compared to placebo, and found no significant effect on either body composition or strength gain in young men after completion of a resistance training program. The Food and Drug Administration reviewed these findings and concluded that the claims of generalized fat loss and muscle accretion with chromium picolinate supplementation were false. A follow-up double-blind study of women fed low-chromium diets and supplemented with chromium (picolinate and chloride) also failed to demonstrate any favorable effects of supplemental chromium, compared to placebo, on body weight or body composition.

### Chromium supplementation in non-obese non-diabetic subjects is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity [^117PuKNb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

While claims of benefits of chromium therapy on weight loss and increased muscle mass have been largely discredited, this supplement is still being promoted for its beneficial effects on insulin action and glucose tolerance. In the 1970's and 1980's there were three clinical reports of of patients with small bowel loop syndromes on parental nutrition who developed glucose intolerance and who improved following chromium therapy. These case reports led to the routine addition of chromium to TPN solutions. They also provided impetus for other clinical studies (see reviews) of chromium therapy in normal subjects, people with glucose intolerance, and people with diabetes (both type 1 and type 2). The results have been inconclusive, with some studies reporting a positive effect on glucose and/or insulin levels whereas others failing to show benefit. Design problems include open label studies; some studies including subjects with different disorders s e.g. type 1 and type 2 patients; type 2 subjects remaining on drugs that affect insulin secretion or insulin action; inadequate control of confounders such as hyperglycemia and obesity that affect insulin action; and failure to address the role of chromium levels on the measured parameters. A significant limitation of most of these studies is their use of surrogate measures such as fasting insulin and glucose tolerance tests which may not be sensitive enough to assess changes in insulin action with therapy. Very few studies employed the more accurate euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique to assess insulin action. The studies also used a wide range of chromium doses, formulations and durations of therapy. Supplementation with 200 to 1000 μg of chromium picolinate has been reported to improve glucose intolerance and lower circulating insulin levels with one study in type 2 diabetes patients showing a greater improvement with 1000 μg dose compared to 200 μg dose. The 1000 μg daily has been used in a number of other clinical studies and not associated with any toxic effects.

### Association of serum chromium levels with malnutrition in hemodialysis patients [^112Wx7CT]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Until now, the normal range and clinical role of serum chromium levels are still worthy of discussion, especially for MHD patients. In normal subjects, serum chromium levels range from 0.038 μg/L to 150 μg/L. Volpe et al. found that the mean serum chromium levels were from 0.26 μg/L to 2.62 μg/L after supplementation with 400 μg/day of chromium in the form of chromium picolinate for 12 weeks. In the current study, the SCL ranged from 0.04 μg/L to 46.3 μg/L, which was within the safe range as previously mentioned. The discrepancy of SCL in these MHD patients may be attributed to the following causes: (1) 31.2% patients had residual daily urine of > 100 mL/day, which would decrease the SCL by urinary excretion of chromium in these patients, (2) diet is one of the main sources of chromium exposure, but there are large individual variations due to different amounts of dietary intake and habits, (3) although all studied patients had been prescribed vitamin B complex (contained nicotinamide, 15 mg/tablet, and vitamin B6, 1 mg/tablet) which could increase the absorption of dietary chromium, some of them had poor drug compliance. A further research is needed to determine the exact causes of the discrepancy of SCL in dialysis patients.

### Chromium treatment has no effect in patients with type 2 diabetes in a Western population: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113Uwzj3]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Chromium treatment has been reported to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, concern exists about the possible toxic effects of chromium picolinate. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chromium treatment in the form of chromium yeast on glycemic control in a Western population of patients with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with oral hypoglycemic agents.

Research Design and Methods

In this 6-month, double-blind study, patients with moderate glycemic control, being treated with oral hypoglycemic agents, were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or treatment with 400 microg of chromium daily in the form of chromium yeast. The primary efficacy parameter was a change in A1C. Secondary end points were changes in lipid profile, BMI, blood pressure, body fat, and insulin resistance.

Results

No differences were found for the change in A1C between the intervention and placebo groups, nor were any differences found between the groups for the secondary end points.

Conclusions

There is no evidence that chromium in the form of chromium yeast is effective in improving glycemic control in Western patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking oral hypoglycemic agents.

### Cancer risk in diet supplement… [^11341d1F]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Not Available People who take chromium picolinate may get more than the increased muscle mass and reduced body fat that the popular dietary supplement promises. During last month's meeting of the American Chemical Society in Anaheim, Calif, researchers at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa reported on chromium picolinate as a possible carcinogen. Their work advanced research by the late Karen Wetterhahn, PhD, of Dartmouth University, who showed in laboratory experiments that chromium picolinate apparently induces cleavage of chromosomal DNA in cells. When chromium picolinate interacts with such common biochemicals as vitamin C, the Alabama researchers reported, the by-products react with oxygen to generate potent, DNA-damaging hydroxyl radicals.

### Chromium picolinate for insulin resistance in subjects with HIV disease: a pilot study [^112zdkML]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

Multidrug regimens in HIV disease are associated with an increased incidence of insulin resistance, by as much as 50%. Not only does insulin resistance predisposes subjects to diabetes but also it is associated with the metabolic syndrome and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Previous studies suggest that chromium picolinate can improve insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes. The objective was to study the efficacy and safety of chromium picolinate as a treatment of insulin resistance in subjects infected with HIV.

Methods

The ability of chromium picolinate (1000 mug/day) to improve insulin sensitivity, determined with a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic insulin clamp, was determined in eight HIV-positive subjects on highly active antiretroviral therapy.

Results

The mean rate of glucose disposal during the clamp was 4.41 mg glucose/kg lean body mass (LBM)/min (range 2.67–5.50), which increased to 6.51 mg/kg LBM/min (range 3.19–12.78, p = .03), an increase of 25% after 8 weeks of treatment with chromium picolinate. There were no significant changes in blood parameters, HIV viral burden or CD4+ lymphocytes with chromium picolinate treatment. Two subjects experienced abnormalities of liver function during the study. Another subject experienced an elevation in blood urea nitrogen.

Conclusions

The study shows that chromium picolinate therapy improves insulin resistance in some HIV-positive subjects, but with some concerns about safety in this population.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study to evaluate postprandial glucometabolic effects of mulberry leaf extract, vitamin D, chromium, and fiber in people with type 2 diabetes [^111eECKF]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Investigational Products

The investigational product was a 2-g blend of MLE in combination with other classical food ingredients that have been reported to modulate glucose. It consisted of 250 mg of MLE, 1.75 g of fiber, 0.75 μg of vitamin D 3, and 75 μg of chromium. The blend was tasteless, white in appearance, and was delivered in a stick-pack/sachet to sprinkle on the breakfast meal.

MLE

MLE was supplied as a powder (Reducose®) produced by Phynova (USA), and 250 mg MLE contained 12.5 mg DNJ.

Fiber

The fiber component was provided as resistant maltodextrin (Fibersol®-2, ADM/Matsutani LLC, USA), and an amount of 1.75 g represents approximately 7% of recommended daily value (RDV) in many regions across the globe, where a daily intake for adults of 25–35 g per day is advocated, yet the average intake of dietary fiber by adults worldwide remains low, typically less than 20 g per day. Aside from possible beneficial effects on glucose, dietary fiber has also been shown to have several important associations with, e.g. satiety by decreasing hunger, prolonging satiation or increasing satiety signals from the gut, metabolic health, and mortality.

Vitamin D

The vitamin D component of the blend was vitamin D 3 (0.75 μg [30 IU]), sourced from DSM (USA). Vitamin D supplementation has been associated with improvements in glycemic control in T2D.

Chromium

The chromium blend-component (75 μg chromium picolinate) was sourced from Nutrition 21 (NJ, USA). Several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated glucometabolic benefits of various dosages of chromium picolinate taken for periods of 4 weeks to 4 months.

Comparator Blend

The comparator blend without MLE consisted of the same ingredients as the blend with MLE, with the exception of the MLE, which was substituted by fiber (250 mg Fibersol®-2) to achieve weight equivalence. The blend was tasteless, off-white in appearance, and was delivered in a stick-pack/sachet with an identical appearance to the blend with the MLE.

### Trace elements in glucometabolic disorders: an update [^113ZruYy]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Biological effects

The appearance of glucose intolerance or even fasting hyperglycaemia in demonstrated cases of Cr deficiency have rapidly led to investigations on the potential of Cr supplementation in insulin resistance and diabetes. Furthermore, diabetic patients have about 1/3 less Cr in various biological samples. The reasons for this have recently been discussed. While it was shown that inorganic Cr was poorly active, Mertz and coworkers identified as early as 1955 a complex found in brewer's yeast, liver and kidney which was able to stimulate glucose transport in the presence-but not in absence- of insulin and which contained Cr. They termed it GTF [glucose tolerance factor]. Its activity required insulin and was dependent on its Cr content, ideally 4 ions/molecule, while 8 ions/molecule revealed toxic. GTF (MW about 1500) appeared to be a mixture of Cr, nicotinic acid and the 3 aminoacids constitutive of glutathione. Replacement of Cr by other metals did not reproduce GTF biological activity. It increased insulin efficacy in adipocytes at relatively high concentrations but no effects was found in diabetic patients despite demonstrable increases in Cr content of various tissues. Presently the GTF story is highly criticized because of missing informations and doubtful technical purification procedures. The GTF story continued with description of a similar structure termed LMWCr.

As for many therapeutic trials, concern must be raised as to the concentrations used. Especially in vitro and in animals studies are usually performed with irrelevant concentrations of the active compound, leading to so-called "pharmacological" effects. Accordingly these data should be viewed with appropriate caution. In vitro many beneficial effects of Cr salts have been reported for insulin resistance or diabetes; Cr chloride increased glucose transport in fat and muscle cells as well as in cardiomyocytes. This was partly explained by higher translocation of Glut-4 transporters. It also decreased oxidative stress, glycosylation and lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes and monocytes under hyperglycaemic conditions.

In animals Cr-picolinate reduced AUC for glucose in type1 diabetic rats. Insulin resistance improved in high fat/low Cr diet-fed rats, in sucrose-fed rats, in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, in GK rats, in JCR-LA corpulent rats and in db/db mice. A study in obese Zucker rats failed to report improvements.

### Effects of chromium supplementation on glycogen synthesis after high-intensity exercise [^112WbwVk]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chromium enhances insulin signaling and insulin-mediated glucose uptake in cultured cells. We investigated the effect of chromium on glycogen synthesis and insulin signaling in humans.

Methods

Sixteen overweight men (BMI = 31.1 ± 3.0 kg.m) were randomly assigned to supplement with 600 microg.d chromium as picolinate (Cr; N = 8) or a placebo (Pl; N = 8). After 4 wk of supplementation, subjects performed a supramaximal bout of cycling exercise to deplete muscle glycogen, which was followed by high-glycemic carbohydrate feedings for the next 24 h. Muscle biopsies were obtained at rest, immediately after exercise, and 2 and 24 h after exercise.

Results

Elevations in glucose and insulin during recovery were not different, but the lactate response was significantly higher in Cr. There was a significant depletion in glycogen immediately after exercise, an increase at 2 h, and a further increase above rest at 24 h (P < 0.05). The rate of glycogen synthesis during the 2 h after exercise was not different between groups (Cr: 25.8 ± 8.0 and Pl: 17.1 ± 4.7 mmol.kg.h). Glycogen synthase activity was significantly increased immediately after exercise in both groups. Muscle phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity decreased immediately after exercise and increased at 2 h (P < 0.05), with a trend for a lower PI 3-kinase response in Cr (P = 0.08).

Conclusions

Chromium supplementation did not augment glycogen synthesis during recovery from high-intensity exercise and high-carbohydrate feeding, although there was a trend for lower PI 3-kinase activity.

### Chromium supplementation in non-obese non-diabetic subjects is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity [^1135R2dt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Changes in insulin sensitivity by chromium absorption

Insulin sensitivity (M LBM/I) did not significantly differ in the chromium and placebo groups at baseline (t = -0.22, p = 0.83). After 16 weeks of therapy, the mean change in insulin sensitivity was -1.63 mg/min/kg/mU insulin (range: -8.9 to + 5.57) in the placebo group and -1.14 (-5.22 to + 4.11) in the chromium group (see Figure 1). The group x time interaction was not significant [F(1,22) = 0.36, p = .54] suggesting the degree of change in insulin sensitivity from pre- to post-assessment did not statistically differ by group.

Figure 1
Boxplot of pre and post insulin sensitivity as measured by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (M LBM/I) by group (0 = placebo group, 1 = chromium group) after 16 weeks of chromium picolinate versus placebo. There was no significant change in insulin sensitivity. -1.63 mg/min/kg/mU insulin (-8.9 to + 5.57) in the placebo group and -1.14 mg/min/kg/mU insulin (-5.22 to + 4.11) in the chromium group (p = 0.83). The serum chromium levels ranged from less than 0.5 to 1.0 μg/L in the placebo group and 0.8 to 5.5 μg/L (mean 3.0) in the chromium treated group.

### New medications which decrease levothyroxine absorption [^116moT57]. Thyroid (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Medications may sometimes interfere with the intestinal absorption of levothyroxine, primarily by forming an insoluble complex with the thyroid hormone in the intestinal lumen. The goal of this study was to examine the acute effects of three previously unstudied medications on levothyroxine absorption.

Design

We studied the effects of three medications on thyroxine absorption in seven normal volunteers. On each study day, the subjects ingested 1 mg levothyroxine sodium, either taken separately or co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel, a phosphate-binding medication used in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia), chromium picolinate (an over-the-counter nutritional supplement), or ezetimibe (Zetia, a drug used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia). Serum thyroxine was measured at intervals over a 6-hour period following drug ingestion.

Main Outcome

Sevelamer hydrochloride and chromium picolinate each significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the area under the serum thyroxine concentration curve, while ezetimibe had no effect.

Conclusion

Hypothyroid patients taking sevelamer hydrochloride or chromium picolinate should be advised to separate the time of ingestion of these drugs from their thyroid hormone preparation by several hours.

### Parenteral trace element provision: recent clinical research and practical conclusions [^116YYTrx]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

In human physiology, inorganic elements that are found in low concentrations in body tissues and fluids are generally termed as trace elements. For nine trace elements, at least one important physiological function in human metabolism is known. These trace elements are ranked as essential micronutrients and should be regularly consumed through foods and/or supplements. Shortage of intake may result in serious metabolic impairments that may lead to stunted growth, reduced physical and mental power, higher risks of chronic diseases, prolonged recovery after illness and early death (Table 1). Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) for micronutrients, including essential trace elements, are regularly published by governmental and non-governmental bodies worldwide to ensure health and well-being over a lifetime. Calculations of RDAs should be based on nutrient demands (amount of nutrient required in metabolism to avoid known signs of deficiency) and should consider average absorption rates (bioavailability) from food. True metabolic demands remain unknown for most essential trace elements, even in healthy subjects. Additional information is gained from observational studies in apparently healthy populations, and the daily nutritive intake of micronutrients is used to estimate an adequate intake range. For safety reasons, upper intake levels are defined for all essential trace elements, with the exception of chromium.

### Chromium supplementation in non-obese non-diabetic subjects is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity [^114hCrwd]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

We have addressed many of these limitations in the present study. The subjects had normal glucose intolerance and were of normal weight. The absence of obesity and hyperglycemia removes two important confounders that can affect insulin action. We also measured serum and urine chromium levels to confirm compliance and also to assess effects of chromium levels on the measured parameters. We used the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp rather than surrogate measures to assess insulin action before and after therapy. We also used chromium picolinate at a dose that previously had been reported to improve insulin resistance.

We did not observe an increase in insulin sensitivity in the treatment group, but observed a decrease in insulin sensitivity only in subjects who had high levels of serum or spot urinary chromium levels. Generally, the absorption of chromium picolinate has reported to be very low in the range of 2.8 ± 1.14% (SD) but there is significant individual variation with peak urinary excretion varying 5 fold after acute dosing. Distribution studies with labeled chromium also suggest that trivalent chromium is stored in the body principally in the liver and also in kidneys, spleen and muscle and it is possible that the impact of chromium therapy may only become apparent in studies lasting several months.

In order to further explore the mechanism by which chromium picolinate induces insulin resistance, we used a human insulin signaling pathway PCR array to examine the expression of genes in skeletal muscle before and after chromium therapy. We were unable to demonstrate any changes in gene expression with therapy in 4 subjects who became insulin resistant with therapy. The expression array examines only the genes coding for proteins that have been directly implicated in, or affected by, insulin signaling. It is of course possible that chromium therapy affects the expression of other genes that were not studied; or that chromium affects muscle insulin signaling at the level of protein function, without an impact on expression of insulin-sensitive genes, through actions that may or may not originate in skeletal muscle. Proposed targets for chromium action include membrane phosphotyrosine phosphatase, insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B.

### Chromium supplementation shortens QTc interval duration in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116cv9vL]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

We investigated the potential effects of chromium supplementation on QTc interval duration in type 2 diabetic patients.

Methods

Of 60 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 30 were randomly assigned to group A, and 30 to group B. Group A received 1000 microg of chromium picolinate (CrPic) daily for 3 months, followed by placebo in the next 3 months; group B was treated with placebo for the first 3 months and CrPic in the next 3 months. At each visit, QT interval was measured on a standard electrocardiogram by averaging 3 consecutive beats in leads II and V4 and corrected for heart rate with Bazett formula.

Results

Although baseline QTc interval was similar in both groups (422 ± 34 milliseconds in group A vs 425 ± 24 milliseconds in group B, P = 0.77), QTc interval at 3 months was shorter in group A (406 ± 35 milliseconds) than in group B (431 ± 26 milliseconds, P = 0.01). In the following 3 months, QTc interval shortened in group B but not in group A, which resulted in a comparable QTc interval duration of both groups at the end of the study (414 ± 28 milliseconds in group A vs 409 ± 22 milliseconds in group B, P = 0.50). Apart from body mass index (31.4 ± 4.2 kg/m2 in patients with QTc shortening vs 28.7 ± 4.2 kg/m2 in patients without QTc shortening, P = 0.03), none of the clinical and laboratory variables predicted QTc interval shortening in our patient cohort.

Conclusions

Short-term chromium supplementation shortens QTc interval in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### The effect of chromium supplementation on polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^116zqSRt]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition. Treatment with chromium has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in adults with PCOS. Treatment of adolescents with PCOS remains a challenge.

Objective

To investigate the effect of chromium supplementation on the various components of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescent girls.

Patients and Methods

Thirty-five adolescent girls with PCOS were enrolled. History of menstrual irregularities was recorded. All underwent physical examination for presence of acne, scoring of hirsutism, and calculation of body mass index. Pelvic ultrasonography was done and serum free testosterone was measured in all subjects. All subjects received 1000 μg chromium picolinate for 6 months followed by re-evaluation.

Results

Mean (SD) age was 15.5 (1) years (range: 14–17 y). No significant change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) with chromium supplementation was noted (1.9 (0.7) SDS vs 2 (0.7) SDS, P = 0.638). The number of patients with oligo/amenorrhea decreased with treatment (29/35 (83%) versus 11/35 (31%), P < .001). Significant reduction in mean ovarian volume (P < .001), total follicular count (P < .034), and free testosterone (P < .002) was observed. No significant improvement in acne or hirsutim was noted.

Conclusion

Supplementation with chromium to adolescents with PCOS is a promising treatment option.

### Chromium supplementation in non-obese non-diabetic subjects is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity [^115wmmLo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using PASW 18.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). After data cleaning and checking distributions to assure that all scores met assumptions, key patient characteristics at baseline were compared across the chromium and control groups using chi-square and t-tests. Between-group differences from pre- to post-assessment on LBM M/I were examined with a repeated measures ANCOVA (RM-ANCOVA) analysis controlling for patient characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, baseline BMI and triglycerides), followed by pair-wise post-hoc tests. Within the chromium treatment group only, the association between chromium absorption and change in insulin resistance was examined in a multiple regression controlling for the same background patient characteristics. Based on the wide range of urinary and serum chromium levels, and the assumption that high chromium levels reflect greater chromium absorption, patients within the chromium group were divided (median split) into a high and low chromium absorption group. A RM-ANCOVA analysis was repeated to test the group x time interaction on M LBM/ I between patients in the placebo group, low chromium absorbers, and high chromium absorbers. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore potential baseline patient measures as predictors of chromium absorption. Exploratory analyses to test whether pre-post changes in body weight or composition or lipids were associated with chromium levels were performed with ANCOVA.

The group sample size of subjects included in the final data analyses (14 active and 15 placebo) had adequate power (.80) to detect an effect of f = .30 or higher. This is equivalent to a medium/large to large effect on insulin sensitivity and had been previously reported with chromium picolinate therapy.

Two analyses to test for differential gene expression in the insulin signaling pathway between before and after treatment were performed in "R":

(i) A two-group unpaired Student's t-test assuming equal group variances. This is also the test performed by the online 'RT2 ProfilerT PCR Array Data Analysis' tool provided by the manufacturer.

(ii) A two-group paired Student's t-test assuming equal group variances (test not provided by manufacturer).

### Association of serum chromium levels with malnutrition in hemodialysis patients [^115dzZnB]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Trivalent chromium is an essential nutrient that plays a role in the metabolism of certain sugars, proteins, and fats by potentiating the action of insulin. However, occupational or environmental exposure to hexavalent chromium-containing compounds may cause multi-organ toxicity such as renal damage, asthma, and some cancers. It is worth noting that ingested hexavalent chromium is reduced efficiently to the trivalent form in the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption of trivalent chromium can be facilitated by the type of chromium ingested, as well as the effect of vitamins, proteins, drugs, and other nutritional factors, in combination with starch, ascorbic acid, minerals, oxalate, and amino acids. Picolinic and nicotinic acids have also been demonstrated to facilitate the absorption of trivalent chromium through the intestinal wall. It is interesting that Anderson et al. indicated that foods high in potassium, saturated fat, and sodium also tend to be high in chromium. Ingestion of phosphorous, vitamin B6, proteins, and carbohydrates also correlated with the ingestion of chromium. In addition, some amino acids such as histidine and glutamic acid increased the absorption of chromium from the intestine. To our knowledge, dietary restriction of potassium, phosphorous, protein, sodium, and fat is recommended for patients with chronic kidney disease with or without dialysis. However, calculations regarding the ingested amount of chromium in restricted diets of patients with dialysis are lacking. In the general population, the recommended dose of trivalent chromium is 50–200 μg per day. However, without additional chromium supplementation, more than 90% of patients' daily diets were below this recommended level (< 50 μg/day). Dietary chromium was also correlated with dietary calories (15 μg chromium/1000 kcal in the typical diet consumed in the United States. From the previously mentioned studies and our findings, we can conclude that there is a positive correlation between nutrition and dietary chromium.

### Chronic maternal dietary chromium restriction modulates visceral adiposity: probable underlying mechanisms [^113rhGSW]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

We demonstrated previously that restriction of micronutrients in utero increased body fat perdentage and central adiposity in offspring. Considering the importance of Cr in maintaining carbohydrate/lipid metabolism and modulating body composition in diabetic subjects, we investigated the effects of peri-/postnatal Cr restriction on the development of adiposity and the associated mechanisms in the WNIN rat model.

The marginally higher diet intake of CrR compared with CrC rats is in disagreement with increased food intake reported on Cr picolinate supplementation. Consistent with earlier reports, we observed no changes in the plasma lipid profile of CrR rats despite increased food intake. This could be due to moderate Cr deficiency and/or insufficient duration of Cr restriction.

Although it did not affect food intake in the offspring, peri-/postnatal Cr restriction decreased plasma Cr in CrR pups from 3 months of age, and all rehabilitation regimens restored rats to control levels, besides increasing their body weights. However, rehabilitation corrected body weight changes in male offspring partially but not in female offspring. Although in line with previous studies on the effects of Cr and vitamin A on body weight, these findings contradict reports on maternal micronutrient restriction–lowered body weight in rat offspring and Cr supplementation–increased body weight in pigs. However, some studies showed that Cr picolinate did not affect body weight. Indeed, no studies to date reported the effect of maternal Cr restriction on the offspring body weight.

Most often, high body adiposity precedes insulin resistance. In this study, maternal Cr restriction increased body fat percentage in males at 18 months of age, whereas in females it increased from 3 months of age, and only CrRC could correct these changes. These findings concur with the decreased fat percentage reported in obese subjects on Cr supplementation and our previous reports that maternal mineral restriction had similar effects in rat offspring. These observations suggest the importance of Cr during gestation and lactation in modulating body fat in offspring.

Increased visceral fat is usually associated with obesity and attendant metabolic disorders. That chronic maternal Cr restriction significantly increased adiposity index in the offspring and rehabilitation did not correct it stresses the importance of Cr during growth, gestation, and lactation in modulating visceral adiposity in offspring. These results agree with those reported in vitamin A restriction and our findings in offspring of Mg-restricted rats, which indicate that maternal Cr restriction increased adiposity, especially visceral adiposity, in offspring and may therefore predispose to insulin resistance and associated diseases in later life.

### Chromium as adjunctive treatment for type 2 diabetes [^115oGWE1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of trivalent chromium in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

Data Sources

The English literature was searched from 1966 through May 2002 using MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and EMBASE. The key words included chromium, glucose, lipids, and diabetes. Pertinent references from review articles and studies were used as additional sources.

Data Synthesis

Trivalent chromium is an essential nutrient and has a key role in lipid and glucose metabolism. Supplementation with chromium does not appear to reduce glucose levels in euglycemia. It may, however, have some efficacy in reducing glucose levels in hyperglycemia. The effects of chromium on lipid levels are variable. Chromium in doses < 1000 microg/d appears to be safe for short-term administration. Kidney function and dermatologic changes need to be monitored.

Conclusions

Chromium appears to be a safe supplement and may have a role as adjunctive therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Additional large-scale, long-term, randomized, double-blind studies examining the effect of various doses and forms of chromium are needed.

### Association of serum chromium levels with malnutrition in hemodialysis patients [^11232aUg]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic, low-grade inflammation has been considered a hallmark feature in patients with chronic kidney disease, and being contributing to the development of protein-energy wasting, as well as accountable for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The elevation of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein is often observed in chronic dialysis patients. In an animal study, chromium supplement could ameliorate inflammation in the respiratory system of type 2 diabetes rats. In human studies, Saiyed et al. revealed that chromium dinicocysteinate supplementation has beneficial effects on reducing vascular inflammation and oxidative stress compared to placebo; Jamilian et al. found that hs-CRP level is decreased after taking chromium for 8 weeks in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. However, we did not found the association between SCL and inflammation in MHD patients, which may be due to the complicated and different mechanisms of inflammation in dialysis patients as compared with the general population. Nevertheless, we found that in the 4 SCL quartile groups, the serum ferritin level decreased as SCL increased (Table 1), and ferritin levels were negatively associated with SCLs (Table 2 and Fig. 1). A study in rats by Ani et al. showed that the serum concentration of ferritin was reduced by 22% following intraperitoneal injections with chromium (1 mg/kg) for 45 days compared with rats injected with saline alone. A study in men by Lukaski et al. indicated that high-dose and long-term chromium picolinate supplement may predispose an individual to iron deficiency. These reports have suggested that chromium may compete with iron for binding to apo-transferrin, and further influence the related biochemical parameters because of the chemical similarities between the two metal ions. On the basis of this interaction, we may observe the negative association between SCL and ferritin in this clinical study. In addition, after adjustment with ferritin and hemoglobin levels, we did not found a significant trend between the doses of erythropoietin and SCL (p = 0.588) in the four subgroups. T here was also no statistically significant relationship between SCL and the doses of erythropoietin (p = 0.680) in these studied patients. Hence, low chromium level may not be a reason for erythropoietin resistance in dialysis population. However, a further study is needed to determine the relationship and to explore the mechanism.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^117WKqFS]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Parenteral chromium exposure, requirements, and product recommendations in PN: There are several reports in PN patients of serum and urine chromium concentrations 10–100 times normal values, while a normal adult diet provides approximately 35 mcg/d of chromium. Recent studies have revised estimated dietary chromium absorption from 10%–20% down to 0.4%–2.5%, meaning the absorbed amount from a standard adult oral diet is only 0.4–0.9 mcg/d. In PN, contamination of a 2-L composite formula is approximately 15 mcg per day in addition to 11 mcg/d intentionally added from a multiple TE product, which amounts to a parenteral chromium dose that is 30–60 times greater than the current estimated requirement. In adults, there are no reported cases of chromium toxicity in patients on long-term PN, but in children glomerular filtration rates in PN-dependent children were inversely related to cumulative parenteral chromium intake and PN duration. Current adult multiple TE products provide 10–15 mcg/d of chromium, yet based on oral absorption the parenteral requirements may be as low as 0.14–0.87 mcg/d. A.S.P.E.N. recommends that in addition to the current multiple TE products that contain 10–15 mcg/d of chromium, a multiple TE product without added chromium should be made.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Do not use unless solution is clear and seal is intact. Chromium 4 mcg/mL (Chromic Chloride Injection, USP) should only be used in conjunction with a pharmacy directed admixture program using aseptic technique in a laminar flow environment; it should be used promptly and in a single operation without any repeated penetrations. Solution contains no preservatives; discard unused portion immediately after admixture procedure is completed.

In assessing the contribution of chromium supplements to maintenance of glucose homeostasis, consideration should be given to the possibility that the patient may be diabetic.

Geriatric Use

An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

Laboratory Tests

Because chromium is present in the bloodstream in microgram quantities, routine measurement is impractical. If necessary, samples can be sent to a reference laboratory for assay.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility

Long-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Chromium 4 mcg/mL (Chromic Chloride Injection, USP) have not been performed, nor have studies been done to assess mutagenesis or impairment of fertility.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Chromium 4 mcg/mL (Chromic Chloride Injection, USP) is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

See DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION section. Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

Pregnancy

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with chromic chloride. It is also not known whether chromic chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Chromic chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly indicated.

### Zinc as nutritional intervention and prevention measure for COVID-19 disease [^116XXQWp]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Nutritional and clinical aspects

Foods abundant in zinc are fish, seafood, egg, meat, seeds, nuts, whole cereals and legumes. In contrast, refined cereal products lack zinc. The bioavailability of zinc is higher when obtained from animal sources compared with vegetable sources and further depends on diet composition. A high dietary intake of phytates, certain fibres and lignin can bind zinc and therefore reduce zinc absorption. Phytates are more present in plant foods like unrefined cereal products and legumes. Besides, high calcium or iron intake may interfere with zinc absorption. In addition, people with malabsorption as a result of gastrointestinal surgery, digestive disorders (like chronic diarrhoea, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) or various other chronic illnesses are at risk of getting insufficient zinc.

The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of zinc for adults in Europe is 11 mg/day for men and 8 mg/day for women with a tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 40 mg/day for both males and females. Different recommendations instead apply for children depending on their age: for ages 4–8 years the RDA is 5 mg/day (UL is 12 mg/day), for ages 9–13 years the RDA is 8 mg/day (UL = 23 mg/day) and for ages 14–18 years the RDA is 11 mg/day for males and 9 mg/day for females (UL is 34 mg/day for both sexes). Dosages considered as safe for oral supplementation in adults are between 10 and 12 mg/day. Excessive dosages resulting in total daily dietary intakes reaching above the ULs, especially for prolonged periods of time, should be avoided. An overdose of zinc can induce copper deficiency and zinc accumulation has toxic effects. Bioavailability of oral zinc supplements differs depending on their chemical composition. Zinc gluconate, citrate and picolinate are better absorbed compared with zinc oxide. Forms of zinc bound to amino acid compounds like aspartate, histidine and cysteine show higher bioavailability in comparison to zinc sulphate, chloride or acetate, with zinc oxide having the lowest uptake.

### What is known about the safety of multivitamin-multimineral supplements for the generally healthy population? Theoretical basis for harm [^113XrafH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Assessment of the safety of nutrients presents a challenge different from that posed by the assessment of other chemicals in food such as additives or contaminants. Because nutrients are essential, a dose-response relation exists at both ends of the intake range, separated by a safe range of intake that reflects normal homeostatic processes. The safe intake may not be the same for all population groups and life stages. The size of the safe intake range for each nutrient will vary and in a few cases may be very small. Certain nutrients such as vitamin A and manganese have known and potentially serious adverse effects at high intakes, whereas others such as iron or vitamin C may have more minor adverse effects that are readily reversible and may only be associated with supplement intake. The risk of harm occurring from taking dietary supplements will depend on the safe intake range of the nutrient concerned, the susceptibility of the individual, and the likely intake of the same nutrient from other supplements or the rest of the diet. In many cases, the available database for the safety of nutrients is very limited because the studies, where available, were not designed to assess adverse effects but may have detected problems when they occurred. Further information on the safety of nutrients could be obtained through careful experimental design.

### Nickel, chromium and cobalt in consumer products: revisiting safe levels in the new millennium [^112E725r]. Contact Dermatitis (2003). Low credibility.

The transition metals nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr) and cobalt (Co) are common causes of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Given the high frequency with which these allergens can be associated with hand eczema in those responsible for domestic work, it has been suggested that contamination of household consumer products with these metals may be of relevance to the causation/chronicity of hand dermatitis. Dose-response studies using 48 h occlusive patch test conditions in sensitized individuals show that ≥ 90% of sensitized patients fail to react below 1 p.p.m., even on irritated skin. Assessment under more realistic exposure conditions has shown that in the presence of irritants and/or following repeated exposures, such individuals rarely react to levels below 10 p.p.m. On the basis of this information, it was recommended a decade ago that household (and other consumer) products should not contain more than 5 p.p.m. of each of Ni, Cr or Co and that, for an even greater degree of protection, the ultimate target level should be 1 p.p.m. The data generated since the original recommendations were made serve to reinforce the validity of these recommendations. Indeed, it is our view that typically the level of each of these transition metals should not normally exceed 1 p.p.m. Then, where consumer products meet this guideline fully, modern quantitative risk assessment shows clearly that elicitation of ACD is highly improbable, and the chance of the induction of sensitization is even lower.

### Chromium in parenteral nutrition: too little or too much? [^114qh3CN]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Although guidelines for routine parenteral supplements of chromium (Cr) were published, there remain major concerns about the infusion of excess Cr. In addition, little information is available on appropriate dosage for intravenous usage. Cr functions as a regulator of insulin action. In humans, the 3 reported cases of Cr deficiency developed peripheral neuropathy, weight loss, and hyperglycemia. Supplementation of Cr to the parenteral nutrition (PN) solution corrected these abnormalities. For parenteral Cr, concerns arise from the high levels found in sera (up to 40-fold higher) and tissues (10- to 100-fold higher) and their effects on kidneys: In 15 children receiving long-term PN, the glomerular filtration rate was lower than that of non-PN controls and was inversely correlated with Cr indices. Furthermore, in a randomized blinded prospective protocol involving 75 newborns, the group receiving the recommended dose of Cr showed higher levels of creatinine that were positively correlated with Cr intake. Of note, Cr contaminants in PN solutions can increase the amount delivered by 10%-100%. A possible method for estimating adequate Cr to be provided IV is to calculate the amount physiologically absorbed in healthy people. This amount is 10 to 100 times less than the daily recommended parenteral Cr in adults. The accumulated scientific data presented here point to a serious need to lower the recommended amount of parenteral Cr.

### Chromium supplementation; negotiation with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and depression [^115i7FVd]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Chromium (Cr) is an essential trace element which found naturally in a daily diet and available in the form of supplementary tablets to boost disorders like diabetes mellitus (DM) and functions like lipid metabolism and beneficial on depression too. Diabetes is one of the most prevalent endocrine diseases or in other words, the most severe metabolic syndrome (MS), which associated with high production of free-radicals which is out of bodies detoxifying machine capacity or high oxidative stress (HOS), vasculitis and elevated lipid profile. many research papers and clinical trials published about the significance of chromium on biological activities, pre and post clinical. For this review research articles, clinical trials, from 1 st Jan'10 to 31 st Dec'18 and refer literature for the biochemical, pharmacological and biological activity of Chromium. Primarily articles gathered from the above search engines. Then precisely according to our aim and goal and regarding designed objectives dismisses similar articles and finally came to 84 articles for the above said period. This review trying to cover the entire picture from what chromium is to the recent updates on their greater role in increasing insulin sensitivity of cells and enhancing lipid metabolism and even recent findings suggest its positive effects including prevention and ameliorating properties on depression. The biological activities, pharmacological features, clinical implications including efficacy and role of chromium compounds on the glycaemic index will be discussed. The outcome of this review is to bring the pros and cons of chromium supplementation along with is safety and toxicity concern beside molecular pathways, biochemistry and clinical trials, all in one comprehensive review.

WARNINGS

Direct intramuscular or intravenous injection of Chromium 4 mcg/mL (Chromic Chloride Injection, USP) is contraindicated, as the acidic pH of the solution may cause considerable tissue irritation.

Severe kidney disease may make it necessary to reduce or omit chromium and zinc doses because these elements are primarily eliminated in the urine.

WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.

Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

### Overview of dietary supplements on patients with type 2 diabetes [^114Z4Hst]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The primary approach for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) involves lifestyle modification and diet therapy along with pharmacologic interventions. Many patients are interested to identify nutritional supplements that may provide benefit in prevention and management of diabetes. However, the efficacy and safety of nutritional supplements such as chromium, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamin D, zinc and magnesium in disease treatment is a worrying and controversial matter. In this narrative review, patients and health care providers are introduced to the effects of mentioned dietary supplements that may help in choosing or not choosing these supplements in treatment of diabetes.

Methods

This review was carried out using comprehensive and systematic literature reports on the dietary supplements in the management of diabetes. Empirical searches were conducted using Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed databases. Searches were also undertaken using keywords, in English, such as "chromium" OR "vitamin D" OR "omega-3 fatty acids" OR "zinc" OR "magnesium" in combination with "type 2 diabetes".

Results

The available evidence is insufficient to create a definite conclusion that nutritional supplements including chromium, n-3 PUFAs, vitamin D, zinc and magnesium might be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of T2DM and therefore, the general recommendation to use these supplements in the management of diabetes cannot be justified. The results of most studies lack uniformity across multiple aspects, including different dose and formation of supplements, duration, and subjects under intervention.

Conclusions

There is a need for well-designed, high quality, large and long-term studies to strengthen the available evidence and ensure the safety and efficacy of products.

### Study details | NCT00759993 | Chromium piccolinate in the prevention of weight gain induced by serotonergic medications initiated on psychiatric inpatient units [^1141g1MV]. ClinicalTrials (2008). Low credibility.

Study Overview A majority of patients who suffer from mental illness are treated with serotonin regulating FDA approved medications. Some of these medications also block histamine transmission, increase blood prolactin levels, induce insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and promote sedation. All of which lead to weight gain and obesity. Many of these drugs are generally safe and effective but do carry the risk of a long term side effect in that acute and gradual weight gain of 10–30 pounds over a few months to a year of treatment. Furthermore, one investigator has published data showing acute, clinically significant weightgain in serotonergically treated psychiatric inpatients. The authors theorize that the use of chromium may reduce carbohydrate craving, appetite and thus protect against weight gain side effects.

We feel chromium piccolinate is less toxic/hazardous than many of the weght loss medications that we currently use and therefore suggest a long term randomized, controlled study where subjects will receive active drug or placebo at the start of any serotonergic treatment while inpatient. The chromium piccolinate and the placbo will be obtained from the Nutrition 21 company, which has been approved by the FDA as a source of this product. Drug: chromium piccolinate Drug: placebo for chromium piccolinate
- crmpicc01.
- Written informed consent is obtained.
- The subject is English-speaking and 18 through 64 years of age inclusive.
- The subject is currently receiving a serotonergic agent or is scheduled to receive a new or change in serotonergic psychotropic agents for their a psychiatric condition or can document that they have been on a stable regimen without any weight gain in last 3 months as a result.
- The subject must have capacity to obtain and give informed consent
- The subject must express concern about weight gain as a potential serotonin side effect.
- The patient is in good health as determined by a medical and psychiatric history, medical examination, and cannot have major medical illness that would jeopardize patient health during the study.
- The patient has a clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical examination or medical history which makes subject medically unstable at time of screening.
- The subject can not be currently on any medication that is clearly being used to lower weight. Examples include: Xenical, Metformin, Wellbutrin, Topomax, psycho-stimulants, and Moban.

### Effect of chromium supplementation on glucose metabolism and lipids: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^11217xLS]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

A systematic review of the effect of chromium supplementation on glucose metabolism and lipid levels.

Research Design and Methods

A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau. Eligible studies were English language randomized controlled trials of chromium supplement intake ≥ 3 weeks, with ≥ 10 participants receiving chromium. All trials with glucose metabolism outcomes and trials of individuals with diabetes or glucose intolerance for lipid outcomes were included. Meta-analyses were performed as appropriate.

Results

Forty-one studies met criteria, almost half of which were of poor quality. Among participants with type 2 diabetes, chromium supplementation improved glycosylated hemoglobin levels by -0.6% (95% CI -0.9 to -0.2) and fasting glucose by -1.0 mmol/l (-1.4 to -0.5) but not lipids. There was no benefit in individuals without diabetes. There were some indications of dose effect and differences among chromium formulations. Larger effects were more commonly observed in poor-quality studies. The evidence was limited by poor study quality, heterogeneity in methodology and results, and a lack of consensus on assessment of chromium status.

Conclusions

No significant effect of chromium on lipid or glucose metabolism was found in people without diabetes. Chromium supplementation significantly improved glycemia among patients with diabetes. However, future studies that address the limitations in the current evidence are needed before definitive claims can be made about the effect of chromium supplementation.

### Factitiously elevated blood chromium [^111NosfW]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Chromium toxicity is rare in individuals who do not have a history of occupational or deliberate exposure to chromium or chromium-containing compounds.

Case Report

A 39-year-old female with confirmed bile acid malabsorption had an elevated whole blood chromium concentration of 76.3 nmol/L (normal < 40 nmol/L). There was no history of chromium exposure and no clinical signs of chromium toxicity. Two repeat samples drawn through a butterfly needle, after discarding of an initial blood draw, also revealed an elevated blood chromium concentration (60.1, 122.7 nmol/L). A subsequent sample collected through a plastic intravenous cannula revealed a normal whole blood chromium concentration of 35 nmol/L.

Discussion

The elevated chromium concentrations were likely because of exogenous contamination from chromium within the venepuncture and butterfly needles. An appropriate sampling technique involving plastic cannula should be used when measuring blood chromium concentrations.

### Parenteral trace element provision: recent clinical research and practical conclusions [^1137Yxqq]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Chromium

In 1977, the first clinical signs of chromium deprivation were documented in a patient receiving TPN who developed severe diabetic-like symptoms refractory to insulin supply. The addition of 200 μg of chromium to the daily PN solution for 3 weeks resulted in an alleviation of symptoms such as glucose intolerance, weight loss and neuropathy, and the patient no longer required exogenous insulin. The reversal of diabetic-like symptoms in patients receiving PN via the provision of short-term high-dose chromium has been repeatedly confirmed, and several case reports are documented. A reliable biomarker of chromium status in patients receiving PN is lacking, and the early detection of chromium deficiency remains problematic in patients receiving PN. Clinical observation of the symptoms of chromium deficiency and their reversibility with chromium supplementation remains the most reliableand only generally accepted indicator of chromium deprivation. In 2014, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) specified the available evidence to be insufficient to provide evidence of the essentiality of chromium in human metabolism in healthy and diseased adults.

In a previous study, 50 μg/day of chromium was reported to balance urinary excretion. In subsequent studies in patients in intensive care, 100 μg/day was required to balance urinary losses. Using supplements, serum concentrations above the normal range were found with a chromium intake of 10 μg/day, and elevated tissue concentrations were found with an intake of 14 μg/day. Many of the patients who received supplemental chromium exhibited serum, urine or tissue chromium concentrations above the normal range without clinical signs of chromium toxicity. Homoeostatic control of chromium depends on renal excretion. Therefore, chromium supplementation in patients with renal dysfunction is not recommended.

On the basis of serum concentrations as a reliable biomarker, 10 μg/day of chromium should be sufficient in PN therapy.

### Investigation of lead and chromium exposure after consumption of contaminated cinnamon-containing applesauce-United States, November 2023-April 2024 [^117NqpDM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This investigation identified 566 cases of high BLLs after consumption of applesauce containing cinnamon that was contaminated with lead and chromium. Reported signs and symptoms included abdominal pain, lethargy, and developmental or behavioral symptoms, all of which, although nonspecific, are consistent with lead poisoning. The long-term implications of this event remain unknown.

Lead can affect nearly every organ system, with central nervous system effects being the primary concern in pediatric exposures, causing harm that might not be immediately apparent and that might be lifelong. The presence of lead in blood is associated with declines in cognitive and neuromotor and neurosensory function. Although exact levels at which this occurs in acute poisoning events is unclear, there is no safe BLL in children. Health effects of eating food contaminated with chromium (VI) (hexavalent chromium), the form found in lead chromate, are not well understood. Most data on health effects of hexavalent chromium come from inhalational and dermal exposures in the workplace, where long-term exposures have resulted in lung disease, ulceration of mucous membranes, and cancer. CDC did not recommend for or against testing chromium levels in blood, serum, or urine among persons affected by this event. Chromium levels only reflect recent exposures, because chromium is rapidly eliminated from the body. Results are difficult to interpret and do not guide clinical management, because the levels at which chromium causes harm are not well established. CDC did recommend blood lead testing for children who consumed a recalled product because results can guide follow-up actions for prevention and medical treatment.

This investigation highlights the importance of primary prevention, i.e. preventing toxic exposures before they occur. Increased product testing is essential to identifying contaminated products and preventing them from entering the food supply. However, the globalized food and consumer good supply chain might increase the potential for outbreaks of lead poisoning and underscores the continued need for childhood blood lead testing and resources to support follow-up investigations and referrals for services to protect health. CDC's CLPPP has helped build capacity for state and local childhood lead poisoning prevention programs, which were essential throughout this investigation. In North Carolina, where the first cases were identified, CDC had provided nearly three decades of support to CLPPP and the state has a cadre of highly experienced and skilled public health professionals who were able to quickly identify and act on those cases.

### Trace elements in glucometabolic disorders: an update [^117XjEso]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Many trace elements, among which metals, are indispensable for proper functioning of a myriad of biochemical reactions, more particularly as enzyme cofactors. This is particularly true for the vast set of processes involved in regulation of glucose homeostasis, being it in glucose metabolism itself or in hormonal control, especially insulin. The role and importance of trace elements such as chromium, zinc, selenium, lithium and vanadium are much less evident and subjected to chronic debate. This review updates our actual knowledge concerning these five trace elements. A careful survey of the literature shows that while theoretical postulates from some key roles of these elements had led to real hopes for therapy of insulin resistance and diabetes, the limited experience based on available data indicates that beneficial effects and use of most of them are subjected to caution, given the narrow window between safe and unsafe doses. Clear therapeutic benefit in these pathologies is presently doubtful but some data indicate that these metals may have a clinical interest in patients presenting deficiencies in individual metal levels. The same holds true for an association of some trace elements such as chromium or zinc with oral antidiabetics. However, this area is essentially unexplored in adequate clinical trials, which are worth being performed.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: micronutrient supplementation [^116C8pGv]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Dietary supplement safety oversight — Manufacturers and/or distributors are "responsible for ensuring product safety before marketing of dietary supplements", and they "are presumed to be safe based on their history of use; thus, they do not require an FDA premarket review of safety or efficacy". For "any new dietary ingredient sold after DSHEA's implementation" and not recognized as present in the food supply, the manufacturer and distributor "must notify the FDA of the intention to market the product and provide the FDA the information used to conclude that the ingredient was generally regarded as safe to consume", and once marketed, "the FDA has the authority to remove a product in the case that they prove it to be unsafe". The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) "monitors safety largely by collecting adverse event reports from consumers, health professionals, and manufacturers through MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program", and the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires the responsible party to submit serious adverse event reports "within 15 business days" and to keep records "for 6 years". The FDA defines a serious adverse event as one that results in "death", "a life-threatening experience", "inpatient hospitalization", "a persistent or significant disability or incapacity", "a congenital anomaly or birth defect", or that "requires, based on reasonable medical judgment, a medical or surgical intervention to prevent an outcome listed above". The FDA "received 6,307 mandatory serious AERs for dietary supplements from 2008 through 2011", and "Six of the 10 dietary supplements receiving the most mandatory AERs were MVM supplements", but "an AER alone does not indicate a causal relationships" because co-consumed products or preexisting conditions could contribute.

### Chromic chloride [^115LMpFj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Trivalent chromium is part of glucose tolerance factor, an essential activator of insulin-mediated reactions. Chromium helps to maintain normal glucose metabolism and peripheral nerve function.

Providing chromium during TPN helps prevent deficiency symptoms including impaired glucose tolerance, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and a confusional state similar to mild/moderate hepatic encephalopathy.

Serum chromium is bound to transferrin (siderophilin) in the beta globulin fraction. Typical blood levels for chromium range from 1 to 5 mcg/liter, but blood levels are not considered a meaningful index of tissue stores. Administration of chromium supplements to chromium- deficient patients can result in normalization of the glucose tolerance curve from the diabetic-like curve typical of chromium deficiency. This response is viewed as a more meaningful indicator of chromium nutriture than serum chromium levels.

Excretion of chromium is via the kidneys, ranging from 3 to 50 mcg/day. Biliary excretion via the small intestine may be an ancillary route, but only small amounts of chromium are believed to be excreted in this manner.

### Chromium (VI) contact dermatitis: getting closer to understanding the underlying mechanisms of toxicity and Sensitization! [^111GBJky]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Various haptens trigger innate immune pathways and/or induce cytotoxicity as a part of sensitization. Adam et al. decipher in vitro the mechanisms by which chromium(VI) induces inflammation, the likely prerequisites for toxicity, sensitization, and allergic contact dermatitis against chromium(VI). Importantly, and in line with other observations, chromium(VI), but not chromium(III) (or Ni(II)), induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in turn activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, allowing increased IL-1β processing and secretion, which likely underlies both chromium(VI)-induced cutaneous toxicity and sensitization. Interrupting this mechanism, perhaps with reducing agents or inhibitors of the NLRP3/IL-1 axis, may be a new option to prevent occupational chromium toxicity and allergy.

### A method to distinguish chromium-tanned leathers with low and high risks of surface hexavalent chromium [^116XrSA6]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

A fundamental difference between European and Californian chemical legislation is whether the consumer needs to be informed about the chemical risks. The relevant legislation in the European Union specifies a restriction limit (recently lowered to 1 mg/kg), while Californian legislation allows any values as long as the consumer is warned. In any case, accurate testing is necessary, especially since even the now suggested 1 mg/kg Cr(VI) restriction limit corresponds for typical leather thicknesses and densities to 0.01–0.05 μg/cm 2, which is close to the 10% minimum elicitation limit of 0.03 μg/cm 2.

The proposed method cannot identify the specifics of the antioxidants/tannins nor determine how long the leather's reduction capacity would last. Studies have shown that the reduction capacity can decrease or change with time, although it is unknown if those studies were done on leathers that would be equivalent to leathers produced in a state‐of‐the‐art Gold Leather Working Group rated tannery. To test long‐term exposure scenarios, a long‐term sequential protocol and a protocol simulating the washout of antioxidants can be used. While spiking methods are commonly used to validate analytical methods or to measure the reduction capacity of solutions or soils, this protocol is the first to use it for consumer products. The concept could, in the future, be used for other consumer products, which are suspected to change the bioavailability and chemical form of potentially sensitising substances.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a ready-to-drink bowel preparation: subanalysis by age from a phase III, assessor-blinded study [^113hxC4K]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) increase with age and, therefore, it is recommended that adults undergo regular CRC screening, ideally by colonoscopy, with some new guidelines recommending screening begin at 45years. Effective bowel preparation is a critical step to a successful colonoscopy. Of concern is that older adults may have poorer quality of bowel preparation or reduced tolerability for the bowel preparation. Here, we performed a post hoc secondary analysis for the effect of age on the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of ready-to-drink sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and citric acid (SPMC oral solution) bowel preparation.

Methods

A phase III, randomized, assessor-blinded, multicenter, non-inferiority study was conducted comparing split-dose, low-volume SPMC oral solution with split-dose, low-volume sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and citric acid powder for oral solution. A post hoc secondary analysis was performed to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SPMC oral solution by age group (< 50years, 50-64years, ⩾65years). The prespecified primary efficacy endpoint ('responders') was the proportion of participants with 'excellent' or 'good' ratings on a modified Aronchick Scale (AS). Secondary efficacy outcomes were the quality of cleansing of the right colon as assessed by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS); as well as selected findings from the Mayo Clinic Bowel Prep Tolerability Questionnaire. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs) and laboratory evaluations.

Results

Within age groups, at least 83.9% of participants were responders by the AS, and at least 91.1% of participants were responders by the BBPS in the right colon. On both scales, responder rates were highest in the youngest age group and decreased with increasing age. Greater than 88% of participants in any age group found the preparation 'easy' or 'acceptable' to ingest, with rates of 'easy' being highest in the oldest age group. No new safety signals were seen in any age group. The most commonly reported drug-related, treatment-emergent AEs were, by ascending age group, nausea (7.0%, 3.2%, 0.8%), headache (4.2%, 2.8%, 1.6%) and vomiting (2.8%, 1.2%, 0.8%).

Conclusion

Ready-to-drink SPMC oral solution showed good efficacy of overall colon cleansing and tolerability in adults across different age groups, including those ⩾65years. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03017235.

### A dual-action, low-volume bowel cleanser administered the day before colonoscopy: results from the SEE CLEAR II study [^1137o11s]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Optimal bowel preparation is vital for the efficacy and safety of colonoscopy. The inconvenience, discomfort, required consumption of large volumes of product, and potential adverse effects associated with some bowel preparations deter patients from colonoscopy and may provide inadequate cleansing. A dual-action, non-phosphate, natural orange-flavored, low-volume preparation containing sodium picosulfate and magnesium citrate (P/MC) is currently being reviewed for bowel cleansing.

Methods

This was a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, assessor-blinded, prespecified non-inferiority, head-to-head study to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of day-before administration of P/MC vs. 2L polyethylene glycol solution and two 5-mg bisacodyl tablets (2L PEG-3350 and bisacodyl tablets (HalfLytely and Bisacodyl Tablets Bowel Prep Kit)) in adult patients preparing for colonoscopy (SEE CLEAR II Study). The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of P/MC to 2L PEG-3350 and bisacodyl tablets in overall colon cleansing using a modified Aronchick scale. In addition, efficacy in the ascending, mid (transverse and descending), and recto-sigmoid segments of colon was evaluated using a modified Ottawa scale. Patient acceptability and tolerability of the bowel preparations were assessed via a standard questionnaire. Safety was assessed based on the monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and meaningful findings on clinical evaluations including physical examinations, vital sign measurements, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).

Results

A total of 603 patients were randomized to receive either P/MC (n = 300) or 2L PEG-3350 and bisacodyl tablets (n = 303). Based on the Aronchick scale, successful overall cleansing was similar in patients receiving P/MC (83.0%) and patients receiving 2L PEG-3350 and bisacodyl tablets (79.7%). P/MC demonstrated non-inferiority to 2L PEG-3350 and bisacodyl tablets in overall cleansing of the colon, as measured by the Aronchick scale. Similarly, the efficacy of P/MC, as measured by the Ottawa scale, was non-inferior to 2L PEG-3350 and bisacodyl tablets in cleansing the ascending, mid, and recto-sigmoid segments of the colon. Patient-reported acceptability and tolerability for each item examined on the questionnaire was significantly greater for P/MC compared with 2L PEG-3350 and bisacodyl tablets (P < 0.0001). Treatment-emergent AEs related to the bowel preparation reported by 1% of patients receiving P/MC or 2L PEG-3350 and bisacodyl tablets were nausea (3.0% vs. 4.3%), vomiting (1.4% vs. 2.0%), and headache (2.7% vs. 1.7%). No clinically meaningful changes were noted in either treatment arm in data collected from physical examinations, vital sign measurements, and ECGs.

Conclusions

When administered as a day-before dose, the bowel cleansing effects of P/MC were non-inferior compared with 2L PEG-3350 and bisacodyl tablets using the clinician-rated Aronchick and Ottawa scales. Treatment acceptability was significantly more favorable in patients receiving P/MC than in patients receiving 2L PEG-3350 and bisacodyl tablets.

### Mitochondrial ATP synthase as a direct molecular target of chromium (III) to ameliorate hyperglycaemia stress [^113ZmKWN]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Chromium exists in the nature in two common oxidation states, i.e. Cr(III) and Cr(VI), with the trivalent Cr(III) being relatively nontoxic, while hexavalent Cr(VI) compounds are highly redox-active and have long been known as potent toxicants and carcinogens even at low concentrations. Chromate and dichromate are two common forms of Cr(VI) with chromate predominating under physiological conditions. Cr(VI) compounds have been demonstrated to inhibit thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and oxidize thioredoxin (Trx) and peroxiredoxin (PrX). There are also controversial reports on the oxidation states of Cr(III) in cells, and it has been reported that Cr(III) supplements could be readily oxidized to carcinogenic Cr(VI) in living cells. Cr(III) is ubiquitous in food at a very low concentration and has been extensively used as a nutritional supplement. However, the physiological/pharmacological effects of trivalent chromium remain largely obscure and contradictory results exist in both its efficacy and molecular mechanism. The concentrations of chromium are normally in the range of 0.11–16.4 ng/mL and 3–800 ng/g in human blood and different tissues, respectively, in non-exposed populations.

### Optimizing bowel preparation quality for colonoscopy: consensus recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^115ETbK3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Sodium picosulfate + magnesium citrate — comparative efficacy and tolerability versus polyethylene glycol–electrolyte solution (PEG-ELS) are reported from meta-analyses, with a trend toward superior bowel preparation quality for 1 L, 2 L, and 4 L PEG-ELS compared with sodium picosulfate + magnesium citrate (RR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.86–1.01; P = 0.07), and vomiting reported more often with PEG-ELS while dizziness was more often with sodium picosulfate + magnesium citrate (risk ratio = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.38, 1.00).

### A pilot study of the safety and efficacy of picolinic acid gel in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^1146GW4U]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cost limitations, adverse effects or lack of efficacy limit the use of current topical therapies in mild to moderate acne vulgaris.

Objectives

To determine the safety and efficacy of picolinic acid, a novel zinc finger therapy, in the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris.

Methods

Twenty subjects with mild to moderate acne vulgaris were treated at our centre during an open-label study with 10% picolinic acid gel (PCL-016) twice daily to the face over 12 weeks.

Results

Fifteen patients completed the 12-week open-label study. A reduction of 58.2% (P < 0.001) in mean total lesion count, 55.5% (P < 0.001) in mean inflammatory lesion count and 59.7% (P < 0.005) in noninflammatory lesion count was seen in this population. No serious adverse events or clinically significant changes in laboratory values were noted.

Conclusions

Results from this study suggest that 10% picolinic acid gel applied twice daily may be safe and effective in the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^113i6dmS]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) trace element (TE) contamination — component sources, variability, and magnitude are described as follows: Studies analyzing TE contents of PN component products have shown several contaminants in amounts greater than 1 mcg/L, and TE contamination was found in all PN components tested, with the greatest amounts in the amino acids, potassium chloride, calcium gluconate, and sodium chloride products. In a 2-L PN solution assembled from tested components, investigators found an extra 1.1 mg Zn, 0.08 mg Cu, 38 mcg Mn, 15 mcg Cr, and 21 mcg Se, with contaminant Mn and Cr approximately 63% and 100% of recommended daily requirements, respectively. Contamination levels varied between manufacturers and lots; chromium contamination was substantial in all formulations evaluated but was greatest in a "renal" formulation and occurred primarily in dextrose, amino acids, and TE components. The current multi-TE products available in the U.S. provide excessive copper and manganese.
