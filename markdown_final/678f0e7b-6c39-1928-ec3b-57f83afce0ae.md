## Question

What does high choltide mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "high choltide" means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "choltide" is a typographical error for "chloride". Then, I should verify the normal serum chloride range and define what constitutes "high" chloride. Next, I will review the clinical contexts in which hyperchloremia arises, including fluid therapy, kidney disease, and endocrine or gastrointestinal disorders. After that, I should examine the pathophysiological mechanisms linking high chloride to adverse outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical significance and outline practical management considerations, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and correct any overstatements as needed.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "choltide" does not map to a standard medical term; wait, let me verify that this is most likely a misspelling of "chloride", which is the major extracellular anion and the subject of extensive clinical literature and guidelines, including its role in acid–base physiology and fluid management decisions [^75b2c071] [^fec1a100].

> I will now examine the normal reference range for serum chloride; typically, normal serum chloride is about 98–106 mmol/L, so "high chloride" (hyperchloremia) is generally defined as a serum chloride above roughly 106–110 mmol/L, with many studies and reviews treating values above 110 mmol/L as clearly elevated and clinically relevant in certain contexts [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the common clinical scenarios that raise serum chloride; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while high-chloride intravenous fluids (especially 0.9% saline with 154 mmol/L chloride) are a frequent iatrogenic cause, hyperchloremia can also reflect renal handling abnormalities, endocrine disorders, or gastrointestinal chloride losses and compensatory responses, so I need to keep the differential in mind [^fec1a100] [^75b2c071] [^556bf473].

> Let me consider iatrogenic causes first; administration of high-chloride crystalloids such as 0.9% saline reliably increases serum chloride and can precipitate hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and multiple meta-analyses associate high-chloride fluids with more AKI and hyperchloremia, albeit with conflicting signals for mortality and heterogeneity across studies, so I should be cautious in inferring causality here [^fec1a100] [^af6b6572] [^cb90ba29].

> I should confirm renal and endocrine contributors; chronic kidney disease cohorts show that higher baseline serum chloride associates with faster eGFR decline, suggesting chloride itself may track with kidney injury risk, while heart failure populations often exhibit hypochloremia linked to diuretic use and neurohormonal activation, underscoring that chloride disturbances reflect both kidney and cardiorenal pathophysiology rather than a single uniform mechanism [^840d7382] [^e050f855] [^8d73a69f].

> But wait, what if the chloride rise is gastrointestinal; congenital chloride diarrhea causes profound chloride losses and secondary metabolic alkalosis, and in that context a "high chloride" discussion would be misleading — so I need to ensure I distinguish absolute chloride excess from compensatory or disease-state chloride patterns that can mask or mimic hyperchloremia depending on the clinical frame [^cec57cb7].

> Now, I will examine mechanisms by which high chloride could cause harm; hyperchloremia lowers the strong-ion difference and can produce a non–anion gap metabolic acidosis, which may reduce renal blood flow via afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and impair renal perfusion, and chloride can modulate tubular transport and immune function, providing plausible links to AKI and coagulopathy, though much of the human data are observational and heterogeneous [^61477d94] [^75b2c071] [^ea14ca55].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence for outcomes; meta-analyses consistently show more AKI and hyperchloremic acidosis with high-chloride fluids, with signals for longer ventilation and more transfusions in some analyses, but mortality differences are not consistently demonstrated, and a large, high-quality meta-analysis found no significant mortality or RRT benefit for low- versus high-chloride solutions, highlighting imprecision and the need for larger trials with greater fluid exposure [^fec1a100] [^af6b6572] [^064f7e81].

> Let me reconsider the clinical significance; even if mortality effects are uncertain, the renal and acid–base signals are biologically coherent and clinically meaningful enough that many critical care and perioperative practices have shifted toward balanced, lower-chloride crystalloids (e.g. lactated Ringer's, Plasma-Lyte) for resuscitation, especially in patients at risk of AKI or with sepsis, while reserving 0.9% saline for select indications like brain injury where tonicity considerations predominate [^31153fdc] [^2d7ee5ce].

> I should double-check special populations; in kidney transplantation, balanced solutions reduce hyperchloremic acidosis compared with saline, but randomized data have not definitively shown improved graft outcomes, so the choice remains individualized with attention to acid–base and potassium dynamics in the immediate postoperative period [^6d0f7835].

> Next, I should review practical management; if hyperchloremia is present, I need to check the source — stop or reduce high-chloride infusions when feasible, consider switching to balanced crystalloids, assess renal function and acid–base status, and evaluate for underlying causes such as CKD progression or endocrine disorders; in neurocritical care using hypertonic saline, expert guidance suggests avoiding excessive hyperchloremia (often keeping chloride below about 110–115 mmol/L) to mitigate AKI risk, though evidence quality is low and monitoring should be frequent and individualized [^559dccd3].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: "high chloride" (hyperchloremia) means a serum chloride above the normal range, most commonly above about 106–110 mmol/L, and while it often reflects iatrogenic chloride loading from saline, it can also signal underlying kidney or cardiorenal disease; clinically, sustained hyperchloremia is associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and a higher risk of AKI in several studies, prompting many clinicians to prefer balanced crystalloids for resuscitation when appropriate, even as mortality benefits remain unproven and practice should be tailored to context and patient risk [^fec1a100] [^af6b6572] [^31153fdc].

High chloride (hyperchloremia) means the serum chloride level is above the normal range (** > 106 mmol/L**) [^notfound]. It is most often due to **high-chloride IV fluids** (e.g. 0.9% saline) [^fec1a100] or renal dysfunction [^840d7382], and is linked to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis [^61477d94], acute kidney injury [^fec1a100], and worse outcomes in critical illness [^ea14ca55]. Management focuses on stopping high-chloride fluids, using balanced crystalloids [^31153fdc], and correcting the cause; **monitor renal function and acid–base status** [^559dccd3].

---

## Definition and normal range

Hyperchloremia is defined as a serum chloride concentration **> 106 mmol/L** [^notfound]; the typical reference range is 98–106 mmol/L.

---

## Causes of high chloride

Hyperchloremia can result from several **clinical scenarios**:

| **Category** | **Causes** |
|-|-|
| Iatrogenic | - High-chloride IV fluids (e.g. 0.9% saline) [^fec1a100] <br/> - Potassium chloride supplementation [^3d31d83a] |
| Renal dysfunction | - Acute kidney injury [^da69264c] <br/> - Chronic kidney disease [^840d7382] <br/> - Renal tubular acidosis |
| Endocrine disorders | - Hyperaldosteronism <br/> - Cushing's syndrome |
| Gastrointestinal losses | - Severe diarrhea <br/> - Vomiting (with compensatory renal bicarbonate loss) |
| Medications | - Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors <br/> - Ammonium chloride |

---

## Clinical significance and complications

Hyperchloremia is associated with several **adverse clinical outcomes**:

- **Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis**: Reduced strong-ion difference lowers bicarbonate, causing acidosis [^61477d94].
- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Higher chloride levels are linked to AKI in critical illness [^da69264c] [^fec1a100].
- **Increased mortality**: Observational data associate hyperchloremia with higher mortality in sepsis and critical illness [^ea14ca55] [^82a40258].
- **Coagulopathy**: High-chloride fluids may impair coagulation and increase transfusion needs [^44047ed4].

---

## Clinical management

Management of hyperchloremia includes:

- **Identify and stop the source**: Discontinue high-chloride fluids (e.g. 0.9% saline) and switch to balanced crystalloids (e.g. lactated Ringer's, Plasma-Lyte) [^31153fdc] [^941d1a77].
- **Correct the underlying cause**: Treat renal dysfunction, endocrine disorders, or gastrointestinal losses.
- **Monitor renal function and acid–base status**: Track serum chloride, bicarbonate, and creatinine; correct acidosis as indicated [^559dccd3].
- **Use caution with potassium chloride**: Monitor for hyperchloremia when giving KCl, especially in renal impairment [^3d31d83a].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the cause, severity, and comorbidities. Persistent hyperchloremia from ongoing high-chloride fluids or renal dysfunction increases risks of AKI, acidosis, and adverse outcomes, whereas **prompt correction improves prognosis** [^fec1a100] [^840d7382].

---

High chloride reflects a serum chloride **> 106 mmol/L**, often from high-chloride fluids or renal issues, and is linked to acidosis, AKI, and worse outcomes; management centers on stopping high-chloride fluids, using balanced solutions, and treating the cause, with close monitoring of renal and acid–base status.

Surrogate endpoints

Analysis of surrogate endpoints revealed that high-chloride intravenous fluids were associated with significantly higher serum chloride levels (MD 3·70 (95 per cent c.i. 3·36 to 4·04) mmol/l; P < 0·001; I² = 98 per cent) (Fig. S5, supporting information), greater blood transfusion volume (SMD 0.35, 0·07 to 0·63; P = 0·014; I² = 0 per cent) (Fig. 5) and longer mechanical ventilation time (SMD 0·15, 0·08 to 0·23; P < 0·001; I² = 17 per cent) (Fig. S6, supporting information).

### Meta-analysis of high-versus low-chloride content in perioperative and critical care fluid resuscitation [^fec1a100]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the relationship between the chloride content of intravenous resuscitation fluids and patient outcomes in the perioperative or intensive care setting.

Methods

Systematic searches were performed of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) databases in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Randomized clinical trials, controlled clinical trials and observational studies were included if they compared outcomes in acutely ill or surgical patients receiving either high-chloride (ion concentration greater than 111 mmol/l up to and including 154 mmol/l) or lower-chloride (concentration 111 mmol/l or less) crystalloids for resuscitation. Endpoints examined were mortality, measures of kidney function, serum chloride, hyperchloraemia/metabolic acidosis, blood transfusion volume, mechanical ventilation time, and length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) and confidence intervals were calculated using fixed-effect modelling.

Results

The search identified 21 studies involving 6253 patients. High-chloride fluids did not affect mortality but were associated with a significantly higher risk of acute kidney injury (RR 1·64, 95 per cent c.i. 1·27 to 2·13; P < 0·001) and hyperchloraemia/metabolic acidosis (RR 2·87, 1·95 to 4·21; P < 0·001). High-chloride fluids were also associated with greater serum chloride (MD 3·70 (95 per cent c.i. 3·36 to 4·04) mmol/l; P < 0·001), blood transfusion volume (SMD 0·35, 0·07 to 0·63; P = 0·014) and mechanical ventilation time (SMD 0·15, 0·08 to 0·23; P < 0·001). Sensitivity analyses excluding heavily weighted studies resulted in non-statistically significant effects for acute kidney injury and mechanical ventilation time.

Conclusion

A weak but significant association between higher chloride content fluids and unfavourable outcomes was found, but mortality was unaffected by chloride content.

Current treatment of kidney disease is not completely satisfactory, particularly when initiated in the late stages of renal progression. There is an urgent need for additional interventions, especially reduction of salt intake, which is rather high in the Western world. In this commentary we provide a critical assessment of post hoc analyses of recent interventional and observational studies on the effect of salt intake on renal and cardiovascular outcomes. To evaluate the mechanisms and safety of reduced salt intake, studies specifically designed to assess salt intake as an endpoint are needed. This approach will have implications for health care policies and labeling of the salt content of purchased foods.

Conclusion

In aggregate, the study shows that higher Cl mean and Cl max are associated with the development of AKI, indicating that chloride overload during ICU treatment may increase the risk of AKI. Furthermore, higher Cl min is found to be protective against AKI, indicating that restricting chloride infusion is no longer beneficial in patients with hypochloremia.

Introduction

The administration of intravenous fluids for resuscitation occurs routinely in the perioperative setting and in the management of critically ill patients. There has been considerable interest in defining optimal fluid resuscitation strategies, yet practice patterns and fluid selection vary considerably. While much attention has been directed at the 'colloid versus crystalloid' debate, increasing evidence suggests clinically important differences related to intravenous fluid chloride content–.

Often referred to as 'normal saline', 0·9 per cent saline contains sodium and chloride in supraphysiological concentrations. Balanced solutions, in contrast, contain significantly lower concentrations of sodium and chloride, making them closer in composition to plasma than 0·9 per cent saline. Despite a lack of evidence supporting the superiority of 0·9 per cent saline, it is commonly used as a resuscitation fluid and has generally served as the 'control fluid' in large trials. Administration of 0·9 per cent saline causes hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis–, and consequently some guidelines recommend the use of balanced solutions as a default during resuscitation. Hyperchloraemia has also been associated with decreased renal perfusion–, impaired immune function–and mortality, suggesting that hyperchloraemia may have clinically relevant effects.

Studies, have examined differences between groups treated with high-chloride versus low-chloride solutions, and a Cochrane systematic reviewof randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined clinical outcomes following the perioperative use of buffered versus non-buffered fluids. A recent systematic reviewof prospective RCTs evaluated the impact of near-isotonic or isotonic crystalloids on acid–base status and other physiological, haemodynamic and clinical outcomes. However, no analyses have focused specifically on the chloride content of crystalloids administered for resuscitation in the broader context of both perioperative and critical care medicine. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine whether the chloride content of resuscitation fluids used in the operating theatre or intensive care unit (ICU) setting is associated with differences in outcomes.

Among the four eligible studies, reporting transfusion outcomes, all reported at least a small or modest, increase in transfusion volume with high-chloride fluid administration. Shaw and co-workersalso demonstrated an association between high-chloride fluids and greater transfusion volume, but the study was not included in the analysis owing to lack of variability data. Although the total number of patients included in the present meta-analysis of blood transfusion volume was low (high-chloride, 102; low-chloride, 100), the potential for a true difference raises relevant questions. Clinicians may consider any difference meaningful given the expense and risks associated with red cell transfusions. Although causality has not been established between high-chloride fluids and increased transfusion, the potential clinical impact of a true effect is hypothesis-generating.

When administered in large volumes, 0·9 per cent saline has been shown to cause coagulopathy. Total volumes of fluid administered did not vary substantially between the groups (Table S3, supporting information), suggesting that dilutional coagulopathy does not account for the observed differences in transfusion. Mechanisms of saline-induced coagulopathy are not fully known, and the data lead us to consider whether hyperchloraemia/acidosis has an independent effect on coagulation. Alternatively, a reverse association cannot be excluded, in that fewer transfusions may have been administered in the low-chloride groups owing to the possibility of incompatibility with citrated blood. However, in two, of the four studies, the low-chloride solution did not contain calcium, and in oneof the other studies the providers were blinded to the fluid that was being administered.

Adult sepsis insights — high-chloride crystalloids: Similar results are being identified for outcomes in adults with sepsis suggesting that resuscitation with crystalloid containing high chloride concentrations (i.e., 0.9% normal saline) is associated with hyperchloremic acidosis, systemic inflammation, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, and mortality as compared with use of balanced, buffered crystalloids such as lactated Ringer's and Plasma-Lyte.

Two studies, included in the present analysis involved paediatric patients. Although both studies were small (22 and 122 patients respectively) and therefore unlikely to impact significantly on the effect estimates, sensitivity analysis excluding these two trials was performed in order to account for potential differences in fluid physiology in paediatric versus adult patients. There was no impact on either effect direction or significance for any of the measured endpoints when these studies were excluded: mortality (RR 1·13, 95 per cent c.i. 0·92 to 1·39; P = 0·250), hospital LOS (SMD −0·07, −0·13 to −0·02; P = 0·013), hyperchloraemia/metabolic acidosis (RR 8·50, 2·49 to 29·0; P < 0·001) or serum chloride (MD 4·02 (3·66 to 4·37) mmol/l; P < 0·001).

Discussion

Meta-analysis of all available studies demonstrated a significantly higher risk of AKI, metabolic acidosis, blood transfusion and time on mechanical ventilation with high-chloride fluid resuscitation. The association between high-chloride fluids, metabolic acidosis and higher serum chloride levels is supported by several studies, that did not meet the inclusion criteria for the present meta-analysis, and provides face validity for a conceptual mechanism of deleterious effects of hyperchloraemia. No increased risk for mortality was found.

High-chloride fluids were significantly associated with an increased risk of AKI/renal failure. This endpoint was driven heavily by one study, and sensitivity analysis excluding this study showed the same direction of effect, but loss of statistical significance. Each remaining study demonstrated a directionally similar association between increased AKI/renal failure and high-chloride fluids. One limitation in interpreting these data is the lack of uniformity among definitions of AKI. Ideally a standardized definition would be applied for the analysis; however, this was not possible with the available data. Moreover, serum creatinine concentration, a surrogate marker of renal function, did not demonstrate an association with the fluid chloride content. Failure to detect such an association may be related to reporting of serum creatinine levels at variable time points, and the possibility that the magnitude of differences in serum creatinine concentration may vary with time.

Greater urine output was significantly associated with high-chloride fluids, which may appear inconsistent with greater risk of AKI. However, the effect of fluid chloride content on urinary output may be largely time-dependent, and in this context urine output may not be a useful surrogate measure of renal function. Variability in the timing of urine output measurements and diuretic use may also confound these results. In light of the variability in AKI/renal failure definitions, timing of creatinine measurement and effects on urine output, this AKI harm signal should be interpreted cautiously.

No reported difference in mortality may reflect either no true difference, variability in the time periods over which mortality was reported, inadequate sample size to detect a difference, or variability in the risk factors in the included patient populations. Because this meta-analysis included studies in both perioperative and ICU settings, lower-risk patients were included than if the analysis had been limited solely to critical illness, lowering the overall mortality rate and thus decreasing the likelihood of detecting a possible mortality signal. It is also conceivable that an increased risk of AKI may occur without an increase in short-term mortality. These factors may help to explain why an increase in AKI, but not mortality, was observed with high-chloride crystalloid use in this meta-analysis.

Two recent studies ineligible for this meta-analysis have examined the relationship between mortality and either hyperchloraemiaor crystalloid fluid choice. A retrospective, propensity-matched, cohort studyof surgical patients demonstrated a significant association between hyperchloraemia and mortality, as well as AKI. Notably, the relationship between serum chloride and fluid administered was not assessed. In a propensity-matched cohort studyof non-operative patients with vasopressor-dependent sepsis, use of balanced fluids (low-chloride by the present definition) was associated with lower in-hospital mortality, but no effect was found for AKI. One could infer that, because high-chloride fluids lead to hyperchloraemia and hyperchloraemia is associated with mortality, high-chloride fluids must be associated with mortality. However, the relationship is not clearly true in all populations studied and may vary based on risk.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our analysis of the general U.S. adult population indicates a potential inverse relationship between serum chloride levels and the risk of MetS, especially in overweight or obese participants who did not smoke or heavy drink. Further in - depth research is warranted. Well - designed prospective cohort studies and interventional trials are needed to establish a causal relationship and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Understanding this relationship could potentially provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of MetS, offering new therapeutic targets and strategies for improving public health. More importantly, in the clinical practise, changes in serum chloride levels should also be monitored when on a low - sodium diet.

### Low-versus high-chloride content intravenous solutions for critically ill and perioperative adult patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^af6b6572]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

To assess whether use of low-chloride solutions in unselected critically ill or perioperative adult patients for maintenance or resuscitation reduces mortality and renal replacement therapy (RRT) use when compared to high-chloride fluids.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis with random-effects inverse variance model. PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, LILACS, and Web of Science were searched from inception to October 2016. Published and unpublished randomized controlled trials in any language that enrolled critically ill and/or perioperative adult patients and compared a low- to a highchloride solution for volume maintenance or resuscitation. The primary outcomes were mortality and RRT use. We conducted trial sequential analyses and assessed risk of bias of individual trials and the overall quality of evidence. Fifteen trials with 4067 patients, most at low risk of bias, were identified. Of those, only 11 and 10 trials had data on mortality and RRT use, respectively. A total of 3710 patients were included in the mortality analysis and 3724 in the RRT analysis.

Results

No statistically significant impact on mortality (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–1.17; P = 0.44; I = 0%) or RRT use (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–1.58; P = 0.52; I = 0%) was found. Overall quality of evidence was low for both primary outcomes. Trial sequential analyses highlighted that the sample size needed was much larger than that available for properly powered outcome assessment.

Conclusions

The current evidence on low- versus high-chloride solutions for unselected critically ill or perioperative adult patients demonstrates no benefit, but suffers from considerable imprecision. We noted a limited exposure volume for study fluids and a relatively low risk of the populations in each study. Together with the relatively small pooled sample size, these data leave us underpowered to detect potentially important differences. Results from well-conducted, adequately powered randomized controlled trials examining sufficiently large fluid exposure are necessary.

### Kalium channelrhodopsins effectively inhibit neurons [^f82bf46f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Recommendations

Although the newly discovered WiChR KCR possesses superior potency, the long recovery kinetics of the current WiChR variant mean that it is appropriate for longer-term inhibition — experiments that require silencing over minutes or hours. As the first-line tool for most inhibitory optogenetics experiments in Drosophila, we recommend KCR1-C29D, due to its potent inhibitory effect, utility in high-chloride cells, minimal toxicity, improved potassium selectivity, and prompt recovery interval. For maximal effect, ATR should be added to food at ≥ 1 mM, and a light intensity ≥ 40 µW/mm 2 used. As potassium conductances are expected to hyperpolarize cells and their compartments regardless of intracellular chloride concentration, using a potassium-selective channelrhodopsin disambiguates the interpretation of the result if the chloride state is unknown. In some cases, ACR1 could be tested in conjunction with KCR1 to address questions about chloride status in a cell type. For C. elegans and zebrafish, we recommend that KCR2 and KCR1, respectively, be used for inhibition in cases where intracellular chloride is unknown (or it is known that chloride levels are high). The availability of KCRs opens up the possibility to intervene in the signaling functions of hyperpolarizing high-chloride non-neuronal cells, for example, silencing excitable endocrine cells, or investigating the effects of membrane potential on signaling in non-excitable cells.

### The association between serum chloride levels and chronic kidney disease progression: a cohort study [^840d7382]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, in a prospective cohort of men and women with CKD, we demonstrated that higher serum chloride is significantly associated with a modest decrease in eGFR independent of other well-established CKD risk factors. Future studies should examine and confirm this relationship over longer periods of follow-up, and in more diverse populations including those without preexisting CKD. Further research is also needed to determine causality, and possible underlying pathophysiology.

### Chloride in heart Failure: the neglected electrolyte [^8d73a69f]. JACC: Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

The increasing burden of heart failure (HF) and emerging knowledge regarding chloride as a prognostic marker in HF have increased the interest in the pathophysiology and interactions of chloride abnormalities with HF-related factors and treatments. Chloride is among the major electrolytes that play a unique role in fluid homeostasis and is associated with cardiorenal and neurohormonal systems. This review elucidates the role of chloride in the pathophysiology of HF, evaluates the effects of treatment on chloride (eg, diuretic agents cause higher urinary chloride excretion and consequently serum hypochloremia), and discusses recent evidence for the association between chloride levels and mortality.

### Association between intravenous chloride load during resuscitation and in-hospital mortality among patients with SIRS [^ea14ca55]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

It is noteworthy that mortality was elevated in the small group of patients (< 2.5% of the study population) who received relatively low volume-adjusted chloride loads (< 105 mmol/L). Potential explanations include the receipt of relatively large proportions of dextrose-containing maintenance fluids, which contain lower chloride concentrations, rather than active resuscitation. Particularly high-acuity patients may have died before receiving adequate resuscitation or fluid administration may have been limited because of concerns related to comorbidities such as congestive heart failure in which higher sodium loads are not tolerated and carry a high mortality rate.

Recent evidence indicates risks associated with high sodium loads and suggests that hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis and hypernatraemia may be independent complications associated with fluid infusion. While our study found a potential association between sodium load and mortality, the ability to fully separate sodium load from volume and tonicity is limited, and this question may warrant further study. Studies examining outcomes in light of relative differences in chloride and sodium load may provide important insights.

While the reasons for the association between increased mortality and elevated chloride levels remain to be fully elucidated, important clinical consequences of hyperchloraemia are known. High serum chloride concentrations following infusion of 0.9% saline are associated with reduced renal artery flow velocity, renal cortical tissue perfusion and longer time to urination. Additionally, animal studies have implicated hyperchloraemia in effects on the immune system, altered blood oxygen binding and organ damage.

In summary, this study demonstrates an association between IV chloride load and mortality in hospitalized patients with SIRS, independent of total fluid volume. Given the study's predefined fluid inclusion criteria, our findings may not be generalizable to all SIRS patients. Still, these findings support existing published data suggesting that fluid composition and volume both have important effects on clinical outcomes. Because the study was observational, the associations are hypothesis-generating and highlight the need for randomized controlled trials powered to detect outcome differences in patients resuscitated using different crystalloids. A multicentre study comparing 0.9% saline and a balanced crystalloid is underway. When viewed together with the existing literature, our findings may not represent evidence that high-chloride solutions are harmful "beyond a reasonable doubt" (they are observational), but the balance of probabilities appears to be shifting away from high-chloride and toward low-chloride solutions for first-line fluid resuscitation of patients with SIRS.

### Bench-to-bedside review: chloride in critical illness [^75b2c071]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Chloride is the principal anion in the extracellular fluid and is the second main contributor to plasma tonicity. Its concentration is frequently abnormal in intensive care unit patients, often as a consequence of fluid therapy. Yet chloride has received less attention than any other ion in the critical care literature. New insights into its physiological roles have emerged together with progress in understanding the structures and functions of chloride channels. In clinical practice, interest in a physicochemical approach to acid-base physiology has directed renewed attention to chloride as a major determinant of acid-base status. It has also indirectly helped to generate interest in other possible effects of disorders of chloraemia. The present review summarizes key aspects of chloride physiology, including its channels, as well as the clinical relevance of disorders of chloraemia. The paper also highlights current knowledge on the impact of different types of intravenous fluids on chloride concentration and the potential effects of such changes on organ physiology. Finally, the review examines the potential intensive care unit practice implications of a better understanding of chloride.

### The association between serum chloride levels and chronic kidney disease progression: a cohort study [^e050f855]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent globally and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in diagnosis and management, it remains an often-progressive disease with complex and uncertain pathophysiology. Moreover, predicting CKD progression is inexact, and there remains an unmet need for identifying novel biomarkers and mechanistic pathways.

Serum chloride is a frequently neglected laboratory value typically only considered during states of metabolic acidosis. However, it has become increasingly clear that chloride is an important driver of numerous homeostatic mechanisms including regulation of renin secretion, tubuloglomerular feedback, blood pressure response, and renal sodium handling.

Clinically, serum chloride has been gaining traction as a predictor of adverse outcomes in various clinical settings. In two observational studies of patients with acute decompensated heart failure, low serum chloride associated with diuretic resistance and increased mortality. In a study of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, serum chloride < 100 mmol/L 6 months after diagnosis associated with increased mortality, independent of serum sodium levels. Hypochloremia also associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality after ischemic stroke, as well as all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a broad cohort of hypertensive patients. As for kidney-specific outcomes, after observational data demonstrated an association between hyperchloremia and acute kidney injury (AKI), two recent randomized control trials demonstrated that both critically and non-critically ill patients who received intravenous fluids with higher chloride concentrations had worsened renal outcomes. Finally, in the only longitudinal study in subjects with stable CKD, hypochloremia associated with both mortality and cardiovascular events. However, to our knowledge no study has examined the relationship of serum chloride levels on long-term CKD progression.

In this study, we used a prospective cohort of mostly CKD stage 3 and 4 patients to determine if there was an association between serum chloride levels and CKD progression. Given recent data that higher concentration of chloride in intravenous fluids were detrimental to short term kidney outcomes, we hypothesized that higher serum chloride levels at baseline would associate with increased risk of long-term CKD progression.

### Normal saline versus lower-chloride solutions for kidney transplantation [^6d0f7835]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The ideal intravenous fluid for kidney transplantation has not been defined, despite the common use of normal saline during the peri-operative period. The high chloride content of normal saline is associated with an increased risk of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, which may in turn increase the risk of hyperkalaemia and delayed graft function. Balanced electrolyte solutions have a lower chloride content which may decrease this risk and avoid the need for dialysis due to hyperkalaemia in the immediate post-transplant period. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) addressing this issue have used biochemical outcomes to compare fluids and have been underpowered to address patient-centred outcomes such as delayed graft function.

Objectives

To examine the effect of lower-chloride solutions versus normal saline on delayed graft function, hyperkalaemia and acid-base status in kidney transplant recipients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 26 November 2015 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of kidney transplant recipients that compared peri-operative intravenous lower-chloride solutions to normal saline were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent investigators assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias. Data from individual studies were extracted using standardised forms and pooled according to a published protocol. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

Six studies (477 participants) were included in the review. All participants were adult kidney transplant recipients and 70% of participants underwent live-donor kidney transplantation. The overall risk of bias was low for selection bias and unclear for remaining domains. There was no difference in the risk of delayed graft function (3 studies, 298 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.70) or hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 199 participants: RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.04 to 6.10) for participants who received balanced electrolyte solutions compared to normal saline. Intraoperative balanced electrolyte solutions compared to normal saline were associated with higher blood pH (3 studies, 193 participants: MD 0.07, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.09), higher serum bicarbonate (3 studies, 215 participants: MD 3.02 mEq/L, 95% CI 2.00 to 4.05) and lower serum chloride (3 studies, 215 participants: MD -9.93 mmol/L, 95% CI -19.96 to 0.11). There were four cases of graft loss in the normal saline group and one in the balanced electrolyte solution group, and four cases of acute rejection in the normal saline group compared to two cases in the balanced electrolyte solution group.

Authors' Conclusions

Balanced electrolyte solutions are associated with less hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis compared to normal saline, however it remains uncertain whether lower-chloride solutions lead to improved graft outcomes compared to normal saline.

Sodium intake — adult CKD recommendation specifies: "We suggest that sodium intake be < 2 g of sodium per day (or < 90 mmol of sodium per day, or < 5 g of sodium chloride per day) in people with CKD (2C)." A caution is provided: "Dietary sodium restriction is usually not appropriate for patients with sodium-wasting nephropathy." Typical intake is high — "Global average sodium intake is estimated to be 4310 mg/d (10.78 g of salt per day), which far exceeds the physiological requirement and is more than double the WHO recommendation of < 2 g of sodium (equivalent to < 5 g of salt) per day in adults." Context notes that salt substitutes have been studied, for example "using 75% sodium and 25% potassium chloride salt substitutes" to lower blood pressure, and that exceptions may apply: "People with CKD may have salt-wasting kidney disease, malnutrition, or be exposed to extremely hot climatic conditions. In such scenarios, this recommendation may not apply."

### Is sodium chloride worth its salt? [^2d7ee5ce]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The choice of fluid for resuscitation of the brain-injured patient remains controversial, and the 'ideal' resuscitation fluid has yet to be identified. Large volumes of hypotonic solutions must be avoided because of the risk of cerebral swelling and intracranial hypertension. Traditionally, 0.9% sodium chloride has been used in patients at risk of intracranial hypertension, but there is increasing recognition that 0.9% saline is not without its problems. Roquilly and colleagues show a reduction in the development of hyperchloremic acidosis in brain-injured patients given 'balanced' solutions for maintenance and resuscitation compared with 0.9% sodium chloride. In this commentary, we explore the idea that we should move away from 0.9% sodium chloride in favor of a more 'physiological' solution.

### Potassium citrate prevents increased urine calcium excretion and bone resorption induced by a high sodium chloride diet [^4da004ba]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

The amount of sodium chloride in the diet of industrialized nations far exceeds physiological requirements. The impact of abundant dietary salt on skeletal health has yet to be established, but is potentially detrimental through increased urinary calcium losses. We examined the effect of increased dietary sodium chloride on urine calcium excretion and bone turnover markers in postmenopausal women and, further, whether potassium citrate attenuates the effects of increased dietary salt. Postmenopausal women (n = 60) were adapted to a low-salt (87 mmol/d sodium) diet for 3 wk, then randomized to a high-salt (225 mmol/d sodium) diet plus potassium citrate (90 mmol/d) or a high-salt diet plus placebo for 4 wk. Urine calcium, urine N-telopeptide, urine cAMP, serum osteocalcin, and fasting serum PTH were measured at the end of the low- and high-salt diets. On the high salt plus placebo diet, urine calcium increased 42 ± 12 mg/d (mean ± SEM), but decreased 8 ± 14 mg/d in the high salt plus potassium citrate group (P = 0.008, potassium citrate vs. placebo, unpaired t test). N-telopeptide increased 6.4 ± 1.4 nanomoles bone collagen equivalents per millimole creatinine in the high salt plus placebo group and 2.0 ± 1.7 nanomoles bone collagen equivalents per millimole creatinine in the high salt plus potassium citrate group (P < 0.05, potassium citrate vs. placebo, unpaired t test). Osteocalcin, PTH, and cAMP were not significantly altered. The addition of oral potassium citrate to a high-salt diet prevented the increased excretion of urine calcium and the bone resorption marker caused by a high salt intake. Increased intake of dietary sources of potassium alkaline salts, namely fruit and vegetables, may be beneficial for postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporosis, particularly those consuming a diet generous in sodium chloride.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^31153fdc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Sepsis

Lactic acidosis is a major metabolic side effect of sepsis. As noted above, intravenous administration of 0.9% saline may cause iatrogenic hyperchloremic acidosis. Hyperchloremia has been associated with increase in mortality in both septic and non-septic patients. However, most studies examining this issue were retrospective, which precludes derivation of a meaningful causative association between the two. Studies comparing solutions with high versus low-chloride concentrations have yielded conflicting results thus far. Reduced rates of mortality and AKI have been described with balanced solutions therefore until more information from RCTs is available, balanced solutions remain preferred over 0.9% saline for the treatment of hemodynamically unstable septic patients.

### Potassium-enriched salt substitutes: a review of recommendations in clinical management guidelines [^f6116a1b]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

A strong body of evidence supports the replacement of regular salt with potassium-enriched salt in patients with hypertension. There is also a case for the general population making the switch to potassium-enriched salt where risks of misuse can be managed. Current clinical guidelines offer incomplete and inconsistent recommendations about the use of potassium-enriched salt substitutes, as well as reducing dietary sodium intake and increasing dietary potassium intake. We urge all relevant clinical guideline bodies to debate the value of potassium-enriched salt as a routine adjunct to drug therapy and update their recommendations accordingly. Evidence suggests that there are likely to be substantial benefits from the much wider use of potassium-enriched salt with a composition of 75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride, by patients with hypertension. As part of their updates, clinical guideline bodies should provide consistent recommendations about the use of potassium-enriched salt substitutes and actively promote these recommendations to their constituents.

### Potassium modulates electrolyte balance and blood pressure through effects on distal cell voltage and chloride [^ef3ab860]. Cell Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Dietary potassium deficiency, common in modern diets, raises blood pressure and enhances salt sensitivity. Potassium homeostasis requires a molecular switch in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), which fails in familial hyperkalemic hypertension (pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2), activating the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter, NCC. Here, we show that dietary potassium deficiency activates NCC, even in the setting of high salt intake, thereby causing sodium retention and a rise in blood pressure. The effect is dependent on plasma potassium, which modulates DCT cell membrane voltage and, in turn, intracellular chloride. Low intracellular chloride stimulates WNK kinases to activate NCC, limiting potassium losses, even at the expense of increased blood pressure. These data show that DCT cells, like adrenal cells, sense potassium via membrane voltage. In the DCT, hyperpolarization activates NCC via WNK kinases, whereas in the adrenal gland, it inhibits aldosterone secretion. These effects work in concert to maintain potassium homeostasis.

### Potassium chloride [^3d31d83a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of potassium chloride IV:
- **Decreased serum sodium**: use caution in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, patients with psychogenic polydipsia, and patients treated with medications increasing the risk of hyponatremia, such as certain diuretic, antiepileptic, and psychotropic medications. Avoid administering potassium chloride infusion in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. Monitor serum sodium levels if use cannot be avoided.
- **Electrolyte abnormalities**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as potassium chloride infusion can cause electrolyte disturbances, such as overhydration/hypervolemia and congested states, including pulmonary edema and peripheral edema. Avoid administering potassium chloride infusion in patients with or at risk for fluid and/or solute overloading. Monitor fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance as needed if use cannot be avoided.
- **Increased serum chloride**: use caution in patients with or at risk of hyperchloremia. Monitor serum chloride levels and renal function.
- **Increased serum potassium, cardiac arrhythmias**: use extreme caution in patients with at risk of hyperkalemia and/or associated with increased sensitivity to potassium, such as severe renal impairment, acute dehydration, extensive tissue injury or burns, congestive HF or AV block, potassium-aggravated skeletal muscle channelopathies, such as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, paramyotonia congenita, and potassium-aggravated myotonia/paramyotonia.
- **Increased serum potassium**: use caution in patients at risk of hyperosmolality, acidosis, or undergoing correction of alkalosis and in patients treated concurrently or recently with agents or products that can cause hyperkalemia. Obtain continuous ECG monitoring and frequent serum potassium and acid-base balance measurements in patients requiring highly concentrated solutions, especially if they receive digitalis.
- **Tissue damage, thrombophlebitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as paravenous administration or extravasation of concentrated potassium solutions can cause tissue damage, including vascular, nerve, and tendon damage, which may require surgical intervention, including amputation.

### The association between serum chloride levels and chronic kidney disease progression: a cohort study [^492d99e9]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this observational, prospective cohort we found that higher serum chloride associated with modestly worsened eGFR decline during the course of 1.7 years of median follow-up, independent of other well-established risk factors for CKD progression. Serum chloride was associated with > 30% decline in eGFR in demographic adjusted models, but the results were attenuated and insignificant in fully adjusted models. There was no clear threshold effect, with continuous models of serum chloride demonstrating an association with eGFR decline for every 1 mEq/L increase.

Our study adds to the growing body of evidence implicating a role for chloride in human disease. Several recent observational studies have focused on heart failure. In one analysis of patients admitted for acute decompensated heart failure, lower levels of serum chloride were independently associated with long-term mortality. In another acute heart failure cohort, baseline hypochloremia associated with impaired diuresis, and persistent hypochloremia with increased mortality. Low serum chloride levels also associated with higher mortality in chronic heart failure. Two additional observational studies found independent relationships between baseline hypochloremia and increased in-hospital mortality in patients with acute stroke, as well as all-cause mortality in hypertensive patients followed longitudinally.

While these observational studies yielded adverse outcomes associated with hypochloremia, ours showed possible worsened outcomes with higher serum chloride levels. This discordance may be due to differences in study design and outcomes, as prior studies were conducted in different populations where there may be more hemodynamic and volume issues, and a stronger role for diuretics which may have impacted chloride levels and outcomes. These studies also did not specifically focus on kidney function, where chloride has important physiologic roles. For instance, previous observational studies found associations between hyperchloremia, chloride-liberal intravenous fluids, and acute kidney injury (AKI). These relationships were later confirmed in two large randomized control trials that showed superior acute renal outcomes with balanced crystalloids versus normal saline. In the one observational study with serum chloride that focused on a cohort of CKD participants, hyperchloremia associated with worsened eGFR at baseline (22.6 mL/min/1.73m 2 vs 36.3 mL/min/1.73m 2, in the highest versus the lower quartile of serum chloride, respectively), which correlates with our findings, although this study did not examined changes in eGFR longitudinally.

### Hyperchloremic acidosis in the critically ill: one of the strong-ion acidoses? [^61477d94]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Decreases in plasma bicarbonate are associated with hyperchloremic acidosis and lactic acidosis. According to the Stewart approach to acid-base physiology, the strong-ion difference regulates plasma bicarbonate, with chloride and lactate being the only strong anions routinely measured in clinical chemistry. We hypothesized that the plasma strong-ion difference, both with and without lactate, would have a stronger association with plasma bicarbonate than plasma chloride alone would have with bicarbonate. We used plasma acid-base data from 300 critically ill patients. The correlation with bicarbonate became progressively weaker (P < 0.001): all measured strong ions, r = 0.60; measured strong ions without lactate, r = 0.42; chloride alone, r = -0.27. In a subgroup of 26 patients with traditional hyperchloremic acidosis (base excess < -2 mmol/L and anion gap < 17 mmol/L), the measured strong-ion difference (without lactate) had a stronger correlation (P < 0.001) with bicarbonate than chloride had: r = 0.85 versus r = -0.60. We conclude that hyperchloremic acidosis and lactic acidosis are strong-ion acidoses. Hyperchloremia should be viewed relative to the plasma strong cations. A practical conclusion is that both managing and preventing acid-base disorders with IV fluid therapy involves manipulating each of the plasma strong ions, particularly sodium and chloride.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^559dccd3]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Hypertonic sodium solution administration — acute kidney injury (AKI) risk mitigation recommendations are as follows: We suggest that severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia during treatment with hypertonic sodium solutions should be avoided due to the association with acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). An upper serum sodium range of 155–160 mEq/L and a serum chloride range of 110–115 mEq/L may be reasonable to decrease the risk of acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Clinicians should routinely monitor both sodium and chloride serum concentrations to assess risk of AKI related to elevated concentrations (good practice statement), and renal function should be monitored closely in patients receiving hypertonic sodium solutions due to the risk of AKI with hyperosmolar therapy (good practice statement). For monitoring frequency, clinicians should use patient-specific factors with ranging from twice daily to every 2 h based on rapidity of change to interventions.

### Chemically recyclable polyvinyl chloride-like plastics [^ff99f817]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is the world's third-most widely manufactured thermoplastic, but has the lowest recycling rate. The development of PVC-like plastics that can be depolymerized back to monomer contributes to a circular plastic economy, but has not been accessed. Here, we develop a series of chemically recyclable plastics from the reversible copolymerization of cyclic anhydride with chloral. The copolymerization is highly efficient through the anionic or cationic mechanism under mild conditions, yielding polyesters with tunable structure and properties from multiple commercial monomers. Notably, these polyesters manifest mechanical properties comparable to PVC and polystyrene. Meanwhile, such polyesters are flame-retardant like PVC due to high chloride content. Of significance, these polyesters can be depolymerized back to starting monomers at high temperatures owing to the reversibility of the copolymerization, leading to a circular economy. Overall, the readily available monomers, simple synthesis, advantageous performance, and practical recyclability make the polymers promising for applications.

### Effects of potassium and chloride on ribosome association with the RNA of foot-and-mouth disease virus [^bbc1ff80]. Virus Research (2003). Low credibility.

Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and other picornaviruses initiate translation of their polyprotein cap-independently at an internal site of the positive-strand viral RNA. This process is mediated by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a highly structured cis-acting RNA element that binds translation initiation factors and ribosomal subunits. During their life cycle, picornaviruses induce proliferation of membrane structures involved in viral replication and an increase in membrane permeability probably facilitating virus progeny release. Here, I analyze the efficiency of association of the ribosomal subunits with the FMDV IRES RNA at elevated salt concentrations. Potassium stimulates FMDV translation, whereas sodium chloride concentrations up to 150 mM neither stimulate nor interfere with FMDV translation. Even high potassium concentrations allow binding of the viral RNA to ribosomes. Chloride stimulates binding of ribosomes to the viral RNA at the stage of 48S initiation complex formation and FMDV translation at concentrations up to 150 mM. Only at elevated concentrations, binding of ribosomal subunits and translation are inhibited by chloride. However, FMDV start site selection is not influenced by potassium salts. These results indicate that the association of the viral RNA with ribosomal subunits is well adapted to high salt conditions that are induced during picornavirus infection.

### Chloride-sensitive signaling turns the potassium switch on… [^dfcd1b84]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

The potassium switch refers to plasma potassium regulation of the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC), which controls distal sodium delivery and therefore potassium secretion. Low extracellular potassium activates NCC by relieving chloride inhibition of With-No-Lysine 4 (WNK4). A new mouse model carrying a chloride-insensitive WNK4 mutant still shows NCC activation on low potassium diet. These effects are mediated by WNK4 activation and kelch-like 3 (KLHL3) inhibition and reveal additional chloride-sensitive pathways for NCC activation.

### Active intestinal chloride secretion in human carriers of cystic fibrosis mutations: an evaluation of the hypothesis that heterozygotes have subnormal active intestinal chloride secretion [^176f5b44]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2000). Low credibility.

To explain the very high frequency of cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations in most populations of European descent, it has been proposed that CF heterozygotes have a survival advantage when infected with Vibrio cholerae or Escherichia coli, the toxins of which induce diarrhea by stimulation of active intestinal chloride secretion. Two assumptions underlie this hypothesis: (1) chloride conductance by the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the rate-limiting step for active intestinal chloride secretion at all levels of expression, from approximately zero in patients with CF to normal levels in people who are not carriers of a mutation; and (2) heterozygotes have smaller amounts of functional intestinal CFTR than do people who are not carriers, and heterozygotes therefore secrete less chloride when exposed to secretagogues. The authors used an intestinal perfusion technique to measure in vivo basal and prostaglandin-stimulated jejunal chloride secretion in normal subjects, CF heterozygotes, and patients with CF. Patients with CF had essentially no active chloride secretion in the basal state, and secretion was not stimulated by a prostaglandin analogue. However, CF heterozygotes secreted chloride at the same rate as did people without a CF mutation. If heterozygotes are assumed to have less-than-normal intestinal CFTR function, these results mean that CFTR expression is not rate limiting for active chloride secretion in heterozygotes. The results do not support the theory that the very high frequency of CF mutations is due to a survival advantage that is conferred on heterozygotes who contract diarrheal illnesses mediated by intestinal hypersecretion of chloride.

Sodium intake — lifestyle intervention for lowering blood pressure in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis: We suggest targeting a sodium intake < 2 g of sodium per day (or < 90 mmol of sodium per day, or < 5 g of sodium chloride per day) in patients with high BP and CKD (2C). The Work Group notes that there are instances in which recommendations in the general population may not apply to the CKD population; for example, rarely, CKD patients may have salt-wasting kidney disease in which case this recommendation may not apply. Given that clinical trials of potassium-containing salt substitutes systematically exclude patients with CKD, the Work Group suggests caution in using potassium-containing salt substitutes in CKD populations, especially in those with advanced CKD, hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, hyperkalemia from other causes until more data on the safety and efficacy of their use in CKD become available.

Pathogenesis of the lag phenomenon — The exact mechanism is not fully understood; sodium chloride may bring about p38MAPK release and ADMA synthesis, decreasing endothelial nitric oxide formation and leading to failure of arteriolar muscle to relax. High ADMA concentrations have been found in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, and in chronic renal failure high sodium chloride intake decreased nitric oxide synthase expression in certain areas of the brain, resulting in activation of the sympathetic nervous system and hypertension. Sodium restriction should lead to the opposite effects, and long-term dialysis patients maintained for years on a low-salt diet have peripheral vascular resistance that is lower than that of healthy controls.

### Potassium-enriched salt substitutes: a review of recommendations in clinical management guidelines [^e35976d6]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Excess dietary sodium intake and insufficient dietary potassium intake are both well-established risk factors for hypertension. Despite some successful initiatives, efforts to control hypertension by improving dietary intake have largely failed because the changes required are mostly too hard to implement. Consistent recent data from randomized controlled trials show that potassium-enriched, sodium-reduced salt substitutes are an effective option for improving consumption levels and reducing blood pressure and the rates of cardiovascular events and deaths. Yet, salt substitutes are inconsistently recommended and rarely used. We sought to define the extent to which evidence about the likely benefits and harms of potassium-enriched salt substitutes has been incorporated into clinical management by systematically searching guidelines for the management of hypertension or chronic kidney disease. We found incomplete and inconsistent recommendations about the use of potassium-enriched salt substitutes in the 32 hypertension and 14 kidney guidelines that we reviewed. Discussion among the authors identified the possibility of updating clinical guidelines to provide consistent advice about the use of potassium-enriched salt for hypertension control. Draft wording was chosen to commence debate and progress consensus building: strong recommendation for patients with hypertension — potassium-enriched salt with a composition of 75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride should be recommended to all patients with hypertension, unless they have advanced kidney disease, are using a potassium supplement, are using a potassium-sparing diuretic, or have another contraindication. We strongly encourage clinical guideline bodies to review their recommendations about the use of potassium-enriched salt substitutes at the earliest opportunity.

### Chronic kidney disease increases the susceptibility to negative effects of low and high potassium intake [^4ca6868c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The development of hypertension secondary to extreme high K + diets in rodents has now been reported by several groups, and was also clear in our 5/6Nx rats on a less extreme but still unphysiologically high 2.5% K + diet. This suggests that increasing dietary K + intake may only decrease blood pressure when it is used to normalize a low K + diet. This is in agreement with a previous meta-analysis which demonstrated a U-shaped relationship between dietary K + intake and blood pressure. There are several possible reasons why a high K + diet increases blood pressure, including higher plasma aldosterone, hyperchloremia and metabolic acidosis. Higher ENaC abundance is compatible with an aldosterone effect, although ENaC can also be activated directly by extracellular K +. Little et al. recently showed that hypertension on a high K + diet can be reversed by amiloride further supporting a role for ENaC. An interesting finding was that the attenuated hypertension on the high KCitrate diet occurred with higher pNCC and with similar plasma aldosterone and ENaC levels. The stimulatory effect of KCitrate on pNCC has been reported previously. We propose that hypochloremia explained higher pNCC assuming that intracellular chloride concentrations were also lower, which are a recognized stimulant for NCC. The greater rise in blood pressure with KCl suggests a role for dietary chloride and, indeed, we found a significant correlation between plasma chloride and blood pressure. Previous studies demonstrated an effect of dietary chloride on blood pressure. In uninephrectomized rats treated with desoxycorticosterone, a high sodium chloride but not sodium bicarbonate diet increased blood pressure. In 25 patients with essential hypertension, K + citrate supplementation decreased blood pressure to a greater extent than K + chloride. Chloride can induce renal vasoconstriction, which could potentially result in higher blood pressure. Another interesting observation is the high urinary sodium excretion in the high dietary K + groups. This has been shown previously and, although speculative, may imply that the animals are not in steady state or that part of the K + salts are excreted as sodium salts.

Electrolyte transport diarrhea

Forms of CODE associated with impaired electrolyte transport include defects to chloride or sodium transporters with high fecal losses of either chloride or sodium in the stool. Patients present with watery diarrhea, dehydration, and severe changes to electrolytes and acid-base balance, if left untreated. PN, IV fluids, and electrolyte supplementation are required in the first months of life. Over time, oral supplementation of electrolytes, fluids, and specialized formulas can support increasing enteral tolerance up to enteral autonomy (Table 2).

Congenital chloride diarrhea

Congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD; MIM #) is a disorder of the intestinal Cl − /HCO 3 − exchange transporter, resulting in high fecal Cl − loses, hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. It is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC26A3 gene.

Most children are born prematurely with hydramnios and absence of meconium, suggesting an intrauterine onset of diarrhea. Similar to congenital sodium diarrheas, the condition can go undiagnosed in the early neonatal period due to high-volume stool output resembling urine. During the first days of life, patients usually have a large, distended abdomen, and the neonatal weight loss is unusually high. Dehydration is common and can lead to death, particularly during the early neonatal period.

Clinical symptoms include failure to thrive and high output of very watery stool containing high chloride, > 90 mmol/L. However, stool chloride may be low in patients with chronically depleted serum chloride. Urine chloride is dependent on serum chloride, and in cases in which the serum chloride is < 95 mmol/L, urine testing is associated with an absence of chloriduria.

### Serum chloride concentration and outcomes in adults receiving intravenous fluid therapy with a balanced crystalloid solution or 0.9% sodium chloride [^02a12440]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether there is an interaction between baseline serum chloride concentration and pH and treatment effects in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients receiving intravenous fluid therapy with balanced solution versus 0.9% sodium chloride (saline).

Methods

A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial in which patients were divided into cohorts according to quartiles of baseline serum chloride concentration and pH. The primary outcome was day-90 mortality.

Results

From 4846 patients with outcome data available, 4823 with relevant baseline data were included in this analysis, with 1347, 1333, 993 and 1150 patients in the chloride quartiles of < 102, 102–106, 107–109 and > 109 mmol/L, respectively. Data were also analysed in pH quartiles of ≤ 7.27, 7.27–7.34, 7.34–7.39 and > 7.39. The risk-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) for day-90 mortality for patients assigned balanced solution compared to saline was 1.23 (0.95–1.58), 0.95 (0.73–1.25), 0.88 (0.64–1.21), and 0.76 (0.57–1.01) for lowest to highest chloride subgroups, respectively (P value for interaction = 0.10), and 0.89 (95% CI 0.69–1.15), 0.94 (0.70–1.27), 0.96 (0.67–1.38) and 1.15 (0.82–1.60) for pH quartiles from lowest to highest, respectively (P value for interaction = 0.63).

Conclusions

There were no significant differences in the treatment effect of balanced solutions compared to saline according to baseline serum chloride concentration or pH.

### Kalium channelrhodopsins effectively inhibit neurons [^f0f0999b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The analysis of neural circuits has been revolutionized by optogenetic methods. Light-gated chloride-conducting anion channelrhodopsins (ACRs)-recently emerged as powerful neuron inhibitors. For cells or sub-neuronal compartments with high intracellular chloride concentrations, however, a chloride conductance can have instead an activating effect. The recently discovered light-gated, potassium-conducting, kalium channelrhodopsins (KCRs) might serve as an alternative in these situations, with potentially broad application. As yet, KCRs have not been shown to confer potent inhibitory effects in small genetically tractable animals. Here, we evaluated the utility of KCRs to suppress behavior and inhibit neural activity in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and zebrafish. In direct comparisons with ACR1, a KCR1 variant with enhanced plasma-membrane trafficking displayed comparable potency, but with improved properties that include reduced toxicity and superior efficacy in putative high-chloride cells. This comparative analysis of behavioral inhibition between chloride- and potassium-selective silencing tools establishes KCRs as next-generation optogenetic inhibitors for in vivo circuit analysis in behaving animals.

### Usefulness of high-concentration calcium chloride solution for correction of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in patients with high-hematocrit value [^c85b94d2]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pseudoprolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is a serious problem in anticoagulation therapy for patients with high hematocrit, such as cyanotic congenital heart diseases. APTT pseudoprolongation occurs when APTT assay is performed using routinely used vacuum sampling tubes containing citrate. Because the plasma fraction is small in high-hematocrit blood, the prescribed volume of citrate would be excessive for APTT assay, resulting in prolongation of clotting or APTT pseudoprolongation. CLSI — The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly NCCLS) method is the established method to correct the pseudoprolongation. However, the CLSI method needs repeated blood drawings and time-consuming, complicate procedures. Thus, alternative simple method is desired.

Method

We examined whether APTT pseudoprolongation would be prevented by the increase in free calcium ion concentration by using high-concentration calcium chloride solution for the assay. Blood samples were obtained from 15 patients with high hematocrit (65 ± 6%) who had cyanotic congenital heart disease.

Result

Conventional APTT assay using 0.025 mol/L calcium chloride solution gave greater APTT compared with the CLSI method (51.7 ± 11.8 vs. 34.6 ± 4.7 s, p < 0.001). However, when 0.035 mol/L calcium chloride solution was used, APTT (36.6 ± 5.8 s) was similar to that obtained from the CLSI method. There was a good correlation in APTT values between high-calcium chloride solution method and the CLSI method (the slope = 0.57, r2 = 0.49).

Conclusion

High-calcium chloride solution method is useful to correct APTT pseudoprolongation. Because of the simplicity and the need of a single blood drawing, this method would reduce the burdens of not only patients but also clinical laboratory.

### Effect of 0.9% NaCl compared to plasma-lyte on biomarkers of kidney injury, sodium excretion and tubular transport proteins in patients undergoing primary uncemented hip replacement-a randomized trial [^941d1a77]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fluid treatment is widely used for maintaining cardiovascular stability in patients undergoing surgery, trauma, and critical disease. Both isotonic saline and balanced crystalloids are commonly used for fluid resuscitation. Isotonic saline has a high chloride content (154 mmol/L), whereas the balanced crystalloids have lower chloride contents but also differ in electrolyte composition. Ringer's acetate, Ringer's lactate and PlasmaLyte are all balanced crystalloids, and PlasmaLyte has the lowest chloride content (98 mmol/L). Infusion of fluids containing high chloride amounts are suspected to increase the need for renal replacement therapy. In several studies, isotonic saline induced hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis as opposed to fluids with a lower sodium and chloride content, especially when administered in high amounts. Animal experiments have shown that hyperchloremic acidosis reduces renal blood flow (RBF) and induces kidney injury. High chloride concentrations during renal perfusion correlated with increased renal vasoconstriction and with declines in RBF and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In addition, studies in healthy subjects comparing isotonic saline to fluids with lower sodium and chloride contents showed a decrease in RBF and GFR.

Infusion of balanced IV solutions in patients admitted to an emergency department was associated with a lesser degree of acute kidney injury (AKI) than infusion of fluid solutions with higher chloride content. However, the importance of hyperchloremia and infusion of high chloride-containing solutions is still under much debate in the clinical setting. In daily practice, traditional biomarkers such as plasma creatinine and GFR are used to estimate renal function. In case of AKI, changes in creatinine may require 24 h or more before being detectable. However, biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) have shown potential as acute indicators of AKI. Both are able to detect kidney injury and predict the risk of renal replacement therapy within hours.

We therefore hypothesized that fluids containing high amounts of chloride given as isotonic saline could induce hyperchloremic acidosis and cause subsequent changes in biomarkers of kidney injury. These effects may be detected by measuring renal function, urinary excretion of biomarkers of kidney injury, and plasma concentrations of vasoactive hormones.

We investigated this hypothesis in a randomized, double-blinded study, where patients undergoing primary uncemented hip replacement were given either isotonic saline (IS) or PlasmaLyte (PL) during the course of their surgery and recovery.

### NICARDIPINE HYDROCHLORIDE capsule… [^d680c69c]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules are nonlinear due to saturable hepatic first pass metabolism. Following oral administration, increasing doses result in a disproportionate increase in plasma levels. Steady-state C max values following 20-, 30-, and 40-mg doses every 8 hours averaged 36, 88, and 133 ng/mL, respectively. Hence, increasing the dose from 20 to 30 mg every 8 hours more than doubled C max and increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg every 8 hours increased C max more than threefold. A similar disproportionate increase in AUC with dose was observed. Considerable inter-subject variability in plasma levels was also observed. Nicardipine hydrochloride plasma levels were higher in patients with mild renal impairment than in normal subjects. After 30-mg nicardipine hydrochloride tid at steady-state, C max and AUC were approximately twofold higher in these patients.

An increase in heart rate may occur in response to the vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure, and in a few patients this heart rate increase may be pronounced. In clinical studies mean heart rate at time of peak plasma levels was usually increased by 5 to 10 beats per minute compared to placebo, with the greater increases at higher doses, while there was no difference from placebo at the end of the dosing interval. Electrophysiologic Effects In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules. Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for 1 month was associated with thyroid hyperplasia that was prevented by T4 supplementation.

Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. Overdosage with a 600-mg single dose has been reported. Marked hypotension and bradycardia occurred, along with drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech. Supportive treatment with a vasopressor resulte.

### Succinylcholine chloride [^899e7622]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Maternal Adverse Reactions

Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother.

Labor or Delivery

Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for succinylcholine chloride injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride injection or from the underlying maternal condition.

### Overexpression of pendrin in intercalated cells produces chloride-sensitive hypertension [^1f639e2c]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Inherited and acquired disorders that enhance the activity of transporters mediating renal tubular Na(+) reabsorption are well established causes of hypertension. It is unclear, however, whether primary activation of an Na(+)-independent chloride transporter in the kidney can also play a pathogenic role in this disease. Here, mice overexpressing the chloride transporter pendrin in intercalated cells of the distal nephron (Tg(B1-hPDS) mice) displayed increased renal absorption of chloride. Compared with normal mice, these transgenic mice exhibited a delayed increase in urinary NaCl and ultimately, developed hypertension when exposed to a high-salt diet. Administering the same sodium intake as NaHCO3 instead of NaCl did not significantly alter BP, indicating that the hypertension in the transgenic mice was chloride-sensitive. Moreover, excessive chloride absorption by pendrin drove parallel absorption of sodium through the epithelial sodium channel ENaC and the sodium-driven chloride/bicarbonate exchanger (Ndcbe), despite an appropriate downregulation of these sodium transporters in response to the expanded vascular volume and hypertension. In summary, chloride transport in the distal nephron can play a primary role in driving NaCl transport in this part of the kidney, and a primary abnormality in renal chloride transport can provoke arterial hypertension. Thus, we conclude that the chloride/bicarbonate exchanger pendrin plays a major role in controlling net NaCl absorption, thereby influencing BP under conditions of high salt intake.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^7d6a53a1]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Reactive P and S co-doped porous hollow nanotube arrays for high performance chloride ion storage [^4646da3e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Sustainable clean energy, water scarcity and industrial wastewater treatment demands have prompted the research of chloride ion storage, which has also been widely studied in the fields of rechargeable chloride ion batteries, and desalination. Thus it is imperative to find effective and reliable technologies for storage of excessive chloride from water and wastewater. Although the traditional techniques can separate chloride ions from the reclaimed water, such as precipitation, electrolysis, ion exchange, and evaporative concentration, they have certain drawbacks such as high energy consumption, high cost, and complex maintenance processes.

Chloride-ion capture for CDI has gained significant attraction in recent years as a promising water-treatment technology to tackle water shortage and chloride pollution problems. Apart from its low cost and easy operation, CDI has great potential as a platform for a combination of freshwater access and energy recovery –.

Electrodes are the core component of electrochemical desalination and ion separation. Up to now, only a few Cl – capture materials have been developed, including Ag/AgCl, Bi/BiOCl, Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) –, conductive polymers –, etc. However, the application of Ag/AgCl is limited by its high cost and strong volume changes in reversible reactions; Bi/BiOCl is restricted by its sluggish kinetics, high energy consumption and electron consumption in disequilibrium with cathodic adsorption; LDHs has relatively insufficient conductivity and low cycling stability; conductive polymer electrodes have a low desalination capacity, currently the highest capacity is around 20 mg g –1. As a consequence, it is very urgent to exploit high-performance electrodes for advancing Cl – storage.

### Renal tubular NHE3 is required in the maintenance of water and sodium chloride homeostasis [^2367b025]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

The sodium/proton exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) is expressed in the intestine and the kidney, where it facilitates sodium (re)absorption and proton secretion. The importance of NHE3 in the kidney for sodium chloride homeostasis, relative to the intestine, is unknown. Constitutive tubule-specific NHE3 knockout mice (NHE3 loxloxCre) did not show significant differences compared to control mice in body weight, blood pH or bicarbonate and plasma sodium, potassium, or aldosterone levels. Fluid intake, urinary flow rate, urinary sodium/creatinine, and pH were significantly elevated in NHE3 loxloxCre mice, while urine osmolality and GFR were significantly lower. Water deprivation revealed a small urinary concentrating defect in NHE3 loxloxCre mice on a control diet, exaggerated on low sodium chloride. Ten days of low or high sodium chloride diet did not affect plasma sodium in control mice; however, NHE3 loxloxCre mice were susceptible to low sodium chloride (about -4 mM) or high sodium chloride intake (about +2 mM) versus baseline, effects without differences in plasma aldosterone between groups. Blood pressure was significantly lower in NHE3 loxloxCre mice and was sodium chloride sensitive. In control mice, the expression of the sodium/phosphate co-transporter Npt2c was sodium chloride sensitive. However, lack of tubular NHE3 blunted Npt2c expression. Alterations in the abundances of sodium/chloride cotransporter and its phosphorylation at threonine 58 as well as the abundances of the α-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel, and its cleaved form, were also apparent in NHE3 loxloxCre mice. Thus, renal NHE3 is required to maintain blood pressure and steady-state plasma sodium levels when dietary sodium chloride intake is modified.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^75342cd7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Medium credibility.

Mineralocorticoid and sodium management in classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency: Infants with classic 21OHD require GCs in addition to MC treatment and supplemental sodium chloride. The requirement for sodium in normally growing infants is ~1 mmol/kg per day, the amount provided by human milk; however, in patients with salt-wasting CAH, this amount is insufficient, and sodium chloride supplements are recommended. Sodium chloride supplementation may not be needed if high-dose fludrocortisone is used; however, it is particularly important to monitor blood pressure in infants who require treatment with high doses of MC. Clinicians should reassess MC and sodium doses periodically based on blood pressure, serum sodium, potassium, and plasma renin activity (PRA). Subclinical aldosterone deficiency is present in all forms of 21OHD and is best evaluated by the aldosterone-to-PRA ratio, and consequently, all individuals with classic CAH benefit from fludrocortisone therapy and adequate dietary sodium beginning in infancy.

### Structural basis for malate-driven, pore lipid-regulated activation of the arabidopsis vacuolar anion channel ALMT9 [^41747506]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In the simulations at a cytosolic negative membrane potential, we observed that conformations of both N and W classes in the basal state converged into those in the conductive states representing both R143 down and R226 up (Fig. 4f–h, Supplementary Fig. 12d–f, Supplementary Movies 4–9). Such opposing movements of R143 and R226 rotamers allowed a new anion binding site (S2) between S1 and S3 by relieving hydrophobic constrictions of the pore in the basal state (Fig. 4f–h). At high malate concentrations ([malate] High), three malate molecules occupied S1, S2, and S3. An entering malate pushed a pre-existing malate into the next site and a malate at S3 exited (Fig. 4f). Such ion transport is reminiscent of a knock-on mechanism in potassium channels. Such knock-on effects induced a continuous flow of malate ions. By contrast, chloride ions represented a sporadic influx due to chloride ion trapping among R143, R200, and R226 at S1 and S2 at high chloride concentrations ([Cl −] High) (Fig. 4g). In presence of a small portion of malate ([Cl −] High + [malate] Low), a malate entering S2 disrupted chloride retention in S1 and S2, thereby allowing the subsequent passage of many chloride ions (Fig. 4h–j). When comparing simulations ([Cl −] High vs. [Cl −] High + [malate] Low), the low malate concentration only increased the frequency of the conductive phase (Fig. 4g, h). In each simulation, both average transit times (20–26 ns) and average flow rates (142–177 ions per μs) of chloride ions were similar during conductive phase, regardless of malate ions (Fig. 4g, h). These simulation results are consistent with the malate-dependent open probability increase without conductivity changes in single-channel analysis.

### Advanced intermediate temperature sodium-nickel chloride batteries with ultra-high energy density [^d6372257]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Sodium-metal halide batteries have been considered as one of the more attractive technologies for stationary electrical energy storage, however, they are not used for broader applications despite their relatively well-known redox system. One of the roadblocks hindering market penetration is the high-operating temperature. Here we demonstrate that planar sodium-nickel chloride batteries can be operated at an intermediate temperature of 190°C with ultra-high energy density. A specific energy density of 350Whkg(-1), higher than that of conventional tubular sodium-nickel chloride batteries (280°C), is obtained for planar sodium-nickel chloride batteries operated at 190°C over a long-term cell test (1,000 cycles), and it attributed to the slower particle growth of the cathode materials at the lower operating temperature. Results reported here demonstrate that planar sodium-nickel chloride batteries operated at an intermediate temperature could greatly benefit this traditional energy storage technology by improving battery energy density, cycle life and reducing material costs.

### A novel method for inducing nerve growth via modulation of host resting potential: gap junction-mediated and serotonergic signaling mechanisms [^287647fa]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Donor Innervation is Regulated by Resting Potential Changes

Exposure to ivermectin depolarizes cells expressing glutamate/glycine-gated chloride channels by locking the targets in an open position, leading to Cl – loss from chloride-rich Xenopus cells. To determine if the phenotype caused by ivermectin was a specific effect of chloride signaling (or even an off-target effect of the drug), or was a response to membrane depolarization per se (regardless of which ion's conductance caused it), experiments were performed to examine ectopic eye innervation in response to voltage changes driven by chloride, potassium, and sodium channels.

The intracellular concentration of chloride ions in developing tadpoles can be as high as 60 mM, while that of standard media is 10 mM, leading to a cellular loss of chloride (and membrane depolarization) following ivermectin exposure. To reverse this effect and hyperpolarize GlyCl-expressing cells, a supplemented medium was created with a 65 mM chloride concentration; the same strategy was previously used to characterize the function of the glycine receptor-expressing cells during embryogenesis. Animals were raised in this medium following transplantation (during the same time periods as drug exposure) and host innervation was visualized as in the previous experiments. Imaging revealed that chloride supplemented media significantly inhibited ivermectin induced hyperinnervation of the host [n = 37 (P = 0.05); 19% hyperinnervation in high chloride treatment compared with 37% with ivermectin only). Most animals showed no innervation, and those in which axons were observed showed a greatly reduced number and simpler branching pattern (Fig. 3a, ai) compared with ivermectin only-treated animals (e.g. Fig. 1d, e). No developmental defects were noted in animals raised in high chloride solutions compared with siblings in standard media, indicating the effect on ectopic eyes was not the result of any large-scale developmental defects. Given the ability of high extracellular chloride to inhibit the hyperinnervating effect of ivermectin precisely as predicted by the Goldman equation, we conclude that the effect is not due to an ion-independent function of ivermectin.

### Succinylcholine [^ac8f3155]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from published literature from case reports and case series over decades of use with succinylcholine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Succinylcholine is used commonly during delivery by caesarean section to provide muscle relaxation. If succinylcholine is used during labor and delivery, there is a risk for prolonged apnea in some pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with succinylcholine chloride.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Maternal Adverse Reactions

Plasma cholinesterase levels are decreased by approximately 24% during pregnancy and for several days postpartum which can prolong the effect of succinylcholine. Therefore, some pregnant patients may experience prolonged apnea.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Apnea and flaccidity may occur in the newborn after repeated high doses to, or in the presence of atypical plasma cholinesterase in, the mother.

Labor or Delivery

Succinylcholine is commonly used to provide muscle relaxation during delivery by caesarean section. Succinylcholine is known to cross the placental barrier in an amount that is dependent on the concentration gradient between the maternal and fetal circulation.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of succinylcholine or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for succinylcholine chloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from succinylcholine chloride or from the underlying maternal condition.

### Unravelling rechargeable zinc-copper batteries by a chloride shuttle in a biphasic electrolyte [^c4626aec]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The zinc-copper redox couple exhibits several merits, which motivated us to reconstruct the rechargeable Daniell cell by combining chloride shuttle chemistry in a zinc chloride-based aqueous/organic biphasic electrolyte. An ion-selective interface was established to restrict the copper ions in the aqueous phase while ensuring chloride transfer. We demonstrated that the copper-water-chloro solvation complexes are the descriptors, which are predominant in aqueous solutions with optimized concentrations of zinc chloride; thus, copper crossover is prevented. Without this prevention, the copper ions are mostly in the hydration state and exhibit high spontaneity to be solvated in the organic phase. The zinc-copper cell delivers a highly reversible capacity of 395 mAh g −1 with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, affording a high energy density of 380 Wh kg −1 based on the copper chloride mass. The proposed battery chemistry is expandable to other metal chlorides, which widens the cathode materials available for aqueous chloride ion batteries.

### An optimized murine model of ferric chloride-induced arterial thrombosis for thrombosis research [^0b6c1270]. Thrombosis Research (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction/Objectives

Animal models are important tools in thrombosis research and preclinical drug development. Ferric chloride has been widely used to induce arterial thrombosis in a variety of species. However, almost all previous reports applied a very high concentration of ferric chloride (10–60%) to induce thrombus formation leading to difficulties in evaluating the efficacy of antithrombotic agents. Thus, the purpose of this study was to refine the ferric-chloride-induced thrombosis model to be better suited for thrombosis research.

Methods and Results

Dose-dependent study was used to identify a threshold concentration of ferric chloride sufficient for consistent occlusion (as reflected by the Doppler blood flow) of the carotid artery in C57BL/6 mice. Ferric chloride concentration at or about a threshold of 2.5% was found to be sensitive to anticoagulant (e.g., heparin) and antiplatelet (e.g., clopidogrel) agents. In contrast, the vessel rapidly occluded at or above 5% ferric chloride concentration despite pretreatment with the antithrombotic agents, even at doses that exerted maximal prolongation of tail bleeding time.

Conclusions

Our study provides a simple, sensitive and highly controlled method for limiting vessel injury in mice to better detect the efficacy of antithrombotic drugs and/or evaluate therapeutic targets.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^1a72c8eb]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 — Potassium-containing salt substitutes in CKD not receiving dialysis: These products "often replace sodium with potassium salts," but "Clinical trials of potassium-containing salt substitutes systematically exclude patients with CKD, so benefits and harms of potassium-containing salt substitutes in CKD are not available." While observational studies suggest that "a higher potassium intake may be associated with a lower risk for all-cause death, CV disease, and CV death," "at advanced stages of CKD (G4 and G5), a high potassium intake may be associated with higher risk." Therefore, "The Work Group suggests caution in using potassium-containing salt substitutes in CKD populations, especially in those with advanced CKD, hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, hyperkalemia from other causes until more data on the safety and efficacy of their use in CKD become available."

### Drinking water NaCl is associated with hypertension and albuminuria: a panel study [^95b268f4]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Salt leaching into freshwater is an emerging global environmental health concern. We tested the associations between drinking water salinity and blood pressure, hypertension, and albuminuria.

Methods

We conducted a 2-year panel study in 2022 and 2023 with 434 observations among 327 Daasanach adults aged > 18 years in northern Kenya. Water sources were analyzed for overall salinity and ionic composition (sodium-chloride; calcium, potassium, magnesium). We measured resting blood pressure and classified hypertension stage 1 and stage 2. Urine samples were analyzed for albuminuria (≥ 30 mg/g albumin-to-creatinine ratio).

Results

Drinking water salinity was driven by sodium-chloride (mean = 162.6 mg/L, SD = 77.1), with low concentrations of calcium, potassium, and magnesium (mean = 45 mg/L, SD = 13.5). Across 2022 and 2023, 40.1% of adults had at least hypertension stage 1, 13.5% had hypertension stage 2, and 42.2% had albuminuria. Using random effects linear and logistic panel regressions fully adjusted for confounders, each 100 mg/L of drinking water sodium-chloride was associated with 4.5 mmHg (95% CI, 2.4–6.6) and 3.3 mmHg (95% CI, 2.2–4.5) increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 3.0× the odds of at least hypertension stage 1 (95% CI, 1.49–5.83), 3.6× the odds of hypertension stage 2 (95% CI, 1.93–6.81), and 2.0× the odds of albuminuria (95% CI, 1.28–3.06). Calcium, potassium, and magnesium were unassociated with any outcomes. Hypertension stage 2 (but not hypertension stage 1) was associated with 2.6× (95% CI, 1.19–5.77) the odds of albuminuria.

Conclusions

Drinking water sodium-chloride was associated with resting blood pressure, hypertension, and albuminuria in a population with few traditional lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease. Measuring specific salts in water helps untangle associations with hypertension.

### Importance of abnormal chloride homeostasis in stable chronic heart failure [^26b768b5]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this analysis was to determine the long-term prognostic value of lower serum chloride in patients with stable chronic heart failure. Electrolyte abnormalities are prevalent in patients with chronic heart failure. Little is known regarding the prognostic implications of lower serum chloride.

Methods and Results

Serum chloride was measured in 1673 consecutively consented stable patients with a history of heart failure undergoing elective diagnostic coronary angiography. All patients were followed for 5-year all-cause mortality, and survival models were adjusted for variables that confounded the chloride-risk relationship. The average chloride level was 102 ± 4 mEq/L. Over 6772 person-years of follow-up, there were 547 deaths. Lower chloride (per standard deviation decrease) was associated with a higher adjusted risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.12–1.49; P < 0.001). Chloride levels net-reclassified risk in 10.4% (P = 0.03) when added to a multivariable model (with a resultant C-statistic of 0.70), in which sodium levels were not prognostic (P = 0.30). In comparison to those with above first quartile chloride (≥ 101 mEq/L) and sodium (≥ 138 meq/L), subjects with first quartile chloride had a higher adjusted mortality risk, whether they had first quartile sodium (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.08–1.69; P = 0.008) or higher (hazard ratio 1.43, 95% confidence interval 1.12–1.85; P = 0.005). However, subjects with first quartile sodium but above first quartile chloride had no association with mortality (P = 0.67).

Conclusions

Lower serum chloride levels are independently and incrementally associated with increased mortality risk in patients with chronic heart failure. A better understanding of the biological role of serum chloride is warranted.

### Chemical epiglottitis causing airway compromise after benzalkonium chloride ingestion [^ef1172c3]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benzalkonium chloride, a quaternary ammonium compound with disinfectant properties, produces caustic effects at concentrations of 0.1% or higher. However, the relationship between the characteristics of the ingested substance and clinical severity, including airway compromise, is not always straightforward.

Case Summary

A 77-year-old man presented with odynophagia and drooling after unintentionally ingesting only 1mL of 10% benzalkonium chloride and 1% isopropyl methyl phenol (Neotraban Green ®). Given the risk of airway compromise, emergency endotracheal intubation was performed. Despite the high concentration, no oral, esophageal, or gastric injury was observed.

Images

Flexible laryngoscopy revealed marked epiglottic and arytenoid swelling, leading to a diagnosis of chemical epiglottitis.

Conclusion

Even minimal ingestion of high-concentration benzalkonium chloride can cause life-threatening upper airway injury. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for airway compromise in cases of caustic ingestion based not only on ingested volume but also on clinical signs.

### A safe and non-flammable sodium metal battery based on an ionic liquid electrolyte [^caeb24a2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Rechargeable sodium metal batteries with high energy density could be important to a wide range of energy applications in modern society. The pursuit of higher energy density should ideally come with high safety, a goal difficult for electrolytes based on organic solvents. Here we report a chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolyte comprised of aluminium chloride/1-methyl-3-ethylimidazolium chloride/sodium chloride ionic liquid spiked with two important additives, ethylaluminum dichloride and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide. This leads to the first chloroaluminate based ionic liquid electrolyte for rechargeable sodium metal battery. The obtained batteries reached voltages up to ~ 4 V, high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.9%, and high energy and power density of ~ 420 Wh kg −1 and ~ 1766 W kg −1, respectively. The batteries retained over 90% of the original capacity after 700 cycles, suggesting an effective approach to sodium metal batteries with high energy/high power density, long cycle life and high safety.
