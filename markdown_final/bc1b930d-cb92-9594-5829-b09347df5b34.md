## Question

How does the diagnosis of UTI differ in paraplegic patients compared to the general population?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) differs in paraplegic patients compared to the general population. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and baseline risk context in paraplegia. Then, I should verify how symptoms and signs differ from the general population. Next, I will examine laboratory thresholds for bacteriuria and pyuria and whether they are the same. After that, I need to check the role of asymptomatic bacteriuria and diagnostic stewardship. Finally, I will integrate these into a practical diagnostic approach and highlight pitfalls and special scenarios, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic context. Paraplegia causes neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction with impaired emptying, elevated intravesical pressure, vesicourethral dyssynergia, and frequent catheter use, all of which increase UTI risk and complicate diagnosis; baseline bacteriuria is common and often chronic, so a positive culture alone is not sufficient to diagnose infection [^eba9755a] [^52b83700] [^ebf48eac].

> Wait, let me verify the symptom landscape. In paraplegia, classic lower urinary tract symptoms like dysuria, frequency, and urgency are often absent or not perceived; instead, clinicians should look for atypical or nonlocalizing signs such as increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, malaise or fatigue, new incontinence, cloudy or malodorous urine, abdominal or flank pain, and fever, recognizing that no single sign is diagnostic and that patients may be better at predicting absence of UTI than presence [^6f751381] [^01e2d951] [^dbb54b5a] [^c53af69d].

> Hold on, I should verify culture thresholds because they differ from the general population. In noncatheterized patients without neurogenic bladder, significant bacteriuria is typically defined as ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL, but in neurogenic bladder managed with intermittent catheterization, lower thresholds are used: ≥ 10² CFU/mL with symptoms is considered diagnostic of UTI, and for catheter-associated UTI, ≥ 10³ CFU/mL with compatible symptoms and no other source suffices; importantly, pyuria alone is not diagnostic and should not trigger treatment in the absence of symptoms [^7a50dd9c] [^f2926bfb] [^ba41b2ee].

> I need to check the role of asymptomatic bacteriuria. In paraplegic patients, screening for or treating asymptomatic bacteriuria is discouraged because it does not improve outcomes and increases resistance; bacteriuria recurs quickly and often with more resistant organisms after treatment, so antibiotics should be reserved for symptomatic infections or specific procedural indications [^c7518a27] [^8f569461] [^eca74bdc].

> Let me consider the laboratory interpretation carefully. Pyuria is common in neurogenic bladder even without infection, so a negative urinalysis can help rule out UTI, but a positive urinalysis should not be used to diagnose UTI in the absence of compatible symptoms; in other words, absence of pyuria argues against infection, whereas presence of pyuria is nonspecific in this population [^9b1ec760] [^ba41b2ee] [^d67dc6a3].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach. Diagnosis should be symptom-driven: identify new or changed atypical signs, exclude other sources of infection, and then obtain urinalysis and urine culture with susceptibilities; in recurrent UTI, evaluate for structural or functional contributors with imaging and consider urodynamics if no source is found, while avoiding reflex cultures for cloudy or malodorous urine alone [^388e6b1b] [^095800d6] [^47af6432] [^da0c1ec3].

> But wait, what if the patient is febrile or septic? I should confirm that in suspected urosepsis, obtaining urine culture and two sets of blood cultures before antibiotics is recommended, and that empiric therapy should be tailored to local resistance patterns and then narrowed to culture results; this aligns with general sepsis principles but is especially important in neurogenic bladder where resistance is common [^8dce3681] [^a57efdd4].

> I should double-check special scenarios. Prior to urologic procedures involving mucosal disruption, screening and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria is advised to reduce procedural infectious risk; in pregnancy with SCI, screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is still recommended despite the general prohibition, given maternal-fetal risks, though evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^eca74bdc] [^c4be003d].

> Let me reconsider the key distinctions to ensure I have not missed anything. Compared with the general population, paraplegic patients have a higher baseline prevalence of bacteriuria, atypical or nonlocalizing symptoms, lower culture thresholds for diagnosing UTI, and a stronger mandate to avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria; therefore, diagnosis must integrate clinical change with appropriate microbiologic criteria and a high index of suspicion for complications [^ebf48eac] [^7a50dd9c] [^c7518a27].

---

UTI diagnosis in paraplegic patients differs from the general population due to **atypical symptoms** (increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, malaise, or sense of unease) [^6f751381] and a **high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria** (ASB) [^ebf48eac], which can confound diagnosis [^52b83700]. Classic urinary symptoms are often absent, so clinicians must rely on **clinical judgment** and correlate new or changed symptoms with urinalysis and culture [^c2718d60]. Lower bacterial thresholds (** ≥ 10² CFU/mL**) are used for catheterized patients [^7a50dd9c], and pyuria alone is not diagnostic [^ba41b2ee]. ASB should not be treated [^c7518a27] unless specific indications exist, to avoid resistance and harm [^8f569461].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Paraplegic patients often present with **atypical symptoms** that differ from the classic urinary symptoms seen in the general population [^52b83700]:

- **Increased spasticity**: Commonly reported and may be the primary indicator of UTI [^6f751381].

- **Autonomic dysreflexia**: Sudden hypertension, headache, and sweating, often triggered by bladder irritation or infection [^6f751381].

- **General malaise or sense of unease**: Frequently reported by patients and caregivers [^6f751381].

- **Cloudy or malodorous urine**: Common but nonspecific findings [^01e2d951].

- **New or worsening incontinence**: May indicate infection [^01e2d51].

Classic symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, and urgency are often absent or muted due to **neurogenic bladder dysfunction** and altered sensory perception [^52b83700].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and thresholds

Diagnostic criteria for UTI in paraplegic patients differ from those in the general population, particularly regarding **bacterial colony counts** and the interpretation of pyuria:

| **Parameter** | **General population** | **Paraplegic patients** |
|-|-|-|
| Significant bacteriuria | ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL | ≥ 10² CFU/mL (catheterized patients) [^7a50dd9c] |
| Pyuria | Diagnostic indicator | Nonspecific; common in ASB [^ba41b2ee] |
| Asymptomatic bacteriuria | Treat only in specific cases (e.g. pregnancy) | Do not treat unless specific indications [^c7518a27] |

---

## Role of asymptomatic bacteriuria

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is highly prevalent in paraplegic patients, particularly those with indwelling catheters or using intermittent catheterization [^ebf48eac]. Treating ASB in this population is **not recommended** because it does not improve outcomes and increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and adverse effects [^8f569461] [^0b870ac5].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Given the atypical presentation and high prevalence of ASB, a **careful diagnostic approach** is essential:

- **Clinical assessment**: Document new or changed symptoms, including increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, malaise, or changes in urine characteristics [^6f751381].

- **Urinalysis and urine culture**: Obtain in symptomatic patients to confirm infection and guide antibiotic therapy [^c2718d60].

- **Avoid routine screening**: Do not screen for or treat ASB unless specific indications exist (e.g. prior to urologic procedures) [^c7518a27].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Several challenges complicate UTI diagnosis in paraplegic patients:

- **Subjectivity of symptoms**: Reliance on patient-reported symptoms can lead to misclassification of ASB as symptomatic UTI [^52b83700].

- **Lack of standardized criteria**: Variability in diagnostic criteria and definitions of symptomatic UTI across studies and clinical practice [^103887f3].

- **Risk of overtreatment**: Misdiagnosis of ASB as symptomatic UTI leads to unnecessary antibiotic use, promoting resistance and adverse effects [^8f569461].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following:

- **Do not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria**: Strong recommendation against screening or treating ASB in paraplegic patients [^c7518a27].

- **Use clinical judgment**: Base diagnosis on new or changed symptoms, supported by urinalysis and culture [^c2718d60].

- **Lower bacterial thresholds**: Use ≥ 10² CFU/mL for catheterized patients [^7a50dd9c].

- **Avoid pyuria-based diagnosis**: Pyuria alone is not diagnostic of UTI in this population [^ba41b2ee].

---

UTI diagnosis in paraplegic patients requires a **heightened awareness of atypical symptoms**, careful clinical assessment, and judicious use of diagnostic tests. The high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria necessitates a cautious approach to avoid overtreatment and antibiotic resistance.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common complications in people with neurogenic bladder. Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are challenging for several reasons, including a high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and catheter use, frequent ambiguous nonlocalizing signs and symptoms, increased risk for complications and difficult-to-treat pathogens, and a lack of effective preventative methods. Current research aims to improve elicitation and evaluation of signs and symptoms, implement algorithms to avoid urine cultures in asymptomatic patients and use appropriate antibiotics for UTI, and identify novel effective prevention methods.

### Current controversies in urinary tract infections: ICI-RS 2017 [^103887f3]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

The current definition of urinary tract infection (UTI) relies on laboratory and clinical findings, which may or may not be relevant, depending upon the patient group under consideration. This report considers the utility of current definitions for UTI in adults with and without underlying neurological conditions in order to identify gaps in current understanding and to recommend directions for research.

Methods

This is a consensus report of the proceedings of Think Tank TT3: "How do we define and when do we treat UTI in neurological and non-neurological adult patients?" from the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS), June 8–10, 2017 (Bristol, UK).

Results

Evidence considering the definitions of UTI in patients with and without neurological diseases was reviewed and synthesized. We examined research on laboratory methods and clinical definitions, focusing on specific cut-off values for the quantification of significant bacteriuria, and leucocyturia. Several areas were identified, mostly related to the lack of evidence-based definitions of significant bacteriuria for different patient groups, as well as uncertainties about the role of inflammatory biomarkers, and non-specific symptoms and signs.

Conclusions

One of the biggest challenges in clinical practice is to discriminate between asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTI. Future research should concentrate on risk factors for developing symptomatic UTI in different patient groups. Targeted investigations for specific populations, such as the frail elderly, and patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction, are still needed.

### Urinary infections in patients with spinal cord injury [^29277448]. Spinal Cord (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective study concerning urinary tract infections in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients.

Objectives

To check whether the regular (1/week) urine cultures allow a more accurate treatment of urinary tract infections in SCI patients compared to empiric treatment.

Setting

Ghent University Hospital, East-Flanders, Belgium.

Methods

Group 1: 24 tetraplegic patients; group 2: 22 paraplegic patients; group 3: 28 other polytrauma patients as controls. These groups were chosen as catheterisation and other voiding methods differ according to the underlying pathology.

Results

An average of four clinically significant episodes of bacteriuria were found for groups 1 and 2, while group 3 experienced very few urinary infections. The mean species turnover of the first two groups was 2. No statistically significant difference was found in antibiotic-resistance patterns of organisms isolated.

Conclusion

Despite different catheterisation techniques in para- and tetraplegic patients, we conclude that: (1) the number of episodes of clinical significant nosocomial urinary infections is not different; (2) the mean species turnover is the same; (3) because of the species turnover, the value of regular urine cultures for 'documented' treatment of clinical relevant urinary infections seems to be limited. So urine culture could be performed less frequently or only when therapy becomes mandatory; (4) No oral antibiotic with superior activity was found: treatment is best started empirically (after sampling for urine culture) and adjusted to the resulting antibiotic sensitivity screening.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^9b1ec760]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. A UA encompasses physical, chemical, and microscopic evaluations designed to aid in diagnosing kidney, metabolic, oncologic, and infectious disorders. Unfortunately, the diagnostic value of UA for UTI is limited. 45, 46 While the absence of pyuria can help rule out infection in most patient populations, the positive predictive value of pyuria for diagnosing infection is exceedingly low as it often indicates the presence of genitourinary inflammation due to many other possible noninfectious reasons. For these reasons, WikiGuidelines authors believe that evidence-based diagnosis of UTI should be primarily based on clinical symptoms. Clinical symptoms may be integrated with UA findings, but authors caution clinicians to not rely solely on the UA alone.

Urine cultures are reasonable for complicated cases and/or recurrent UTIs, particularly in suspected pyelonephritis, to guide targeted therapy. In simple uncomplicated cystitis in healthy nonpregnant patients, routine cultures are not necessary. 47, 48. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Routine use of UA and urine cultures for the workup of fever in hospitalized patients leads to unnecessary testing and antimicrobial use. 46, 49, 50 Studies show that UTIs, including catheter-associated UTIs, are infrequently the source of fever, particularly in the absence of urinary tract obstruction, recent urological procedures, or immunocompromise. 51 Consequently, urine testing should not be automatic in febrile patients, especially geriatric patients, or those with known nonurinary sources of fever and should be reserved for cases with specific urinary or related symptoms.

The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. The role of molecular techniques for UTI diagnosis is currently limited. Molecular diagnostics cannot distinguish true infection from ASB. Urine culture is the current reference standard for confirming the etiologic pathogen in patients with suspected infection. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. UA has a very low specificity in diagnosing UTIs in patients with indwelling urinary catheters or ileal conduits but has excellent negative predictive value. 72 This suggests that a negative UA can rule out CAUTI for patients with functioning bone marrow, but given the low specificity of UA in patients with urinary catheters or ileal conduits, a positive UA does not mean the patient has a CAUTI.

### Urinary tract infection and neuropathic bladder [^23c3c71e]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common infection in patients with neurogenic bladder. Diagnosis is fraught with challenges since there is no globally accepted definition for UTI and symptoms can vary widely. Due to the increased risk of morbidity, it is important to have a thorough understanding of the risk of UTI, diagnostic criteria, and to treat aggressively when UTI is confirmed. Prevention of UTI is optimal but more studies are needed to identify the best methods to prevent UTIs in this population.

### Physiologic differences in vital signs and urine tests in spinal cord injury and the effects on urinary tract infection diagnosis [^35627921]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish the physiologic baseline (person's physiologic state when their health is stable) for vital signs and urine lab measurements after spinal cord injury (SCI).

Design

This case-control study using outpatient data from the national Veteran's Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse included 2,000 Veterans with SCI (cases) and 2,000 Veterans without SCI (controls) between 2018–2019. Cases and controls were randomly selected, and frequency matched for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and Deyo comorbidity index.

Results

SCI patients had lower temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures than non-SCI (p < 0.05). Pyuria and hematuria were higher in SCI patients, with approximately 73% of tetraplegic and paraplegic patients having urine white blood cells above 10 HPF. Tetraplegic patients had lower heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure than both paraplegic patients and non-SCI patients (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Baseline vital signs were lower in SCI patients compared to non-SCI patients. Lower systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were associated with higher levels of SCI. Tetraplegic and paraplegic patients had baseline pyuria above 10 HPF suggesting the criteria for pyuria as a positive indicator of UTI should be different in patients with SCI than those without SCI.

### Urinary tract infection analysis in a spinal cord injured population undergoing rehabilitation – how to treat? [^f9ee8e28]. Spinal Cord (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Cross sectional study, including 38 outpatients. Standardized questionnaire was used and urine cultures were performed.

Objectives

To study spinal cord-injured (SCI) patients bladder management, clinical aspects that symptomatic urinary tract infection (SUTI) may present and asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) incidence with its antimicrobial susceptibility profile.

Setting

Spinal cord injury outpatient rehabilitation clinic.

Results

Clean intermittent catheterization is used by 71% of the patients. SUTI may have atypical clinical presentation (shivers, spasticity increase, headaches). In total, 65.7% (N = 25) of the patients presented AB. Among these, the microorganisms isolated were resistant mainly to Ampicillin, Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim and Norfloxacin, whose resistance rates were, respectively 73.3%, 60% and 33.3%.

Conclusion

Special attention should be given to possible atypical symptoms for SUTI. Although a small amount of urine samples was analyzed, resistance rates against Ampicillin, Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim, Ciprofloxacin and Nitrofurantoin appear to be higher among SCI patients compared to the general population, thus demonstrating the need for continuous monitoring of microorganisms susceptibility, in order to avoid therapeutic failure when dealing with this specific population.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^8f569461]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) with impaired voiding — asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) management: Recommendation — In patients with SCI, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Evidence summary highlights that subjects with SCI have a high prevalence of bacteriuria and a high incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and treatment of ASB is usually followed by early recurrence of bacteriuria with reinfecting strains more likely to be antimicrobial resistant. Trials in intermittently catheterized patients observed no differences in rates of symptomatic UTI between antimicrobial treatment/prophylaxis and placebo or no treatment. Multiple reviews and guidelines concluded that ASB should not be screened for or treated in SCI patients, and European Association of Urology guidance states screening for and treatment of ASB are not recommended. Some evidence suggests ASB might be protective and that treatment of ASB may be associated with an increased risk of symptomatic UTI; bacterial interference using nonpathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli 83972/HU2117) has been evaluated, with two RCTs in neurogenic bladders reporting protection against symptomatic UTI in small cohorts (20 and 27 patients, respectively). Clinical signs and symptoms of UTI in SCI may differ from the classic genitourinary symptoms experienced by patients with normal sensation.

### Management of urinary tract infection in patients with spinal cord injuries [^a04aab9f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is responsible for major morbidity and mortality in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. Several factors appear to be responsible for an increased risk of infection in the neurogenic bladder. Incomplete voiding, elevated intravesical pressure and catheter use contribute to an increased risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection. Frequent exposure to antibiotics increases the risk of infection by resistant organisms. UTIs interfere with rehabilitation, and may lead to secondary urologic complications. The classic symptoms of UTI are unreliable indicators in SCI patients with neurogenic bladder. Lack of pyuria reasonably predicts the absence of UTI in SCI patients. Asymptomatic bacteriuria need not be treated with antibiotics. Symptomatic UTI warrants therapy in all patients.

### Diagnostic evaluation and management of recurrent urinary tract infections in the spinal cord injury population-a retrospective evaluation at a tertiary care center [^c8ad6853]. Spinal Cord (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective review.

Objectives

While most individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are expected to have 1–2 urinary tract infections (UTIs) per year, there is a subset with higher incidence. We evaluate our practice to characterize common causes of recurrent UTIs, hypothesizing that more frequent infections typically have addressable risk factors.

Setting

Tertiary urology clinic, San Jose, CA.

Methods

We reviewed patients with SCI referred to a tertiary urology clinic for evaluation and management of "recurrent UTIs" during the years 2015–2020. Following workup, the suspected cause of recurrent UTIs and number of post-specialty evaluation UTIs (patient reported) were noted.

Results

Forty persons with SCI with a mean of 4.8 UTI treatments in the prior year comprised our cohort with most performing CIC (80%). After workup, 37/40 (92.5%) had a likely cause for their reported recurrent UTIs. In 16/40 (40%), careful questioning determined that the patient was not having UTIs based on guideline definitions. In those with confirmed recurrent UTIs, a bladder diary (62.5%) or urodynamic study (64%) was more likely to identify a cause compared to imaging (2.6%) or cystoscopy (8%). With a minimum 1-year follow-up, 90% of our population had a 50% or more reduction in UTI incidence, mostly using non-antibiotic strategies.

Conclusion

In a referral SCI population with a chief complaint of "recurrent UTIs", over a third were not having UTIs. In addition to detailed history, a bladder diary ± urodynamics are most useful in finding the cause and improving UTI.

### Obstetric management of patients with spinal cord injuries: ACOG committee opinion, number 808 [^c4be003d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) — definitions, screening, and limited preventive evidence in pregnancy with spinal cord injury (SCI) are outlined. Virtually all patients with SCIs suffer from neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, and urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis are the most common reason for hospitalization of women with SCIs during pregnancy. For diagnosis, general definitions should apply: asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the presence of one or more species of bacteria growing in the urine at specified quantitative counts (10⁵ or more colony-forming units), and urinary tract infection is defined as substantial urinary bacterial growth with symptoms; in women with SCIs, symptoms may not be typical and may include autonomic dysreflexia and increased spasticity. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is prevalent among individuals with SCI, with rates as high as 50–100%. Regarding screening, screening at least once in early pregnancy is recommended for all pregnant women by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force and the Infectious Disease Society of America, these recommendations have been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and should be followed, although some experts advocate more frequent assessment in pregnant patients with SCIs. Preventive evidence is limited: a prospective study of prophylactic weekly oral cyclic antibiotics (amoxicillin, cefixime, and nitrofurantoin) in six pregnant women with SCIs demonstrated a reduction in UTI frequency but its small sample size precludes broad recommendations; a systematic review suggested that the lowest UTI rate was described with the Credé maneuver but the optimal bladder evacuation mode in pregnancy cannot be determined based on limited evidence.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^75ad71ad]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship — pretest probability and UTI ordering context — Pretest estimates of disease are based on the incidence of disease in specific populations and how risk factors or symptoms modify probability, and this estimation is challenging in patients with nonspecific symptoms. In elderly patients, urine cultures are often ordered for nonspecific symptoms such as failure to thrive or fatigue, and the incidence of urinary tract infections in elderly women is higher than the general population as is the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

### Urinary tract infections in special populations: diabetes, renal transplant, HIV infection, and spinal cord injury [^bca1f7a3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Some populations have unique considerations relevant to complicated urinary tract infection. For patients with diabetes, renal transplant, HIV infection, and spinal cord injuries, approaches to management, including diagnosis and treatment, are generally similar to other patients with complicated urinary tract infection. In addition, there is no evidence that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria leads to improved outcomes.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^11c1e6c6]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Hydrophilic versus uncoated catheters in acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) — an RCT randomized patients to hydrophilic (n = 108) or uncoated (n = 116) catheters for six months and found the incidence of UTI and time to first symptomatic infection requiring antibiotics were significantly delayed in the hydrophilic group, although dropout rates were high at 58% and 40%, respectively.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^01e2d951]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — symptom-based diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients shows limited specificity. In a prospective case series, symptomatic UTI required a bacterial count of > 10² CFU/mL plus at least one symptom, whereas asymptomatic UTI used the same culture criteria without symptoms; there was no clinical sign or symptom that was diagnostic of UTI. The most common clinical signs associated with UTI were cloudy and/or malodorous urine (51.4%), new onset UI (51.2%), fatigue (41.7%), and fever (30.7%), and these signs and symptoms, in isolation, were not optimal for a diagnosis of UTI.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis for urinary tract infection in persons with spinal cord dysfunction [^ba2f9a17]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in persons with neurogenic bladders caused by spinal cord dysfunction.

Data Sources

A broad search strategy with no language restriction was conducted of MEDLINE (1966-January 1998), EMBASE (1974-January 1998), and CINAHL (1982-July 1998) using the general search terms urinary tract, urinary tract infections, bacteriuria, paraplegia, quadriplegia, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, neurogenic bladder, and neuropathic bladder. Additional articles were identified by experts and by reviewing reference lists of articles obtained from searches.

Study Selection

Criteria included human studies of adults and adolescents who had neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord dysfunction; the studies had to address antimicrobial prophylaxis of UTI and include bacteriuria or UTI as an outcome. We excluded any study that was clearly not a controlled trial or that only included children under the age of 13 years. Two reviewers independently abstracted data, and disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently abstracted data, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Studies were graded by 1 project investigator according to quality criteria developed by Jadad and Schulz.

Data Synthesis

The sizes of the effect of antimicrobial prophylaxis on weekly infection rates from 15 trials that met the inclusion criteria were pooled by using a random effects model. Antimicrobial prophylaxis did not significantly decrease symptomatic infections. Prophylaxis was associated with a reduction in asymptomatic bacteriuria among acute patients (< 90d after spinal cord injury; P < .05); 1 patient would require 3.7 weeks of treatment on average to prevent 1 asymptomatic infection. For nonacute patients, the reduction approached statistical significance (P = 0.06). Prophylaxis resulted in an approximately twofold increase in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.

Conclusions

The regular use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for most patients who have neurogenic bladder caused by spinal cord dysfunction is not supported. A clinically important effect, however, has not been excluded. Future research should focus on randomized trials in those patients who have recurrent UTIs that limit their daily functioning and well-being.

### Pathogenesis of bacteriuria and infection in the spinal cord injured patient [^eba9755a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) produces profound alterations in lower urinary tract function. Incontinence, elevated intravesical pressure, reflux, stones, and neurological obstruction, commonly found in the spinal cord-injured population, increase the risk of urinary infection. The overall rate of urinary infection in SCI patient is about 2.5 episodes per patient per year. Despite improved methods of treatment, urinary tract morbidity still ranks as the second leading cause of death in the SCI patient.SCI removes the ability of the pontine micturition center and higher centers in the brain to inhibit, control, or coordinate the activity of the vesicourethral unit. As a result, a patient with complete quadriplegia is typically unaware of bladder activity. Bladder contraction is accompanied by vesicosphincter dyssynergia instead of sphincter relaxation. It is widely accepted that intermittent catheterization, when compared with indwelling catheters, reduces the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) in SCI patients and is the preferred method of bladder drainage in this patient population. Attempts at eliminating bacteriuria associated with indwelling or intermittent catheters have generally been unsuccessful. There is now appreciation of the fact that a creeping adherent biofilm of bacteria frequently ascends through the luminal and external surfaces of an indwelling catheter, often within 8 to 24 hours, leading to bacterial adherence to the bladder surface and correlating with symptomatic infection. The use of antimicrobial agents to clear or prevent bacteriuria in patients on indwelling or intermittent catheterization has had mixed success. Treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in SCI patients remains controversial. SCI patients with symptomatic urinary infections should be treated with the most specific, narrowest spectrum antibiotics available for the shortest possible time. Guidelines for selecting antimicrobial agents in SCI patients are similar to guidelines for the treatment of complicated urinary infections in the general population. Characteristics of the quinolones make them well suited to treating UTI in the SCI patient.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^0ae45e3d]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Human as habitat model — lower urinary tract microbiome and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) reframe culture interpretation and clinical outcomes. Sensitive culture-dependent and -independent techniques reveal that the lower urinary tract, even in asymptomatic, healthy individuals, hosts a complex microbial community, challenging the prior view that urine is sterile and redefining UTI as microbial infiltration of an otherwise sterile tract; in this view all individuals are likely "bacteriuric", these commensal communities are generally symbiotic, and ASB communities may protect patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) from additional symptomatic episodes. Among 673 young women with ASB, those treated with antibiotics experienced higher rates of subsequent symptomatic UTI, intentional bladder colonization with a nonpathogenic E. coli (HU2117) has been shown to safely reduce symptomatic UTI risk in patients with spinal cord injury, and large epidemiologic studies document a high prevalence (> 75%) of chronic or fluctuating lower urinary tract symptoms in the general population.

### CAUTIon-not all UTIs are the same [^76dd1cc8]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for ~400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) with indwelling catheters at risk for calculi — clinicians should perform urinary tract imaging every 1–2 years for patients who are at risk for upper and lower urinary tract calculi (e.g., patients with spinal cord injury, recurrent urinary tract infection, immobilization, hypercalciuria) (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C), supported by four observational studies. Rationale includes that the catheter increases the risk of UTIs and is a source of chronic bacteriuria, with bladder stones prevalence ranging from 8% to 41% and upper tract stones occurring in 6–32% of patients.

### Urinary tract infection and neurogenic bladder [^34f0421e]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent, recurrent, and lifelong for patients with neurogenic bladder and present challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Patients often present without classic symptoms of UTI but with abdominal or back pain, increased spasticity, and urinary incontinence. Failure to recognize and treat infections can quickly lead to life-threatening autonomic dysreflexia or sepsis, whereas overtreatment contributes to antibiotic resistance, thus limiting future treatment options. Multiple prevention methods are used but evidence-based practices are few. Prevention and treatment of symptomatic UTI requires a multimodal approach that focuses on bladder management as well as accurate diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^82f94cf0]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Practice considerations — population and definition: This recommendation applies to adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection and does not apply to persons who have chronic medical or urinary tract conditions, such as end-stage renal disease; have neurogenic bladders, urinary stents, or spinal cord injuries; are hospitalized; reside in an institution (e.g., a nursing home); or who are transplant recipients. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs when the urinary tract is colonized with significant amounts of pathogenic bacteria, primarily from the gastrointestinal tract, in the absence of symptoms or signs of a urinary tract infection; the most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, although other bacteria such as Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, and group B streptococcus can be involved. The risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria varies by age, sex, and pregnancy status; because of the location and length of the female urethra, women are predisposed to infections of the urinary tract, in general, men are at low risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria, and persons with diabetes are also at increased risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^dbb54b5a]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) populations — predictive value of patient-reported symptoms for UTI: In a prospective case series of 147 consecutive SCI patients (101 male; 106 at T6 or higher), UTI definitions included a significant bacteria colony count (defined as > 10⁴ CFU/ mL) and pyuria (defined as > 10 WBC/hpf); using these definitions, 61% (n = 90) of patients were able to predict the presence of UTI based on symptoms, and 39% (n = 57) of patients were unable, and the authors found that the type of bladder management had no impact on prediction. In another study of 51 SCI patients (34 male, 26 at T6 or higher), patients were much better at predicting when they did not have a UTI versus when they did have a UTI, with a negative predictive value of 82.8% and a positive predictive value of 32.6%. For individual signs and symptoms, the presence of urinary leukocytes had the highest sensitivity (82.8%) and negative predictive value (93.8%); cloudy urine had the second highest positive predictive value (61.3%) and sensitivity (65.5%); fever and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) had the highest specificity at 99% but very low sensitivity (fever: 6.9%; AD: 0%). Another report found malodorous urine to have the highest sensitivity and new onset incontinence to have the highest specificity for UTI diagnosis in SCI patients, and cloudy urine had the highest positive predictive value (71%), which increased to 78% when combined with malodorous urine.

### Epidemiology of urinary tract infections: incidence, morbidity, and economic costs [^28c5c36d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are considered to be the most common bacterial infection. According to the 1997 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, UTI accounted for nearly 7 million office visits and 1 million emergency department visits, resulting in 100,000 hospitalizations. Nevertheless, it is difficult to accurately assess the incidence of UTIs, because they are not reportable diseases in the United States. This situation is further complicated by the fact that accurate diagnosis depends on both the presence of symptoms and a positive urine culture, although in most outpatient settings this diagnosis is made without the benefit of culture. Women are significantly more likely to experience UTI than men. Nearly 1 in 3 women will have had at least 1 episode of UTI requiring antimicrobial therapy by the age of 24 years. Almost half of all women will experience 1 UTI during their lifetime. Specific subpopulations at increased risk of UTI include infants, pregnant women, the elderly, patients with spinal cord injuries and/or catheters, patients with diabetes or multiple sclerosis, patients with acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome/human immunodeficiency virus, and patients with underlying urologic abnormalities. Catheter-associated UTI is the most common nosocomial infection, accounting for > 1 million cases in hospitals and nursing homes. The risk of UTI increases with increasing duration of catheterization. In noninstitutionalized elderly populations, UTIs are the second most common form of infection, accounting for nearly 25% of all infections. There are important medical and financial implications associated with UTIs. In the nonobstructed, nonpregnant female adult, acute uncomplicated UTI is believed to be a benign illness with no long-term medical consequences. However, UTI elevates the risk of pyelonephritis, premature delivery, and fetal mortality among pregnant women, and is associated with impaired renal function and end-stage renal disease among pediatric patients. Financially, the estimated annual cost of community-acquired UTI is significant, at approximately $1.6 billion.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for neurogenic bladder, more specifically with respect to re-evaluation of patients with new symptoms, ICUD/SIU 2018 guidelines recommend to do not ignore the following non-specific signs and symptoms of UTIs in patients with spinal cord injury, which may suggest presence of urinary infections:

- exacerbation of spasticity

- difficulty to insert the catheter into the urethra due to the spasms of the pelvic floor

- worsening of incontinence

- fever

### Triggered urine interleukin-6 correlates to severity of symptoms in nonfebrile lower urinary tract infections [^ffa00f25]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Objective diagnosis of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients prone to asymptomatic bacteriuria is compromised by local host responses that are already present and the positive urine culture. We investigated interleukin-6 as a biomarker for nonfebrile urinary tract infection severity and diagnostic thresholds for interleukin-6 and 8, and neutrophils to differentiate between asymptomatic bacteriuria and urinary tract infection.

Materials and Methods

Patients with residual urine and neurogenic bladders due to spinal lesions included in a long-term Escherichia coli 83972 asymptomatic bacteriuria inoculation trial were monitored for 2 years. Symptom scoring and urine sampling to estimate interleukin-6 and 8, and neutrophils were performed regularly monthly and at urinary tract infection episodes.

Results

Patients were followed in the complete study for a mean of 19 months (range 10 to 27) and those with asymptomatic bacteriuria with E. coli 83972 were followed a mean of 11 months (range 4 to 19). A total of 37 nonfebrile urinary tract infection episodes with complete data on interleukin-6 and 8, neutrophils and symptom scoring were documented. Interleukin-6 was the only marker that persistently increased during urinary tract infection compared to asymptomatic bacteriuria in pooled and paired intra-individual comparisons (p < 0.05). Interleukin-6 above the threshold (greater than 25 ng/l) correlated to more severe urinary tract infection symptoms (p < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of all biomarkers were poor/moderate when differentiating asymptomatic bacteriuria vs all urinary tract infection episodes. However, in urinary tract infections with worse symptoms interleukin-6 and neutrophils demonstrated equal good/excellent outcomes.

Conclusions

Triggered interleukin-6 correlated to urinary tract infection symptom severity and demonstrated a promising differential diagnostic capacity to discriminate urinary tract infection from asymptomatic bacteriuria. Future studies should explore interleukin-6 as a biomarker of urinary tract infection severity and assess the treatment indication in nonfebrile urinary tract infections.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^808c44d8]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Highlights

- Older adults may present atypically with UTI and making a diagnosis can be difficult.
- There is limited authoritative guidance on how older adult outpatients present with UTI.
- Symptoms and signs traditionally associated with UTI (e.g. nocturia, urgency and abnormal vital signs) may have limited utility in diagnosing these infections in older adult outpatients.
- Disability in performing a number of acts of daily living may be better predictors of UTI; high quality studies should be conducted in this area to confirm this.

### Urinary bladder biopsies in spinal cord injured patients [^fa1f940c]. Spinal Cord (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A series of 94 urinary bladder biopsies in spinal cord injured (SCI) patients were histopathologically and statistically analysed.

Objectives

The following hypotheses were examined: (1) The number of clinical bladder infections per year in each patient does not influence the histopathological type of inflammation of the urinary bladder; (2) The duration of the spinal cord lesion does not have a strong effect on the type of inflammation; (3) The different neurological levels (upper and lower motor neuron lesions) do not relate to a specific histopathology.

Settings

All patients received their treatment at the Swiss Paraplegic Centre in Nottwil, near Lucerne (Switzerland).

Methods

The samples were taken from the bladder fundus during endoscopic urologic operations. Histopathological standard procedures were carried out. Statistical analysis including Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square tests were performed.

Results

Histopathological analysis showed abnormal alterations of the urinary bladder mucosa in 86 SCI-patients: (91.5%). 63 cases (67.0%) showed a chronic type and 23 cases (24.5%) showed a subacute type of inflammation. A normal urinary bladder was found in eight cases (8.5%). The three hypotheses were statistically not rejected.

Conclusion

Results demonstrated no correlation between the number of bladder infections per year, the period since injury, the neurologic level of the spinal cord lesion and the histopathology of the urinary bladder mucosa.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^eca74bdc]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — asymptomatic bacteriuria: clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with NLUTD. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) The guideline notes that antibiotic resistance is a significant problem in NLUTD and that unnecessary antibiotic use should be avoided; treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in catheter-free spinal cord injury (SCI) patients leads to early recurrence with more resistant strains and has no effect on subsequent asymptomatic bacteriuria or UTI in SCI patients performing intermittent catheterization. The exception is pregnancy and prior to urologic procedures in which urothelial disruption or upper tract manipulation is anticipated; for contaminated or clean-contaminated procedures, perioperative antimicrobial treatment or prophylaxis is stated as best practice, with related guidance suggesting obtaining a urine culture and giving a targeted, short course regimen rather than empiric therapy before endoscopic urologic procedures, and recommending a single oral dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for patients with NLUTD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^5887d644]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB.

### Predictive factors of urinary tract infections among the oldest old in the general population. A population-based prospective follow-up study [^f8cd1039]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in the very elderly and account for nearly 25% of all infections. The incidence of UTI increases with age in both men and women, and increases from 12 to 29 per 100 person-years at risk in community-dwelling elderly populations to 44 to 58 per 100 residents per year at risk in long term care facilities. These UTI are often complicated, involving the presence of structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Especially in vulnerable older persons living in long term care facilities, UTIs more often have serious consequences such as delirium, dehydration, urosepsis, hospitalisation, or even death.

Several strategies to prevent UTI have been developed, such as treatment of those at high risk with low-dose, long-term antibiotics, oestrogens and cranberry products. These strategies have been shown to be effective in preventing UTI in younger women with recurrent UTI, but not yet in vulnerable older people. Preventive strategies are best applied to those at risk; however, factors associated with UTI in ambulatory older patients in the community setting have not been described.

Previous studies have shown that increasing age, diabetes mellitus, stroke, urine incontinence, prior history of UTI, urogenital surgery, and impaired functional and cognitive status predict the development of UTI among older individuals. However, these studies investigated predictors of UTI in specific patient groups, such as hospitalised patients and patients residing in long-term care facilities and did not include older individuals in the general population. In addition, these studies used different methods to identify UTI. It is generally accepted that diagnosing symptomatic UTI in older persons is complicated due to factors like difficult doctor-patient communication, chronical genito-urinary symptoms, and a high frequency of positive urine cultures due to bacteriuria without complaints.

To target preventive strategies against UTIs in older individuals, those with highest risk to develop UTI have to be identified. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and predictive factors of UTI among the oldest old in the general population.

### Retrospective cohort study of patient-reported urinary tract infection signs and symptoms among individuals with neurogenic bladder [^c53af69d]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to characterize patient-reported signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic bladder to inform development of an intervention to improve the accuracy of urinary tract infection diagnosis.

Design

This is a retrospective cohort study of adults with neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury/disorder, multiple sclerosis, and/or Parkinson disease and urinary tract infection encounters at four medical centers between 2017 and 2018. Data were collected through medical record review and analyzed using descriptive statistics and unadjusted logistic regression.

Results

Of 199 patients with neurogenic bladder and urinary tract infections, 37% were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, 36% spinal cord injury/disorder, and 27% Parkinson disease. Most patients were men (88%) in inpatient or long-term care settings (60%) with bladder catheters (67%). Fever was the most frequent symptom (32%). Only 38% of patients had a urinary tract-specific symptom; 48% had only nonspecific to the urinary tract symptoms. Inpatient encounter setting (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–5.2) was associated with greater odds of only having nonspecific urinary tract symptoms.

Conclusions

In patients with neurogenic bladder and urinary tract infection encounters, nonspecific signs and symptoms are most frequently reported. These results can inform interventions to help providers better elicit and document urinary tract-specific symptoms in patients with neurogenic bladder presenting with possible urinary tract infection, particularly among hospitalized patients.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria [^b2a79a19]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine in the absence of urinary symptoms, is a common clinical finding that often warrants a decision about whether to initiate antimicrobial therapy. There are few indications to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria, and inappropriate treatment contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance. In 2019, the Infectious Diseases Society of America revised its 2005 guidelines on asymptomatic bacteriuria, incorporating new evidence. The updated guidelines recommend screening and appropriate treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women and in individuals undergoing endourological procedures associated with mucosal trauma. The guidelines recommend against screening and treatment in infants and children; healthy adults, including nonpregnant pre- and postmenopausal women; and patients with diabetes mellitus, long-term indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injuries. The guidelines also recommend against screening and treatment in patients undergoing nonurological surgery, patients who have had a kidney transplant more than one month prior, recipients of other solid organ transplants, or those with impaired voiding following spinal cord injury. Although delirium in older adults can be caused by a urinary tract infection, the guidelines recommend that patients with delirium and no urinary or systemic symptoms be assessed for other causes of delirium, rather than initiating treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria, because treatment has not been shown to have any beneficial effect on clinical outcomes.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria: prevalence, diagnosis, management, and current antimicrobial stewardship implementations [^0b870ac5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a common clinical condition that often leads to unnecessary treatment. It has been shown that incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria increases with age and are more prominent in women than men. In older women, the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is recorded to be more than 15%. This number increased up to 50% for those who reside in long-term care facilities. In most scenarios, asymptomatic bacteriuria does not lead to urinary tract infections, and therefore, antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria has not been shown to improve patient outcomes. In 2019, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) updated its asymptomatic bacteriuria management guidelines, which emphasized on the risks and benefits of treating the condition. Women who are pregnant should be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the first trimester and treated, if positive. Individuals who are undergoing endoscopic urologic procedures should be screened and treated appropriately for asymptomatic bacteriuria as well. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in individuals with diabetes, neutropenia, spinal cord injuries, indwelling urinary catheters, and so on has not been found to improve clinical outcomes. Furthermore, unnecessary treatment is often associated with unwanted consequences including but not limited to increased antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and increased health care cost. As a result, multiple antibiotic stewardship programs around the US have implemented protocols to appropriately reduce unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. It is important to appropriately screen and treat asymptomatic bacteriuria only when there is evidence of potential benefit.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^b49ee99b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) guideline — definition and scope: ASB is defined as the presence of 1 or more species of bacteria in urine at specified counts (≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL or ≥ 10⁸ CFU/L), irrespective of pyuria, and without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). The 2005 IDSA guideline recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures, and treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The current guideline reviews and updates the 2005 guideline, and the recommendations also consider populations not addressed previously, such as children and patients with solid organ transplants or neutropenia, noting that antimicrobial stewardship programs have identified management of ASB as an important opportunity for decreasing inappropriate antimicrobial use.

### Hydrophilic catheters for intermittent catheterization and occurrence of urinary tract infections. A retrospective comparative study in patients with spinal cord injury [^8d3b0d6c]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Bacteriuria is unavoidable in patients with long-term catheterization, where the rate of bacteriuria among the patients using PVC uncoated catheters in this study was 81.15% which was significantly higher among the ones using coated catheters. This was also observed by Perkash et al. where the bacteriuria rate was reported to be 86%. The rate of pyuria was also significantly higher in the uncoated catheter group. which is similar to the findings of Jeong et al. but does not correspond to the findings of De Ridder et al. who reported a significant difference in the rate of symptomatic UTI only but no significant different in terms of bacteriuria or pyuria.

It is worth mentioning that the IDSA and AUA guidelines recommend against screening for or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in those with SCI and short or long-term indwelling catheters. However, the signs and symptoms of UTI in those with SCI or other neurologic pathology are often subtle and different from those without neurologic pathology, therefore, clinicians should carefully assess signs and symptoms in this population.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^80041dc9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) clinical evaluation — history, physical examination, and red flags: No quality studies assess the utility and/or components of a history and physical examination; nevertheless, the Panel's consensus recommendation is that a careful history and physical examination is naturally important for appropriate evaluation and diagnosis. The initial assessment of LBP has a unique emphasis on 'ruling out' serious underlying conditions, and this process primarily relies upon the identification of red flags that in employed populations include trauma, history of cancer, immunosuppression, progressive neurological deficit, renal colic, and history of urinary tract infections. The absence of red flags and conditions generally rules out the need for specialist studies, referral, or inpatient care during the first 4 to 6 weeks. A comprehensive evaluation and documentation include history, prior treatment, vocation and avocational activities, functional level, medical and family history, social history including substance(s) use, review of systems, laboratory testing, and imaging studies. Evaluation using repeated end-range testing while monitoring for patterns of pain response determines the presence or absence of directional preference and pain centralization.

### Morbidity of urodynamic testing in patients with spinal cord injury: is antibiotic prophylaxis necessary? [^d718e534]. Spinal Cord (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective, non-randomized study.

Objectives

To assess the incidence of urinary tract infection after urodynamics in patients with spinal cord injury.

Setting

Outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Germany.

Methods

Urinary tract infection and clinical symptoms in 109 consecutive outpatients with spinal cord injury following urodynamic evaluation were studied.

Results

Data from 72 patients were evaluable. Of these, seven patients (9.7%) developed a significant urinary tract infection. Five of these were symptomatic. Pre-existing asymptomatic bacteriuria was not associated with a higher risk for post-interventional infection. The technique of the bladder management did not correlate with urinary tract infection rates.

Conclusion

In this study, symptomatic urinary tract infections after cystometry were not infrequent. Therefore, it seems that antibiotic prophylaxis cannot be omitted in patients with spinal cord injury undergoing urodynamic investigation.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^7a50dd9c]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — urine culture thresholds and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) diagnostic criteria. The National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research Consensus Statement in 1994 defined a UTI as > 10² CFU/mL for those who manage their bladder with CIC and > 10⁴ CFU/mL if using a condom catheter. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for CAUTI can be applied to NLUTD and identified three criteria: signs and symptoms compatible with UTI, no other identifiable source of infection, and a bacterial count > 10³ CFU/mL; the IDSA did not advocate using pyuria to determine whether antibiotics should be administered and stated that if pyuria was absent and there were other causes of symptoms, other than UTI, should be sought.

AUA/SUFU adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — recurrent UTI on clean intermittent catheterization: In NLUTD patients who perform clean intermittent catheterization with recurrent urinary tract infection, clinicians may offer oral antimicrobial prophylaxis to reduce the rate of urinary tract infections following shared decision-making and discussion regarding increased risk of antibiotic resistance (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). This statement was informed by one systematic review, two randomized controlled trials, and three observational studies reporting on rate of UTI, with serious risk of bias and evidence downgraded for inconsistency; the literature shows lack of uniformity in defining recurrent UTI, with variation in urinary symptoms, urine culture colony forming unit/mL threshold, differentiation of bacterial persistence versus reinfection and bacterial species, and number of UTIs per year.

Assess healthcare professional competency in catheter use, catheter care, and maintenance. – (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Educate HCP about the importance of urine culture stewardship and provide indications for urine cultures. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Consider requiring clinicians to identify an appropriate indication for urine culturing when placing an order for a urine culture. The indication should be supported by the literature,– and should be appropriate for the specific patient population. Include guideline-based remindersfor the specific circumstances. Below is a simple example of appropriate and inappropriate reasons to culture urine are referenced online on the CDC website, though several other lists are available in the literature specific to particular clinical settings (eg, ICU, emergency department, nursing home, and catheterized versus non-catheterized patients): Appropriate uses of urine culture include the following: Presence of symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI): Flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness Acute hematuria New pelvic discomfort New onset or worsening sepsis without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing Fever or altered mental status without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing In spinal-cord-injury patients and other highly complex patients (eg, patients with > 40% total body burn, recipients of kidney transplants with graft failure) symptoms may include increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, and/or sense of unease. Inappropriate uses of urine cultures include the following: Odorous, cloudy, or discolored urine in the absence of other localizing signs and symptoms Reflex urine cultures based on urinalysis results, such as pyuria, in the absence of other indications (absence of pyuria suggests diagnosis other than CAUTI) Urine culture to document response to therapy unless symptoms fail to resolve.
Provide training on appropriate collection of urine. Specimens should be collected and should arrive at the microbiology laboratory as soon as possible, preferably within an hour. If delay in transport to the laboratory is expected, samples should be refrigerated (no more than 24 hours) or collected in preservative urine transport tubes. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

Spinal cord injury, heavily sedated, or ventilated patients Surveillance criteria may not be equally sensitive for all patient populations. Patient populations in which the UTI criteria may not be as sensitive include spinal cord injury patients, those with brain injuries, and heavily sedated patients. NHSN constructed its surveillance definitions to balance sensitivity and specificity along with feasibility. A set of criteria that covered every subpopulation with high specificity and sensitivity would be too complicated to employ consistently across different facilities. NHSN recommends following the criteria as written in locations in which you are performing CAUTI surveillance. UTI Symptoms: urinary urgency, urinary frequency, and dysuria No, "with no other recognized cause" does not apply to these symptoms.

In the presence of a positive urine culture which may have been collected as a differential diagnosis for suspicion of UTI, it would be very rare that there is another associated cause for urinary urgency, urinary frequency and dysuria which are hallmark UTI symptoms. Yes. If the patient's urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria occurred when the indwelling urinary catheter was not in place at the time the patient experienced the urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria, then the urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria can be used as an element to meet NHSN UTI criteria, even on a day when the was in place for part of the day. Suprapubic tenderness and "With no other recognized cause" Pain documented as "abdominal pain" in the medical record is too general and not to be interpreted as suprapubic tenderness as there are many causes of abdominal pain.

Lower abdominal pain, or bladder or pelvic pain or discomfort are acceptable documentation to meet NHSN's UTI symptom of suprapubic tenderness. Ideally, clinical decisions about "with no other recognized cause" for the UTI signs/symptoms, suprapubic tenderness or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness, should be made by a physician and/or their designee in your organization who has access to a patient's entire medical record and clinical picture. The other recognized cause must occur during the current admission. Clinical judgment determination must be able to be defended and backed up by physician documentation and there should be clear rationale for that determination in the event the case is validated. Urine specimen source No. Any urine specimen submitted for culture is eligible for review to see if that urine specimen meets NHSN UTI criteria.

### Hydrophilic catheters for intermittent catheterization and occurrence of urinary tract infections. A retrospective comparative study in patients with spinal cord injury [^1dbe06ae]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the use of intermittent catheterization has improved the care of these patients, but infections still arise. The hydrophilic-coated catheters had superior beneficial clinical effects compared to the PVC uncoated catheters, where there were significantly fewer patients who experienced symptomatic UTIs in the hydrophilic-coated catheters group compared to the uncoated catheter group with almost 50% the patients using the hydrophilic-coated catheter group were free from symptomatic UTIs. Such findings may greatly impact the quality of life of SCI patients by reducing their risk of developing symptomatic UTIs. Our data demonstrated that male gender, old age patients, patients with longer SCI duration, and ASIA impairment scale C or more severe were associated with an increased risk of developing symptomatic UTI in SCI patients. Therefore, more attention could be given to this group while assessing and monitoring for UTI symptoms. Even though bacteriuria is inevitable in patients with long-term catheterization, however, treatment should not be started unless the clinical symptoms exist.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^f1bce9c7]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the utility of symptoms and signs in diagnosing UTI in older adult outpatients. Our search strategy was broad, in order to maximise chances of capture of relevant studies. We contacted several authors of studies to clarify details in the papers being screened for inclusion. Dual extraction of all data was performed. Data was extracted as fully as possible, providing gender specific data when possible. However, due to the breadth of the review, and given the difficulty of search terms in this area it is highly likely we have missed studies, especially unpublished studies. Whilst we were able to extract data for a wide range of symptoms and signs, due to variations in the way they were reported, meta-analysis was only possible for two symptoms.

Our results should be interpreted with caution as a number of the included studies were of poor quality, there was high heterogeneity between the included studies, and few symptoms and signs were assessed across more than one study. We postulate that differences in study design, the low quality of a number of the included studies and differences in definition of symptoms and signs may explain the observed heterogeneity. Furthermore, we assessed multiple independent symptoms and signs; having applied 95% confidence intervals, we might expect that 1 in 20 of our estimates might produce significant results as a result of chance.

A number of the studies were rated as 'high risk' across a number of the QUADAS-2 domains. However, we also recognise that in studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs, by their very nature, it is difficult to entirely eliminate subjectivity and a degree of bias. For example, incorporation bias is largely unavoidable because diagnoses of infections are often made taking into account symptoms and signs, as well as test results. Partly as a result of this as well as lack of standardisation of methodology, the feasibility of pooling results from such studies is restricted by significant heterogeneity. Insufficient studies were included within the meta-analysis to allow for meaningful subgroup analysis to be performed to explore the high heterogeneity.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults [^c34514de]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

A common dilemma in clinical medicine is whether to treat asymptomatic patients who present with bacteria in their urine. There are few scenarios in which antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteruria has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Because of increasing antimicrobial resistance, it is important not to treat patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria unless there is evidence of potential benefit. Women who are pregnant should be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the first trimester and treated, if positive. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with diabetes, older persons, patients with or without indwelling catheters, or patients with spinal cord injuries has not been found to improve outcomes.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — antibiotic stewardship rationale and culture dynamics. An argument for obtaining a urine culture is the ability to treat a UTI with culture-specific antibiotics and the importance of antibiotic stewardship, particularly as NLUTD patients may be at greater risk of harboring resistant organisms. In 93 SCI patients, multidrug resistance was found in 48% of strains with asymptomatic bacteriuria and 66.6% with symptomatic UTI. Among 52 NLUTD patients secondary to SCI followed with weekly urine cultures, there was an average 60% and 36% incidence of change in results for indwelling catheter and CIC, respectively. Over two years in 146 NLUTD patients, among 81 individuals with at least two positive cultures there was 55.8% concordance that decreased for each 30-day period between cultures (p = 0.02), while antibiotic sensitivity concordance was higher for ciprofloxacin (77.3%), nitrofurantoin (78.5%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (75%).

### Quantifying guideline-discordant intermittent catheterization in adults hospitalized with spinal cord injury: a retrospective cohort study [^b8b52a37]. Spinal Cord (2025). Medium credibility.

The incidence of UTI in our study cohort was about 12%, which is lower than the previously reported incidence rate ranging between 40–60%. This reduction may be attributed to the significant efforts healthcare systems have dedicated to UTI prevention, particularly those associated with urinary catheters. Many healthcare systems have implemented policies and procedures, such as early removal of indwelling catheters, aseptic insertion techniques, and regular monitoring of catheter use to mitigate UTI risks. These measures, along with staff education and adherence to infection control protocols, have been pivotal in reducing UTI rates. This difference could also result from the more stringent UTI definition in our study by requiring a combination of UTI diagnosis codes, positive urinary culture, and antibiotic use. Although the incidence of UTIs was slightly higher in the guideline-discordant CIC group compared to the guideline-concordant group (12.54% versus 10.42%), this difference was not statistically significant. This finding may suggest that while guideline-discordant CIC is prevalent, it may not directly translate to a significantly higher risk of UTIs within this study population. However, it's important to note that this finding was based on an unadjusted analysis. The low number of UTI events in our sample made it statistically challenging to fit a multivariate model that adjusted for relevant covariates (e.g. baseline health status, immunosuppressant use or concurrent urinary tract conditions) that is key for obtaining accurate point estimates. Therefore, this study serves as an initial step in understanding the relationship between guideline-discordant CIC and UTI risk. Future research should focus on conducting adjusted analyses when sample sizes allow, to further investigate the observed trend towards a higher UTI rate in the guideline-discordant group.

Outcome measures

As per the International Clinical Practice Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria was defined as having at least 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU) per mL of a single organism in the urine of a non-catheterized patient. Pyuria was defined as having positive leukocyte esterase on urine dipstick or ≥ 10 white blood cells per high-powered field (WBCs/hpf) on urine microscopy. Symptomatic UTI was defined as having a bacterial colony count of at least 10⁵ colony-forming units and at least one clinical symptom, such as fever, chills, cloudy urine, increased spasticity, or malaise and was reported as yes, or no after evaluating the criteria for every single case by the research physician, any recurrent UTI events were nor reported or included in the analysis. Positive urine culture in the absence of clinical symptoms was not considered a UTI.

Study variables

For both groups, socio-demographic data including age, and gender were collected using a predesigned case report form (CRF). Additionally, data related to SCI including the ASIA impairment scale, type of injury, and type of implant were also collected. Past clinical history of the patient was reported including comorbid conditions and drug history as well as the type of catheter used. All the patients' microbiology reports were collected from a microbiology laboratory that included bacterial type and strain. The incontinence nurse report was used to document the catheter type and UTI symptoms and the daily frequency of intermittent catheterization. UTI-related data were also collected including UTI symptoms, urinalysis, urine microscopy, urine culture, and susceptibility testing.

### Urinary tract infection in geriatric and institutionalized patients [^0cc44464]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The importance of urinary tract infection in elderly populations and some of the unique features in its evaluation and therapy are becoming better recognized. In elderly populations in the community there are concerns about increasing antimicrobial resistance in infecting organisms. In postmenopausal women, the importance of vaginal estrogen deficiency as a factor which promotes urinary tract infection is becoming increasingly recognized, leading to therapeutic strategies other than antimicrobials. For elderly residents of long term care facilities, urinary tract infection is very common, and most frequent in those with the greatest functional impairment. Whilst it is recognized that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated, the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in this population often presents a dilemma. In particular, the urine culture is useful only in excluding urinary tract infection, not in making a diagnosis of symptomatic infection. There has been a tendency to manage all clinical deterioration in long term care facility residents who have positive urine cultures as urinary tract infection, contributing to excess antimicrobial use and heightening the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Recently published guidelines and commentaries attempt to address this problem.

There are three systematic reviews that have evaluated this topic, with the first published in 2007 including four parallel group trials evaluating symptomatic UTI; due to heterogeneity, pooling of data could not be done, with heterogeneity arising from catheter type, catheterization technique (sterile versus clean), catheter usage (single versus multiple use), and UTI definition.

### Neurourologic dysfunction: evaluation, surveillance and therapy [^3fb36dc2]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Neurogenic bladder dysfunction results from a variety of neurologic pathologies and can lead to significant patient morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the evaluation, surveillance and management of patients with spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, spina bifida and Parkinson's disease.

Recent Findings

Recent studies of patients with neurogenic bladder have highlighted their risk for potentially preventable urologic complications ranging from renal failure to urinary tract infections. However, these same studies bring attention to the lack of compliance and consensus regarding the recommended evaluation of these high-risk patients.

Summary

Patients with neurovesical dysfunction must be followed at regular intervals to preserve upper tract function, maintain safe bladder pressures, prevent urinary tract infections and address continence. Future studies and guidelines are needed to direct the management of these complicated patients.

### Systematic review of urological followup after spinal cord injury [^6c82a482]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

There is no consensus on the appropriate urological followup of individuals after spinal cord injury but it is well known that they are at risk for renal deterioration, bladder cancer and stones. We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate evidence of urological screening in this population.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed 385 abstracts, of which 50 met study inclusion criteria. We rated evidence using American Academy of Neurology 2004 guidelines.

Results

A total of 12 articles evaluated urinary tract infection screening. Patient reported symptoms used to predict urinary tract infection yielded mixed results and urine dipstick testing had the same accuracy as microscopy. Routine urine culture was unnecessary in healthy, asymptomatic individuals with normal urinalysis. Urodynamics probably must be done periodically (6 articles) but there was no information on frequency. In 11 articles ultrasound was recommended as a useful, noninvasive and possibly cost-effective screening method. Renal scan was a good method for further testing, especially if ultrasound was positive (11 articles). Evidence was sufficient (11 articles) to recommend ultrasound of the urinary tract to detect urinary tract stones with good sensitivity but not plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters and bladder (2 articles). There was insufficient evidence to recommend urine markers or cytology for bladder cancer screening (9 articles).

Conclusions

Based on this review no definitive recommendations for screening can be made except routine renal ultrasound. Urodynamics are an important part of screening but the frequency is unclear. The optimum bladder cancer screening method has not been defined.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in women: Clinicians should obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity with each symptomatic acute cystitis episode prior to initiating treatment in patients with rUTIs. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) Although no randomized, prospective studies were identified that were specifically designed to document direct effects of procuring urinalysis and urine culture with antibiotic sensitivities prior to initiating treatment, the bulk of observational data supports the comprehensive laboratory diagnostic evaluation of each episode (e.g., urinalysis and standard urine culture), and every effort should be made to obtain urinalysis, microbiological identification, and antimicrobial resistance patterns to confirm the diagnosis and follow clinical responses to management; the routine prescription of antibiotics based on patient symptoms without microbiological evaluation should be discouraged, and independent evaluation of each symptomatic episode not only allows for the modification of treatment plans as needed to address atypical or antimicrobial-resistant bacteria but will also help to identify those patients with one of the numerous alternative diagnoses who would benefit from a different approach to treatment.

Routine urologic follow-up is an essential component in the care of spinal cord injury patients to prevent the consequences of acute obstructive processes and to preserve renal function

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common after SCI, with an incidence of 2.5 episodes per patient per year. It is important to recognise that UTI is a frequent source of septicaemia and has a mortality rate of approximately 15% in the SCI population. Imaging findings are similar to those seen in patients without SCI (Fig. 3). While there is an increased incidence of cystitis and pyelonephritis in persons with SCI, the absence of symptoms or presence of non-specific symptoms such as fever or autonomic dysreflexia, a manifestation of the loss of coordinated autonomic responses to demands on the heart rate and vascular tone, often leads to a delay in diagnosis. At the time of clinical presentation, the patient may have developed complications or widespread infection or sepsis. Figure 4 shows gas within the renal collecting system secondary to infection with a gas-forming organism or pyelitis. This serious infection requires urgent drainage and has a mortality rate approaching 20%. It is important to distinguish from emphysematous pyelonephritis, in which there is gas in the renal parenchyma, necessitating emergency nephrectomy, and which has a mortality rate of nearly 80% in this population. Epididymitis is a common complication in SCI, associated with voiding dysfunction and retrograde spread of organisms from the urinary bladder or prostate. At ultrasound, the epididymis is enlarged, hypoechoic and hypervascular (Fig. 5). The role of imaging in the evaluation of the genitourinary system in SCI patients is to assess for obstruction and to identify an underlying cause such as calculi; to evaluate for signs of active infection; to identify or exclude serious complications, such as renal or perinephric abscess or emphysematous pyelonephritis requiring emergency intervention; and to detect chronic changes such as scarring.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^bd248e36]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins and 50% to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections, while minimising antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values. We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives. Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesised that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of management using dipstick or clinical algorithms compared with the alternative management strategies (empirical antibiotic treatment, delayed prescribing, and targeted prescribing based on midstream urine results).

### Renal stone disease in spinal-cord-injured patients [^9d02cce4]. Journal of Endourology (2012). Low credibility.

Renal stone disease is common among patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). They frequently have recurrent stones, staghorn calculi, and bilateral stone disease. The potential risk factors for stones in the SCI population are lesion level, bladder management strategy, specific metabolic changes, and frequent urinary tract infections. There has been a reduction in struvite stones among these patients, likely as a result of advances in their urologic care. The clinical presentation of stone disease in patients with SCI may involve frequent urinary infections or urosepsis, and at the time of presentation patients may need emergency renal drainage. The proportion of patients who have their stones treated with different modalities is largely unknown. Shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) is commonly used to manage stones in patients with SCI, and there have been reports of stone-free rates of 50% to 70%. The literature suggests that the morbidity associated with percutaneous nephrolithotomy in these patients is considerable. Ureteroscopy is a common modality used in the general population to treat patients with upper tract stone disease. Traditional limitations of this procedure in patients with SCI have likely been overcome with new flexible scopes; however, the medical literature has not specifically reported on its use among patients with SCI.

Measures

Socio-demographic and baseline clinical data

The following data are registered: date of birth, gender, level of spinal cord injury, traumatic or medical causes of spinal cord injury, ASIA scale, time with indwelling urethral catheter or first-ever urethral catheterization, presence of diabetes mellitus and medical treatments history (including treatments that may increase risk of infection).

Primary outcome

The primary outcome is the development of a UTI related to urinary catheterization.

The patient must have at least one sign or symptom suggestive of UTI (see Table 2) with no other recognized cause and a positive urine culture with no more than 2 species of microorganisms. The study does not establish a specific threshold of uropathogen colony count criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and use each centre criteria.

Table 2
Signs and symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection

An UTI is considered associated with the use of study catheter if the specimen collection is performed at any time from catheterization procedure and 30 th day, catheter removal or catheter replacement (whichever occurs first).

It was considered that knowing if one type of urinary catheter or another may reduce symptomatic UTI is critical for clinical decisions. Many other studies considered asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) as primary outcome but ASB is very common in SCI patients, especially in those using indwelling catheters, and it appears to have no long-term squeals.

Secondary outcomes

Asymptomatic UTI, bacteremic UTI, and adverse events related to catheterization procedure are considered secondary outcomes.

Patients with an asymptomatic UTI are those with no signs or symptoms but with a positive urine culture with no more than 2 species of microorganisms in an specimen collected at any time from catheterization procedure and 30 th day, catheter removal or catheter replacement (whichever occurs first).

Patients with bacteremic UTI are those fulfilling the primary outcome and with a positive blood culture with at least 1 matching uropathogen microorganism to the urine culture.

The study measures the direct costs attributable to the use of intervention or control urinary catheters and their complications.

Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient using catheters with antiseptic silver alloy coating or standard catheters under study are also recollected.

### Intermittent catheterization: the devil is in the details [^07c842e6]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

D, the international community has engaged in strong debates on urinary tract infection (UTI) and re-use of catheters during the management of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) among individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). The most frequent complication of intermittent catheterization is UTI. There is no universally accepted definition of UTI in individuals with NLUTD, particularly in those with SCI. While UTI is an evolving term that varies between organizations, its potentially devastating effect is of no argument. UTI is costly to both the healthcare system and to individuals and can result in frequent hospitalization, sepsis, and even death.

In this respect, the Cochrane 2014 systematic review "Intermittent catheterisation for long-term bladder management" by Prieto and colleagues, became one of the leading documents that captured the minds and attention of clinicians around the world.

Although the authors did identify numerous limitations and risk for bias within the trials included in their review (p.8), they came to the conclusion that "there is still no convincing evidence that the incidence of UTI is affected by use of aseptic or clean technique, coated or uncoated catheters, single (sterile) or multiple-use (clean) catheters, self-catheterisation or catheterisation by others, or by any other strategy" (p.2). This has influenced clinicians' opinions and recommendations on intermittent catheterization over the last few years.

However, upon closer inspection of the review, we are confident that this conclusion requires revision.

Results

Baseline data

Study participants were recruited from April 2011 to February 2014.

Four-hundred and ninety-seven participants were approached via correspondence, telephone contact or in person. Three-hundred and fifty participants were interested and were screened for eligibility. Of the 350 participants screened, 10 did not have neurogenic bladder and 76 either did not want or could not cease excluded medications like antibiotics and their current probiotics (Fig. 2 — participant flow). Thirty-nine were excluded due to criteria such as complex bladder disturbance or chronic pressure ulcers.

Fig. 2
Consort participant flow diagram

All 207 participants who were randomised were analysed by original group assignment (intention to treat). Participants had a mean age of 49.1 years (range 19–82 years) and were predominantly male (79%). Forty-seven percent were tetraplegics and 51% had complete injury (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grade A). Sixty-percent of participants had a suprapubic or indwelling urethral catheter as part of neurogenic bladder management. The median time since SCI was 7 years (range 10 days to 61 years).

There were no clinically important differences between the treatment groups at baseline in the characteristics measured (Table 1).

Outcomes and estimation

Fifty-three of 207 participants met study endpoint UTI, as follows: 14 in Group 1, 8 in Group 2, 15 in Group 3 and 16 in Group 4. A further 20 participants had symptomatic but not study endpoint UTI; 5 of these had fever. Of the 53 study endpoint UTI participants, 22 had febrile UTIs. As a consequence of their endpoint UTI, 3 participants developed urosepsis, one participant was diagnosed with pyelonephritis and one participant was diagnosed with orchitis. All except one participant who met the study endpoint utilised catheters to empty their bladder. In terms of UTI recurrence in the 53 participants, 11% (6/53) had a subsequent study endpoint UTI and 6% (3/53) had a further two study endpoint UTIs within the 6-month duration of the study.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^770bf3d3]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

We also included some studies in which small numbers of participants were recorded as having cancer; these participants may have been immunosuppressed. However, we also recognise that a number of older people have malignancy as a co-morbidity. This might actually be more representative of real populations that clinicians treat.

We deliberately excluded studies conducted in A&E units in an attempt to make the results more relevant to primary care, and therefore may not be generalizable to emergency rooms. We included four studies that included a small proportion of the total participants under the age of 65 years. In one study,11% of participants were under 65 years of age, however, the author informed us that the two by two table data remained essentially unchanged after excluding them. Given the author's assertions we can be confident that this would not have biased the estimates obtained. Another studyhad an age range of 64–97 years, and in another, participants ranged from 64 to 102 years. In the study by Sundvall et al.the age range was 63–100 years; the author was able to confirm that there was only one participant aged 63 years, and all others were aged 65 years and above. For one study, we were unable to contact the authors to clarify the age of participants in the paper, however, due to the setting being a nursing home, we were confident that the majority, if not all, participants would be over 65 years.

We extracted episodic data into two by two tables when we were unable to extract participant data for one study. This may have led to over-estimation of the number of people with UTI, as the number of episodes of occurrence of a symptom or sign did not equate to the number of participants who experienced the symptom or sign. This is unlikely to have affected sensitivity, specificity or likelihood ratios. It may, however, have led to over-estimation of the positive predictive value and under-estimation of the negative predictive value. Finally, we excluded non-English studies and may therefore have omitted studies otherwise suitable for inclusion.

### The etiology of urinary tract infection: traditional and emerging pathogens [^7afb34b9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The microbial etiology of urinary infections has been regarded as well established and reasonably consistent. Escherichia coli remains the predominant uropathogen (80%) isolated in acute community-acquired uncomplicated infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (10% to 15%). Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus species, and enterococci infrequently cause uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis. The pathogens traditionally associated with UTI are changing many of their features, particularly because of antimicrobial resistance. The etiology of UTI is also affected by underlying host factors that complicate UTI, such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, or catheterization. Consequently, complicated UTI has a more diverse etiology than uncomplicated UTI, and organisms that rarely cause disease in healthy patients can cause significant disease in hosts with anatomic, metabolic, or immunologic underlying disease. The majority of community-acquired symptomatic UTIs in elderly women are caused by E coli. However, gram-positive organisms are common, and polymicrobial infections account for up to 1 in 3 infections in the elderly. In comparison, the most common organisms isolated in children with uncomplicated UTI are Enterobacteriaceae. Etiologic pathogens associated with UTI among patients with diabetes include Klebsiella spp. Group B streptococci, and Enterococcus spp., as well as E coli. Patients with spinal cord injuries commonly have E coli infections. Other common uropathogens include Pseudomonas and Proteus mirabilis. Recent advances in molecular biology may facilitate the identification of new etiologic agents for UTI. The need for accurate and updated population surveillance data is apparent, particularly in light of concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. This information will directly affect selection of empiric therapy for UTI.
