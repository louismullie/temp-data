## Question

medical management of kidney stones

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the medical management of kidney stones. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why medical management matters. Then, I should verify the universal foundation of therapy, especially fluids. Next, I will examine stone-specific pharmacologic strategies for calcium oxalate, uric acid, cystine, and struvite stones. After that, I need to check the role of empiric therapy when no metabolic abnormality is found. I will then review monitoring and follow-up, including when to repeat stone analysis. Finally, I should consider special populations, cost-effectiveness, and how recent evidence shifts practice, before summarizing a practical algorithm with caveats and shared decision-making points.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why medical management is essential. Nephrolithiasis is common, recurrent, and increasingly recognized as a systemic condition with links to CKD, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome, so prevention is not just about avoiding pain but also about mitigating downstream morbidity and cost, which justifies a structured medical approach beyond acute care [^f775f079] [^3974b74f].

> I need to ensure the universal foundation is solid before layering pharmacotherapy. Increased fluid intake to achieve at least 2.5 liters of urine per day is the cornerstone for all stone formers and reduces recurrence risk by roughly half in first-time stone formers, with observational signals that coffee, tea, wine, and orange juice associate with lower risk, whereas sugar-sweetened beverages associate with higher risk, though beverage-specific RCTs are limited [^231837aa] [^c1970abb] [^c351007a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diet alone solving everything. Dietary counseling should be individualized: for calcium oxalate stones, maintain normal dietary calcium (about 1,000–1,200 mg/day) with meals, limit sodium to ≤ 2,300 mg/day, and moderate oxalate if hyperoxaluria is present; for uric acid stones, reduce non-dairy animal protein and increase alkali load; for cystine stones, restrict sodium and protein and push fluids aggressively to dilute cystine below its solubility threshold, ideally with urine volume ≥ 4 liters/day in some cases [^c1b271ba] [^fc14bcc3] [^8f5321c6] [^4d100714].

> Next, I should review calcium oxalate stone pharmacotherapy. Thiazides reduce urinary calcium and have long been standard for hypercalciuria, but wait, let me verify the strength of evidence. Recent high-quality syntheses, including the NOSTONE randomized trial and updated meta-analyses, show thiazide monotherapy does not significantly reduce recurrence versus placebo, so I should be cautious and reserve thiazides for confirmed hypercalciuria or persistent recurrence despite fluids and diet, with close monitoring for metabolic adverse effects and periodic labs for hypokalemia and glucose intolerance [^24739719] [^e8d66864] [^2e6b55cc] [^dbf38d19]. Potassium citrate is indicated for hypocitraturia or low urine pH and reduces recurrence by about 75% in RCTs, and I should prefer potassium citrate over sodium citrate to avoid calciuric effects of sodium loading [^dd06417c] [^c1970abb]. Allopurinol is appropriate when hyperuricosuria coexists with calcium oxalate stones, with RCT data showing a roughly 40% reduction in recurrence in that subgroup, though it is not effective for normouricosuric calcium stone formers [^767994d2] [^c1970abb].

> I will now examine uric acid stone management. First-line therapy is urinary alkalinization to raise pH toward 6.0–6.5, typically with potassium citrate, because uric acid solubility rises exponentially with pH; allopurinol is not first-line if urine remains acidic, though it can be added if hyperuricosuria persists despite alkalinization, and I should double-check that we are not substituting allopurinol for alkali in acidic urine [^3df275a6] [^b9ddfa72].

> For cystine stones, I need to ensure a stepwise approach. Start with very high fluid intake, sodium restriction, and protein moderation to reduce cystine supersaturation; if stones persist, add urinary alkalinization to target pH around 7.0; and if still uncontrolled, escalate to cystine-binding thiols such as tiopronin, which is generally preferred over d-penicillamine due to better tolerability, with ongoing monitoring for hematologic and hepatic toxicity [^26136ab4] [^4d100714] [^dbf38d19].

> Struvite stones require a different mindset. I should confirm infection control as the priority: eradicate urease-producing organisms, monitor for reinfection with periodic cultures, and consider long-term suppressive antibiotics in select cases, because recurrence is driven by infection rather than metabolic factors alone [^40454ac0].

> But wait, what if no specific metabolic abnormality is identified or the patient declines testing. Empiric therapy can still be reasonable in recurrent calcium stone formers; potassium citrate is often favored first-line given efficacy and a favorable side-effect profile, while thiazides can be considered if hypercalciuria is suspected or recurrence continues despite alkali, acknowledging the weaker contemporary evidence base for thiazides and the need to reassess benefit–risk over time [^d1d62d3b] [^24739719].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up to close the loop. After initiating therapy, obtain a single 24-hour urine within about 6 months to assess adherence and biochemical response, then annually or more frequently if stone activity persists; periodically image to detect new stones or growth, tailoring modality to stone type and prior imaging; and if the patient is not responding as expected, repeat stone analysis because composition may have shifted, which would redirect therapy [^027f59f2] [^5877f32c] [^eaf0d37d] [^91b65cb4].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed. In children, most principles are extrapolated from adults, with ultrasound preferred for imaging and potassium citrate reasonable for hypocitraturia or uric acid stones; thiazides may be considered for persistent hypercalciuria, though pediatric RCTs are sparse, so shared decision-making and close follow-up are essential [^70d3b4ac]. In pregnancy, coordinate any pharmacologic or surgical intervention with obstetrics and favor noninvasive strategies when possible. In ADPKD, apply general population stone-prevention principles but individualize given anatomic complexity and higher obstruction risk, and consider centers of expertise for complicated cases [^7afdbd81] [^235d3ac3] [^840407f1].

> Let me consider cost-effectiveness to align choices with value. For a first stone, conservative therapy with fluids and diet is most cost-effective; for recurrent stones, empiric pharmacotherapy or a modified simple metabolic evaluation can be cost-equivalent depending on recurrence frequency, which supports selective metabolic testing rather than universal comprehensive workups in low-risk patients [^2b083ac0] [^e5b26658].

> Hold on, I should verify how recent evidence shifts practice. The NOSTONE trial and subsequent meta-analyses challenge routine thiazide use for recurrence prevention, so I should confirm hypercalciuria before prescribing and reassess efficacy and adverse effects within 1–2 years; conversely, alkali therapy remains well supported for hypocitraturia and uric acid stones, and allopurinol retains a niche for hyperuricosuric calcium oxalate formers, reinforcing the need for targeted rather than empiric pharmacotherapy whenever feasible [^24739719] [^e8d66864] [^dd06417c] [^767994d2].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. For all patients, start with fluids to ≥ 2.5 liters urine/day and diet counseling tailored to stone type; for recurrent calcium oxalate stones, add potassium citrate if hypocitraturia or low pH, thiazide only if hypercalciuria is confirmed, and allopurinol if hyperuricosuria coexists; for uric acid stones, prioritize alkalinization to pH 6.0–6.5 and add allopurinol if hyperuricosuria persists; for cystine stones, maximize fluids, restrict sodium and protein, alkalinize to pH ~7.0, and add tiopronin if needed; for struvite stones, focus on infection eradication and surveillance; throughout, monitor 24-hour urine at 6 months and yearly, image periodically, and repeat stone analysis if the course deviates from expectations, adjusting therapy accordingly [^231837aa] [^d1d62d3b] [^3df275a6] [^26136ab4] [^40454ac0] [^027f59f2] [^5877f32c] [^91b65cb4].

Medical management of kidney stones centers on **prevention of recurrence** through targeted dietary and pharmacologic strategies, guided by stone type and metabolic evaluation [^f775f079]. Universal measures include **high fluid intake** to achieve ≥ 2.5 L/day urine output [^231837aa] and **dietary sodium restriction** to ≤ 2,300 mg/day [^c1b271ba]; calcium intake should remain normal (1,000–1,200 mg/day) with meals to limit oxalate absorption [^fc14bcc3]. Pharmacologic therapy is tailored: thiazides for hypercalciuria [^2e6b55cc], potassium citrate for hypocitraturia or uric acid/cystine stones [^dd06417c] [^3df275a6], and allopurinol for hyperuricosuria [^767994d2]. For acute ureteral stones, alpha-blockers facilitate passage and reduce pain [^e58c2fae] [^2ccc4b45]. Regular follow-up with 24-hour urine testing and imaging is essential to monitor response and adjust therapy [^027f59f2] [^5877f32c] [^eaf0d37d].

---

## Dietary management

Dietary modifications are foundational and should be **individualized** based on stone type and metabolic profile [^5e158bee].

| **Dietary intervention** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Fluid intake | All stone formers | ≥ 2.5 L/day urine output [^231837aa] [^c351007a] |
| Sodium restriction | Calcium stone formers | ≤ 2,300 mg/day [^c1b271ba] |
| Calcium intake | Calcium oxalate stone formers | 1,000–1,200 mg/day with meals [^c1b271ba] [^fc14bcc3] |
| Oxalate restriction | Hyperoxaluria | Limit high-oxalate foods (e.g. nuts, spinach, rhubarb) [^fc14bcc3] |
| Protein restriction | Uric acid/cystine stone formers | Limit non-dairy animal protein [^8f5321c6] [^4d100714] |

---

## Pharmacologic management

Pharmacotherapy is selected based on **stone composition and metabolic abnormalities** [^f775f079].

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Mechanism** | **Dosage** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Thiazide diuretics | Hypercalciuria | Reduce urinary calcium | - HCTZ 25 mg BID or 50 mg daily <br/> - Chlorthalidone 25 mg daily <br/> - Indapamide 2.5 mg daily [^2e6b55cc] |
| Potassium citrate | - Hypocitraturia <br/> - Uric acid stones <br/> - Cystine stones | Alkalinize urine, increase citrate | 10–20 mEq TID with meals [^notfound] |
| Allopurinol | Hyperuricosuria | Reduce uric acid production | 100–300 mg daily [^notfound] |
| Tiopronin | Cystine stones | Cystine-binding thiol | 200–1,000 mg/day [^notfound] |

## Acute management of ureteral stones

Medical expulsive therapy (MET) with **alpha-blockers** (e.g. tamsulosin) is recommended for distal ureteral stones ≤ 10 mm to facilitate passage and reduce pain [^e58c2fae] [^5f22436f]. NSAIDs are **first-line for pain control**, with opioids reserved for refractory cases [^6a14fa8d] [^2903e195].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess adherence, metabolic response, and stone activity. Obtain a **24-hour urine** within 6 months of therapy initiation, then annually or as needed [^027f59f2] [^5877f32c]. Imaging (ultrasound or low-dose CT) should be performed periodically to detect new stones or growth [^eaf0d37d]. Repeat stone analysis is indicated if the clinical course changes or response is suboptimal [^91b65cb4].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Ultrasound is first-line imaging; avoid radiation. Coordinate care with obstetrics [^7afdbd81].
- **Children**: Management mirrors adults, with ultrasound preferred and dosing adjusted for weight [^70d3b4ac].
- **ADPKD**: Follow general population guidance, with individualized screening and multidisciplinary care [^235d3ac3] [^840407f1].

---

Medical management of kidney stones is a **multifaceted approach** that combines dietary changes, targeted pharmacotherapy, and regular monitoring to prevent recurrence and reduce morbidity [^f775f079].

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^d6e48b49]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, prevention and follow-up of adult patients with kidney stones based on the best available published literature.

Materials and Methods

The primary source of evidence for this guideline was the systematic review conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults. To augment and broaden the body of evidence in the AHRQ report, the AUA conducted supplementary searches for articles published from 2007 through 2012 that were systematically reviewed using a methodology developed a priori. In total, these sources yielded 46 studies that were used to form evidence-based guideline statements. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional statements were developed as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Results

Guideline statements were created to inform clinicians regarding the use of a screening evaluation for first-time and recurrent stone formers, the appropriate initiation of a metabolic evaluation in select patients and recommendations for the initiation and follow-up of medication and/or dietary measures in specific patients.

Conclusions

A variety of medications and dietary measures have been evaluated with greater or less rigor for their efficacy in reducing recurrence rates in stone formers. The guideline statements offered in this document provide a simple, evidence-based approach to identify high-risk or interested stone-forming patients for whom medical and dietary therapy based on metabolic testing and close follow-up is likely to be effective in reducing stone recurrence.

### Kidney stones: pathophysiology and medical management [^8a9dbb1c]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

The formation of stones in the urinary tract stems from a wide range of underlying disorders. That clinicians look for the underlying causes for nephrolithiasis is imperative to direct management. There are many advances in genetics, pathophysiology, diagnostic imaging, medical treatment, medical prevention, and surgical intervention of nephrolithiasis. Here, I provide a brief general background and focus mainly on pathophysiology and medical treatment of kidney stones. Although important advances have been made in understanding nephrolithiasis from single gene defects, the understanding of polygenetic causes of kidney stones is still largely elusive. A substantial proportion of data that resulted in new methods of treatment and prevention, which can be empirical or definitive, has focused on urinary luminal chemical composition of the precipitating solutes. Manipulation of inhibitors and epithelial factors is important and needs further investigation. Advances in the management of nephrolithiasis depend on combined efforts of clinicians and scientists to understand the pathophysiology.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^5475a936]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — epidemiology and risk factors note that the overall prevalence of self-reported kidney stones from 2007–2010 was 8.8%, with a higher prevalence among men (10.6%) than women (7.1%), representing a 70% increase over the last reported prevalence (5.2%) derived from an NHANES sample (1988–1994). Although historically kidney stones have occurred more commonly in men than women, by any number of metrics the gender gap is closing, and the impact of obesity was found to be greater in women than men. Overweight/obesity, hypertension and diabetes have all been shown to be associated with an increased risk of stone disease, and diet and lifestyle affect the risk of developing stones. Some drug therapies have been shown to be superior to placebo, or no-treatment control groups, in randomized trials, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating drug treatments are relatively sparse; diet therapy has never been compared head-to-head with pharmacologic therapy, so recommendations incorporate both diet therapy and pharmacotherapy until the superiority of one over the other can be demonstrated.

American Urological Association guideline scope and limitations — these guidelines "do not necessarily establish the standard of care" and "represent not absolute mandates but provisional proposals for treatment," and "the guidelines do not pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases." "Conformance with any clinical guideline does not guarantee a successful outcome." The text may include information about certain drug uses "off label," and the AUA "urges strict compliance with all government regulations and protocols for prescription and use of these substances," with physicians encouraged to follow all prescribing information.

### Medical management of renal stones [^3974b74f]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The prevalence of kidney stones is increasing in industrialized nations, resulting in a corresponding rise in economic burden. Nephrolithiasis is now recognized as both a chronic and systemic condition, which further underscores the impact of the disease. Diet and environment play an important role in stone disease, presumably by modulating urine composition. Dietary modification as a preventive treatment to decrease lithogenic risk factors and prevent stone recurrence has gained interest because of its potential to be safer and more economical than drug treatment. However, not all abnormalities are likely to be amenable to dietary therapy, and in some cases drugs are necessary to reduce the risk of stone formation. Unfortunately, no new drugs have been developed for stone prevention since the 1980s when potassium citrate was introduced, perhaps because the long observation period needed to demonstrate efficacy discourages investigators from embarking on clinical trials. Nonetheless, effective established treatment regimens are currently available for stone prevention.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^b9ddfa72]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — first-line therapy for uric acid stones states that clinicians should not routinely offer allopurinol as first-line therapy to patients with uric acid stones (Expert Opinion). Reduction of urinary uric acid excretion with the use of allopurinol in patients with uric acid stones will not prevent stones in those with unduly acidic urine, and therefore first-line therapy for patients with uric acid stones is alkalinization of the urine with potassium citrate.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part II: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^85c7ff25]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones (AUA Guideline) abstract — scope and methods: The guideline covers the surgical management of patients with ureteral and/or kidney stones and is intended for clinicians evaluating and managing patients, and the summary represents Part II of the three-part series. The systematic review was conducted in two planned stages — first searching for systematic reviews and then for primary literature — using OVID to search MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles evaluating surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones, with databases searched for studies published from January 2000 through May 2025 (week 20) and with reference lists of included systematic reviews and primary literature scanned. The Panel addressed adult and pediatric patients with ureteral and/or kidney stones for whom surgical intervention may be indicated, with each statement addressing a specific patient scenario in which the choice of surgical intervention was reviewed and justified, and additionally reviewed and analyzed the utility of specific surgical techniques, technologies, or medications aimed at improving patient outcomes. Conclusions emphasize that selection of optimal treatment modalities is determined by patient factors, urinary tract anatomy, and stone characteristics and is guided by shared decision-making that takes into account patient goals and preferences, resource availability, and physician expertise, and the guideline serves as a resource to provide the best available evidence on which to base discussions in a shared decision-making process to arrive at appropriate treatment decisions.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^5877f32c]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — ongoing metabolic monitoring states that after the initial follow-up, clinicians should obtain a single 24-hour urine specimen annually or with greater frequency, depending on stone activity, to assess patient adherence and metabolic response (Expert Opinion), and if patients remain stone free for an extended period of time on their treatment regimen, discontinuation of follow-up testing may be considered.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^d1d62d3b]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — empiric therapy when no metabolic abnormality persists states that clinicians should offer thiazide diuretics and/or potassium citrate to patients with recurrent calcium stones in whom other metabolic abnormalities are absent or have been appropriately addressed and stone formation persists (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). It adds that thiazides and potassium citrate therapy have been shown to prevent recurrent stones in patients with normal range urinary calcium and citrate, respectively, and therefore it may be appropriate to utilize these therapies for patients with recurrent stones who do not demonstrate specific urinary abnormalities, with potassium citrate possibly preferred first-line in patients with no identified risk factors for nephrolithiasis given its relatively low side effect profile.

### Kidney stone pathophysiology, evaluation and management: core curriculum 2023 [^c4b5d8b2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Kidney stone disease, also known as nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis, is a disorder in which urinary solutes precipitate to form aggregates of crystalline material in the urinary space. The incidence of nephrolithiasis has been increasing, and the demographics have been evolving. Once viewed as a limited disease with intermittent exacerbations that are simply managed by urologists, nephrolithiasis is now recognized as a complex condition requiring thorough evaluation and multifaceted care. Kidney stones are frequently manifestations of underlying systemic medical conditions such as the metabolic syndrome, genetic disorders, or endocrinopathies. Analysis of urine chemistries and stone composition provide a window into pathogenesis and direct ancillary studies to uncover underlying diseases. These studies allow providers to devise individualized strategies to limit future stone events. Given its complexity, kidney stone disease is best addressed by a team led by nephrologists and urologists with input from multiple other health professionals including dietitians, endocrinologists, interventional radiologists, and endocrine surgeons. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we provide a case-based overview of nephrolithiasis, divided by the individual stone types. The reader will gain a pragmatic understanding of the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of this condition.

### Identifying and integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in clinical practice guidelines on managing kidney stones [^a0cb211d]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Kidney stones have a substantial psychosocial impact, with recurring kidney stone events resulting in limitations to life participation. However, the impacts may be effectively managed by empowering people with kidney stones with consistent and clear guidance on management, particularly nutrition, and acknowledging and addressing the wide-reaching effects of kidney stone related pain. The involvement of people with kidney stones in developing guidelines is critical to identifying the topics and outcomes to ensure their relevance, ultimately enhancing the quality of care and outcomes through supporting self-management of kidney stones.

### Identifying and integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in clinical practice guidelines on managing kidney stones [^4651f80f]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Kidney stones affect about 10% of the adult population, and the incidence of kidney stones is increasing worldwide. About 35% to 50% of people with kidney stones experience recurrence within five years. Kidney stones cause debilitating symptoms, such as vomiting, nausea and pain. Emergency departments are burdened by the presentation of acute pain due to kidney stones, with one of the highest rates of representation at these services. People with kidney stones have reported impaired quality of life, with kidney stones recurrence causing anxiety and low mood. Kidney stones can also limit life participation through impacts on the ability to work, leading to financial concerns and family impacts.

Whilst there are guidelines on the management of kidney stones, they may not address the areas that are relevant to people who have had kidney stones. Integrating patient perspectives and priorities in clinical practice guidelines is now widely advocated to ensure they are meaningful and relevant to patients. The Caring for Australians and New ZealandeRs with kidney Impairment (CARI) Guidelines have also demonstrated that the involvement of people with lived experience of disease broadens the scope of clinical practice guidelines and enhances their relevance and translation.

We convened workshops to identify people with kidney stones perspectives on topics and outcomes to integrate into the CARI Guidelines update on kidney stones management. We also aimed to describe reasons for their selection of topics and outcomes and discuss how their input was integrated by the guideline Working Group into the guideline.

### Kidney stone disease: risk factors, pathophysiology and management [^f775f079]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is the most common health condition affecting the kidney and urinary tract and constitutes a major global health-care problem. The prevalence of nephrolithiasis has increased substantially over the past five decades, irrespective of age, sex or ethnicity. Kidney stones cause substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life and enormous health-care expenditure, largely due to their frequent recurrence. Furthermore, nephrolithiasis is now recognized as a systemic condition associated with increased risks of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and low bone mass. Nephrolithiasis exhibits marked pathophysiological heterogeneity. Dietary and environmental exposures interact with genetic predisposition to shape individual disease risk. Calcium oxalate stones are most prevalent, commonly driven by hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia and low urine volume, whereas the formation of uric acid and calcium phosphate stones is commonly linked to urinary pH. A comprehensive clinical evaluation can uncover underlying metabolic abnormalities, distinguish idiopathic, secondary and Mendelian forms of nephrolithiasis, identify systemic disease associations and guide therapy. Recurrence prevention requires individualized strategies that combine dietary and pharmacological interventions. For established stones, surgical management is effective, with ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy achieving high stone-free rates. Despite its considerable clinical and societal burden, nephrolithiasis remains under-recognized, underserved and under-researched. Greater awareness and investments in research, innovation and education are urgently needed.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^eaf0d37d]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — imaging surveillance advises that clinicians should periodically obtain follow-up imaging studies to assess for stone growth or new stone formation based on stone activity (plain abdominal imaging, renal ultrasonography or low dose computerized tomography) (Expert Opinion), noting that plain radiography provides an acceptable assessment of stone activity in most patients with radiopaque stones, while renal ultrasonography is preferred for most patients with radiolucent stones, and that a one-year imaging interval is recommended for stable patients, but this may be tailored based on stone activity or clinical signs.

AUA medical management of kidney stones guideline — screening evaluation in newly diagnosed kidney or ureteral stones states: A clinician should perform a screening evaluation consisting of a detailed medical and dietary history, serum chemistries and urinalysis on a patient newly diagnosed with kidney or ureteral stones (Clinical Principle). A detailed history should elicit from the patient any medical conditions, dietary habits or medications that predispose to stone disease; nutritional factors associated with stone disease include calcium intake below or significantly above the recommended dietary allowance, low fluid intake, high sodium intake, limited intake of fruits and vegetables and high intake of animal-derived purines; and patients should be queried regarding their regular use of any stone-provoking medications or supplements. Dietary history should elicit from the patient their average daily intake of fluids (amount and specific beverages), protein (types and amounts), calcium, sodium, high oxalate-containing foods, fruits and vegetables and over-the-counter supplements. Serum chemistries should include electrolytes, calcium, creatinine and uric acid that may suggest underlying medical conditions associated with stone disease. Urinalysis should include both dipstick and microscopic evaluation to assess urine pH and indicators of infection and to identify crystals pathognomonic of stone type, and urine culture should be obtained in patients with a urinalysis suggestive of urinary tract infection or in patients with recurrent UTIs.

A careful and individualized evaluation of risk factors is a fundamental part of the management of patients with urinary tract stone disease. Identification and correction of important abnormalities provide the basis for designing an efficient and rational treatment program, aiming at an arrest or at least reduction of recurrent stone formation. It is beyond doubt that appropriate therapeutic steps in this regard are of great benefit for the patient. It needs to be emphasized, however, that no success will be obtained unless the patient is willing and able to follow the ensuing dietary recommendations and medical advice.

### Clinical review. kidney stones 2012: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^819aa9f4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

The pathogenetic mechanisms of kidney stone formation are complex and involve both metabolic and environmental risk factors. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney stone disease.

Evidence Acquisition and Synthesis

Both original and review articles were found via PubMed search reporting on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of kidney stones. These resources were integrated with the authors' knowledge of the field.

Conclusion

Nephrolithiasis remains a major economic and health burden worldwide. Nephrolithiasis is considered a systemic disorder associated with chronic kidney disease, bone loss and fractures, increased risk of coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome. Further understanding of the pathophysiological link between nephrolithiasis and these systemic disorders is necessary for the development of new therapeutic options.

### Guidelines on urolithiasis [^d8568e20]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

A project was initiated by the Health Care Office of the European Association of Urology in order to formulate common recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of patients with urolithiasis. The basic task for the working group therefore was to extract and evaluate evidence from the literature in order to reach a consensus on how these patients could best be managed.

Methods

Extensive reviews of the literature together with a thorough and detailed discussion of the various topics, by a working group including of experts from several European countries, provided the basis for a consensus overview of urolithiasis and its management.

Results and Conclusions

Recommendations are given for the management of patients with acute stone colic and for active removal of stones from the ureter and kidney. Moreover, the principles for risk evaluation of patients with recurrent stone formation and appropriate recurrence preventive treatment are given.

The medical and surgical management of kidney stones is one of the most common functions of the urologist. Management choices are often nuanced, involving the decision to embark on one surgical plan among several options. As the wider medical community critically evaluates the care we provide to an increasingly diverse population, it will be important to examine patient outcomes with a particular focus on ensuring equitable care. This review examines the influence of social parameters on the care of kidney stone patients. The dearth of literature in this area warrants rigorous studies on the relationship between race as well as socioeconomic status and the management of kidney stone disease.

AUA 2026 kidney and ureteral stones — medical expulsive therapy (MET) for middle/proximal ureter: For adult patients with ≤ 10 mm stones in the middle and proximal ureter, clinicians may offer MET with alpha-adrenergic blockers for approximately 30 days to facilitate stone passage, designated as a Conditional Recommendation with Evidence Level: Grade B. A meta-analysis cited here found no significant difference in rates of spontaneous stone expulsion between MET and control groups for these locations, and stratified outcomes by stone location should be interpreted with caution due to few studies. The Panel concluded that despite lack of benefit for middle/proximal ureter stones, the safety and success of MET for distal ureter stones make it reasonable to consider this adjuvant pharmacotherapy for ureteral stones at all locations.

Kidney stone prevention evidence and implementation — both dietary manipulation and medications such as thiazides, allopurinol and citrate have "been shown to have efficacy in kidney stone prevention," although "the relative merits of diet and medications have never been compared head-to-head." The effort to prevent stones "needs to be broadened to other populations of practitioners," as "Primary care practitioners and physician extenders are adept at counseling weight loss, exercise and smoking cessation," and "Implementation of stone prevention regimens could also be extended to emergency rooms and primary care offices." Overall, "Strong evidence from an admittedly low number of clinical trials demonstrates that stones are indeed preventable."

### Medical management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: a systematic review for an American College of Physicians clinical guideline [^c1970abb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Optimum management to prevent recurrent kidney stones is uncertain.

Purpose

To evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent recurrent kidney stones.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane, and other databases through September 2012 and reference lists of systematic reviews and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).

Study Selection

28 English-language RCTs that studied treatments to prevent recurrent kidney stones and reported stone outcomes.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted data, a second checked accuracy, and 2 independently rated quality and graded strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

In patients with 1 past calcium stone, low-strength evidence showed that increased fluid intake halved recurrent composite stone risk compared with no treatment (relative risk [RR], 0.45 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.84]). Low-strength evidence showed that reducing soft-drink consumption decreased recurrent symptomatic stone risk (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.98]). In patients with multiple past calcium stones, most of whom were receiving increased fluid intake, moderate-strength evidence showed that thiazides (RR, 0.52 [CI, 0.39 to 0.69]), citrates (RR, 0.25 [CI, 0.14 to 0.44]), and allopurinol (RR, 0.59 [CI, 0.42 to 0.84]) each further reduced composite stone recurrence risk compared with placebo or control, although the benefit from allopurinol seemed limited to patients with baseline hyperuricemia or hyperuricosuria. Other baseline biochemistry measures did not allow prediction of treatment efficacy. Low-strength evidence showed that neither citrate nor allopurinol combined with thiazide was superior to thiazide alone. There were few withdrawals among patients with increased fluid intake, many among those with other dietary interventions and more among those who received thiazide and citrate than among control patients. Reporting of adverse events was poor.

Limitations

Most trial participants had idiopathic calcium stones. Nearly all studies reported a composite (including asymptomatic) stone recurrence outcome.

Conclusion

In patients with 1 past calcium stone, increased fluid intake reduced recurrence risk. In patients with multiple past calcium stones, addition of thiazide, citrate, or allopurinol further reduced risk.

### Medical treatment of urinary stones [^63e1808c]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To identify the latest progression on medical treatment of urinary stones.

Recent Findings

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be the preferred analgesic option for patients presenting to the emergency department with renal colic. A-blockers could be of patient benefit when used for distal ureteral stones more than 5mm in size. However, the quality of the randomized controlled studies on medical expulsive therapy (MET) is still low based on the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) criteria. MET should be used with caution in children and pregnant women. In patients with renal stones, the evaluation of the comorbidities of developing chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is mandatory. It is highly recommended to follow the European Association of Urology Urolithiasis Guidelines Panel Diagnostic and Therapeutic algorithms to prevent stone recurrence.

Summary

Medical treatment of urinary stone disease should be supported by well designed higher level of evidence clinical research.

### Kidney stones: treatment and prevention [^2903e195]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Kidney stones are a common disorder, with an annual incidence of eight cases per 1,000 adults. During an episode of renal colic, the first priority is to rule out conditions requiring immediate referral to an emergency department, then to alleviate pain, preferably with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The diagnostic workup consists of urinalysis, urine culture, and imaging to confirm the diagnosis and assess for conditions requiring active stone removal, such as urinary infection or a stone larger than 10 mm. Conservative management consists of pain control, medical expulsive therapy with an alpha blocker, and follow-up imaging within 14 days to monitor stone position and assess for hydronephrosis. Asymptomatic kidney stones should be followed with serial imaging, and should be removed in case of growth, symptoms, urinary obstruction, recurrent infections, or lack of access to health care. All patients with kidney stones should be screened for risk of stone recurrence with medical history, basic laboratory evaluation, and imaging. Lifestyle modifications such as increased fluid intake should be recommended for all patients, and thiazide diuretics, allopurinol, or citrates should be prescribed for patients with recurrent calcium stones. Patients at high risk of stone recurrence should be referred for additional metabolic assessment, which can serve as a basis for tailored preventive measures.

It further notes that first-line therapy for patients with cystine stones is increased fluid intake, restriction of sodium and protein intake, and urinary alkalinization, and if these modifications are not sufficient, cystine-binding thiol drugs constitute the next line of therapy, with tiopronin possibly more effective and associated with fewer adverse events than d-penicillamine and should be considered first.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of urolithiasis [^6a14fa8d]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

The European Association of Urology urolithiasis guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of urinary stone disease. Given the complexity and variability of stone formation, individualised patient management is emphasised.

Methods

The guidelines incorporate evidence from the latest research and focus on risk assessment, imaging techniques, pharmacological management, and surgical interventions. A research librarian conducted literature searches for urolithiasis in the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase databases via Dialog-Datastar. The strength of recommendations is also rated.

Key Findings and Limitations

Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical history, biochemical evaluation, and imaging, with ultrasound as the first-line modality and low-dose computed tomography as the gold standard for precise stone assessment. Stone composition and burden influence treatment decisions with algorithms primarily based on stone size, location, and composition. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended for first-line pain management, with opioids reserved as a secondary option. Medical expulsive therapy with α-blockers may be considered for selected patients with ureteral stones. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy remain the primary intervention modalities, with selection based on stone characteristics and patient factors. Advances in multiplanar imaging have improved assessment of the stone burden, although further research is needed to refine predictive models. Genetic testing is recommended for high-risk patients to guide personalised treatment.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

The guidelines provide a framework for clinical decision-making while acknowledging the need for continued advances in urolithiasis.

### Evaluation and medical management of kidney stones in children [^70d3b4ac]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

We review the current literature on the diagnostic evaluation and dietary and pharmacological management of children with nephrolithiasis.

Materials and Methods

We searched MEDLINE(®), Embase(®) and the Cochrane Library from their inceptions to March 2014 for published articles in English on kidney stones and therapy in children 0 to 18 years old. Based on review of the titles and abstracts, 110 of the 1,014 articles (11%) were potentially relevant to the diagnostic evaluation and medical management of nephrolithiasis in children. We summarized this literature and drew on studies performed in adult populations to augment areas in which no studies of sufficient quality have been performed in children, and to highlight areas in need of research.

Results

During the last 25 years the incidence of nephrolithiasis in children has increased by approximately 6% to 10% annually and is now 50 per 100,000 adolescents. Kidney stones that form during childhood have a similar composition to those that form in adulthood. Approximately 75% to 80% of stones are composed of predominantly calcium oxalate, 5% to 10% are predominantly calcium phosphate, 10% to 20% are struvite and 5% are pure uric acid. The recurrence rate of nephrolithiasis in patients with stones that form during childhood is poorly defined. Ultrasound should be used as the initial imaging study to evaluate children with suspected nephrolithiasis, with noncontrast computerized tomography reserved for those in whom ultrasound is nondiagnostic and the suspicion of nephrolithiasis remains high. Current treatment strategies for children with kidney stone disease are based largely on extrapolation of studies performed in adult stone formers and single institution cohort or case series studies of children. Tamsulosin likely increases the spontaneous passage of ureteral stones in children. Increased water intake and reduction of salt consumption should be recommended for all children with a history of kidney stones. Potassium citrate is a potentially effective medication for children with calcium oxalate stones and concomitant hypocitraturia, as well as children with uric acid stones. However, long-term compliance with therapy and the effect on decreasing stone recurrence in children are unknown. Based largely on efficacy in adult populations, thiazide diuretics should be considered in the treatment of children with calcium based stones and persistent hypercalciuria refractory to reductions in salt intake.

Conclusions

The incidence of kidney stone disease in children is increasing, yet few randomized clinical trials or high quality observational studies have assessed whether dietary or pharmacological interventions decrease the recurrence of kidney stones in children. Collaborative efforts and randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of alternative treatments for children with nephrolithiasis, particularly those with calcium oxalate stones and concomitant hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia. Additional areas in need of study are the optimal length of time for a trial of stone passage in children, the cost-effectiveness of medical expulsive therapy vs analgesics alone, and the size and location of stones for which medical expulsive therapy is most effective.

### When is medical prophylaxis cost-effective for recurrent calcium stones? [^e5b26658]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Medical management is generally recommended for recurrent calcium stones to prevent future episodes. However, in this era of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and outpatient ureteroscopy it is not known whether medical prophylaxis is more cost-effective than treatment of recurrent stone episodes. The cost of medical prophylaxis was compared with the cost of clinically managing recurrent stone episodes, and the stone recurrence rate without prophylaxis (stone frequency) at which these 2 treatment approaches became cost equivalent was determined.

Materials and Methods

An international cost survey was conducted in 10 countries to compare costs of medical prophylaxis and managing recurrent acute stone episodes. Costs of an acute stone episode included an emergency room visit, associated radiographic imaging to confirm diagnosis of a symptomatic stone and outpatient treatment of upper urinary tract stones that did not pass spontaneously. Costs of medical management included an initial limited metabolic evaluation, drug therapy, a followup office visit every 6 months that included a 24-hour urinalysis and radiographic imaging of the kidneys, ureters and bladder once a year.

Results

Costs of medical prophylaxis and managing an acute stone episode varied significantly from country to country. The stone frequency at which costs of these management options became equivalent ranged from 0.3 to 4 stone episodes a year.

Conclusions

Medical management of a first stone episode is not cost-effective. Cost analysis should be individualized for specific health care plans to determine which practice patterns are most cost-effective for a particular patient with recurrent calcium stone formation.

AUA guideline — cystine stones dietary and fluid/sodium goals: Clinicians should counsel patients with cystine stones to limit sodium and protein intake (Expert Opinion). The target for urine volume is typically higher than that recommended to other stone formers because of the need to decrease urinary cystine concentration below 250 mg/L, and oral intake of at least four liters per day is often required to meet this goal. A reasonable goal for sodium intake in individuals with cystinuria is 100 mEq (2,300 mg) or less daily.

### Leave no stone unturned: defining recurrence in kidney stone formers [^8719bfaf]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Established guidelines provide recommendations on the management of kidney stones to prevent recurrence. However, clear and clinically useful terminology for recurrence of kidney stones is needed. This review describes the various manifestations of kidney stone recurrence and the reported rates of kidney stone recurrence in various clinical settings.

Recent Findings

Kidney stone recurrence has a wide range of symptomatic and radiographic presentations. Symptomatic recurrence may include characteristic symptoms of stone passage via the ureter (renal colic and gross hematuria). This may be self-managed or result in clinical care, with or without confirmation of an obstructing stone on imaging. Radiographic recurrence has been variably defined as new stone formation, stone growth, or stone disappearance (from passage with or without symptoms). Studies have used inconsistent definitions of recurrence, and recurrence rates vary substantially. Stone free rates and residual stone fragment size after surgical interventions are useful predictors of symptomatic recurrence.

Summary

The recurrence rate of kidney stones has been assessed in stone formers from sub-specialty clinics, the general community, and clinical trials. The definition of recurrence is quite heterogenous between studies, but the rate of recurrence generally increases as more manifestations are included in the definition.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^235d3ac3]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Nephrolithiasis in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) — people should be asked about prior history of kidney stones with medical records reviewed, and screening for kidney stones in those with no history should be individualized. People with ADPKD and known kidney stones should undergo 24-hour urinary testing for lithogenic risk factors, serial kidney imaging studies to assess stone burden, and analysis of their kidney stones if feasible. The Work Group agrees that statements from the Canadian Urological Association Guideline for the general population apply to people with ADPKD: all stone formers should be counselled to achieve a daily urine output of 2.5 l (2B); stone disease highly correlates with obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome and patients should be counselled that proper management of these conditions may reduce their future stone risk (2D); and when possible, specific dietary assessments and recommendations should be made with the involvement of a registered dietitian (3C). Medical treatment of recurrent kidney stones in people with ADPKD should be the same as in the general population, and because obstructing kidney stones are more challenging to treat in people with ADPKD, they should be managed by centers of expertise.

Non-obstructing kidney stones with flank pain — elective surgery: For adult patients with flank pain and non-obstructing kidney stones on the ipsilateral side who have no other identifiable source of pain, clinicians may offer elective surgical treatment (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). The relationship between non-obstructing kidney stones and pain remains uncertain, and several studies have shown a reduction in pain for patients undergoing surgery for this indication; accordingly, the Panel believes that patients with pain and non-obstructing kidney stones, which would otherwise be left untreated, may be offered surgical intervention when the pain is consistent with stone-related symptoms and other causes have been reasonably excluded, and clinicians should engage in shared decision-making with patients.

The incidence of renal stones in adults has increased significantly over time. Although published evidence is somewhat limited, during the last 10 years, there have been reports of 4-fold increase in the number of children evaluated for nephrolithiasis, and of those, a 7-fold increase in diagnosis of stone disease. The etiology of stone formation has shifted over time, with a transition from infectious causes to metabolic causes. It was our goal in this review of the literature on pediatric renal stone disease to further highlight the changing epidemiology and etiology as well as provide a framework for appropriate clinical evaluation and use of diagnostic tools when approaching a patient with suspected renal stone disease. We also provide guidance regarding treatment and prevention of renal stone disease in children.

### Pathophysiology and management of calcium stones [^68619c70]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a common disorder that accounts for significant cost, morbidity, and loss of work. There is a one in eight lifetime chance of being diagnosed with urinary stones. Calcium is the most common component of renal stones in individuals in industrialized nations. Calcium stones form as a result of a variety of environmental and metabolic abnormalities that change the urinary environment and increase supersaturation of stone-forming salts. Understanding the pathophysiology of stone disease can help direct treatment toward correction of the underlying abnormalities. Current medical and dietary therapeutic regimens have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of recurrent stone formation.

Struggling to obtain individualised care

Participants felt that the management strategy for preventing stone recurrence was generic and did not account for their individual context and underlying diagnosis. They suggested that stone analysis and metabolic evaluation should be completed so clinicians could tailor the management strategy according to their specific types of kidney stone. They believed that evaluating the metabolic cause and the stone type was not common practice and was often only offered after stone removal.

It's the process of going through and analysing why the stones came about. In my case, it's only after they did the surgery and took it out they could identify them as calcium oxalate stones… (Male, 60–69 years old, Auckland)

Participants struggled to find the 'right' people to tailor treatment to prevent kidney stones. They stated that referral pathways across medical specialities and dietetics were vital to ensure individualised nutrition and pharmacological therapy to prevent the recurrence of kidney stones. Some participants noted the poor communication between public and private providers and across healthcare disciplines. For example, a participant stated that urologists never passed on information after their stone removal procedures to other medical specialists. Particularly back to primary care, which limited the ability to make changes to their diet and lifestyle to self-manage and prevent reoccurring kidney stones.

### Medical management of common urinary calculi [^1d637e6f]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a common condition affecting nearly 5 percent of U.S. men and women during their lifetimes. Recurrent calculi can be prevented in most patients by the use of a simplified evaluation, reasonable dietary and fluid recommendations, and directed pharmacologic intervention. Serum studies and 24-hour urine collections are the mainstays of metabolic investigation and usually are warranted in patients with recurrent calculi. Although some stones are the result of inherited conditions, most result from a complex interaction between diet, fluid habits, and genetic predisposition. Calcium-sparing diuretics such as thiazides often are used to treat hypercalciuria. Citrate medications increase levels of this naturally occurring stone inhibitor. Allopurinol can be helpful in patients with hyperuricosuria, and urease inhibitors can help break the cycle of infectious calculi. Aggressive fluid intake and moderated intake of salt, calcium, and meat are recommended for most patients.

### Pharmacotherapy of urolithiasis: evidence from clinical trials [^39263ca0]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Urolithiasis is a worldwide problem with significant health and economic burdens. Medical therapy that alters the course of stone disease has enormous medical and financial impact. Urolithiasis is a final manifestation of a broad range of etiologies and pathogenesis. The modest progress in understanding the pathophysiology has hampered successful development of targeted therapy. Current regimens are based mostly on rational alteration of urinary biochemistry and physical chemistry to lower the risk of precipitation. In terms of pharmacotherapy, there are drugs to successfully improve hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, aciduria, hyperuricosuria, and hypercystinuria. These agents have been proven to be effective in randomized controlled trials in improving urinary biochemical and physicochemical risk factors, as well as clinical outcomes. Although our current regimens have clearly improved the management and lives of stone formers, there are still clearly identifiable immense voids in the knowledge of pathophysiology of stone disease that can be filled with combined basic science and clinical studies.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^c1b271ba]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Diet therapies — sodium restriction and dietary calcium for calcium stone formers advise that clinicians should counsel patients with calcium stones and relatively high urinary calcium to limit sodium intake and consume 1,000–1,200 mg per day of dietary calcium (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B), with the Panel supporting a target of ≤ 100 mEq (2,300 mg) sodium intake daily; in supporting evidence, a five-year randomized controlled clinical trial in men with a history of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis and idiopathic hypercalciuria assigned to a diet lower in calcium (400 mg/day) or to a diet with normal calcium content (1,200 mg/day) and lower amounts of animal protein and sodium found at study end that the risk of developing a recurrent stone on the normal calcium diet was 51% lower than on the lower calcium diet, although the independent effect of calcium could not be ascertained; supplemental calcium, in contrast, may be associated with an increased risk of stone formation.

For frequent stone formers, and even for some first-time stone formers interested in preventing future episodes of renal colic, a metabolic evaluation is necessary. The urologist, rather than members of other medical specialties, seems to have the primary responsibility of the medical management of stone disease. Thus, it is essential for the urologist to have a good working knowledge of the principles of metabolic evaluation and kidney stone prevention. This article provides guidelines related to metabolic evaluation and the prevention of kidney stones.

### Bisphosphonates and management of kidney stones and bone disease [^4a946362]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Kidney stones are strongly associated with low bone density and bone fracture. Clinical management focuses on prevention of kidney stones and bone fracture. We reviewed literature of kidney stones and bone disease with a special focus on updates in therapeutic strategies. We will review the literature regarding dietary management, supplements, and medications and emphasize the recent studies on bisphosphonates and kidney stone management.

Recent Findings

Bisphosphonate medications are commonly used in management of low bone density. Previous studies showed that they reduce urinary calcium. A recent large prospective study found that bisphosphonates may reduce the risk of kidney stones in individuals who have low bone density. In addition to lowering urinary calcium, a recent study found that bisphosphonates may act as an inhibitor in the urinary space.

Summary

There are multiple dietary and pharmacologic strategies that can be considered for kidney stones and bone disease, such as low salt and normal calcium diet, as well as thiazides, alkali, and bisphosphonate medications. Bisphosphonates may have an important role in reducing bone resorption and reducing overall risk of kidney stone and bone disease.

Kidney stone selection and management — donor candidates with prior or current stones: The acceptance of a donor candidate with prior or current kidney stones should be based on an assessment of stone recurrence risk and knowledge of the possible consequences of kidney stones after donation. As recommended in chapter 5 (Predonation Kidney Function), when asymmetry in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), parenchymal abnormalities (including stones), vascular abnormalities, or urological abnormalities are present but do not preclude donation, the more affected kidney should be used for donation. There are reports of nephrolithiasis-related adverse events in recipients of an allograft with a stone left in situ, and there are also reports on the safety and success of ex vivo ureteroscopy to remove stones from explanted donor kidneys before transplantation. Donors and donor candidates who develop kidney stones should follow general population evidence-based guidelines for dietary and pharmacologic-based strategies to prevent kidney stones.

### Outcomes of dissolution therapy and monitoring for stone disease: should we do better? [^726318a0]. Current Opinion in Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Surgical management is the cornerstone of urolithiasis treatment, but high recurrence rates and associated complications necessitate the existence of medical treatment options, aiming at dissolution of kidney stones and prevention of recurrence. The purpose of this review is to present the most recent knowledge existing in scientific literature, regarding dissolution therapy and ways of monitoring nephrolithiasis patients.

Recent Findings

A number of laboratory studies have been performed testing experimental treatments (tolvaptan, chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, a-lipoic acid, glucosaminoglycans, plant extracts), to reduce kidney stone formation and cellular damage and showed encouraging results. Uric acid stones is the main target of dissolution therapy, but until last years, existing level of evidence was low. A number of prospective and randomized studies, proved the efficacy and safety of oral chemolysis for radiolucent stones and associated prognostic features of success. Tolvaptan and a-Lipoic acid were also tested in patients with cystinuria and resulted in reduction of recurrence. Finally, some new diagnostic markers are suggested as tests for the monitoring of urolithiasis patients, with satisfying accuracy and discriminative ability.

Summary

Medical dissolution therapy for nephrolithiasis is an effective option, especially for patients with radiolucent/uric acid stones. In the future, we need clinical trials to confirm the encouraging results of pilot studies testing several agents for patients with cystinuria.

AUA guideline — medical expulsive therapy (MET) for distal ureteral stones: For adult and pediatric patients with ≤ 10 mm distal ureteral stones, clinicians should offer MET with alpha-adrenergic blockers for approximately 30 days to facilitate stone passage (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). For patients who elect a trial of spontaneous passage for a ≤ 10 mm distal ureteral stone, initiation of pharmacotherapy with any alpha-adrenergic blocker (i.e., tamsulosin, alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin, and silodosin) has been shown to increase the likelihood of spontaneous stone passage, reduce associated pain, and result in fewer unplanned healthcare encounters. A meta-analysis for this Guideline included 49 studies comprising more than 8,000 patients and showed that use of any alpha-adrenergic blocker resulted in a statistically significantly higher rate of stone passage compared to a control or no-treatment group, with reductions in pain episodes, the need for pain medication, the rate of unplanned healthcare encounters as measured by emergency department (ED) visits, and the need for surgical intervention.

### Treatment and prevention of kidney stones: an update [^cf444941]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is rising worldwide, especially in women and with increasing age. Kidney stones are associated with chronic kidney disease. Preventing recurrence is largely specific to the type of stone (e.g., calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, cystine, struvite [magnesium ammonium phosphate]), and uric acid stones); however, even when the stone cannot be retrieved, urine pH and 24-hour urine assessment provide information about stone-forming factors that can guide prevention. Medications, such as protease inhibitors, antibiotics, and some diuretics, increase the risk of some types of kidney stones, and patients should be counseled about the risks of using these medications. Managing diet, medication use, and nutrient intake can help prevent the formation of kidney stones. Obesity increases the risk of kidney stones. However, weight loss could undermine prevention of kidney stones if associated with a high animal protein intake, laxative abuse, rapid loss of lean tissue, or poor hydration. For prevention of calcium oxalate, cystine, and uric acid stones, urine should be alkalinized by eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables, taking supplemental or prescription citrate, or drinking alkaline mineral waters. For prevention of calcium phosphate and struvite stones, urine should be acidified; cranberry juice or betaine can lower urine pH. Antispasmodic medications, ureteroscopy, and metabolic testing are increasingly being used to augment fluid and pain medications in the acute management of kidney stones.

### Integration and utilization of modern technologies in nephrolithiasis research [^1516b606]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

Nephrolithiasis, or stones, is one of the oldest urological diseases, with descriptions and treatment strategies dating back to ancient times. Despite the enormous number of patients affected by stones, a surprising lack of conceptual understanding of many aspects of this disease still exists. This lack of understanding includes mechanisms of stone formation and retention, the clinical relevance of different stone compositions and that of formation patterns and associated pathological features to the overall course of the condition. Fortunately, a number of new tools are available to assist in answering such questions. New renal endoscopes enable kidney visualization in much higher definition than was previously possible, while micro-CT imaging is the optimal technique for assessment of stone microstructure and mineral composition in a nondestructive fashion. Together, these tools have the potential to provide novel insights into the aetiology of stone formation that might unlock new prevention and treatment strategies, and enable more effective management of patients with nephrolithiasis.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part III: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^9ce85d1f]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA Guideline — emerging technologies and patient-centered research priorities in kidney and ureteral stone management emphasize that mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) and suction technologies are introduced, yet in many cases these technologies are still sensitive to the patient's baseline stone burden, and using high frequency lasers for a "dusting" approach appears inferior to basket extraction. Novel options listed include suction-based retrograde approaches, ultrasonic propulsion burst wave lithotripsy, robotic platforms, hybrid lasers, and the ability to monitor collection system temperature and pressure, and the guideline states these novel technologies and techniques should be rigorously and critically assessed in clinical investigations that employ clearly described, high quality imaging, and adhere to standardized definitions of treatment outcomes. The document also notes that understanding the patient perspective on the treatment of stones is limited with little investigation into shared decision-making, calls for study designs that include patient-reported outcomes such as quality-of-life effects, and highlights that fundamental questions for patients, including how long it will take for a ureteral stone to pass, when to intervene on an asymptomatic stone, how to optimally treat stent discomfort, and whether anything can be done to promote stone passage, remain largely unanswered and should be front-of-mind as future studies assess quality and outcomes.

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^24739719]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Kidney stones are the most common condition affecting the kidney, and characterized by a high rate of recurrence. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (thiazides) are commonly prescribed to prevent the recurrence of kidney stones. This review offers a comprehensive up-to-date assessment of the evidence supporting the use of thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention, highlights potential harms associated with treatment, and identifies areas of knowledge that require further investigation.

Recent Findings

The clinical routine to prescribe thiazides for kidney stone prevention has recently been challenged by the findings of the large NOSTONE trial that failed to show superiority of hydrochlorothiazide at doses up to 50mg daily over placebo in preventing a composite of clinical or radiological recurrence in patients at high risk of recurrence. Yet, adverse events such as new onset diabetes mellitus and gout were more common in patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide compared to placebo. As demonstrated by a novel meta-analysis presented in this review encompassing all randomized placebo-controlled trials with thiazide monotherapy, current trial evidence does not indicate that thiazide monotherapy is significantly better than placebo in preventing kidney stone recurrence.

Summary

Given the limited efficacy and possible adverse effects, we advocate for a restrictive use of thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention. Clearly, there remains a high unmet medical need for effective, targeted therapies to prevent recurrence of kidney stones.

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^11fad65b]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

HOW SHOULD PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT CALCIUM KIDNEY STONES BE MANAGED IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE RECENT FINDINGS?

We propose to invest energy and time in patient education, such as dietary and physical behavior changes, as first line intervention. If this does not suffice, pharmacological measures should be discussed on a case-to-case basis. Citrate salts are a valid option, although high quality trial evidence is limited. Additionally, CaP stone formation may be triggered by alkali administration, necessitating careful monitoring of treatment and urine pH. In patients with calcium kidney stones that are intolerant, or not responsive to citrate supplementation as monotherapy, long-acting thiazides such as chlorthalidone or indapamide may be tried. Importantly, however, there are currently only theoretical considerations and no robust trial data demonstrating an advantage of these thiazide-like compounds over hydrochlorothiazide for kidney stone recurrence prevention. Close monitoring of the patient should be started, and if there is no relevant change in stone activity after 2–3 years of treatment, discontinuation should be explored. The combination of thiazides and alkali therapy may be promising, but has not been tested rigorously so far. Benefits and potential risks associated with long-term use of thiazides should be discussed carefully with each patient.

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^e8d66864]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The incidence of recurrence is high in patients with kidney stones. Initial treatment focuses on dietary and behavioral interventions, but this approach is difficult to implement on the long-term and frequently fails to adequately suppress stone formation, necessitating pharmacological treatment. Thiazides have been one of the standard medical treatments for kidney stone prevention. The evidence supporting their use for this indication was largely based on observational data and small trials with methodological limitations. Recent findings challenge this long-held practice. Based on the results of a novel meta-analysis provided in this review that encompasses all double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to date, thiazide monotherapy does not confer a greater advantage over placebo in preventing the recurrence of calcium-containing kidney stones. There is currently also no head-to-head data showing an advantage of thiazide-like compounds, such as chlorthalidone or indapamide compared to hydrochlorothiazide. Given the limited efficacy and possible adverse effects associated with long-term use, we advocate for a restrictive use of thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention. Collectively, these recent findings underscore the high unmet medical need for effective therapies in patients with kidney stones.

### Identifying and integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in clinical practice guidelines on managing kidney stones [^f1f00837]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Insights from critical stakeholders are missing, we acknowledge that no caregivers were involved, who could provided additional perspectives to inform the guidelines, such as selecting and preparation of foods for people with experiences of recurrent kidney stones. A contrast is also evident, clinicians may have an acute perception of kidney stones, focusing on each episode as it occurs, whereas patients place a high value on preventative measures that also allow them to have an active role in their care, aiming to minimise recurrence and adopt a strategic, long-term approach.

Although consumer involvement in research has become increasingly advocated, there is still no standardised approach for involving people with lived experience in the guideline development process. The methods highlighted in our organisational framework for consumer involvement in guidelines have been implemented for workshops previously conducted for other chronic kidney disease conditions and are relatively effective and comprehensive for eliciting consumers' perspectives and insights on relevant priority topics and outcomes to be included in guidelines. Despite various guidelines organisations involving consumers in guidelines, further research on the methods to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of involvement strategies are required.

### Identifying and integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in clinical practice guidelines on managing kidney stones [^2c54687e]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

The prevention and management of recurrent kidney stones can be challenging and requires patients to modify their diet and daily rountines that impact their quality of life. Our study aims to describe the process of integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in guidelines on kidney stones to ensure patient relevance.

Methods

Two workshops were convened in Aotearoa New Zealand with people with kidney stones invited to identify topics and outcomes for inclusion in the guidelines. Flipcharts and transcripts were analysed thematically to identify the reasons for participants' choices.

Results

The topics identified by the twenty-eight participants included education on nutrition, better diagnosis, and individualised nutritional and pharmacological management. Pain, equity of access, anxiety about recurrence, and life participation were identified as important outcomes to be included. Four themes (and subthemes) underpinning priorities were: unresolvable debilitating pain (complexity of exctruciating acute episodic pain, inadequacy of pain relief medication, frustrated by stigma associated with opioids), dissatisfied at delayed access to care (prolonged difficulties in diagnosis, struggling to obtain individualised care), inadequate knowledge to enable self-management (insufficient information on kidney stones, conflicting nutrition advice, cultural deficit), and limiting life participation (restricting life choices, psychological burden of kidney stones).

Conclusions

Participants identified topics that would support symptom management to improve quality of life and reduce the burden on families. Guidelines should provide essential, consistent and clear guidance, particularly on nutrition, to support self-management. Incoporating consumer priorities in guidelines can help to support decision-making and patient-centred care in kidney stones.

### Identifying and integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in clinical practice guidelines on managing kidney stones [^f3750a1a]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Context

CARI Guidelines facilitate the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in Australia and New Zealand. A Working Group of five nephrologists, one urologist, one clinical biochemist, two consumers and one kidney-specialised dietitian was convened to discuss the update of a guideline for managing kidney stones. In the initial Working Group meeting, preliminary topics were identified, with topics prioritised (determined via feasibility), for inclusion in the guideline update using the Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparator, Outcomes, Methodology (PI/ECOM) framework. To help ensure that the inclusion of topics and recommendations aligned with what is relevant and meaningful to consumers, two half-day workshops were convened in Aotearoa New Zealand, on May 2021, in Auckland and Whangārei. These workshops aimed to elicit patient and caregiver perspectives about topics and outcomes for inclusion in the guideline update. The study has been reported according to the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research.

Participants and recruitment

People with kidney stones were eligible if they were aged 18 years or over, spoke English, had experienced at least one episode of kidney stones, or were a caregiver of a person who had experienced kidney stones. Assisted by three New Zealand-based Working Group members, participants were recruited from kidney stones clinics based at New Zealand tertiary hospitals, across two locations (Auckland, a major city in the north of New Zealand's North Island; Whangārei a rural centre in the Northland region of the North Island). After expressing interest, particpants received a patient information sheet from the Working Group members and provided informed consent to participate. A purposive sampling strategy was applied to obtain a wide range of demographic and clinical characteristics (i.e. type of kidney stone). Participants were reimbursed with an hourly sitting fee as well as any travel-related costs (i.e. petrol, parking). Ethics approval was granted by The University of Sydney's Ethics Committee (2020/724). The project was also approved as low risk by the Auckland District Health Board after a review of the University of Sydney's ethics approval.

### Medical therapy to facilitate the passage of stones: what is the evidence? [^2ccc4b45]. European Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Medical expulsive therapy (MET) for urolithiasis has gained increasing attention in the last years. It has been suggested that the administration of alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists (alpha-blockers) or calcium channel blockers augments stone expulsion rates and reduces colic events.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of MET with alpha-blockers and calcium channel blockers for upper urinary tract stones with and without prior extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).

Evidence Acquisition

A systematic review of the literature was performed in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews searched through 31 December 2008 without time limit. Efficacy and safety end points were evaluated in 47 randomised, controlled trials assessing the role of MET. Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager (RevMan) v.5.0 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark).

Evidence Synthesis

Pooling of alpha-blocker and calcium channel blocker studies demonstrated a higher and faster expulsion rate compared to a control group (risk ratio [RR]: 1.45 vs 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34–1.57 vs 1.33–1.66). Similar results have been obtained after ESWL (RR: 1.29 vs 1.57; 95% CI: 1.16–1.43 vs 1.21–2.04). Additionally, lower analgesic requirements, fewer colic episodes, and fewer hospitalisations were observed within treatment groups.

Conclusions

Pooled analyses suggest that MET with alpha-blockers or calcium channel blockers augments stone expulsion rates, reduces the time to stone expulsion, and lowers analgesia requirements for ureteral stones with and without ESWL for stones ≤ 10 mm. There is some evidence that a combination of alpha-blockers and corticosteroids might be more effective than treatment with alpha-blockers alone. Renal stones after ESWL also seem to profit from MET. The vast majority of randomised studies incorporated into the present systematic review are small, single-centre studies, limiting the strength of our conclusions. Therefore, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trials are needed.

### ACP best practice No 181: chemical pathology clinical investigation and management of nephrolithiasis [^fd08b8fa]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Renal stones have afflicted humans for millennia but there is still no solution to this problem. This review discusses the laboratory and metabolic aspects of the clinical management of patients with renal stones, both primary and secondary in origin. First, non-pharmacological interventions such as increased fluid intake, decreased protein consumption, dietary changes in sodium, calcium, oxalate, potassium, purine, vitamins, and essential fatty acids are considered. Then specific pharmacological treatment to modify urine calcium, oxalate, urate, citrate, and acidity are considered. Finally, more unusual types of stone are examined.

### Kidney stones: prevention options… [^6b5567fd]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best approach to prevent recurrent kidney stones. Bottom Line Increased fluid intake or decreased soft drink intake may prevent further kidney stones in patients with a single episode of a calcium stone, but other dietary interventions are not effective. Thiazides and citrates with increased fluid intake decrease recurrence in patients with multiple past stones, as does allopurinol in patients with high uric acid levels. Combinations — allopurinol and citrates with a thiazide — are no more effective than thiazides alone. Synopsis The researchers conducting this systematic review searched several databases, including the Cochrane library, and identified 28 English-language randomized trials that compared approaches to prevent recurrent kidney stones. The studies primarily evaluated patients with calcium stones, and included patients with a single incidence or with multiple recurrences.

One reviewer abstracted the data and a second author checked for accuracy. Two reviewers independently rated the quality of the identified research. For patients with a single recurrence, low-quality evidence showed that increased fluid intake or reduced soft drink consumption halved the recurrence of stones compared with no treatment. Decreased-protein diets or high-fiber diets and multicomponent diet changes were all ineffective. In patients with recurrent calcium stones, six moderate-quality studies showed that thiazide treatment, combined with high fluid and decreased oxalate intake, decreased stone recurrence by one-half and decreased rates of lithotripsy.

Treatment with citrates and increased fluid intake also decreased composite stone recurrence. Allopurinol decreases composite stone recurrence in patients with baseline hyperuricemia or hyperuricosuria. Combinations with thiazides were no more effective than a thiazide alone.

### Cost-effective management of nephrolithiasis… [^2b083ac0]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: What are the most cost-effective treatment strategies for the medical management of patients with kidney stones. Setting: Population-based Study Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis Synopsis: Investigators from Texas constructed a decision tree to estimate the cost of treatment and follow-up in patients with calcium oxalate renal stones. Using MEDLINE, they identified studies addressing the natural history, evaluation, and medical and surgical treatment of nephrolithiasis. Costs of various outcomes were estimated using local hospital and pharmacy charges from two national chains for specified diagnostic tests, medications, and surgical procedures.

Six treatment strategies were evaluated: conservative therapy — dietary modification without drug treatment or metabolic evaluation; empiric medical therapy — dietary modification and drug treatment for all patients; modified simple metabolic evaluation — a single 24-hour urine collection for analysis of common urinary. stone risk factors, with potassium citrate and hydrochlorothiazide prescribed for patients with hypercalciuria, and potassium citrate alone for patients with normocalciuria; simple metabolic evaluation — the same evaluation as no. 3, except that patients with normocalciuria and no other identifiable abnormality received no. drug therapy; modified comprehensive metabolic evaluation — at least two 24-hour urine collections for stone risk analysis and a fasting oral calcium load test with similar treatment as in no. 3; and comprehensive metabolic evaluation — the same work-up as in no.

5, but with treatment only for patients with an identified disorder. A sensitivity analysis evaluated medication cost thresholds at varying levels of risk that would achieve cost equivalence with conservative therapy for each treatment strategy. In patients with first-time kidney stones, conservative therapy was the most cost-effective strategy. In patients with recurrent kidney stones, empiric therapy and the modified simple metabolic evaluation were equally the most cost-effective strategies. Bottom Line: In patients with first-time kidney stones, conservative therapy is the most cost-effective strategy. In patients with recurrent kidney stones, empiric therapy and a modified simple metabolic evaluation are equally cost-effective.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^99e58a59]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Six guidelines with recommendations for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis to support urologists in decision-making were available for inclusion in our analysis. While there is generally a high grade of consensus for most stone scenarios, we also detected some relevant discrepancies between different guidelines. In particular, lower consensus was found for the treatment of proximal ureteral stones and hierarchical levels of recommended treatments for specific situations. These are, however, controversial situations where adequate evidence to assist with decision-making has yet to be elicited by further research.

KDIGO 2025 ADPKD — practice points on counseling, stone prevention, and weight state that healthcare providers should work with accredited nutrition providers or registered dietitians to provide individualized nutrition counseling to people with ADPKD, particularly people with CKD G4–G5 and those with or at high risk of urinary stones; people with ADPKD who either have or have an increased risk of developing urinary stones should make dietary adjustments to prevent stone formation with strategy depending on stone composition or lithogenic molecules; and people with ADPKD should maintain a healthy body weight, taking into account the additional weight due to enlarged kidneys and liver.

### Nonpharmacologic methods of stone risk reduction: diet and supplements [^5e158bee]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

This article provides background and a rationale for patient-centered, individualized, nonpharmacologic risk reduction for the most common types of kidney stones. An appreciation for the heterogeneity of urolithiasis and how it is expressed across stone formers is reviewed. Evidence-based strategies to address urinary and dietary risk factors are reviewed. Strategies to target risk factors are provided. For appropriate lithogenic risk factors, targeted nonpharmacologic therapies, informed by individualized assessment and consideration of patient-centered factors, is encouraged.
