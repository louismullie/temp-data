## Question

Can pinkish discharge be a sign of impending labor or fetal distress?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pinkish discharge can be a sign of impending labor or fetal distress. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "pinkish discharge" most plausibly represents in late pregnancy. Then, I should verify whether this aligns with recognized signs of labor onset. Next, I will examine whether pinkish discharge correlates with fetal distress or is itself a marker of compromise. After that, I need to distinguish physiologic "bloody show" from pathologic bleeding that warrants urgent action. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation with thresholds for when to seek care and when to observe at home.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity behind "pinkish discharge". In late pregnancy, a pink-tinged mucous discharge typically reflects the "bloody show", which is passage of blood-tinged cervical mucus as the cervix softens, effaces, and dilates with labor onset. This is a common, physiologic sign rather than a pathologic bleed, and it is explicitly listed among signs of active labor in prehospital and obstetric guidance, alongside contractions and membrane rupture [^7b53bad4] [^0a2416bd].

> Wait, let me verify whether this links to impending labor rather than fetal distress. The bloody show is a recognized harbinger of labor and is included in tools and protocols that help identify the active phase of labor; it reflects cervical change and does not, by itself, indicate fetal compromise, whereas fetal distress is primarily signaled by abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, reduced fetal movement, or maternal signs such as fever and uterine tenderness, not by the color of mucous discharge [^7b53bad4] [^f5fd73a6] [^c0aaf962].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should distinguish pinkish "bloody show" from concerning bleeding. Pathologic antepartum hemorrhage — such as placenta previa with painless bright red bleeding, abruption with pain and uterine rigidity, or vasa previa with rupture of membranes and profuse bleeding — presents differently and carries maternal-fetal risk. These are not subtle pink discharge and require immediate evaluation, whereas light, pink-tinged mucus is generally expected with cervical change in labor [^8240382a] [^490d2a04] [^e7c33f13].

> I need to check whether any credible source ties pinkish discharge to fetal distress. I do not find evidence that pinkish mucous discharge itself signals fetal compromise; instead, distress is identified by fetal heart rate abnormalities, meconium-stained fluid in certain contexts, or maternal-fetal instability, and guidelines emphasize continuous or structured intermittent monitoring to detect these issues rather than relying on discharge characteristics to infer distress [^f5fd73a6] [^d8c4c052].

> Let me consider timing and context. Pinkish discharge is most meaningful when it accompanies regular, painful contractions or membrane rupture, reinforcing that labor is underway or imminent. Conversely, isolated pink discharge without contractions may still be early labor or simply cervical change, and observation with activity as tolerated is reasonable if there are no red flags such as heavy bright red bleeding, severe pain, fever, or reduced fetal movement [^7b53bad4] [^c0aaf962].

> But wait, what if the discharge is not pink but frankly bloody, malodorous, or green-tinged. I should double-check that any change in color, odor, or volume prompts reassessment: green or foul-smelling discharge raises concern for infection, and heavy bright red bleeding suggests abruption, previa, or vasa previa. In those scenarios, urgent evaluation is indicated rather than watchful waiting [^fac97ac1] [^8240382a] [^490d2a04].

> Next, I should review practical guidance. For patients at term with pinkish, blood-tinged mucous discharge and no other symptoms, education and home observation are appropriate, with instructions to return for regular contractions, rupture of membranes, decreased fetal movement, fever, severe pain, or heavy bright red bleeding. For preterm patients, any bleeding merits prompt assessment given the broader differential and risks, so I need to ensure gestational context guides urgency [^c0aaf962] [^242bb5d2].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Pinkish discharge in late pregnancy most often represents "bloody show", a normal sign of cervical change and impending labor, and is not a sign of fetal distress. Fetal distress is identified by abnormal fetal heart rate patterns or other clinical instability, not by the hue of mucous discharge, so patients should be reassured about pink-tinged mucus while remaining vigilant for warning signs that warrant immediate care [^7b53bad4] [^f5fd73a6] [^c0aaf962].

Pinkish discharge in late pregnancy is most often a **normal sign of impending labor** (bloody show) due to cervical changes and mucus plug loss, especially when accompanied by regular contractions or membrane rupture [^7b53bad4] [^0a2416bd]. It is **not a direct sign of fetal distress**, which is indicated by abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, reduced movement, or meconium-stained fluid [^f5fd73f6] [^d8c4c052]. However, pinkish discharge can also signal concerning conditions such as placenta previa, placental abruption, or vasa previa, particularly if bleeding is heavy, persistent, or accompanied by pain, fever, or abnormal fetal heart rate [^8240382a] [^490d2a04]. Any pinkish discharge should be reported to a healthcare provider for evaluation, especially if preterm, heavy, or associated with other symptoms [^c0aaf962].

---

## Physiological basis of pinkish discharge

Pinkish discharge typically reflects **cervical changes** — softening, effacement, and dilation — with capillary disruption and mucus plug loss, producing blood-tinged mucus ("bloody show") [^7b53bad4]. This is a common, benign sign of labor onset or progression, especially with regular contractions or membrane rupture [^7b53bad4].

---

## Pinkish discharge as a sign of impending labor

Pinkish discharge is a recognized sign of **impending labor**, particularly at term [^7b53bad4]. Key features include:

- **Timing**: Typically occurs within 24–48 hours before labor, but can be days earlier.
- **Characteristics**: Light pink or brown-tinged mucus; small to moderate amount.
- **Associated symptoms**: Regular contractions, membrane rupture, or cervical change [^7b53bad4].

---

## Pinkish discharge and fetal distress

Pinkish discharge is **not a direct indicator of fetal distress**. Fetal distress is identified by abnormal fetal heart rate patterns (e.g. late decelerations, bradycardia), reduced fetal movement, or meconium-stained amniotic fluid [^f5fd73f6] [^d8c4c052]. Pinkish discharge may coexist with distress in certain pathologic conditions (e.g. placental abruption, vasa previa), but the discharge itself is not the cause or primary sign [^8240382a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert opinions

Clinical guidelines emphasize **evaluating pinkish discharge in context**:

- **Normal finding**: Light pink, blood-tinged mucus with cervical change is expected in labor [^7b53bad4].
- **Concerning features**: Heavy, bright red bleeding; persistent discharge; pain; fever; or abnormal fetal heart rate warrant urgent evaluation [^c0aaf962] [^490d2a04].
- **Management**: Assess for placenta previa, placental abruption, vasa previa, or infection if bleeding is significant or atypical [^8240382a] [^490d2a04].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Interpretation** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| Light pink, blood-tinged mucus with regular contractions at term | Normal "bloody show"; impending labor | Observe; report to provider |
| Heavy, bright red bleeding at any gestation | Possible placenta previa, abruption, or vasa previa | Immediate emergency evaluation |
| Pinkish discharge with fever, uterine tenderness, or malodorous fluid | Possible infection (chorioamnionitis) | Urgent medical evaluation |
| Pinkish discharge before 37 weeks | Possible preterm labor or cervical change | Prompt medical evaluation |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Pinkish discharge is usually a **normal sign of impending labor** (bloody show) and is not itself a sign of fetal distress. However, it can also signal serious conditions such as placenta previa, placental abruption, or vasa previa, especially if heavy, persistent, or accompanied by pain, fever, or abnormal fetal heart rate. Patients should report any pinkish discharge to their healthcare provider for assessment and guidance [^c0aaf962].

Furthermore, none of the current guidelines are recommending the use of vaginal examination as the main single method to establish whether a woman is in active phase of first stage of labor. They rather indicate vaginal examination as a mean to confirm, if deemed necessary by the practitioner, what emerges as suggestive for the active phase of labor by other methods (e.g. observation of women's behaviors, signs and symptoms) within an holistic assessment.

The latter, has been deemed to be crucial considering the complexity of the physiology underpinning the active labor.

Previous studies have focused on women's behaviors and signs that may suggest labor onset, including: skin changes, body temperature, sweating, breathing, conversation, movement and posture, mood, energy, pain perceptions, presence and changes of the purple line, spontaneous rupture of membranes, vaginal discharge, cervical change over time, fetal movement and station and condition of the presenting part. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the role that these signs play both in recognize the active phase of labor and in supporting midwives' decision making.

Within the context of international recommendations and in order to provide a safe care, the use of a structured tool might assist midwives and caregivers in focusing on key elements using a holistic approach to diagnose active phase of labour.

Thus, this study aimed to build and to validate a predictive model to identify a cervical dilatation ≥ 4 cm based on maternal signs and symptoms.

### Effects of induction of labour versus expectant management in women with impending post-term pregnancies: the 41 week-42 week dilemma [^a7cb8ca0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Control group: expectant management until 42 weeks

Women allocated to expectant management await spontaneous onset of labour until 42 weeks. If labour has not started, monitoring is according to local protocol. This reflects current care in The Netherlands. Monitoring can consist of consultations, electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and ultrasound assessment of amniotic fluid. An increase of the frequency of these checks as well as admission to the hospital is based on the judgment of the midwife or clinician in charge as usual. In the expectant management group, intervention will occur in case the fetal condition does not justify expectant management, such as reduced fetal movements reported by the mother, non-optimal fetal heart rate on CTG or oligohydramnios. If an indication for induction of labour occurs, such as prelabour rupture of membranes for > 24 hours or meconium stained amniotic fluid, referral to secondary care for labour induction is indicated according to the management strategies which are recorded in the national Obstetrical Indication List. All diagnostic tests and interventions between randomisation and birth are registered in the case report form. Protocol violation is noted in the case report form with the reason of switch of policy to induction of labour. Women with uncomplicated pregnancies who are still in primary care will be referred to secondary care at 42 + 0 weeks for induction of labour following the procedure as stated for the intervention group.

Outcome measures

Primary

Primary outcome will be a composite of perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidity. Adverse perinatal outcome is defined as a composite of perinatal mortality, a 5-minute Apgar-score below 7 and/or an arterial pH below 7.05 (as in other Consortium studies), meconium aspiration syndrome, plexus brachialis injury (with and without association with shoulder dystocia (additional manoeuvres to deliver shoulders)) and/or NICU admission (level of care and duration). Meconium aspiration syndrome is defined as respiratory distress in the first four hours after birth in presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid and categorised as severe (requiring assisted mechanical ventilation) or moderate (requiring oxygen for at least 48 hours or at a concentration of 40 percent or greater but without mechanical ventilation).

Secondary

Secondary outcomes will be maternal outcomes such as operative delivery (operative vaginal delivery, Caesarean section), need for analgesia (epidural, remifentanil, pethidin), post-partum haemorrhage ≥ 1000 mL and severe perineal injury (third- or fourth-degree perineal tear).

Maternal preferences, satisfaction, wellbeing and anxiety will be assessed alongside the trial.

### Alternative approach to monitoring labor: purple line [^fb1a1b79]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 140 million births occur worldwide every year, with more than four births occurring every second. A positive childbirth experience is important for every woman worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a positive birth as an experience that espouses women's sociocultural beliefs and meets their expectations. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 studies involving 22,800 participants from twelve countries indicated that support during childbirth, preparation for childbirth, and minimal interventions during labor were the most important factors leading to a positive birth experience.

Women can perceive their childbirth experiences as positive or negative or have mixed emotions about them. Negative childbirth experiences are attributed to various factors, such as a lack of knowledge, inability to use decision-making mechanisms, media influences, deficiencies in healthcare facilities, behaviors of healthcare personnel, cultural beliefs, and negative childbirth narrations by family elders. However, it is crucial to monitor the progress of labor carefully and offer compassionate care during childbirth for a positive childbirth experience.

The progress of labor can be monitored via a series of signs and symptoms, including cervical dilatation, cervical effacement, and fetal descent, along with the observation and measurement of the purple line in the sacral region, respiratory rate, changes in behavior, sounds, and movements. Although various methods are available for monitoring the progress of labor, vaginal examination (manual examination) is predominantly preferred for evaluating cervical dilatation, cervical effacement, and fetal descent in clinical settings. Several studies have shown that monitoring cervical dilatation increases concerns about the decisions made and interventions performed during labor. Furthermore, vaginal examination is described as an unpleasant, intrusive, embarrassing, and discomforting experience for women. The frequency of vaginal examinations and lack of care during the procedure lead to pain, discomfort, anxiety, and negative emotions such as fear, embarrassment, guilt, and weakness among women, thereby reducing childbirth satisfaction. Women with a history of sexual violence and posttraumatic stress disorder experience more stress during vaginal examinations. Additionally, there is a positive relationship between the number of vaginal examinations and the risk of puerperal sepsis and genital tract infections.

Previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) — outpatient expectant management and follow-up: before hospital discharge for a trial of outpatient expectant management, it is important to provide detailed instructions about signs and symptoms to monitor, including daily temperature monitoring to screen for maternal fever and infection, contractions, vaginal bleeding, discolored or malodorous vaginal discharge, and abdominal pain; it is common for patients to be seen frequently (often weekly) for assessment of maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, physical examination, and possible laboratory evaluation for signs of infection such as leukocytosis; and Hospital readmission should occur if there are contraindications to continued expectant management, such as hemorrhage, infection, or fetal demise, or after reaching a point when a trial of neonatal resuscitation and intensive care would be considered appropriate by the healthcare team and desired by the patient so that antenatal corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and antepartum fetal surveillance may be initiated as appropriate.

### Vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy [^490d2a04]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Bleeding in late-term pregnancy can present as an innocuous start to parturition or a catastrophic maternal-fetal hemorrhage masked by the physiologic adaptations of pregnancy. The emergency management of late-term bleeding can be challenging, especially when providing stabilizing care in a limited-resource environment. Early recognition of life-threatening vaginal bleeding, potential causes, and emergency management of maternal-fetal distress is reviewed. Maternal resuscitation with balanced versus targeted blood products replacement is presented for low-resource versus high-resource environments. Emergency department readiness for such a patient, in combination with appropriate consultation or transfer, is essential to the effective management of late-term vaginal bleeding.

Conditions that often present with vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks are common and can cause morbidity and mortality. Clinically stable patients can choose their management options. Clinically unstable patients require urgent procedural management: uterine aspiration, dilation and evacuation, or surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy. Septic abortion requires prompt procedural management, intravenous antibiotics, and intravenous fluids. Available data on prognosis with expectant management of pre-viable rupture of membranes in the United States are poor for mothers and fetuses.

### Near-term and intrapartum care of mothers for perinatal and newborn outcomes [^ce6a2293]. Neonatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The dearth of research pertaining to essential interventions delivered near-term or during labor, such as antibiotics for PPROM, antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation, the use of partograph, and induction of labor in LMICs, is concerning and calls for more stringent data collection in these regions. Addressing health disparities between high- and upper-middle-income countries and LMICs and providing adequate support to at-risk populations are gravitational in preventing adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative to amplify efforts in underdeveloped regions to improve the healthcare infrastructure, and educate pregnant women about the importance of identifying the warning signs of maternal and fetal distress during the gestational period, especially at a time as critical as the intrapartum period and childbirth.

### Prelabor rupture of membranes: ACOG practice bulletin, number 217 [^999e41e6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) diagnosis — Most cases of PROM can be diagnosed on the basis of the patient's history and physical examination, and examination should be performed in a manner that minimizes the risk of introducing infection; because digital cervical examinations increase the risk of infection, they generally should be avoided unless the patient appears to be in active labor or delivery seems imminent. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by conventional clinical assessment (visualization of amniotic fluid, pooling, simple pH test, or arborization/ferning), with the normal pH of vaginal secretions generally 3.8–4.5 whereas amniotic fluid usually has a pH of 7.1–7.3. False-positive test results may occur with blood, semen, alkaline antiseptics, certain lubricants, trichomonas, or bacterial vaginosis, whereas false-negative results may occur with prolonged membrane rupture and minimal residual fluid. In equivocal cases, ultrasonographic examination of amniotic fluid volume may be a useful adjunct but is not diagnostic; fetal fibronectin is sensitive but nonspecific for ruptured membranes, with a negative test suggesting intact membranes, but a positive test not diagnostic of PROM. Several commercially available protein tests report high sensitivity, but false-positive test result rates of 19–30% have been reported, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration described adverse events related to their use, including 13 fetal deaths; accordingly, these tests should not be used without other clinical assessments and at most should be considered selectively relative to standard methods of diagnosis. If diagnosis remains unclear after a full evaluation, membrane rupture can be diagnosed with ultrasonographically guided transabdominal instillation of indigo carmine dye, documented by a stained tampon or pad removed 20–30 minutes later; note that maternal urine also will turn blue or blue-green and should not be confused with amniotic fluid, and shortages of indigo carmine have led to suggested alternatives such as fluorescein.

### Routine vaginal examinations for assessing progress of labour to improve outcomes for women and babies at term [^f7fecfbe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal examinations have become a routine intervention in labour as a means of assessing labour progress. Used at regular intervals, either alone or as a component of the partogram (a pre-printed form providing a pictorial overview of the progress of labour), the aim is to assess if labour is progressing physiologically, and to provide an early warning of slow progress. Abnormally slow progress can be a sign of labour dystocia, which is associated with maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, particularly in low-income countries where appropriate interventions cannot easily be accessed. However, over-diagnosis of dystocia can lead to iatrogenic morbidity from unnecessary intervention (e.g. operative vaginal birth or caesarean section). It is, therefore, important to establish whether or not the routine use of vaginal examinations is an effective intervention, both as a diagnostic tool for true labour dystocia, and as an accurate measure of physiological labour progress.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness, acceptability and consequences of digital vaginal examination(s) (alone or within the context of the partogram) with other strategies, or different timings, to assess progress during labour at term.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 February 2013) and reference lists of identified studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vaginal examinations (including digital assessment of the consistency of the cervix, and the degree of dilation and position of the opening of the uterus (cervical os); and position and station of the fetal presenting part, with or without abdominal palpation) compared with other ways of assessing progress of labour. We also included studies assessing different timings of vaginal examinations. We excluded quasi-RCTs and cross-over trials. We also excluded trials with a primary focus on assessing progress of labour using the partogram (of which vaginal examinations is one component) as this is covered by another Cochrane review. However, studies where vaginal examinations were used within the context of the partogram were included if the studies were randomised according to the vaginal examination component.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors assessed the studies for inclusion in the review. Two authors undertook independent data extraction and assessed the risk of bias of each included study. A third review author also checked data extraction and risk of bias. Data entry was checked.

Main Results

We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria but they were of unclear quality. One study, involving 307 women, compared vaginal examinations with rectal examinations, and the other study, involving 150 women, compared two-hourly with four-hourly vaginal examinations. Both studies were of unclear quality in terms of risk of selection bias, and the study comparing the timing of the vaginal examinations excluded 27% (two hourly) to 28% (four hourly) of women after randomisation because they no longer met the inclusion criteria. When comparing routine vaginal examinations with routine rectal examinations to assess the progress of labour, we identified no difference in neonatal infections requiring antibiotics (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 8.07, one study, 307 infants). There were no data on the other primary outcomes of length of labour, maternal infections requiring antibiotics and women's overall views of labour. The study did show that significantly fewer women reported that vaginal examination was very uncomfortable compared with rectal examinations (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.70, one study, 303 women). We identified no difference in the secondary outcomes of augmentation, caesarean section, spontaneous vaginal birth, operative vaginal birth, perinatal mortality and admission to neonatal intensive care. Comparing two-hourly vaginal examinations with four-hourly vaginal examinations in labour, we found no difference in length of labour (mean difference in minutes (MD) -6.00, 95% CI -88.70 to 76.70, one study, 109 women). There were no data on the other primary outcomes of maternal or neonatal infections requiring antibiotics, and women's overall views of labour. We identified no difference in the secondary outcomes of augmentation, epidural for pain relief, caesarean section, spontaneous vaginal birth and operative vaginal birth.

Authors' Conclusions

On the basis of women's preferences, vaginal examination seems to be preferred to rectal examination. For all other outcomes, we found no evidence to support or reject the use of routine vaginal examinations in labour to improve outcomes for women and babies. The two studies included in the review were both small, and carried out in high-income countries in the 1990s. It is surprising that there is such a widespread use of this intervention without good evidence of effectiveness, particularly considering the sensitivity of the procedure for the women receiving it, and the potential for adverse consequences in some settings. The effectiveness of the use and timing of routine vaginal examinations in labour, and other ways of assessing progress in labour, including maternal behavioural cues, should be the focus of new research as a matter of urgency. Women's views of ways of assessing labour progress should be given high priority in any future research in this area.

### Delayed interval delivery of the second twin in a woman with altered markers of inflammation [^e905428f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

One week following admission (24 + 4) the patient experienced blood stained brownish vaginal secretions and the vaginal examination revealed a Bishop score of 8. She was transferred to the labor ward where she delivered a female that weighted 550 g. Manual extraction of the placenta failed and the umbilical cord was ligated just above the level of the external cervical os. The vagina was rinsed with antiseptic solution (povidone iodine, Betadine®) and she remained in the labor ward under close surveillance of vital signs and fetal heart rate for the next 4 h. No signs of active labor were noticed. After informed consent and detailed counselling about the possible benefits and complications, the woman opted for delayed delivery of the second twin.

The next day the delivered twin died from respiratory distress syndrome. Blood samples were obtained from the patient that once again revealed raised white blood cells (WBCs) (12,400/μl) and increased CRP (13.14 mg/L). The patient remained in the high-risk pregnancy department and 5 days later she had a new blood and urine examination along with urine cultures that revealed elevated WBCs (13.900/μl), an a steep rise in CRP (31.78 mg/L) along with the presence of enterobacteriae spp. An expert in infectious diseases was advised and the patient received cefuroxime 750 mg eight hourly for 7 days. The surveillance protocol involved close laboratory assessment (WBC and CRP levels three times a week), ultrasonographic evaluation twice a week, vital signs clinical assessment (arterial pressure, heart rate, temperature) and electronic fetal monitoring (non stress test, NST) twice a day. The fluctuations of CRP and WBC values during the patient's hospitalization are shown in the Fig. 1. She remained afebrile with no clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis. A repeated dose of steroids was administered to the patient during her 26th and 27th day of hospitalization (28th week of gestation).

The second female fetus was finally delivered 34 days after the first fetus (29 + 2) with cesarean section due to an abnormal NST. The neonate weighed 1150 g and had an Apgar score of 7 at the first minute and 9 at 5 minutes. It remained in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for about 4 weeks.

### Quality-improvement strategies for safe reduction of primary cesarean birth: ACOG committee statement no. 17 [^44a25e87]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Statement No. 17 — Resources and communication to support vaginal birth note that accessing available resources is critical and starts with patient-centered care; strong nurse-to-nurse support and education enable evidence-based interventions. Areas to address include pain-management options, remote monitoring or intermittent auscultation to allow greater movement, labor and pushing positions, and integrating labor doulas. Structured communication practices such as patient-centered care huddles may reduce anxiety and interventions for indeterminate or category II fetal heart rate tracings, support teamwork and patient safety, and patient-inclusive, bidirectional communication can better inform expectations and reinforce that indeterminate tracings and labor variations do not imply fetal compromise or an impending need for cesarean. Culture of care can be reinforced by collecting and internally reporting data.

### Prelabor rupture of membranes: ACOG practice bulletin, number 217 [^7218d496]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes — outpatient monitoring may be possible after a period of hospital assessment, but maternal risks are significant; outpatient expectant care should include frequent temperature evaluations, clear counseling on monitoring symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, abnormal discharge), and frequent evaluations by a health care provider, with hospitalization often around the time of viability when fetal intervention is desired.

### Velamentous cord insertion ruptured during labour leading to acute fetal blood loss [^999d7307]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Umbilical cord rupture (UCR) in utero is a very rare and critical emergency that can cause fetal death within minutes. A 38-year-old nulliparous woman was admitted at 39 weeks in labour. Sudden watery vaginal discharge and bleeding with a rapid drop in the fetal heart rate to 60 beats/min necessitated an emergency caesarean section. A male infant weighing 2632 g was delivered 21min after the onset of bradycardia; Apgar scores were 0 and 1 at 1 and 5min, respectively. He was extremely pale; the umbilical arterial blood pH was 6.89 and haemoglobin was 9.0 g/dL. The umbilical cord had a velamentous insertion and was lacerated, with haemorrhage in the outer layer of an umbilical artery close to the placental end. The presentation was typical of UCR: vaginal bleeding following the rupture of membranes. Prompt diagnosis of UCR and termination of pregnancy are essential for fetal survival.

### Improving the quality of obstetric care for women with obstructed labour in the national referral hospital in Uganda: lessons learnt from criteria based audit [^5cae5bde]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Participants' recruitment

Upon making a diagnosis of obstructed labour by the obstetric team on duty, patients who consented to participate in the study were followed prospectively to the point of discharge from the facility. The quality of obstetric care given to them was analyzed from their charts. Participants were interviewed for details where there was need for clarity in cases of under or over documentation of clinical findings.

Inclusion criteria:
All women with obstructed labour managed in Mulago hospital during the study period that consented to participate in the study.

Exclusion criteria:
Women managed for obstructed labour in other facilities but referred to Mulago hospital for further care following delivery.
Women with more than one obstetric emergency not related to each other e.g. Eclampsia + Obstructed labour.
Very sick women with obstructed labour unable to give informed consent or participate in patient interviews.

The study participants were 180 women with obstructed labour in each audit that was conducted within 24 h of admission. The criteria used for diagnosis of obstructed labour included having three adequate uterine contractions in ten minutes lasting 45–60 s with no cervical progression in two hours or progression less than 1 cm/h or presence of clinical signs of obstructed labour (impending uterine rupture, Bandl's ring, blood-stained urine, severe caput or molding of fetal head) or clinical signs of shock (hypotension or tachycardia with a pulse of > 110/min).

Maternal outcome variables

The maternal outcomes, which were considered in the study included; hospital stay of the participants, mode of delivery, maternal morbidities like puerperal sepsis, uterine rupture, fistula formation, and whether mother died or was alive at discharge.

Fetal outcome variables

Fetal outcomes that were considered included; admission to a NICU (special care Unit), rationale for admission to the NICU, and whether the baby died or was alive at discharge from hospital.

### Serum metabolites as diagnostic biomarkers for preterm labor: a metabolomics-based study [^bb4268fc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preterm labor signs are a common and high-risk obstetric condition characterized by uterine contractions, cervical effacement and dilation, and changes in vaginal discharge occurring before 37 weeks of gestation, which may lead to or indicate imminent preterm birth (PTB). According to the World Health Organization statistics, approximately 15% of babies globally are born prematurely each year, which not only increases the risk of neonatal mortality but may also have long-term implications for children's health and development. Therefore, effective diagnosis and management of preterm labor signs are crucial for reducing the rate of PTB and its associated complications. In clinical practice, the diagnosis and intervention of preterm labor signs are particularly important as they directly impact the health of both the pregnant woman and the fetus.

The diagnosis of preterm labor signs mainly relies on clinical symptoms, cervical examination, and uterine contraction monitoring. However, these conventional methods have notable limitations. For example, cervical length measurement and contraction assessment lack globally standardized protocols, leading to variability across medical institutions. Moreover, the accuracy of conventional diagnostic methods in predicting the risk and timing of preterm birth remains limited, often failing to provide an adequate window for early prevention and intervention. Therefore, developing novel and more precise biomarkers is crucial for improving the screening and prevention of preterm labor signs.

### Clinical chorioamnionitis at term: definition, pathogenesis, microbiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^fac97ac1]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical chorioamnionitis, the most common infection-related diagnosis in labor and delivery units, is an antecedent of puerperal infection and neonatal sepsis. The condition is suspected when intrapartum fever is associated with two other maternal and fetal signs of local or systemic inflammation (eg, maternal tachycardia, uterine tenderness, maternal leukocytosis, malodorous vaginal discharge or amniotic fluid, and fetal tachycardia). Clinical chorioamnionitis is a syndrome caused by intraamniotic infection, sterile intraamniotic inflammation (inflammation without bacteria), or systemic maternal inflammation induced by epidural analgesia. In cases of uncertainty, a definitive diagnosis can be made by analyzing amniotic fluid with methods to detect bacteria (Gram stain, culture, or microbial nucleic acid) and inflammation (white blood cell count, glucose concentration, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, matrix metalloproteinase-8). The most common microorganisms are Ureaplasma species, and polymicrobial infections occur in 70% of cases. The fetal attack rate is low, and the rate of positive neonatal blood cultures ranges between 0.2% and 4%. Intrapartum antibiotic administration is the standard treatment to reduce neonatal sepsis. Treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin have been recommended by professional societies, although other antibiotic regimens, eg, cephalosporins, have been used. Given the importance of Ureaplasma species as a cause of intraamniotic infection, consideration needs to be given to the administration of antimicrobial agents effective against these microorganisms such as azithromycin or clarithromycin. We have used the combination of ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, and metronidazole, which has been shown to eradicate intraamniotic infection with microbiologic studies. Routine testing of neonates born to affected mothers for genital mycoplasmas could improve the detection of neonatal sepsis. Clinical chorioamnionitis is associated with decreased uterine activity, failure to progress in labor, and postpartum hemorrhage; however, clinical chorioamnionitis by itself is not an indication for cesarean delivery. Oxytocin is often administered for labor augmentation, and it is prudent to have uterotonic agents at hand to manage postpartum hemorrhage. Infants born to mothers with clinical chorioamnionitis near term are at risk for early-onset neonatal sepsis and for long-term disability such as cerebral palsy. A frontier is the noninvasive assessment of amniotic fluid to diagnose intraamniotic inflammation with a transcervical amniotic fluid collector and a rapid bedside test for IL-8 for patients with ruptured membranes. This approach promises to improve diagnostic accuracy and to provide a basis for antimicrobial administration.

### Fatal early-onset sepsis caused by intrauterine transmission of serogroup Y meningococcus [^267db873]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

CASE REPORT

Following an uncomplicated pregnancy, a 26-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 2, para 1, not vaccinated for type Y N. meningitidis), presented at exactly 29 weeks of gestation with ruptured fetal membranes for half a day, vaginal discharge of green-colored fluid, and uterine contractions. She reported a 2-week history of headache, urticaria, and elevated temperature up to 37.8°C. Her vaginal discharge during pregnancy had increasingly become more green-colored over the last month. At presentation to our center, her laboratory infection markers were elevated (Table 1), and cardiotocography showed a fetal tachycardia (180 to 200 beats per minute) and minimal beat-to-beat variability. Due to imminent premature delivery, betamethasone was administered for lung maturation. Because of suspected intrauterine infection, tocolysis was not initiated, while intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was started approximately 1 hour prior to delivery. Given the progression of labor, vaginal delivery was considered the quickest and safest obstetrical management plan.

### Diagnosing onset of labor: a systematic review of definitions in the research literature [^2ddaa5ec]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of labor onset has been described as one of the most difficult and important judgments made by providers of maternity care. The first stage of labor, through effective uterine contractions, achieves the objective of shortening or effacing the cervix, and opening or dilating it to at least 10 cm in diameter to allow the passage of the infant from the uterus to the vagina. It is comprised of two phases; latent and active.

There is compelling evidence that the duration of both latent and active phases of labor are clinically relevant and thus require consistent approaches to measurement. A prolonged latent phase of labor has been associated with an increased risk for oxytocin augmentation of labor, caesarean section, meconium staining in the amniotic fluid, 5-min Apgar score less than 7, need for newborn resuscitation and admission to the NICU. Women who are admitted to labor wards in the latent vs. active phase of labor are at higher risk for obstetrical intervention including electronic fetal monitoring, epidural analgesia, oxytocin, and caesarean section. There may also be important differences in durations of latent and active phase labor and their relationship to obstetric outcomes according to parity.

Despite research pointing to the importance of the duration and transition between the latent and active phases of labor, there is considerable inconsistency in definitions of labor onset, a necessary component of measuring duration. The onset of the latent phase of labor has been defined as the time of the first clinical assessment in labor at the hospital, or alternatively the beginning of strong regular painful contractions. Similarly, inconsistency exists in definitions of the transition from the latent to the active phase. This important indicator of labor progress has been variably characterized as coinciding with the onset of regular contractions, beginning at the time at which the woman was admitted to the labor ward, when she seeks professional care, or the time at which she is consented for participation in a randomized controlled trial. Recently researchers have used the woman's self-report as the time of labor onset.

### Top 10 pearls for the recognition, evaluation, and management of maternal sepsis [^4d01d67d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pearl 1. Recognition is key: always maintain a high index of suspicion for sepsis.

Maternal sepsis can present with multiple and varied symptoms such as lethargy, chills and rigors, generalized malaise, rashes, lower abdominal or pelvic pain, foul lochia, contractions, malodorous or discolored leaking of fluid from the vagina, and breast engorgement. Signs of maternal sepsis include fever or hypothermia, tachycardia, hypotension, uterine tenderness, preterm labor or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, altered mental status, and end-organ dysfunction.

Although there are no standardized criteria to diagnose maternal sepsis, vital signs changes are an early indicator of infection. However, these early vital sign changes may be dismissed as normal physiologic changes of pregnancy such as an increase in heart rate, and decrease in blood pressure. Additionally, external influences (eg, blood loss during delivery, common infections, fluid administration, medications, and effects of anesthesia) may further confuse the clinical picture. Often there is no obvious source of infection in maternal sepsis, which makes recognition more challenging and may result in delays in treatment and source control. –

Because the symptoms of maternal sepsis are often nonspecific, health care professionals need to maintain a high index of suspicion. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommends that health care professionals consider the diagnosis of sepsis in pregnant patients with otherwise unexplained end-organ damage in the presence of an infectious process, regardless of the presence of a fever. Although every pregnant patient is at risk for sepsis, there are specific patient characteristics that are associated with increased risk for sepsis (Box 2). – Close surveillance of pregnant or postpartum patients with these conditions may aid in the early detection of sepsis.

### Routine vaginal examinations compared to other methods for assessing progress of labour to improve outcomes for women and babies at term [^60596c6d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Routine vaginal examinations are undertaken at regular time intervals during labour to assess whether labour is progressing as expected. Unusually slow progress can be due to underlying problems, described as labour dystocia, or can be a normal variation of progress. Evidence suggests that if mother and baby are well, length of labour alone should not be used to decide whether labour is progressing normally. Other methods to assess labour progress include intrapartum ultrasound and monitoring external physical and behavioural cues. Vaginal examinations can be distressing for women, and overdiagnosis of dystocia can result in iatrogenic morbidity due to unnecessary intervention. It is important to establish whether routine vaginal examinations are effective, both as an accurate measure of physiological labour progress and to distinguish true labour dystocia, or whether other methods for assessing labour progress are more effective. This Cochrane Review is an update of a review first published in 2013.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness, acceptability, and consequences of routine vaginal examinations compared with other methods, or different timings, to assess labour progress at term.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register (which includes trials from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and conference proceedings) and ClinicalTrials.gov (28 February 2021). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vaginal examinations compared with other methods of assessing labour progress and studies assessing different timings of vaginal examinations. Quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion. We excluded cross-over trials and conference abstracts.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all studies identified by the search for inclusion in the review. Four review authors independently extracted data. Two review authors assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included four studies that randomised a total of 755 women, with data analysed for 744 women and their babies. Interventions used to assess labour progress were routine vaginal examinations, routine ultrasound assessments, routine rectal examinations, routine vaginal examinations at different frequencies, and vaginal examinations as indicated. We were unable to conduct meta-analysis as there was only one study for each comparison. All studies were at high risk of performance bias due to difficulties with blinding. We assessed two studies as high risk of bias and two as low or unclear risk of bias for other domains. The overall certainty of the evidence assessed using GRADE was low or very low. Routine vaginal examinations versus routine ultrasound to assess labour progress (one study, 83 women and babies) Study in Turkey involving multiparous women with spontaneous onset of labour. Routine vaginal examinations may result in a slight increase in pain compared to routine ultrasound (mean difference -1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.10 to -0.48; one study, 83 women, low certainty evidence) (pain measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) in reverse: zero indicating 'worst pain', 10 indicating no pain). The study did not assess our other primary outcomes: positive birth experience; augmentation of labour; spontaneous vaginal birth; chorioamnionitis; neonatal infection; admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Routine vaginal examinations versus routine rectal examinations to assess labour progress (one study, 307 women and babies) Study in Ireland involving women in labour at term. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. Compared with routine rectal examinations, routine vaginal examinations may have little or no effect on: augmentation of labour (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.68; one study, 307 women); and spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.06; one study, 307 women). We found insufficient data to fully assess: neonatal infections (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.07; one study, 307 babies); and admission to NICU (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.73; one study, 307 babies). The study did not assess our other primary outcomes: positive birth experience; chorioamnionitis; maternal pain. Routine four-hourly vaginal examinations versus routine two-hourly examinations (one study, 150 women and babies) UK study involving primiparous women in labour at term. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. Compared with routine two-hourly vaginal examinations, routine four-hourly vaginal examinations may have little or no effect, with data compatible with both benefit and harm, on: augmentation of labour (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.57; one study, 109 women); and spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.26; one study, 150 women). The study did not assess our other primary outcomes: positive birth experience; chorioamnionitis; neonatal infection; admission to NICU; maternal pain. Routine vaginal examinations versus vaginal examinations as indicated (one study, 204 women and babies) Study in Malaysia involving primiparous women being induced at term. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as low. Compared with vaginal examinations as indicated, routine four-hourly vaginal examinations may result in more women having their labour augmented (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.03 to 6.31; one study, 204 women). There may be little or no effect on:

- spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.59; one study, 204 women);
- chorioamnionitis (RR 3.06, 95% CI 0.13 to 74.21; one study, 204 women);
- neonatal infection (RR 4.08, 95% CI 0.46 to 35.87; one study, 204 babies);
- admission to NICU (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.63 to 6.56; one study, 204 babies). The study did not assess our other primary outcomes of positive birth experience or maternal pain.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on these findings, we cannot be certain which method is most effective or acceptable for assessing labour progress. Further large-scale RCT trials are required. These should include essential clinical and experiential outcomes. This may be facilitated through the development of a tool to measure positive birth experiences. Data from qualitative studies are also needed to fully assess whether methods to evaluate labour progress meet women's needs for a safe and positive labour and birth, and if not, to develop an approach that does.

Case presentation

A 25 years old gravida 3, and para 2 (both are alive) mother presented with the complaint of advanced labor pain of 18 h duration. She came by ambulance transport from a 35 km distant rural health center to Bele Primary Hospital, Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia. The mother did not remember her last normal menstrual period but claims to be amenorrheic for the last 9 months. During the current pregnancy; she had no antenatal care visit, no history of vaginal bleeding, no abdominal pain, and no other danger signs of pregnancy. She has no previous history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and pelvic surgery. She has also no history of contraceptive use. Both her last deliveries were at home with no complications. During the physical examination, her vital signs were in the normal range. Pink conjunctiva and non-icteric sclera. On abdominal examination, 38 weeks sized uterus, fetal heart beat was 148 bpm, cephalic presentation, longitudinal lie, multiple fetal poles were not appreciated, there was 3 uterine contractions in 10 min with moderate strength and bladder was not distended. On the genito-urinary examination (per vagina), cervix was fully dilated, vertex presentation, fetal head visible at vulva, normal position, no sign of caput or molding, the membrane was ruptured with clean amniotic fluid.

Basic laboratory investigations were done, her hematocrit level was 35%, and her blood group was "O positive". Other serologic tests were also done for HIV, Hepatitis, and syphilis and all were negative and urine analysis was also negative for microscope exam.

Vaginal delivery summary, this mother gave birth to alive female neonate weighing 3300gm with an Apgar score of 8 and 9 in the 1 st and 5 th minutes respectively by spontaneous vaginal delivery and 3 rd stage of labor managed actively.

But after the delivery of the neonate, her abdomen shows three tumor features i.e. contracted 20 weeks sized uterus and palpable masses at both left and right upper quadrants. The mass was non-tender and slightly hard and smooth at the left side posterior to the uterus and irregular at the right side (Fig. 1). Bimanual exploration of the uterus was made to look for after coming 2 nd twin and speculum examination also performed to explore the presence of additional cervical canal and double uterus, but only one cervical opening was appreciated. The posterior fornix was bulged.

### Oxytocin [^ebefaa4f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage of oxytocin is determined by uterine response. The following dosage information is based upon the various regimens and indications in general use.

Induction or Stimulation of Labor

Intravenous infusion (drip method) is the only acceptable method of administration for the induction or stimulation of labor.

Accurate control of the rate of infusion flow is essential. An infusion pump or other such device and frequent monitoring of strength of contractions and fetal heart rate are necessary for the safe administration of oxytocin for the induction or stimulation of labor. If uterine contractions become too powerful, the infusion can be abruptly stopped, and oxytocic stimulation of the uterine musculature will soon wane.

An intravenous infusion of a non-oxytocin containing solution should be started. Physiologic electrolyte solutions should be used except under unusual circumstances.

To prepare the usual solution for intravenous infusion–one mL (10 units) is combined aseptically with 1,000 mL of a non-hydrating diluent.

The combined solution, rotated in the infusion bottle to insure thorough mixing, contains 10 mU/mL. Add the container with dilute oxytocic solution to the system through the use of a constant infusion pump or other such device to control accurately the rate of infusion.

The initial dose should be no more than 1 to 2 mU/min. The dose may be gradually increased in increments of no more than 1 to 2 mU/min., until a contraction pattern has been established which is similar to normal labor.

The fetal heart rate, resting uterine tone, and the frequency, duration, and force of contractions should be monitored.

The oxytocin infusion should be discontinued immediately in the event of uterine hyperactivity or fetal distress. Oxygen should be administered to the mother. The mother and fetus must be evaluated by the responsible physician.

Control of Postpartum Uterine Bleeding

Intravenous Infusion (Drip Method) — To control postpartum bleeding, 10 to 40 units of oxytocin may be added to 1,000 mL of a nonhydrating diluent and run at a rate necessary to control uterine atony.

Intramuscular Administration — 1 mL (10 units) of oxytocin can be given after delivery of the placenta.

Treatment of Incomplete or Inevitable Abortion

Intravenous infusion with physiologic saline solution, 500 mL, or 5% dextrose in physiologic saline solution to which 10 units of oxytocin have been added should be infused at a rate of 20 to 40 drops/minute.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Meconium passed in labor: how reassuring is clear amniotic fluid? [^d8c4c052]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Clear amniotic fluid is frequently considered a reassuring sign during labor. Our aim was to examine the incidence of meconium that can only have been passed intrapartum and to determine its neonatal associations and whether its absence is a useful sign.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of 8394 "low risk" laboring women at term with clear amniotic fluid at early amniotomy.

Results

Meconium was passed in 5.2% of labors but was not detected until delivery of the fetal head in 51.5% of these. It was associated with moderate-severe acidosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.21, 6.03), low Apgar score at 5 minutes (OR 6.49; 95% CI 2.73, 15.44), and neonatal seizures (OR 4.33; 95% CI 3.17, 5.93). However, the sensitivity for these outcomes of the intrapartum passage of meconium and, particularly, its detection before delivery was very poor.

Conclusion

Although correlated with adverse neonatal outcomes, most affected infants had clear amniotic fluid throughout labor. The presence of clear amniotic fluid is an unreliable sign of fetal well-being.

### Detection and risk stratification of women at high risk of preterm birth in rural communities near nagpur, India [^8295c3a5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Definition and risk stratification of HRPB

Women were classified as HRPB positive if they had one or more of the 4 following signs or symptoms of preterm labor during the risk period of week 24–36 of gestation: (1) intermittent abdominal pain or pain associated with blood-stained mucus discharge, watery vaginal discharge or a sudden gush of water (Signs of preterm labor); (2) watery vaginal discharge or a sudden gush of water with or without cramping (Premature rupture of membranes); (3) vaginal bleeding with or without cramping (hemorrhage), and (4) severe headache (hypertension). Risk of preterm birth was further stratified by the number of signs or symptoms present ranging from 0, 1, 2 or 3 or more. The HRPB definition did not include a history of previous preterm birth, a well-recognized predictor of preterm birth, because of the difficulty in obtaining a reliable history of previous spontaneous preterm birth in rural settings.

Intervention package to determine HRPB

The multifaceted HRPB package consisted of four components – i) training at multiple levels regarding signs or symptoms of preterm labor, ii) monitoring in the community between week 24 and 36 of gestation by community health worker or ASHA worker, iii) determination of whether the pregnant woman was positive using the HRPB signs or symptoms by ASHA worker in the community, and, iv) confirmation of the HRPB signs or symptoms by a health care provider (HCP) at the Primary Health Center (PHC), sub-center (SC) or other referral facility to determine eligibility for administration of ACT in a woman who is brought to the center by an ASHA or who is self referred.

### Transmural vaginal-to-bladder injury from an obstructed labor pattern [^26485f19]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A vesicovaginal fistula, among other devastating sequelae, is a complication that can arise from obstetric trauma such as prolonged obstructed labor patterns. These are rarely seen as obstetric-related complications in well-developed countries. They are thought to arise from direct ischemic injury that can occur between the fetal head and the adjacent tissues.

Case

A patient presented to the emergency room in obstructed labor. Examination revealed a crowning fetal head, no fetal heart tones, and purulent vaginal discharge. Postpartum, the patient experienced irritative voiding symptoms, vaginal stenosis, and cystoscopic evidence of injury to the bladder base.

Conclusion

These findings may provide evidence of the transmural vaginal-to-bladder damage that can occur from obstructed labor.

### Anaphylaxis during pregnancy [^641b0104]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis during pregnancy, labor, and delivery can be catastrophic for the mother and, especially, the infant. Symptoms and signs can include intense vulvar and vaginal itching, low back pain, uterine cramps, fetal distress, and preterm labor. During the first 3 trimesters, etiologies are similar to those in nonpregnant women. During labor and delivery, common etiologies are β-lactam antibiotics, natural rubber latex, and other agents used in medical and perioperative settings. Important caveats in management include injecting epinephrine (adrenaline) promptly, providing high-flow supplemental oxygen, positioning the mother on her left side to improve venous return to the heart, maintaining a minimum maternal systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg to ensure adequate placental perfusion, and continuous electronic monitoring. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cesarean delivery should be performed when indicated. In all women of child-bearing age, allergy/immunology specialists can help to prevent anaphylaxis in pregnancy through prepregnancy risk assessment and risk reduction strategies, such as confirming the etiology of systemic allergic reactions, providing written instructions for allergen avoidance, and initiating relevant immune modulation. In pregnant women the benefits versus risks of skin tests, challenge tests, desensitization, and initiation of immunotherapy with allergens should be carefully weighed; if possible, these procedures should be deferred until after parturition. Prospective interdisciplinary studies of anaphylaxis during pregnancy are needed.

### Duration of second stage of labor and instrumental delivery as risk factors for severe perineal lacerations: population-based study [^8b8bc39e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We conclude that the risk of severe perineal lacerations increases during the first 3 hours of second stage of labor and thereafter remains relatively unchanged. Risk factors for perineal lacerations were instrumental delivery, large fetal size and occiput posterior position. This important information should be considered when weighting the risks and benefits of performing instrumental delivery, especially if the goal is to reduce the risk of maternal perineal trauma. We suggest that the decision to perform an instrumental vaginal delivery should be weighed against the option of continuing labor in the setting of reassuring maternal and fetal status. Unless there are signs of fetal distress or strong maternal discomfort, continuing labor may enable significant proportion of women to achieve spontaneous vaginal delivery, and thus lead to decrease in severe perineal lacerations.

### Operative vaginal birth: ACOG practice bulletin, number 219 [^da72df9f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Operative vaginal birth — indications and benefits — is used to achieve or expedite safe vaginal birth for maternal or fetal indications, with examples including maternal exhaustion and inability to push effectively; medical indications such as maternal cardiac disease and a need to avoid pushing in the second stage of labor; prolonged second stage of labor, arrest of descent, or rotation of the fetal head; and nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns in the second stage of labor; it is beneficial for women because it avoids cesarean birth and its associated morbidities whose short-term risks include hemorrhage, infection, prolonged healing time, and increased cost, while long-term morbidities include a high likelihood of repeat cesarean birth, complications after cesarean birth, and placental abnormalities such as placenta accreta; for fetuses with possible compromise, successful operative vaginal birth can shorten exposure to additional labor and reduce or prevent intrapartum insults and often can be safely accomplished more quickly than cesarean birth.

### Inducing labor after fetal demise: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of mifepristone and misoprostol combination versus misoprostol alone [^911a809b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), one of the most tragic outcomes of pregnancy, affects approximately 1% of pregnancies. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines IUFD as the death of a fetus at 28 weeks of gestation or later, with a fetal weight of at least 1000 g. Several factors can contribute to IUFD, including maternal systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus and hypertension, as well as fetal factors such as infections, immune hemolytic disorders, umbilical cord accidents, metabolic abnormalities, congenital anomalies, and placental insufficiency.

Over 90% of women experiencing intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) go into spontaneous labor within three weeks following the fetus's death. Nonetheless, earlier medical intervention is frequently vital to address potential risks to the mother, such as emotional distress, psychological trauma, and physical complications. This intervention might begin at the mother's request or be advised by healthcare practitioners to avert negative outcomes. Postponing evacuation raises the risk of coagulation disorders and intrauterine infections by approximately 10%, which can detrimentally impact the woman's physical, psychological, and social health. In light of these possible complications after IUFD, timely labor induction is essential. Inducing labor in cases of IUFD can often be more complex than in live births, likely because fetal demise usually occurs during the second or early third trimester, a period when the cervix remains immature and the uterus is less responsive to oxytocin.

The ideal medication for pregnancy termination should not only be effective and safe but also cost-effective to reduce the financial burden on patients. Prostaglandins are commonly used to induce labor in cases of IUFD, particularly when the cervix is immature, as has been studied extensively. Among these, misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analog, is widely used due to its low cost, stability at room temperature, and ease of use. Misoprostol functions by attaching to prostaglandin receptors in the myometrium, which triggers uterine contractions and aids in cervical ripening. This twofold effect enhances cervical softening, dilation, and uterine contractions required for inducing labor. Its adaptability across different administration methods — oral, vaginal, sublingual, or buccal — makes it suitable for diverse clinical situations scenarios. However, while effective, misoprostol is not without side effects. Common adverse effects include fever, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, and headache. The most serious potential complications are abnormal uterine activity, such as tachysystole or uterine rupture, particularly in cases of high or repeated dosages.

### Vernixuria: another sign of uterine rupture [^4357530a]. Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Uterine rupture complicates approximately 1% of trials of labor after cesarean. Classic signs and symptoms include loss of station, cessation of labor, vaginal bleeding, fetal distress, and abdominal pain. Other signs are also possible. We report a case of uterine rupture at VBAC trial that includes an unusual clinical sign of uterine rupture: vernix caseosa observed in the urine of the parturient. During labor, a bladder catheter was inserted to evaluate oliguria. Vernix caseosa and blood were found in the tubing. Prompt cesarean delivery followed. A tear extending from the original transverse scar into the bladder dome was found. Vernixuria is an additional sign of uterine rupture.

### Misoprostol [^1183e9d6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Labor and delivery

Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting.

The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture.

The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol.

Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate.

The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown.

The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation.

### Intrapartum fetal monitoring [^f5fd73a6]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Continuous electronic fetal monitoring was developed to screen for signs of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and impending fetal death during labor. Because these events have a low prevalence, continuous electronic fetal monitoring has a false-positive rate of 99%. The widespread use of continuous electronic fetal monitoring has increased operative and cesarean delivery rates without improved neonatal outcomes, but its use is appropriate in high-risk labor. Structured intermittent auscultation is an underused form of fetal monitoring; when employed during low-risk labor, it can lower rates of operative and cesarean deliveries with neonatal outcomes similar to those of continuous electronic fetal monitoring. However, structured intermittent auscultation remains difficult to implement because of barriers in nurse staffing and physician oversight. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development terminology is used when reviewing continuous electronic fetal monitoring and delineates fetal risk by three categories. Category I tracings reflect a lack of fetal acidosis and do not require intervention. Category II tracings are indeterminate, are present in the majority of laboring patients, and can encompass monitoring predictive of clinically normal to rapidly developing acidosis. Presence of moderate fetal heart rate variability and accelerations with absence of recurrent pathologic decelerations provides reassurance that acidosis is not present. Category II tracing abnormalities can be addressed by treating reversible causes and providing intrauterine resuscitation, which includes stopping uterine-stimulating agents, fetal scalp stimulation and/or maternal repositioning, intravenous fluids, or oxygen. Recurrent deep variable decelerations can be corrected with amnioinfusion. Category III tracings are highly concerning for fetal acidosis, and delivery should be expedited if immediate interventions do not improve the tracing.

### The purple line as a measure of labour progress: a longitudinal study [^98c34195]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal examination (VE) and assessment of the cervix is currently considered to be the gold standard for assessment of labour progress. It is however inherently imprecise with studies indicating an overall accuracy for determining the diameter of the cervix at between 48–56%. Furthermore, VEs can be unpleasant, intrusive and embarrassing for women, and are associated with the risk of introducing infection. In light of increasing concern world wide about the use of routine interventions in labour it may be time to consider alternative, less intrusive means of assessing progress in labour. The presence of a purple line during labour, seen to rise from the anal margin and extend between the buttocks as labour progresses has been reported. The study described in this paper aimed to assess in what percentage of women in labour a purple line was present, clear and measurable and to determine if any relationship existed between the length of the purple line and cervical dilatation and/or station of the fetal head.

Methods

This longitudinal study observed 144 women either in spontaneous labour (n = 112) or for induction of labour (n = 32) from admission through to final VE. Women were examined in the lateral position and midwives recorded the presence or absence of the line throughout labour immediately before each VE. Where present, the length of the line was measured using a disposable tape measure. Within subjects correlation, chi-squared test for independence, and independent samples t-test were used to analyse the data.

Results

The purple line was seen at some point in labour for 109 women (76%). There was a medium positive correlation between length of the purple line and cervical dilatation (r = +0.36, n = 66, P = 0.0001) and station of the fetal head (r = +0.42, n = 56, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

The purple line does exist and there is a medium positive correlation between its length and both cervical dilatation and station of the fetal head. Where the line is present, it may provide a useful guide for clinicians of labour progress along side other measures. Further research is required to assess whether measurement of the line is acceptable to women in labour and also clinicians.

### A randomized trial that compared intravaginal misoprostol and dinoprostone vaginal insert in pregnancies at high risk of fetal distress [^85b1f159]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of misoprostol and dinoprostone in pregnancies at high risk of fetal distress.

Study Design

Medical indications for the induction of labor with postdate pregnancy or intrauterine growth restriction were randomized. A sequential design that was based on the triangular test was used.

Results

At the fourth interim analysis, which included 140 patients, the trial was stopped because no significant difference was found in neonatal safety between misoprostol and dinoprostone, which was assessed on arterial cord pH < 7.20 (14.3% vs 10.0%, respectively; P = 0.60). Neonatal tolerance was similar in the 2 groups, with no difference in the cesarean delivery rate for fetal distress or in the incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Time to vaginal delivery was shortened by misoprostol (P = 0.03).

Conclusion

Misoprostol and dinoprostone are equally safe for the induction of labor in pregnancies that are at high risk of fetal distress; however, misoprostol allowed the earlier induction of labor than did dinoprostone.

### Development and validation of a predictive model to identify the active phase of labor [^4b16f459]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study developed a predictive model for the onset of the active phase of labor based on maternal signs and symptoms. The predictive performance of the model on the diagnosis of cervical dilatation more than 4 cm suggests its implementation into clinical practice.

A validated tool based on maternal signs and symptoms would facilitate the initial midwifery assessment process and improve midwives' confidence and skills, thus embracing a holistic approach to diagnose the onset of the active phase of labor, with the ultimate aim of minimizing interventions. In particular, the tool might be used as a supportive guide to differentiate women who have a valid reason to be assessed through a vaginal examination from the ones who would beneficiate to be discharged home or of a further observation.

In a continuity model of care context, the implementation of this tool might represent a way to achieve a safe and a high quality midwifery care, supporting midwives in the decision making process.

The analysis of classification errors is useful to identify appropriate predictive probability thresholds based on different settings of care and women's characteristics, adapting the assessment tool to different management of midwifery care.

Further research are warranted to investigate how this tool might associate with maternal and neonatal outcomes, including women's birth experience.

Moreover, the predictive performance of the assessment tool should be evaluated in different settings and in specific women's subgroups.

### Dinoprostone (Cervidil) [^ff13d8f2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 For Hospital Use Only

CERVIDIL should be administered in a hospital setting with an obstetrical care facility.

5.2 Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation

CERVIDIL should be used with caution in women at high risk of postpartum disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Physiologic or pharmacologic induction of labor, including the use of CERVIDIL, is associated with an increased risk of DIC during the postpartum period. Women aged 30 years or older, those with complications during pregnancy and those with a gestational age over 40 weeks have an increased risk of DIC during the postpartum period. As soon as possible, assess for an evolving fibrinolysis in the immediate post-partum period. Therapy consisting of prompt removal of the source of procoagulant material, replacement of depleted clotting factors and, in some cases, anti-coagulation with heparin should be instituted promptly.

5.3 Amniotic Fluid Embolism Syndrome

The use of dinoprostone-containing products, including CERVIDIL, can result in inadvertent disruption and subsequent embolization of antigenic tissue causing the development of Amniotic Fluid Embolism Syndrome, a rare and often fatal obstetric condition.

Carefully monitor patients for clinical signs of Amniotic Fluid Embolism Syndrome including hypotension, hypoxemia and respiratory failure, DIC, coma or seizures and provide supportive care as needed.

5.4 Uterine Tachysystole and Uterine Hypersystole/Hypertonicity

The use of CERVIDIL may cause uterine tachysystole with or without fetal heart rate changes (see Table 1). While using CERVIDIL, carefully monitor uterine activity, fetal status and the progression of cervical dilatation and effacement. Remove CERVIDIL with any evidence of uterine tachysystole, uterine hypersystole/hypertonicity, fetal distress, or if labor commences. CERVIDIL is contraindicated when prolonged contraction of the uterus is detrimental to fetal safety or uterine integrity, such as previous cesarean section or major uterine surgery, because of the risk of uterine rupture and obstetrical complications (e.g., need for hysterectomy and the occurrence of fetal or neonatal death). Prostaglandins, including CERVIDIL, may potentiate the effect of oxytocin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Remove CERVIDIL at least 30 minutes before administration of an oxytocic agent is initiated and continue to carefully monitor uterine activity. Remove CERVIDIL prior to amniotomy or following rupture of membranes because the higher vaginal pH that occurs with rupture of membranes may result in higher release rate of dinoprostone.

### Common peripartum emergencies… [^e7c33f13]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

When fetal well-being is in question, the fetal heart tracing may offer clues to the etiology of the problem. Repetitive late decelerations of the fetal heart rate may signal utero-placental insufficiency. Deep, prolonged decelerations or sudden bradycardia during the second stage of labor suggest cord compression, for which expeditious delivery often results in a good perinatal outcome. 4 Sinusoidal tracings are frequently associated with critically distressed fetuses. Nonreactive tracings are not in themselves ominous, provided that short-term variability is normal. 5 Repetitive variable decelerations suggest umbilical cord compression, especially in the presence of oligohydramnios or amniotomy. It is extremely important to verify that fluid is flowing from the vagina and that volume overload is not occurring. Amnioinfusion should not be performed if there are late decelerations, a fetal scalp pH of less than 7.

2, abruptio placentae, placenta previa, previous vertical uterine incision or known uterine anomalies. Another etiology to consider is uterine rupture, which may cause fetal distress before vaginal bleeding and pain begin. Prolonged fetal heart rate decelerations have also been reported after the administration of epidural anesthesia, even when maternal blood pressure is normal. 11 Regardless of the etiology of the nonreassuring fetal tracing, general measures to improve fetal oxygenation may help while the fetal tracing is monitored. Placenta previa should be ruled out when a patient has copious vaginal bleeding. The classic presentation of placenta previa is painless vaginal bleeding and a soft, nontender uterus. If readily available, ultrasonography should be performed immediately, since placenta previa can be quickly and accurately diagnosed by ultrasound examination.

16 When ultrasonography is not available, gentle speculum examination may be considered, as long as the bleeding is not brisk. This examination should be performed with a "double set-up" in case immediate cesarean section is required. A history of abrupt onset of vaginal bleeding that began with rupture of membranes suggests vasa previa, especially when bleeding is accompanied by decreased fetal movement and a nonreassuring fetal tracing. Urgent cesarean section is generally performed. The differential diagnosis of antepartum vaginal bleeding also includes normal "bloody show" and mucopurulent cervicitis. Vasa previa should be suspected when bloody show is excessive.

### Dinoprostone (Cervidil) [^8fb1bb27]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosage Instructions

Administer one CERVIDIL insert (10 mg) intravaginally for use up to 12 hours (approximately 0.3 mg of dinoprostone is released per hour) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Monitor uterine activity, fetal status, and the progression of cervical dilatation and effacement with the use of CERVIDIL. Remove CERVIDIL 12 hours after insertion with the onset of active labor, prior to an amniotomy, occurrence of uterine tachysystole, uterine hypersystole/hypertonicity, or fetal distress [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Remove CERVIDIL at least 30 minutes prior to administering an oxytocic agent [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

2.2 Preparation and Administration Instructions

CERVIDIL should be administered only by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities.

Preparation and Administration Instructions

Keep CERVIDIL frozen until ready for use. Do not warm CERVIDIL prior to vaginal insertion.
Tear open the individually-wrapped foil package containing CERVIDIL along the tear mark. Never open the package using scissors or other sharp objects because this may damage the knitted polyester retrieval system. Do not cut the retrieval system and do not use CERVIDIL unless its retrieval system is intact.
Immediately after opening the package, insert CERVIDIL transversely, in the posterior fornix of the vagina (see Figure 1). If necessary, use a minimal amount of water-miscible lubricant to assist vaginal insertion. Do not permit excess contact or coating with the lubricant, as this could prevent release of dinoprostone from the vaginal insert. Insertion does not require sterile conditions.
Tuck some of the excess retrieval system into the vagina to avoid movement of CERVIDIL away from the proper position; however, leave a small amount of the retrieval system outside the vagina to aid in retrieval.
Instruct women to remain in a recumbent position during insertion of CERVIDIL and for 2 hours afterward. Women may be ambulatory 2 hours after insertion; however, ensure that the insert remains in place.

2.3 Removal Instructions

To retrieve, locate the retrieval system and pull it gently until CERVIDIL is fully removed.
Upon removal of CERVIDIL, it is essential to perform a visual inspection to ensure that the slab has been removed, as it will continue delivering the active ingredient.

Previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes — recognition and immediate management of suspected intraamniotic infection are described as follows: clinical symptoms of infection may be less overt at earlier gestational ages; intraamniotic infection is often diagnosed clinically on the basis of maternal temperature ≥ 38°C and ≥ 1 other signs or symptoms of infection (eg, maternal tachycardia, purulent cervical discharge, fetal tachycardia, uterine tenderness), but some cases may not initially present with a maternal fever, and appropriate intervention with antibiotics and abortion care should not be delayed because of the absence of maternal fever; although amniocentesis may be helpful in diagnosing intraamniotic infection, it should not delay clinical management; other contraindications to expectant management, including hemorrhage and fetal demise, should prompt abortion care or delivery and evacuation of uterine contents; and decisions regarding the type of abortion care (procedural or medication abortion) should prioritize the safety of the pregnant person with consideration of maternal stability, gestational age, and availability of clinicians able to provide procedural abortion care.

### Hospital stay for healthy term newborn infants [^23a3ea69]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Recommendations — term newborn discharge criteria: The length of stay of a healthy term newborn should be based on the unique characteristics of each mother-infant dyad, and input from the mother and her obstetrical care provider and nursing staff should be considered to encourage on-demand breastfeeding and to ensure simultaneous discharge. It is recommended that the following minimum criteria be met before discharge of a term newborn, defined as an infant born between 37–0/7 and 41–6/7 weeks of gestation after an uncomplicated pregnancy, labor, and delivery: Clinical course and physical examination reveal no abnormalities that require continued hospitalization, and the infant's vital signs are within normal ranges and stable for the 12 hours preceding discharge, including an axillary temperature of 36.5°C to 37.4°C (97.7–99.3°F), a respiratory rate below 60 per minute with no other signs of respiratory distress, and an awake heart rate of 100 to 190 beats per minute; heart rates as low as 70 beats per minute while sleeping quietly are acceptable, whereas sustained heart rates near or above the upper end of this range may require further evaluation.

### Immediate versus deferred delivery of the preterm baby with suspected fetal compromise for improving outcomes [^0ac3192d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Immediate delivery of the preterm fetus with suspected compromise may decrease the risk of damage due to intrauterine hypoxia. However, it may also increase the risks of prematurity.

Objectives

To assess the effects of immediate versus deferred delivery of preterm babies with suspected fetal compromise on neonatal, maternal and long-term outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing a policy of immediate delivery with deferred delivery or expectant management in preterm fetuses with suspected in utero compromise. Quasi-randomised trials and trials employing a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

We included one trial of 548 women (588 babies) in the review. Women with pregnancies between 24 and 36 weeks' gestation took part. The study took place in 13 European countries, between 1993 and 2001. The difference in the median randomisation to delivery interval between immediate delivery and deferred delivery was four days (median: 0.9 (inter-quartile range (IQR) 0.4 to 1.3) days for immediate delivery, median: 4.9 (IQR 2.0 to 10.8) days in the delay group). There was no clear difference in the primary outcomes of extended perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 2.04, one trial, 587 babies, moderate-quality evidence) or the composite outcome of death or disability at or after two years of age (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.75, one trial, 573 babies, moderate-quality evidence) with immediate delivery compared to deferred delivery. The results for these outcomes are consistent with both appreciable benefit and harm. More babies in the immediate delivery group were ventilated for more than 24 hours (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.97, one trial, 576 babies). There were no differences between the immediate delivery and deferred delivery groups in any other infant mortality outcome (stillbirth, neonatal mortality, postneonatal mortality > 28 days to discharge), individual neonatal morbidity or markers of neonatal morbidity (cord pH less than 7.00, Apgar less than seven at five minutes, convulsions, interventricular haemorrhage or germinal matrix haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis and periventricular leucomalacia or ventriculomegaly). Some important outcomes were not reported, in particular infant admission to neonatal intensive care or special care facility, and respiratory distress syndrome. We were not able to calculate composite rates of serious neonatal morbidity, even though individual morbidities were reported, due to the risk of double counting infants with more than one morbidity. More children in the immediate delivery group had cerebral palsy at or after two years of age (RR 5.88, 95% CI 1.33 to 26.02, one trial, 507 children). There were, however, no differences in neurodevelopment impairment at or after two years (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.41, one trial, 507 children), death at or after two years of age (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.63, one trial, 573 children), or death or disability in childhood (six to 13 years of age) (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.40, one trial, 302 children). More women in the immediate delivery group had caesarean delivery than in the deferred delivery group (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.24, one trial, 547 women, high-quality evidence). Data were not available on any other maternal outcomes. There were several methodological weaknesses in the included study, and the level of evidence for the primary outcomes was graded high for caesarean section and moderate for extended perinatal mortality and death or disability at or after two years. The evidence was downgraded because the CIs for these outcomes were wide, and were consistent with both appreciable benefit and harm. Bias may have been introduced by several factors: blinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention, data for childhood follow-up were incomplete due to attrition, and no adjustment was made in the analysis for the non-independence of babies from multiple pregnancies (39 out of 548 pregnancies). This study only included cases of suspected fetal compromise where there was uncertainty whether immediate delivery was indicated, thus results must be interpreted with caution.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently there is insufficient evidence on the benefits and harms of immediate delivery compared with deferred delivery in cases of suspected fetal compromise at preterm gestations to make firm recommendations. There is a lack of trials addressing this question, and limitations of the one included trial means that caution must be used in interpreting and generalising the findings. More research is needed to guide clinical practice. Although the included trial is relatively large, it has insufficient power to detect differences in neonatal mortality. It did not report any maternal outcomes other than mode of delivery, or evaluate maternal satisfaction or economic outcomes. The applicability of the findings is limited by several factors: Women with a wide range of obstetric complications and gestational ages were included, and subgroup analysis is currently limited. Advances in Doppler assessment techniques may diagnose severe compromise more accurately and help make decisions about the timing of delivery. The potential benefits of deferring delivery for longer or shorter periods cannot be presumed. Where there is uncertainty whether or not to deliver a preterm fetus with suspected fetal compromise, there seems to be no benefit to immediate delivery. Deferring delivery until test results worsen or increasing gestation favours delivery may improve the outcomes for mother and baby. There is a need for high-quality randomised controlled trials comparing immediate and deferred delivery where there is suspected fetal compromise at preterm gestations to guide clinical practice. Future trials should report all important outcomes, and should be adequately powered to detect differences in maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine GRADE recommendations — classification and implications used in this Obstetric Care Consensus are summarized as follows: Recommendations are classified as either strong (Grade 1) or weak (Grade 2), and quality of evidence is classified as high (Grade A), moderate (Grade B), and low (Grade C), yielding six possibilities (1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C). For strong recommendations, strong recommendations can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation, and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. For weak recommendations, best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients or societal values; alternative approaches likely to be better for some patients under some circumstances; and very weak recommendation indicates other alternatives may be equally reasonable.

At admission, women with signs and symptoms of labor or with rupture of membranes at < 37 weeks and 0 days' gestation should be screened for GBS colonization unless a vaginal-rectal GBS screen was performed within the preceding 5 weeks (AII). Women with signs and symptoms of preterm labor who have unknown GBS colonization status at admission or a positive GBS screen within the preceding 5 weeks should receive GBS prophylaxis at hospital admission (AII).

### Prelabor rupture of membranes: ACOG practice bulletin, number 217 [^1fa5b16e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes — expectant management and surveillance generally involve hospital admission with periodic assessment for infection, abruptio placentae, umbilical cord compression, fetal well-being, and labor, with an acceptable strategy including periodic ultrasonographic monitoring of fetal growth and periodic fetal heart rate monitoring. A temperature elevation may indicate intrauterine infection, diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion because early signs and symptoms may be subtle, and in the absence of fever criteria such as abdominal or fundal tenderness and maternal or fetal tachycardia have variable sensitivity and specificity; serial monitoring of leukocyte counts and other inflammatory markers have not been proved useful and are nonspecific without clinical evidence of infection, especially after antenatal corticosteroids.

### First and second stage labor management: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 8 [^3434802f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Labor and labor arrest definitions — normal labor is defined as the presence of regular and painful uterine contractions resulting in cervical dilation or effacement or both. The first stage of labor is defined as the interval between onset of labor and complete or 10 cm cervical dilation and is divided into latent and active phases. The latent phase is characterized by gradual and relatively slower cervical dilation that starts on perception of regular uterine contractions and ends when rapid cervical change initiates, after which the active phase of labor continues until complete cervical dilation. The second stage of labor commences at 10 cm cervical dilation and ends on delivery of the neonate, and the third stage of labor is the period between delivery of the neonate and delivery of the placenta.

### Diagnosing onset of labor: a systematic review of definitions in the research literature [^3f2d38a9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

A definition of labor onset that uses both endocrine levels and observable signs and symptoms might provide a reliable and valid measure at some point in the future. In practical terms, what is needed is a point in time after which labor should not only be expected to continue among healthy women, but beyond which, failure to progress would require intervention on the part of the caregiver to prevent subsequent maternal and neonatal morbidity.

Studies in our review were more likely to focus on active phase of labor than latent phase labor, which is of concern given the adverse outcomes associated with early hospital admission in latent phase labor. A strong consensus around the definition of onset of latent phase labor is needed to ensure comparability of research findings, and subsequently to guide clinical diagnosis and intervention. Understanding when the transition between the latent and active phases of labor takes places is essential for designing initiatives to assist women to remain out of hospital during latent phase labor.

RESULTS

Prospective assessment of information provided to pregnant patients

A total of 595 women were eligible and were contacted. Of these, 138 agreed to complete the questionnaire. Fifty‐nine participants (43%) were in their first pregnancy (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Parity of participants.

The framework analysis of the answers to open‐ended questions highlighted different themes.

First question 'What do you know about labour?'

From the online National Health Service (NHS) data dictionary, the definition of labour is 'Labour is a period of time when there are painful contractions and changes to the cervix that result in the birth of a baby and end with the expulsion of the placenta and membranes'.
Framework analysis of the answers to this question highlighted the themes given in Table 2.

TABLE 2
Themes highlighted by framework analysis of answers to 'What do you know about labour?'.

Thirty‐five women (25.36%), all at their first or second pregnancy, gave a more accurate definition of labour, listing the main signs and symptoms (release of mucous plug, water break, starting of contractions and increasing frequency of contractions) as part of information received by midwives and doctors. This information was provided by health professionals to instruct women about when would be the proper time to attend hospital. The remaining 103 participants (74.64%) were not able to give a complete answer about labour (Table 2).

Diagnosis and monitoring for uterine rupture during TOLAC include clinician evaluation and continuous fetal assessment: Once labor has begun, a patient attempting TOLAC should be evaluated by an obstetrician or other obstetric care provider, and most authorities recommend continuous electronic fetal monitoring. There are no data to suggest that intrauterine pressure catheters or fetal scalp electrodes are superior to external forms of continuous monitoring, and there is evidence that the use of intrauterine pressure catheters does not help in the diagnosis of uterine rupture. Personnel familiar with the potential complications of TOLAC should be present, uterine rupture often is sudden and may be catastrophic, and no accurate antenatal predictors of uterine rupture have been identified. Acute signs and symptoms may include fetal bradycardia, increased uterine contractions, vaginal bleeding, loss of fetal station, or new onset of intense uterine pain, and the most common sign indicative of uterine rupture is fetal heart rate abnormality, which has been associated with up to 70% of cases of uterine ruptures. Therefore, continuous fetal heart rate monitoring during TOLAC is recommended.

### Uterine contractions preceding labor [^f79df920]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether 12 contractions in 1 hour is a meaningful signal that spontaneous labor has begun or is imminent.

Methods

This prospective observational cohort study includes all women reporting contractions who presented to a labor and delivery triage unit between August 1 and October 31, 2006, who met the following criteria: 1) 36 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks of gestation, 2) cervical dilation less than 4 cm, 3) intact membranes, and 4) no other medical or obstetric complications that might influence admission. Each woman received external fetal monitoring for a minimum of 1 hour. Women were discharged home if cervical dilation did not advance and the fetal heart rate pattern was reassuring. Women who progressed to a cervical dilation of 4 cm were admitted with the diagnosis of labor.

Results

Among 768 women studied, labor was diagnosed within 24 hours in 268 (76%) with 12 or more contractions per hour compared with 216 (52%) of 416 women with fewer than 12 contractions per hour, P < .001. Cervical condition and fetal station were more advanced on presentation in women with 12 or more contractions per hour.

Conclusion

Twelve contractions or more per hour at term is a meaningful signal that true labor has either begun or is imminent.

Analgesia during TOLAC is summarized as follows: No evidence suggests that epidural analgesia is a causal risk factor for unsuccessful TOLAC, and therefore epidural analgesia for labor may be used as part of TOLAC, with adequate pain relief potentially encouraging more women to choose TOLAC. However, epidural analgesia should not be considered necessary, and effective regional analgesia should not be expected to mask signs or symptoms of uterine rupture, particularly because the most common sign of rupture is fetal heart tracing abnormalities.
