## Question

Differential ventilation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about differential ventilation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining differential ventilation and its core indications. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic rationale and when it is most compelling. Next, I will review the clinical evidence by scenario, including single-lung transplant, bronchopleural fistula, and ARDS, and I should double-check the strength of evidence in each. After that, I need to examine technical implementation, monitoring, and safety. Finally, I will integrate guideline perspectives, identify knowledge gaps, and outline a cautious, clinically grounded approach with explicit uncertainties and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope. Differential ventilation refers to independent control of ventilation parameters to each lung or lung unit when there is marked asymmetry in mechanics, perfusion, or injury, typically via a double-lumen tube, bronchial blocker, or specialized circuits that allow separate tidal volume, PEEP, and frequency settings, with the goal of optimizing gas exchange while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury in heterogeneous lungs.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about indications. I should verify where the pathophysiologic rationale is strongest: single-lung transplant with native lung hyperinflation, bronchopleural fistula with persistent air leak, and severe asymmetric ARDS with markedly different regional compliance or perfusion are the classic scenarios where differential ventilation has been described, but the evidentiary base varies widely from case series to bench and animal models, so I need to be careful about overgeneralization [^117JrGVZ] [^116E8kTM] [^114mLmnd].

> Next, I should review the single-lung transplant evidence. A retrospective series of 13 patients with acute severe native lung hyperinflation after emphysema transplant showed a rapid improvement in PaO2 and suggested that a dynamic compliance ratio of native to donor lung exceeding about 2.7 predicts the need for differential ventilation; importantly, this is low-credibility evidence, so I should treat it as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^117JrGVZ]. Let me also confirm guideline positioning: the EACTAIC/SCA/ISHLT consensus advises keeping the double-lumen tube and considering differential ventilation if the patient cannot be extubated and does not tolerate bilateral ventilation with the same settings, which aligns with a cautious, physiology-guided approach in this niche [^115nDMXk].

> I will now examine bronchopleural fistula. Case reports describe successful use of differential ventilation with or without ECMO for traumatic or persistent fistulae, and bench modeling of high-frequency jet ventilation suggests that higher frequencies and lower driving pressures reduce leak, but wait, let me verify the clinical applicability — these are low-credibility data and require careful patient selection and close monitoring for efficacy and complications [^116E8kTM] [^116AGRDR].

> For ARDS, I need to check the strength of evidence. Most reports are case-based or experimental, including reexpansion pulmonary edema and surgical contexts, and while personalized ventilation is an emerging theme in ARDS, contemporary guidelines still anchor care in lung-protective strategies and prone positioning rather than routine differential ventilation; thus, any use here should be exceptional and physiology-driven rather than standard [^113gcAUw] [^112dDD7E] [^115msUwt].

> Let me consider the technical implementation details. Double-lumen endotracheal tubes are the conventional approach for lung separation, with bronchial blockers as alternatives when anatomy or timing precludes DLT, and I should confirm that modern devices and standards exist to support safe deployment; indeed, FDA-recognized standards and 510(k) clearances document differential ventilation tubes and accessories, which supports feasibility when indicated [^116Vv3kQ] [^113zczQ7]. But wait, what if resources are constrained? Emergency ventilator-sharing systems like iSAVE have demonstrated differential PEEP and tidal volume delivery in bench and animal models, yet these remain investigational and require paralysis, sedation, and vigilant monitoring if considered in crisis settings [^114gwx7A] [^1119npje].

> I should double-check monitoring and safety. Independent pressure and flow monitoring for each lung, serial blood gases, and imaging to assess recruitment and avoid overdistension are essential, and I need to ensure that ventilator displays and sensors accurately reflect delivered volumes because errors can exceed 10% depending on sensor type and location, which can mislead titration in asymmetric lungs [^112g7URv]. Let me verify that guidelines emphasize continuous reassessment of driving pressure, plateau pressures, and oxygenation response when personalizing ventilator settings, which is even more critical in differential ventilation [^116ZoG9q].

> Next, I should review the broader guideline context to avoid overpromising. Major ARDS guidelines prioritize low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning in moderate-to-severe disease, and careful PEEP titration, with conditional recommendations for higher PEEP in moderate-to-severe ARDS and explicit cautions about heterogeneity of treatment effects; none endorse routine differential ventilation, reinforcing that it should be reserved for refractory cases with clear asymmetry and after standard measures fail [^116ZoG9q] [^112dDD7E] [^115msUwt].

> Hold on, I should verify the key knowledge gaps. We lack randomized trials of differential ventilation, standardized selection criteria, and validated monitoring thresholds to predict benefit; moreover, the risk of misclassification in ARDS subphenotyping can derail personalized strategies, as highlighted by the LIVE trial, so any future trials of differential ventilation will need robust, real-time phenotyping and careful endpoint selection [^111DHfPK] [^112GuYKj].

> Let me synthesize a cautious clinical approach. Differential ventilation is best viewed as a rescue strategy for specific scenarios: single-lung transplant with native lung hyperinflation, refractory bronchopleural fistula, or severe asymmetric ARDS with markedly disparate compliance or perfusion, after exhausting standard lung-protective measures and prone positioning; implementation requires expert airway management, independent lung monitoring, and continuous reassessment of gas exchange, hemodynamics, and ventilator mechanics, with a low threshold to abandon the strategy if no clear benefit emerges [^115nDMXk] [^112dDD7E] [^116ZoG9q].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Differential ventilation is a niche, physiology-guided intervention with low-credibility evidence that can be lifesaving in select contexts but should not replace evidence-based ARDS care; its use should be exceptional, carefully monitored, and ideally embedded in prospective data collection to advance our understanding and define who truly benefits from this approach [^117JrGVZ] [^116E8kTM] [^112dDD7E].

---

Differential ventilation is a **specialized strategy** for patients with markedly asymmetric lung mechanics or pathology, such as single-lung transplant with native lung hyperinflation, bronchopleural fistula, or severe unilateral lung injury. It allows **independent control of each lung** to optimize gas exchange while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury, but requires a double-lumen tube or bronchial blocker and close monitoring. Evidence is limited to case series and small studies, so it should be reserved for refractory cases after standard lung-protective strategies fail, with careful attention to complications like tube malposition, barotrauma, and infection.

---

## Indications and clinical scenarios

Differential ventilation is indicated in **select scenarios** with asymmetric lung mechanics or pathology:

- **Single-lung transplantation**: Native lung hyperinflation causing mediastinal shift, impaired venous return, and severe V/Q mismatch [^117JrGVZ].
- **Bronchopleural fistula**: Persistent air leak despite conservative management, where isolating the affected lung reduces leak and improves ventilation [^116E8kTM].
- **Severe unilateral lung injury**: Marked asymmetry in compliance or resistance, such as unilateral pneumonia, contusion, or reexpansion pulmonary edema [^113gcAUw].
- **Thoracic surgery**: One-lung ventilation for surgical exposure, with differential ventilation maintaining oxygenation and preventing hyperinflation of the nonoperative lung [^111rf2ge].

---

## Physiological rationale

The rationale is to **match ventilation to regional mechanics and perfusion**, thereby improving oxygenation and CO2 removal while limiting VILI. In asymmetric lungs, uniform ventilation can overdistend compliant regions and under-ventilate stiff regions, worsening V/Q mismatch and barotrauma. Differential ventilation allows tailored tidal volumes, PEEP, and respiratory rates to each lung, optimizing recruitment and minimizing injury [^114mLmnd].

---

## Techniques and equipment

Differential ventilation requires **specialized equipment and techniques**:

| **Technique** | **Equipment** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) | - DLT (left or right) <br/> - Fiberoptic bronchoscope | - Most common method <br/> - Allows independent ventilation of each lung <br/> - Requires bronchoscopic confirmation of position [^115nDMXk] |
| Bronchial blocker | - Arndt or Cohen blocker <br/> - Single-lumen ETT <br/> - Fiberoptic bronchoscope | - Alternative when DLT is contraindicated <br/> - Allows selective lung isolation and ventilation [^111CMD5Q] |
| Novel devices | - Selective lobe ventilation systems <br/> - iSAVE ventilator-sharing platform | - Experimental <br/> - Enable differential ventilation with individualized parameters [^114mLmnd] [^114gwx7A] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits

Evidence is limited but suggests **meaningful benefits** in specific contexts:

- **Improved oxygenation**: Rapid improvement in PaO2/FiO2 in single-lung transplant and severe unilateral lung injury [^117JrGVZ] [^113gcAUw].
- **Reduced air leak**: Effective control of bronchopleural fistula with decreased leak and improved ventilation [^116E8kTM].
- **Minimized VILI**: Tailored ventilation reduces overdistension and atelectrauma in asymmetric lungs [^114mLmnd].

---

## Limitations and risks

Differential ventilation carries **significant risks and limitations**:

- **Technical complexity**: Requires specialized equipment, bronchoscopic expertise, and vigilant monitoring for tube malposition or obstruction [^115nDMXk].
- **Barotrauma**: Risk of overdistension or rupture in hyperinflated or fragile lung segments [^116ZoG9q].
- **Infection risk**: Prolonged intubation and bronchoscopy increase the risk of VAP [^113X3efn].
- **Limited evidence**: Most data are from case series; high-quality RCTs are lacking, limiting widespread adoption [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with conventional ventilation strategies

Conventional ventilation applies uniform parameters to both lungs, which can exacerbate V/Q mismatch and VILI in asymmetric disease. Differential ventilation **individualizes settings** to each lung, improving oxygenation and reducing injury, but at the cost of complexity and risk. It is not a replacement for standard lung-protective strategies but a rescue approach for refractory cases [^112dDD7E].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines do not routinely recommend differential ventilation; it is reserved for **refractory cases** after standard ARDSnet strategies (low tidal volume, adequate PEEP, prone positioning) fail. Expert consensus emphasizes careful patient selection, bronchoscopic confirmation of tube position, and close monitoring for complications [^115nDMXk].

---

## Future directions and research needs

Key priorities include **randomized controlled trials** to define patient selection, outcomes, and safety, and development of standardized protocols and training. Advances in imaging and monitoring could enable real-time assessment of regional mechanics and perfusion to guide differential ventilation [^114mPjXV].

---

Differential ventilation is a **targeted rescue strategy** for severe asymmetric lung disease, offering physiologic advantages over conventional ventilation when expertly applied. Its use should be selective, with careful attention to technique, monitoring, and complications, and supported by further research to clarify indications and outcomes.

Figure 1.
Mortality with use of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The red line represents the expected increasing mortality associated with COVID-19 as age or number and severity of comorbidities increases; the black line represents the idealized ability to reduce mortality to the same low rate for all, irrespective of patient characteristics. The blue line represents the likely differential impact of IMV with more benefit for those who are younger and healthier at baseline and less benefit for those who are older and with more underlying health issues.

The decision to place a patient with COVID-19 on a ventilator is not clear-cut and neither are the outcomes. We will never fully understand how or why these data from each country look so different. However, recognizing when patterns of care and outcomes reported fall outside of one's own norms are essential to make the best use of these data for real-time care. So, while we scrutinize these reports and extract what is universal and can be applied to our understanding and care of patients locally, we need to recognize and report on the enormous drivers of differences and be vigilant in presentation of data to minimize confusion in interpretation. The variability of findings has always existed in studies of mechanical ventilation for critically ill patients. COVID-19 is not an exception, merely an amplifier of these differences.

### Evaluating the effects of protective ventilation on organ-specific cytokine production in porcine experimental postoperative sepsis [^113VNvY8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Cytokine output is differential between organs during experimental sepsis. We see no clinical implication from cytokine levels in this model for initiating protective ventilation before endotoxemia. However, during endotoxemia protective ventilation will attenuate hepatic inflammatory cytokine output and consequently reduce the total pro-inflammatory burden.

Discussion

Although significant advancements have been made in the management of ARDS, many questions remain. Several recommendations in this guideline are conditional in nature and, as such, require careful evaluation of patient and illness characteristics when considering their use. Future studies may serve to strengthen these recommendations or provide additional caveats to their implementation. Measures with more established evidence of benefit also exist, including lung protective ventilation for all patients with ARDS and prone positioning for those with severe ARDS. Although strong recommendations in favor of these measures have previously been made, translating evidence into practice has been fraught with challenges. Considerable practice variation exists in ARDS management, and evidence-based modalities remain underused. This underuse is associated with increased mortality, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to improve ARDS outcomes. To maximize these opportunities, future efforts must be made to facilitate access to readily available, granular data about ARDS management practices in real-world settings to allow for benchmarking, auditing, and continuous quality improvement. Additionally, it is crucial to understand the clinician-, systems-, and patient-level barriers to, and facilitators of, the use of evidence-based supportive care in ARDS to inform a comprehensive approach to implementation.

In addition to implementation research, there are several opportunities to address other areas of uncertainty. Much remains unknown about the impact of supportive measures used for ARDS on the long-term outcomes of survivors, an issue of vital importance to patients. There is a critical need for future clinical trials to not only consistently collect these data, but also to involve patient and family representatives to help identify and guide the selection of specific outcomes to study. There are also other modalities used in a small but significant minority of patients with ARDS, such as pulmonary vasodilators and alternative ventilator modes, for which further data are needed before meaningful recommendations can be made. Additionally, although supportive therapies are often used in combination rather than in isolation, it remains unknown whether combination treatments are synergistic. Treatment effects can also vary across individuals, a concept known as heterogeneity of treatment effect, which is an issue that may be especially relevant to ARDS. There is substantial heterogeneity in ARDS, including patient characteristics, underlying etiologies, mechanisms of injury, and degrees of severity. In light of these issues, there has been growing interest in identifying homogeneous subgroups in ARDS with potential differential responses to treatment. Although the methods for subphenotyping patients with ARDS are currently investigational, the identification of distinct subsets of patients may provide an opportunity to improve patient selection for clinical trials in the future and ultimately increase the likelihood of finding effective interventions.

### New treatment method for reexpansion pulmonary edema: differential lung ventilation [^113gcAUw]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Reexpansion pulmonary edema (REPE) is an iatrogenic complication that develops in a lung rapidly reinflated after varied periods of collapse. Though infrequent, it is often lethal. Measures to prevent REPE are well known and mild cases may be reversed with conventional ventilator therapy and medication; however, there is no definitive treatment for this condition in its severest forms. Asynchronous differential lung ventilation is a relatively new therapeutic modality for preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative treatment of respiratory failure secondary to ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Successful treatment of severe REPE in a 29-year-old male patient is described, using asynchronous differential lung ventilation.

### Reply to kuindersma and spronk: time to tailor the one-size-fits-all approach? [^113yQhn1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite these limitations, we agree with Kuindersma and Spronk that the results of our analysis merit consideration of how best to personalize care for patients with COVID-19–related ARDS. Given that prospective, randomized controlled trials have shown a benefit for corticosteroid therapy in severe COVID-19, there is a lack of equipoise to withhold its use for patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless, a more sophisticated approach to identifying patient populations with differential response to immunomodulatory therapy is appealing, particularly as ongoing studies reveal heterogeneous efficacy of corticosteroids in COVID-19 depending on disease severity, timing of administration, and underlying patient characteristics. Although our study provides one possibility to identifying subgroups with differential treatment response, the best approach to identifying such patients remains uncertain and requires further evaluation. Kuindersma and Spronk's proposed method of incorporating a parsimonious classifier model and SARS-CoV-2 viral load into the decision to initiate corticosteroid therapy may ultimately be an effective strategy pending rigorous prospective studies to validate the process.

To achieve a more precise utilization of corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19–related ARDS, further steps are needed. The first step would be to validate the subgroups we identified in other populations of patients with COVID-19–related ARDS across wider geographic regions, as well as cohorts treated later in the pandemic. If these subphenotypes are ultimately validated, a classification model could be applied to previously published clinical trial data of corticosteroids and other immunomodulators in COVID-19 to identify clinically relevant subgroups. These insights could then be incorporated into future clinical trial design to guide treatment strategies for severe COVID-19 across heterogeneous populations. Until these studies are completed, however, corticosteroids remain the standard of care for mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19.

### Differential lung ventilation after single-lung transplantation for emphysema [^117JrGVZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review outcome and cardiovascular and respiratory function after initiation of differential lung ventilation for acute severe native lung hyperinflation in patients who have had a single-lung transplant for end-stage emphysema.

Design

Retrospective review.

Setting

Cardiothoracic tertiary referral center.

Participants

Thirteen patients who had differential lung ventilation for acute severe native lung hyperinflation, of a total of 132 patients who had a single-lung transplant for end-stage emphysema between 1988 and the end of 2000.

Interventions

None. measurements and main results: Thirteen patients had differential lung ventilation for acute severe native lung hyperinflation; 7 survived to 1 year after transplant. There was a highly significant (p = 0.0006) improvement in mean PaO₂ from 8.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.15 to 10.3) to 16.6 (95% CI, 12.84 to 20.45) 1 hour after start of differential lung ventilation. The average ratio of estimated dynamic compliance in the native lung compared with the transplanted (donor) lung was 2.69 (95% CI, 1.75 to 3.62).

Conclusion

In addition to previous case reports, this series shows that differential lung ventilation is an appropriate treatment for acute severe native lung hyperinflation. A difference in estimated effective dynamic compliance of ≥ 2.69 between native and transplanted lung may require differential lung ventilation.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117G236E]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute respiratory illness characterised by bilateral chest radiographical opacities with severe hypoxaemia due to non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in ARDS and highlighted challenges associated with this syndrome, including its unacceptably high mortality and the lack of effective pharmacotherapy. In this Seminar, we summarise current knowledge regarding ARDS epidemiology and risk factors, differential diagnosis, and evidence-based clinical management of both mechanical ventilation and supportive care, and discuss areas of controversy and ongoing research. Although the Seminar focuses on ARDS due to any cause, we also consider commonalities and distinctions of COVID-19-associated ARDS compared with ARDS from other causes.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^11486UF5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study of disease phenotypes across puberty

Differential lung disease manifestations can occur before and after puberty. When choosing an animal model, it is essential to consider the differential timing of pubertal onset between sexes and across species. In rodents, early markers of puberty are vaginal opening, first vaginal cornification, and the onset of cyclicity in females, whereas balanopreputial separation is used as a marker in males. In C57BL/6 females, vaginal opening occurs at 25 days of age on average, whereas in males of the same strain, balanopreputial separation occurs between 27 and 28 days. The peripubertal period in mice is generally considered 28–40 days for females and 30–40 days for males.

When designing experiments across puberty, researchers should consider that rapid changes in body mass can account for differences in lung-related phenotypes. These differences are important for dosing while administering drugs, treatments, or anesthesia. Similarly, equipment needs may vary depending on the age of the animal. For example, lung function measures using a rodent ventilator will require adjusting ventilation parameters according to the mouse's age and size. Similarly, treatments and interventions such as gonadectomy should consider the timing relative to pubertal development and account for potential changes in body composition that may indirectly affect lung function and other measurements. Although gonadectomy is more commonly performed after puberty, some researchers have conducted the surgery by 3–4 weeks of age. It is important to note that gonadectomy before and after puberty produces different phenotypes in males and females, including body weight and composition changes, which could impact lung phenotypes.

### Selective lobe ventilation and a novel platform for pulmonary drug delivery [^114mLmnd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

The current methods of mechanical ventilation and pulmonary drug delivery do not account for the heterogeneity of acute respiratory distress syndrome or its dependence on gravity. The severe lung disease caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019, is one of the many causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused more than three million deaths worldwide and has challenged all therapeutic options for mechanical ventilation. Thus, new therapies are necessary to prevent deaths and long-term complications of severe lung diseases and prolonged mechanical ventilation. The authors of the present report have developed a novel device that allows selective lobe ventilation and selective lobe recruitment and provides a new platform for pulmonary drug delivery. A major advantage of separating lobes that are mechanically heterogeneous is to allow for customization of ventilator parameters to match the needs of segments with similar compliance, a better overall ventilation perfusion relationship, and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury of more compliant lobes. This device accounts for lung heterogeneity and is a potential new therapy for acute lung injury by allowing selective lobe mechanical ventilation using two novel modes of mechanical ventilation (differential positive end-expiratory pressure and asynchronous ventilation), and two new modalities of alveolar recruitment (selective lobe recruitment and continuous positive airway pressure of lower lobes with continuous ventilation of upper lobes). Herein the authors report their initial experience with this novel device, including a brief overview of device development; the initial in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo testing; layout of future research; potential benefits and new therapies; and expected challenges before its uniform implementation into clinical practice.

### Differential lung ventilation for increased oxygenation during one lung ventilation for video assisted lung surgery [^111rf2ge]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of DLV while ventilating one lung may improve patient's oxygenation, and was found to be better than CPAP. Differential lung ventilation may be used where CPAP failed.

### International consensus recommendations for anesthetic and intensive care management of lung transplantation. An EACTAIC, SCA, ISHLT, ESOT, ESTS, and AST approved document [^115nDMXk]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Lung transplantation — conclusion of the transplant operation includes addressing substantial intra-operative size mismatch with delayed chest closure and/or lung reduction surgery. If iNO therapy is to be continued in the ICU, administration should be uninterrupted during transit; weaning should only proceed in the presence of senior clinical staff, preferentially during the daytime, and bridging therapy should be implemented to avoid rebound pulmonary hypertension and potential cardiorespiratory instability. Changing from double lumen tube to single lumen tube should be considered as potentially difficult, and use of a tube exchanger is recommended to maintain a secure airway. Keeping the double lumen tube and differential lung ventilation should be considered in emphysema patients following single-lung transplantation if they cannot be extubated and do not tolerate ventilation of both lungs with the same settings. Assessment of vascular anastomoses with TEE should be performed on all patients before leaving the operating room and reassessed in the ICU if unexplained hypoxemia or hemodynamic instability is present, and TEE is recommended during hypotension when transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) provides poor echocardiographic windows for a complete cardiac exam.

### COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome: is a different approach to management warranted? [^1142FyTw]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in intensive care units across the globe. As experience of managing patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS has grown, so too have efforts to classify patients according to respiratory system mechanics, with a view to optimising ventilatory management. Personalised lung-protective mechanical ventilation reduces mortality and has become the mainstay of treatment in ARDS. In this Viewpoint, we address ventilatory strategies in the context of recent discussions on phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Although early reports suggested that COVID-19-associated ARDS has distinctive features that set it apart from historical ARDS, emerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with ARDS, with or without COVID-19, are broadly similar. In the absence of evidence to support a shift away from the current paradigm of ventilatory management, we strongly recommend adherence to evidence-based management, informed by bedside physiology, as resources permit.

### Severity of hypoxemia and effect of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114XTaah]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is theoretically beneficial for lung protection, but the results of clinical trials are inconsistent, with study-level meta-analyses suggesting no significant effect on mortality.

Objectives

The aim of this individual patient data meta-analysis was to identify acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patient subgroups with differential outcomes from HFOV.

Methods

After a comprehensive search for trials, two reviewers independently identified randomized trials comparing HFOV with conventional ventilation for adults with ARDS. Prespecified effect modifiers were tested using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression models, adjusting for important prognostic factors and clustering effects.

Measurements and Main Results

Data from 1,552 patients in four trials were analyzed, applying uniform definitions for study variables and outcomes. Patients had a mean baseline PaO₂/FiO₂ of 114 ± 39 mm Hg; 40% had severe ARDS (PaO₂/FiO₂ < 100 mm Hg). Mortality at 30 days was 321 of 785 (40.9%) for HFOV patients versus 288 of 767 (37.6%) for control subjects (adjusted odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.94–1.46; P = 0.16). This treatment effect varied, however, depending on baseline severity of hypoxemia (P = 0.0003), with harm increasing with Pa O2 /Fi O2 among patients with mild-moderate ARDS, and the possibility of decreased mortality in patients with very severe ARDS. Compliance and body mass index did not modify the treatment effect. HFOV increased barotrauma risk compared with conventional ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–2.96; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

HFOV increases mortality for most patients with ARDS but may improve survival among patients with severe hypoxemia on conventional mechanical ventilation.

### A novel inline PEEP valve design for differential multi-ventilation [^113sBNBi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventilator sharing is one option to emergently increase ventilator capacity during a crisis but has been criticized for its inability to adjust for individual patient needs. Newer ventilator sharing designs use valves and restrictors to control pressures for each patient. A key component of these designs is an inline Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) Valve but these are not readily available. Creating an inline PEEP valve by converting a standard bag-valve-mask PEEP valve is possible with the addition of a 3D printed collar.

Methods

This was a feasibility study assessing the performance and safety of a method for converting a standard PEEP valve into an inline PEEP valve. A collar was designed and printed that covers the exhaust ports of the valve and returns exhaled gases to the ventilator.

Results

The collar piece was simple to print and easily assembled with the standard PEEP valve. In bench testing it successfully created differential pressures in 2 simulated expiratory limbs without leaking to the atmosphere at pressures greater than 60 cm of H2O.

Conclusion

Our novel inline PEEP valve design shows promise as an option for building a safer ventilator sharing system.

### Malignant hyperinflation of the nondependent lung during chest surgery [^11415SJ8]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Unilateral malignant hyperinflation of the lungs during positive pressure mechanical ventilation was described during aggressive respiratory therapy of unilateral lung disease or in situations of significant difference in compliance between the two lungs. We report a case of malignant hyperinflation of the nondependent lung during chest surgery. The differential diagnosis and treatment with differential lung ventilation are described.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113wQ89g]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Cough versus breathing regulation and chemosensory influences — cough and breathing can be differentially regulated by primary afferent inputs to the brainstem, indicating regulation of cough is customized to the function of the behavior. During cough, ventilation increases significantly and this alteration is necessary to prevent a loss of respiratory muscle excitability as CO2 falls; the depression of cough induced by hypoxia is less well understood and may reflect a shift in priority of the respiratory muscle control system. The permissive/facilitatory effect of SARs on cough is also not well understood but may help optimize respiratory muscle performance and facilitate expulsive airflows when cough is elicited at higher lung volumes.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^115aoe6T]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID — breathing/respiratory symptoms and differentials include dyspnea at rest or disproportionate dyspnea with activity; chest discomfort with pain, tightness, constriction, and/or pressure; inability to take a full deep breath; and new or progressive cough or chest congestion. Differential diagnoses to consider (new, worsening, or underlying) include nonpulmonary contributions (eg, neurologic, cardiovascular, neuromuscular) and other pulmonary and airway conditions (eg, asthma).

### NTCA guidelines for respiratory isolation and restrictions to reduce transmission of pulmonary tuberculosis in community settings [^115qsKjY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory isolation and restrictions — scope, setting, and activity allowances — Extensive restriction is the most restrictive form of RIR that limits movement to an agreed-upon location physically separated from others and avoids shared ventilation; locations may include the individual's home or, if a community setting is unavailable, a hospital airborne-infection isolation (AII) room. When extensive restrictions are implemented, plans should be developed and monitored by public health authorities and the PWTB using a patient-centered approach, and all individuals should have adequate provisions for activities of daily living with support from public health departments when needed. In most circumstances, the location of RIR is preferred to be in the home over hospital settings. In most instances, midlevel restrictions are expected to meet public health goals, allow some movement for activities in lower-risk settings, and because there is differential transmission risk based on setting and ventilation, outdoor or naturally ventilated or UV-light settings are anticipated to reduce exposure, making most outdoor activities permissible within midlevel restrictions.

### Differential lung ventilation in an infant using LMA and a long tracheal tube [^116B3oCY]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

This is a case report of differential lung ventilation in an infant using a conventional laryngeal mask airway (LMATM) and a commercially available longer paediatric tracheal tube. This 2-month-old infant had her left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia repaired on the sixth day of her life, and had been mechanically ventilated. The right middle lobe became grossly emphysematous and herniated into the left side of the chest, and the right lower lobe became totally atelectatic. A right middle lobe lobectomy was planned. To avoid hyperinflating the right middle lobe, and to expand the right lower lobe without providing a high airway pressure on the left lung, the dependent lung (i.e. left lung) was ventilated with an LMA, and the right lower lobe was expanded with a long tracheal tube inserted through the LMA via the swivel connector. This combination of a conventional LMA and a commercially available longer paediatric tracheal tube could be another way of providing differential ventilation in infants.

Further interpretive considerations — ventilation–perfusion mismatch, extrapulmonary activity, and the stripe sign are described: Ventilation–perfusion mismatch can result from any cause of pulmonary arterial blood flow obstruction, and although there is a long differential diagnosis, there are few common causes including acute pulmonary embolism, old pulmonary embolism, obstruction of an artery by tumor, and radiation therapy; on perfusion scintigraphy, extrapulmonary activity (which may be seen at the edges of lung images in the thyroid or kidneys) may be the result of right-to-left shunting, free 99mTc-pertechnetate, reduced 99mTc compounds, or another recent nuclear medicine procedure, and an image of the head can be used to differentiate free 99mTc-pertechnetate or reduced 99mTc compounds from a right-to-left shunting; the stripe sign (activity at the periphery of a perfusion defect) suggests nonembolic disease.

Differential rat lung ventilation

Twelve pathogen-free male Sprague Dawley rats (350–450 g) were randomly distributed in the different experimental groups (6 for 2.1–0.1 Hz and 6 for 1.1–1.1 Hz). Animals were housed in controlled animal quarters under standard light, temperature, and humidity exposure. All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Research of the University of Barcelona (Approval number 147/18).

Animals were anesthetized intraperitoneally using 20% urethane (10 mL/kg). After confirmation of deep anesthesia by tail and paw clamp, animals were tracheostomised and each lung of the rat was independently cannulated (16 G; BD Bioscience, San Jose, USA). After muscular relaxation with 0.4 mg/kg pancuronium bromide (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) intravenously injected through the penile vein, each lung was connected to a customized small rodent ventilator, with a pressure sensor connected at the entrance of each cannula to monitor animal ventilation according to the conditions explained below. Correct cannulation of each lung was confirmed by opening the chest wall and observing proper independent inflation and deflation of each lung. Animals were ventilated with a tidal volume of 21 mL/kg of animal weight (kg-bw) and with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 3 cmH₂O. Control ventilation was set to a typical frequency of 1.1 Hz with the same tidal volume in each of the two lungs of the rat. To test the effect of varying the ventilation frequency on YAP, a different ventilation frequency was applied to each lung while maintaining the control tidal volume. The left lung was ventilated at 0.1 Hz, and the right lung at 2.1 Hz. In this way, the animal received the same total minute ventilation, hence keeping O₂ and CO₂ blood gas levels thereby discarding any systemic effect induced by differential ventilation.

### Comparability of quantifying relative lung ventilation with inhaledTc-technegas andXe in patients undergoing evaluation for lung transplantation [^114NZDZZ]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Lung ventilation quantification is a critical component in the management of patients with various pulmonary conditions, particularly in the preoperative and postoperative evaluation of those undergoing lung resection and lung transplantation. For instance, the preoperative functional data help guide surgery, with the worse functioning lung removed first in bilateral lung transplantation to avoid the requirement for cardiac bypass. Serial comparison of relative lung ventilation can also help in the assessment of therapeutic effectiveness and determine longitudinal trends in lung function. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s, a common measure of lung ventilation, is an independent predictor of morbidity in patients undergoing lobar or sublobar pulmonary resection or pneumonectomy. However, preoperative measurement of the forced expiratory volume in 1 s does not permit evaluation of differential pulmonary ventilation and does not highlight regional differences, especially in the setting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Traditionally, this quantification has been achieved using 133 Xe, a radioactive gas that has served as the standard for evaluating regional lung function, especially in patients with borderline-low baseline reserves. The distribution of 133 Xe in early wash-in during tidal breathing closely approximates the minute ventilation rate, whereas its distribution at the end of wash-in approximates the lung volume. Notably, quantification of relative lung ventilation with another radiopharmaceutical, aerosolized 99m Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (99m Tc-DTPA), is challenging, especially because of increased central airway deposition in patients with obstructive lung disease, which leads to suboptimal imaging and limits the accuracy of differential ventilation quantification.

In contrast, 99m Tc-Technegas (Cyclomedica Ltd.), which is composed of ultrafine carbon nanoparticles labeled with 99m Tc, offers distinct advantages in terms of particle size (< 0.1 μm vs. ∼2 μm for 99m Tc-DTPA) and distribution. The smaller particle size of 99m Tc-Technegas allows for better peripheral lung deposition, even in the presence of obstructive lung pathology, potentially leading to more accurate and reliable imaging. With its recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, it is anticipated that 99m Tc-Technegas will be increasingly used for lung ventilation scintigraphy, both for assessment of acute or chronic pulmonary thromboembolism and for quantification of relative lung ventilation. However, there are no data available currently to assess the performance of 99m Tc-Technegas for relative quantification of lung ventilation, when compared with the established standard method with 133 Xe.

In the third stage, we ventilated the two animals with differential PEEPs (Pig A: PEEP = 5 cmH₂O, Pig B: PEEP = 10 cmH₂O, Fig. 4, A and B) using iSAVE on a closed-circuit ventilator. During ventilation, we simulated several practically challenging scenarios including: (i) Adding an animal to the iSAVE circuit; (ii) quickly removing an animal from the circuit without leaking the airflow (containing isoflurane) into the atmosphere; and (iii) adjusting ventilation parameters as the animal's respiratory mechanics changed. In all cases, iSAVE enabled stable management of ventilation.

### Optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings in differential lung ventilation during simultaneous unilateral pneumothorax and laparoscopy: an experimental study in pigs [^116PCWdv]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

A combined thoraco-laparoscopic technique for esophageal resection is technically possible, but it requires special attention to ventilation. The positive insufflation pressure normally used in laparoscopy will, when communication between thorax and abdomen is established, create a pneumothorax.

Methods

We performed an experimental study of differential lung ventilation with different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings during thoraco-laparoscopy in anesthetized pigs.

Results

Positive pressure insufflation of carbon dioxide (CO2) resulted in elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, hypercarbia, and respiratory acidosis. Hypoxemia, however, developed only at lower settings of PEEP. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and cardiac output remained relatively stable.

Conclusion

Pneumopleuroperitoneum under positive CO2 insufflation pressure had adverse effects on blood gases. Hypercarbia, respiratory acidosis, and hypoxemia were early manifestations that occurred even in the presence of hemodynamic stability. The application of PEEP equal to or above CO2 insufflation pressure improved blood gases; in particular, the hypoxia could be avoided. No beneficial effects of differential lung ventilation were documented.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design

The goal of this study was to design and validate a system using medical-grade filters, valves, and sensors to provide individualized ventilation using one ventilator shared among at least two subjects. We performed benchtop testing of the iSAVE using linear test lungs to ensure its ability to provide differential ventilation, accommodate for changes in respiratory mechanics, and manage acute changes to patient status. We also evaluated issues of cross contamination, adding and removing subjects from the circuits, and circuit design as they related to specific ventilator models. We performed ventilation of one pig and one test lung, wherein we modulated the respiratory mechanics of each lung to test the management of rebalancing differential ventilation to both lungs. We then performed the simultaneous ventilation of two pigs to evaluate the iSAVE's performance in an in vivo setting, simulating several clinical scenarios. Animal experiments were approved by the Committee on Animal Care at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). No blinding or randomization was performed as this was a proof-of-concept study.

Open-circuit ventilator assembly

A Philips Trilogy portable ventilator was used as a representative open-circuit ventilator for testing. Standard flex corrugated tubing (22 mm outer diameter) was used to connect two respiratory circuits, each consisting of a (i) ball valve (EKWB G ¼" Nickel, Microcenter), (ii) bacterial/viral filter (Main Flow Bacterial/Viral Filter, Teleflex Medical), (iii) pressure sensor (TD160D, Biopac Systems), (iv) airflow sensor (BSL Medium Airflow Transducer SS11LA and AFT 20, Biopac Systems), and (v) Whisper Swivel valve (passive exhalation port, Philips). This was connected to the expiratory side of a Y-piece to allow for the inclusion of a bacterial/viral filter before venting exhaled gas to the ambient. See the circuit diagram provided in Fig. 1A. The airflow and pressure sensors were connected to DA100C differential amplifiers with 1000x gain and processed through the MP160WSW signal processing unit (Biopac Systems) sampling at 2 kHz. Volume control mode was employed, and settings were adjusted to deliver the desired V T, RR, and PEEP. Artificial linear test lungs (IngMar Medical) were used for simulations with the open-circuit ventilator.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^111DHfPK]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Domain 2: ARDS phenotyping

This group was charged with identifying key issues relating to phenotyping in ARDS, assessing the current literature to address these questions, and identifying the knowledge gaps to be addressed in future research.

A systematic search was conducted to identify studies satisfying the following criteria: (1) identify a sub-phenotype as per our working definition (see below and as described in the supplement); (2) focus on phenotyping in patients with ARDS; (3) human data; (4) include ≥ 100 patients with ARDS; (5) include sub-phenotypes showing heterogeneity of treatment effect or sub-phenotypes showing differences in patient outcome. Twenty-five papers were included in the final analysis.

Question 2.1: How do we define an ARDS sub-phenotype?

Based on the currently available literature and consensus within the working group, the following definitions were established:
A phenotype is a clinically observable set of traits resulting from an interaction of genotype and environmental exposures (i.e. ARDS is a phenotype).
A subgroup is a subset of patients within a phenotype, which may be defined using any cut-off in a variable. This cut-off can be arbitrary, and frequently patients fall just on either side of it, resulting in patients switching subgroups (e.g. PaO₂/FiO₂ severity classification of ARDS).
A sub-phenotype is a distinct subgroup (of ARDS patients) that can be reliably discriminated from other subgroups based on a set or pattern of observable or measurable properties. Discrimination is typically based on a data-driven assessment of a multidimensional description of traits. Subphenotypes should also be reproducible in different populations.
An endotype is a sub-phenotype with distinct functional or pathobiological mechanism, which preferably responds differently to a targeted therapy.

Question 2.2: How do we identify or operationalize an ARDS sub-phenotype?

Accurate classification of the sub-phenotype is critical as exemplified by the results of LIVE trial. The trial randomized patients to either standard lung-protective ventilation or a personalized treatment strategy based on radiological sub-phenotype (focal or diffuse pathology on chest radiograph). Overall, there was no benefit to a personalized treatment strategy; however, misclassification of sub-phenotype resulting in misaligned treatment strategies was common, and the results were "positive" when misclassified patients were excluded. Subphenotype classification in prospective studies likely requires: (1) on-site, real-time testing and rapid results, and (2) operator independence.

### Mechanical ventilation: past lessons and the near future [^113ftqUs]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Complexity and clinical trials

Few rules governing mechanical ventilation apply across all phases and severities of acute illness; choices must be conditioned by stage and by patient response. Many of the tested questions have sought 'yes or no, toggle switch' answers (Figure 1). Yet even those interventions that seem amenable to such dichotomous testing are nuanced by considerations of their dose, duration, timing of use, and patient selection. Complexity of co-morbidities, timing stages, and co-interventions requires the clinician to weigh and integrate all important factors before making a decision, and then to employ short-loop feedback with frequent mid-course corrections (Figure 2). Knowing these key principles of effective clinical practice, it is wise to remember that few clinical trials have been undertaken with detailed or proven knowledge of the underlying mechanism driving the outcome variable or have accounted for the complexity and timing of pathophysiology and management. As a simple example, none of the multicenter cooperative trials of mechanical ventilation yet conducted has assured passivity of the study cohort, despite the implications of muscular effort for the transalveolar pressures that lie at the root of ventilator-induced lung injury.

### Lung metabolic activation as an early biomarker of acute respiratory distress syndrome and local gene expression heterogeneity [^115q6nmA]. Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory condition comprising diffuse lung edema and alveolar damage. ARDS frequently results from regional injury mechanisms. However, it is unknown whether detectable inflammation precedes lung edema and opacification and whether topographically differential gene expression consistent with heterogeneous injury occurs in early ARDS. The authors aimed to determine the temporal relationship between pulmonary metabolic activation and density in a large animal model of early ARDS and to assess gene expression in differentially activated regions.

Methods

The authors produced ARDS in sheep with intravenous lipopolysaccharide (10ng ⋅ kg ⋅ h) and mechanical ventilation for 20h. Using positron emission tomography, the authors assessed regional cellular metabolic activation with 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose, perfusion and ventilation with NN-saline, and aeration using transmission scans. Species-specific microarray technology was used to assess regional gene expression.

Results

Metabolic activation preceded detectable increases in lung density (as required for clinical diagnosis) and correlated with subsequent histologic injury, suggesting its predictive value for severity of disease progression. Local time courses of metabolic activation varied, with highly perfused and less aerated dependent lung regions activated earlier than nondependent regions. These regions of distinct metabolic trajectories demonstrated differential gene expression for known and potential novel candidates for ARDS pathogenesis.

Conclusions

Heterogeneous lung metabolic activation precedes increases in lung density in the development of ARDS due to endotoxemia and mechanical ventilation. Local differential gene expression occurs in these early stages and reveals molecular pathways relevant to ARDS biology and of potential use as treatment targets.

Benchtop testing of the iSAVE using linear test lungs

The iSAVE was connected to three common models of intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators (Hamilton, Puritan Bennett, and Philips) (fig. S1). Testing confirmed the circuit was generalizable and could be used to ventilate two linear test lungs.

Individualized management of ventilation and patient interdependence

We tested the ability of the iSAVE to meet the diverse V T needs that may be presented by patients of varying sizes and respiratory mechanics. We first delivered V T of 800 mL to two test lungs with healthy (C = 50 mL/cmH₂O, R = 5 cmH₂O/L/s) and diseased (C = 20 mL/cmH 2 O, R = 5 cmH 2 O/L/s) pulmonary characteristics. By titrating the flow control valve, we were able to achieve differential V T spanning ratios from 50:50 to 15:85 (Fig. 2A). However, at ratios more disproportionate than 20:80, pressure exceeded 40 cmH₂O, which is supratherapeutic.

### Short women with severe sepsis-related acute lung injury receive lung protective ventilation less frequently: an observational cohort study [^114PfPNd]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our prospective observational study at seven academic centers revealed that women were approximately 40% less likely to receive LPV compared to men during the first two days after ALI onset. This differential exposure may be explained by their height difference. According to our multivariable analysis, severe sepsis-related ALI patients were 20% more likely to receive LPV if they were one inch (2.54 cm) taller, while gender was not associated with the use of LPV. Our finding suggests that intensive care regarding mechanical ventilation in ALI patients may be influenced by patient-related factors such as height and severity of illness.

Several critical illnesses have different outcomes by gender. Women have higher mortality than men after developing acute myocardial infarction, respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation and nosocomial infections, while male patients with blunt trauma experience a higher risk of death than females. Several potential explanations for these mortality differences include physiologic and hormonal differences, or differential exposure to intensive care and treatments. Men have been shown to be more likely to be admitted to ICU and undergo aggressive measures, such as mechanical ventilation, vasoactive medication, renal replacement therapy, or central vascular catheterization compared with women, after adjustment for severity of illness. It has also been reported that the adjusted rates of reperfusion therapy and coronary angiography after myocardial infarction were higher in men than in women.

Our study showed the ventilatory care in intubated ALI patients was different by gender, likely from their height difference. On average, women are shorter than men and thus their calculated tidal volumes in mL would be smaller than men's, based on PBW derived from height and gender. If this factor is not considered in the ventilatory care of women with ALI and consequently women receive higher tidal volumes than men, this difference in treatment may contribute to the higher mortality seen in mechanically ventilated women compared with men. Another possibility is that women may be under-diagnosed with ALI and get LPV less often than men. Unfortunately this cannot be confirmed from our data. There was, however, no gender difference in the use of LPV if it was defined by ABW rather than PBW. This suggests the decreased use of LPV in women may be more related to the differential treatment itself rather than differential diagnosis.

### Endoscopic lung volume reduction in COPD: improvements in gas transfer capacity are associated with improvements in ventilation and perfusion matching [^112YYXzv]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) has been shown to improve lung function, quality of life, and exercise tolerance in patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema. Our study aims to determine the effect of ELVR on gas transfer capacity corrected for alveolar volume (KCO) and investigate the relationship between KCO and ventilation and perfusion (VQ) matching. We speculate on possible mechanisms for the observed changes METHODS:: Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were prospectively recruited and underwent unilateral upper lobe ELVR between 2012 and 2014. Each had respiratory function test and differential VQ scans at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 12-month post-ELVR.

Results

In total, 11 patients had 3 sets of respiratory function test (at baseline, 1, and 3mo), whereas 7 had 4 sets (at baseline, 1, 3, and 12mo). KCO improved by 10.3 (± 7.5)% at 1 month (P = NS) and 39.8 (± 15.4)% at 12 months (P < 0.05). VQ of the nontargeted lung increased by 12.8 (± 5.6)% and 7.9 (± 2.3)%, respectively at 1 month, whereas those of the targeted lung both decreased (P < 0.05). At 3 and 12 months, the VQ changes were similar to those at 1 month, though some were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

ELVR results in improved KCO for at least 12 months. This may be explained by the VQ redistribution to the nontargeted and less emphysematous lung with improved VQ matching.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — conclusions emphasize individualized application of recommendations and research gaps: Significant advances have been made in the ventilatory management of ARDS in the last few decades, and clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations in this guideline, and they should be careful when comparing the relative benefits of one intervention over another if they have the same rating. The potential benefits or synergies of combined or sequential treatments with interventions included in this guideline have not been explicitly studied, and therefore no recommendations have been made, while most recent studies of ventilatory interventions, however, have used LTV ventilation in recognition of supportive clinical and experimental evidence.

Lung lavage white blood cell count and differential

White blood cell (WBC) count and differential in the lung lavage has been widely used as an indicator of lung inflammation. Figure 5 shows that HTV ventilation markedly increased lavage content of WBC versus the LTV group (215 ± 21 vs. 70 ± 14 cells/μL; P < 0.05) (upper panel), and increased the percentage of neutrophils (2.2 ± 0.4 vs. 18.4 ± 4.2%; P < 0.05) (white bar; lower panel). Though absolute macrophages increased after HTV ventilation, the percentage of macrophages decreased (88.2 ± 4.7 versus 65.8 ± 6.8%; P < 0.05) and the percentage of lymphocytes moderately increased (8.3 ± 3.1 versus 14.3 ± 6.9%) (black and grey bar, respectively; lower panel). Intravenous treatment of Cu/Zn SOD during HTV ventilation notably reduced total white blood cells (106 ± 23 cells/μL) and the percentage of neutrophils (8.4 ± 2.2%) in BALF, suggesting decreased lung inflammation.

To make sure that the unit of comparison is consistently in gene space across ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets, we first mapped the differentially bound CTCF peaks to nearby genes by the following formula. For a contrast group, WTd0 vs. KOd0, a gene score is derived as follows. Each gene's CTCF differential binding score s g, is computed aswhere c is each peak that maps to gene g by ± 25 kb TSS criterion; f c is the -log 10 Pvalue of peak c; n c is the total number of genes that peak c maps to (± 25 kb TSS). A rank list of genes is produced from highest to lowest s g. Next the rank-list is sorted into ventiles (20 bins). We overlapped all genes within each ventile with the differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq (WTd0 vs. KOd0). Finally, we plotted the overlap number per bin as seen in Fig. 7e, f. In the null hypothesis case, we do not expect to see an association between ChIP-seq peak-mapped genes and differentially expressed genes, and the overlap frequency should be uniform across all ventiles. Any deviation from the uniform distribution, with an overrepresentation towards the left of the plot, will indicate a non-random significant association. The minimum hypergeometric distribution score, available in the GOrilla package, was used to assess the significance of the association and reports a P -value.

### Lung ultrasound for identification of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 [^114AzZD6]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

LUS‐score had only a moderate diagnostic value for identification of requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate to severe COVID‐19. Lung ultrasound served as complement to bedside assessment by guidance of disease severity and was an important tool for differential diagnostics. Respiratory rate and oxygenation index (ROX index) proved applicable for guiding need of IMV‐treatment in COVID‐19.

### Nanoparticle delivery of microRNA-146a regulates mechanotransduction in lung macrophages and mitigates injury during mechanical ventilation [^115YsHet]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

miR-146a −/− mice have increased injury during MV

To assess whether miR-146a plays a protective role in modulating VILI, miR-146a knockout (KO) and WT litter-mate control mice were subjected to injurious MV for 4 h and compared to SB control mice. There was no difference between BAL cytokine or protein concentrations in miR-146a KO mice and WT mice prior to ventilation (SB in Fig. 3a–c). Following ventilation, KO mice exhibited significantly increased BAL IL6 and CXCL1/KC levels (Fig. 3a, b) and elevated total protein concentrations (Fig. 3c) compared to ventilated WT mice. Differential cell counting revealed that global deletion of miR-146a did not significantly alter the recruitment of inflammatory cells following injurious ventilation (Fig. 3d). KO mice also demonstrated a significant increase in lung elastance (Fig. 3e) and decrease in oxygenation (Fig. 3f) following ventilation compared to WT controls. These data demonstrate that loss of miR-146a results in increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion, disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier, and impaired lung function compared to WT animals. Together, the data in Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that miR-146a is an important negative regulator of lung injury during MV. However, the endogenous increase in miR-146a in WT mice in response to MV is not sufficient to abrogate VILI.

Conclusions

The main features of respiratory mechanics, the response to treatment (such as the oxygenation response to LRMs or prone position), and prognosis are similar in COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 ARDS. The oxygenation response to LRM and a high PEEP appear to be very heterogeneous in COVID-19 ARDS; this would argue in favor of a personalized ventilation strategy.

### Effects of different ventilation strategies on lung injury in newborn rabbits [^11691N5o]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The results from experimental and clinical studies have shown that mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or hyperoxia may aggravate a pre-existing lung injury, or even cause lung injury in healthy lungs, despite the fact that it might be the only life-saving intervention available to a patient. The present study was designed to investigate the roles of MV and hyperoxia in the pathogenesis of lung injury.

Methods

Newborn New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to an unventilated air control group or to one of the 2 × 3 × 3 ventilation strategies using a factorial design. The experimental groups were assigned different fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)), peak inspiratory pressures (PIP), and respiratory times (RT). The lung wet-to-dry ratio (W/D), lung histopathology scores, and cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed for each group. The apoptosis levels were studied by immunohistochemistry and a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay.

Results

Different ventilation regimes induced alterations in microvascular permeability, differential histopathological grading, WBC and/or neutrophil and/or lymphocyte influx, and apoptosis levels; moreover, there were significant correlations and interaction effects between these indices.

Conclusions

Our data demonstrate that different ventilation regimes can induce lung injury and that the interaction effects of the FiO(2), the PIP and the RT may play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of lung injury.

### ARDS subphenotypes: understanding a heterogeneous syndrome [^112GuYKj]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Phenotyping for Predictive Enrichment

As discussed above, difficulty classifying patients is a pragmatic challenge inherent to clinical phenotyping of ARDS patients, and a major drawback to the use of clinical phenotyping in both research and practice. Nonetheless, different clinical subphenotypes of ARDS may reflect different underlying biology, and in some cases have been shown to respond differently to treatment. For example, patients with direct ARDS have higher levels of biomarkers of epithelial injury than patients with indirect ARDS, and there is low-level evidence that patients with direct ARDS may respond differently to recruitment maneuvers and glucocorticoids than indirect lung injury patients. A recent, highly innovative randomized controlled trial compared a personalized mechanical ventilation strategy selected according to radiographic subphenotype (focal vs. non-focal) to standard low tidal volume ventilation in 400 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (LIVE trial). The intention-to-treat analysis found no difference in outcomes between groups, but in a post hoc analysis that excluded misclassified patients (21% of total patients), there was a mortality benefit to the personalized mechanical ventilation intervention. These results highlight both the promise and the peril of using subphenotype (in this case radiographic subphenotype) to guide therapy: on the one hand, if patients are appropriately classified, there may be a benefit of personalized care over protocolized care; on the other hand, the significant misclassification that occurs even in the relatively controlled setting of a clinical trial can completely offset the potential benefit. Regardless of this complexity, the LIVE trial was a first step in the direction of what many view as the future of ARDS research: leveraging subphenotype to personalize therapy and directly comparing outcomes to standard protocolized care.

The future of mechanical ventilation

Ideally, mechanical ventilation should be applied so as to avoid all adverse side effects, including VILI. To rationally approach this task, we believe it necessary to characterize much better than we do now the pathophysiology of the lung parenchyma to which the mechanical ventilation is applied and to fully understand the potential harm of each component of the ventilatory set.

Implications of recommendations by stakeholders — Table 1 clarifies how strong versus conditional recommendations should be interpreted: For patients, a strong recommendation means most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, whereas a conditional recommendation means the majority would want the suggested course of action but many would not. For clinicians, a strong recommendation means most individuals should receive the intervention, adherence could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator, and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences; a conditional recommendation involves recognizing that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and helping each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences, with decision aids potentially useful. For policy makers, a strong recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations, whereas a conditional recommendation indicates policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Which ventilators and modes can be used to deliver noninvasive ventilation? [^115vwCrh]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

A wide variety of ventilators and modes can be used to deliver noninvasive ventilation (NIV). To navigate successfully through the many options, the clinician must first have a clear understanding of the goals of mechanical ventilation: namely, safety, comfort, and timely liberation. Examining the specific objectives associated with these goals, we can distinguish priorities for NIV. This paper reviews the methods of achieving those objectives by reviewing the characteristics of ventilation modes and how those characteristics are measured in performance-evaluation studies. This review provides the basis for a simple procedure for selecting the most appropriate NIV technology for the patient and the environment of care.

### The use of exhaled air analysis in discriminating interstitial lung diseases: a pilot study [^112Zpj42]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of ILD ideally relies on the combination of clinical, imaging, alveolar lavage and serological data in the setting of a multidisciplinary discussion. However, this process remains difficult and often requires analysis of surgical lung biopsies. Indeed, surgical lung biopsy is still the single most informative test in cases where both the clinical and HCRT features fail to provide an exclusive diagnosis. However, lung biopsy is often not possible due to a number of contraindications including age, comorbidities and the severity of the disease. There is thus a need for the development of other diagnostic markers that are less or even non-invasive, safe and fast.

A novel and currently untested approach for the non-invasive differential diagnosis of ILD could be the analysis of exhaled air, known to contain a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that might be applied as potential biomarkers for chronic lung diseases. To this extent, we have applied a sampling methodology for collecting concentrated samples of exhaled air against which a thermal desorption gas chromatography — time of flight — mass spectrometry (GC- tof –MS) analysis has been employed. Additionally, data analysis tools have been developed to enable the pipeline analysis of the generated GC–MS sample outputs. By extracting informative VOCs from the compiled database and implementing them into a classifier of which the performance was evaluated, we have already shown that a specific VOC profile in breath can discriminate healthy controls from patients suffering from a variety of lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ventilated-associated pneumonia and asthma. However, it would clinically be more relevant to apply exhaled VOCs in differentiating between chronic lung diseases that (partly) share pathogenesis and symptoms yet display diverse outcomes and therefore require different treatment options. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study is to identify exhaled VOC profiles characteristic for IPF and CTD-ILD, in comparison to patients without lung disease as well as to each other. Such a unique volatile profile for the different ILDs could represent a novel diagnostic tool for positive and differential diagnosis of these complex diseases. Moreover, the secondary aim of this study is to investigate whether these exhaled VOCs, specific for either IPF or CTD-ILD, could be associated with lung function impairment and thus correlate with disease severity.

### A rapidly deployable individualized system for augmenting ventilator capacity [^116g2Lua]. Science Translational Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the second experiment, one 74 kg and one 88 kg female swine were used in a survival approach. These pigs were sedated with 0.25 mg/kg (5 mg/mL) midazolam and 0.03 mg/kg (0.5 mg/mL) dexmedetomidine. The experiment was divided into three stages: Individual ventilation of each animal, PEEP = 0 (stage 1); iSAVE ventilation (differential V T, PEEP = 0) (stage 2); and iSAVE ventilation (differential V T, differential PEEP) (stage 3). Ventilation was performed with the Philips Respironics Esprit ventilator in series with the anesthesia machine. The target tidal volume for each animal was calculated at 10 mL/kg, although ventilation was optimized to maintain SpO₂ > 94% and EtCO₂ ~ 30–35 mmHg in all stages. The PEEP setting on the main ventilator was set to 0 cmH 2 O. After 30 min of stable ventilation, arterial blood gases were measured using an i-STAT handheld blood analyzer (Abbott). Respiratory flow, pressure and volume were continuously logged using the Philips NM3 monitors as well as Biopac systems described above. Reported values represent the mean and standard deviations of 300 breathing cycles. In stage 3, the PEEP settings were changed by adjusting the PEEP valve to enable the animals to be ventilated with differential PEEP values (Pig A: PEEP = 5 cmH₂O, Pig B: PEEP = 10 cmH₂O). Compliance and resistance were measured for each animal by performing an end-inspiratory pause of 1 s to ensure that the iSAVE enabled these measurements. The computed compliance and resistance values matched those which were measured on the monitor. The duration of each stage lasted about 45 min.

Data and statistical analysis

Pressure and flow data from the Biopac system was analyzed using MATLAB (2018a). Flow data was integrated every respiratory cycle to derive the flow. In cases where pressure and flow data were not simultaneously obtained from both limbs of the circuit, data were derived based on the settings on the main ventilator and the measurements on one limb. Homoscedastic, two-tailed t tests were performed to assess significance on the data from the contamination testing with a threshold of P < 0.05. A homoscedastic, two-tailed, t test was used to compare the values from 300 breathing cycles between the two conditions for the in vivo study with a threshold of P < 0.05.

### A performance assessment of airborne infection isolation rooms [^113rVNDd]. American Journal of Infection Control (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) help prevent the spread of infectious agents in hospitals. The performance of 678 AIIRs was evaluated and compared with construction design guidelines.

Methods

The pressure differentials (DeltaP) between the isolation rooms and adjacent areas were measured, and ventilation and construction details were recorded for each room. Ultrafine particle concentrations were evaluated in the rooms, surrounding areas, and ventilation systems serving the rooms. Measurements were analyzed as a function of room parameters.

Results

Only 32% of the isolation rooms achieved the recommended DeltaP of -2.5 Pascals (Pa) relative to surrounding areas. AIIRs with solid ceilings had an average DeltaP of -4.4 Pa, which was significantly higher than the average DeltaP of -2.0 Pa for rooms with dropped ceilings (P = 0.0002). Isolation room ultrafine particle concentrations were more highly correlated with particle levels in surrounding areas (R(2) = 0.817) than in the ventilation systems serving the rooms (R(2) = 0.441). Almost all ventilation filters serving AIIRs collected fewer particles than anticipated.

Conclusion

The results indicate that hospitals are not all maintaining AIIRs to correspond with current guidelines. The findings also support the contention that having tightly sealed rooms helps maintain appropriate pressure differentials.

### Nanoparticle delivery of microRNA-146a regulates mechanotransduction in lung macrophages and mitigates injury during mechanical ventilation [^113eEm3f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Mechanical ventilation generates injurious forces that exacerbate lung injury. These forces disrupt lung barrier integrity, trigger proinflammatory mediator release, and differentially regulate genes and non-coding oligonucleotides including microRNAs. In this study, we identify miR-146a as a mechanosensitive microRNA in alveolar macrophages that has therapeutic potential to mitigate lung injury during mechanical ventilation. We use humanized in-vitro systems, mouse models, and biospecimens from patients to elucidate the expression dynamics of miR-146a needed to decrease lung injury during mechanical ventilation. We find that the endogenous increase in miR-146a following injurious ventilation is not sufficient to prevent lung injury. However, when miR-146a is highly overexpressed using a nanoparticle delivery platform it is sufficient to prevent injury. These data indicate that the endogenous increase in microRNA-146a during mechanical ventilation is a compensatory response that partially limits injury and that nanoparticle delivery of miR-146a is an effective strategy for mitigating lung injury during mechanical ventilation.

### Double impact of cigarette smoke and mechanical ventilation on the alveolar epithelial type II cell [^115VMnn5]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Bronchoalveolar lavage

Neutrophil cell count

To determine the inflammatory response to smoke exposure and mechanical ventilation, the number of neutrophils in the BAL fluid (BALF) was measured. Analysis of cell percentages and overall numbers of different cell populations (Figure 1 and Table 2) demonstrated an increase in neutrophils after both smoke exposure and mechanical ventilation alone. The combination of both conditions resulted in a more-than-additive, statistically significant increase in neutrophils. There was a statistically significant difference between the BALF neutrophils from rats after ventilation alone and from rats after ventilation and smoke exposure combined (Table 1).

Figure 1

The four groups depicted are nonsmoke/nonventilation (NS-NV), smoke/nonventilation (S-NV), nonsmoke/ventilation (NS-V) and smoke/ventilation (S-V). To the right of the dot blots, mean ± SD values are indicated by bars.

### Effect of ventilator mode on ventilator-free days in critically ill adults: a randomized clinical trial [^116vowEE]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

FOR EDITORIAL COMMENT, SEE

Take-Home Points

Study Question: Does the choice among 3 common ventilator modes (volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control) for critically ill adults affect the number of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation?

Results: Among 566 patients included in the primary analysis of this cluster-randomized crossover pilot trial, the number of ventilator-free days did not differ among patients treated with volume control, pressure control, or adaptive pressure control (P = 0.60). Although the median tidal volume received was similar in the 3 groups, other measures of protective mechanical ventilation differed among groups.

Interpretation: This pilot trial established the feasibility of conducting a randomized trial of ventilator mode among critically ill adults and demonstrated differences in intermediate outcomes that warrant further investigation in a larger trial.

Millions of critically ill adults receive invasive mechanical ventilation each year. Although potentially lifesaving, mechanical ventilation itself may injure the lungs, diaphragm, and other organs. In-hospital mortality among critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation in the United States remains > 30%.

To provide invasive mechanical ventilation, clinicians must select a ventilator mode, which determines how the ventilator delivers each breath. The ventilator can administer a set volume and can measure the change in pressure that occurs with the breath (eg, volume control mode), can administer a set pressure and measure the change in volume that occurs with the breath (eg, pressure control mode), or can use an algorithm to titrate the pressure administered breath by breath to maintain a target volume set by the clinician (eg, adaptive pressure control mode). Although previous studies have shown that avoiding large volumes, high pressures, and deep sedation may all improve patient outcomes, each ventilator mode delivers breaths in a way that prioritizes these variables differently. Volume control can facilitate tighter control of the volume administered, but can lead to higher pressures. Pressure control can facilitate tighter control of the pressure administered, but lead to higher volumes. As a dual-control mode, adaptive pressure control can provide the benefits of both volume control and pressure control.

### A rational framework for selecting modes of ventilation [^114tbbTa]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention for respiratory failure and thus has become the cornerstone of the practice of critical care medicine. A mechanical ventilation mode describes the predetermined pattern of patient-ventilator interaction. In recent years there has been a dizzying proliferation of mechanical ventilation modes, driven by technological advances and market pressures, rather than clinical data. The comparison of these modes is hampered by the sheer number of combinations that need to be tested against one another, as well as the lack of a coherent, logical nomenclature that accurately describes a mode. In this paper we propose a logical nomenclature for mechanical ventilation modes, akin to biological taxonomy. Accordingly, the control variable, breath sequence, and targeting schemes for the primary and secondary breaths represent the order, family, genus, and species, respectively, for the described mode. To distinguish unique operational algorithms, a fifth level of distinction, termed variety, is utilized. We posit that such coherent ordering would facilitate comparison and understanding of modes. Next we suggest that the clinical goals of mechanical ventilation may be simplified into 3 broad categories: provision of safe gas exchange; provision of comfort; and promotion of liberation from mechanical ventilation. Safety is achieved via optimization of ventilation-perfusion matching and pressure-volume relationship of the lungs. Comfort is provided by fostering patient-ventilator synchrony. Liberation is promoted by optimization of the weaning experience. Then we follow a paradigm that matches the technological capacity of a particular mode to achieving a specific clinical goal. Finally, we provide the reader with a comparison of existing modes based on these principles. The status quo in mechanical ventilation mode nomenclature impedes communication and comparison of existing mechanical ventilation modes. The proposed model, utilizing a systematic nomenclature, provides a useful framework to address this unmet need.

### Guidelines and recommendations for targeted neonatal echocardiography and cardiac point-of-care ultrasound in the neonatal intensive care unit: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^11555PaF]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Preterm transitional circulation — hemodynamic vulnerability and myocardial immaturity are emphasized: The transition from fetal to postnatal life is more complex in preterm infants with increased risk for hemodynamic compromise, with potential determinants including immaturity of the myocardium, persistence of fetal shunts, inherently smaller pulmonary vascular capacity or adverse cardiovascular effects of lung disease and related ventilation strategies, and differential cytokine and/or pharmacologic responsiveness. The preterm myocardium is composed of underdeveloped contractile mechanisms with disorganized myofibrils, immature calcium handling system, and inadequately compliant collagen, contributing to relatively reduced diastolic performance and compliance, greater intolerance to an abrupt increase in afterload and lack of reserve to cope with reduced preload, and a delay in physiologic drop in PVR secondary to lung disease coupled with failure to increase cardiac outputs and persistence of fetal shunts can contribute to a maladaptive transition.

### Peripheral blood transcriptomic sub-phenotypes of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117EmtwV]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by acute onset of bilateral pulmonary edema and hypoxemia not fully explained by cardiac dysfunction. Primarily defined for adults, ARDS affects 45,000 children in the USA annually, representing 10% of mechanically ventilated children in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs), with a mortality rate of 20% in the USA and 30% worldwide. There are no specific pharmacological therapies for adult or pediatric ARDS despite several trials, and supportive care with lung-protective ventilation and fluid restriction remains the mainstay of treatment.

ARDS is heterogeneous, with patients having distinct comorbidities and inciting etiologies. This heterogeneity has contributed to negative trial results, as therapies effective in some patients are ineffective in others. Methods to reduce heterogeneity, including sub-phenotyping using protein and mRNA biomarkers, have been proposed for improving patient selection for future clinical trials. Extensive work in adult ARDS has demonstrated differential response to positive end-expiratory pressure, conservative fluid management, and simvastatin depending on subtypes defined, in part, by protein biomarkers. By contrast, the presence of subtypes in pediatric ARDS is largely unexplored.

Whole blood transcriptomics has led to significant insights into the heterogeneity of adult and pediatric sepsis. Unsupervised clustering has identified sepsis subtypes with differential biology, and potentially differential response to therapy. Few gene expression studies have been performed in adult ARDS, and none in pediatrics. The aim of the present study was to identify sub-phenotypes of pediatric ARDS using unsupervised clustering on whole blood transcriptomics, hypothesizing that ≥ 2 subtypes would be identified.

### Comparability of quantifying relative lung ventilation with inhaledTc-technegas andXe in patients undergoing evaluation for lung transplantation [^114uoNJm]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1.
Study workflow.

The current study of existing data was approved by the Institutional Review Board (202401060) with waiver of informed consent. Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians analyzed the 133 Xe and 99m Tc-Technegas ventilation images. Quantification of relative lung ventilation with 133 Xe was performed by generating semiautomated regions of interest (ROIs) for each lung and a subjacent background region on the posterior image of the first 40 s of wash-in during tidal breathing (Fig. 2) using Hermes software (Hermes Medical Solutions). The differential lung ventilation was calculated from the background-corrected counts in each lung and expressed as the percentage of total ventilation in each lung. Quantification with 99m Tc-Technegas was performed in a similar fashion, except that the ROIs were drawn on both anterior and posterior images, and we recorded the output percentages obtained using the posterior image alone and anterior image alone, as well as using the geometric mean method (square root of the product of percentages obtained in the anterior and posterior images) (Fig. 2). The analyses were performed asynchronously for the 133 Xe and 99m Tc-Technegas imaging, with a different observer for each of these radiopharmaceuticals to avoid any potential bias while manipulating the ROIs. The images were also visually assessed on 3 domains: overall homogeneity of tracer distribution, tracer deposition in the central airways, and tracer deposition in the peripheral airways. A score of 0–3 was given for each domain, with 0 indicating no heterogeneity and no increased central or peripheral deposition, 1 indicating mild heterogeneity and mildly increased central/peripheral deposition, 2 indicating moderate heterogeneity and moderately increased central/peripheral deposition, and 3 indicating severe heterogeneity and markedly increased central or peripheral deposition.

### Chemoradiation therapy for oesophageal cancer with airway stenosis under mechanical ventilation with light sedation using dexmedetomidine alone [^115ew5Q3]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

For malignant tumours, treatment is rarely indicated in cases requiring mechanical ventilation management because such intensive care would engender a decrease in performance status. However, light sedation using dexmedetomidine might enable chemoradiation while accommodating activities of daily living. We experienced two cases of fatal tracheal invasion and airway stenosis of stage Ⅳ oesophageal cancer that were treated with chemoradiation or radiation under mechanical ventilation (one case was differential lung ventilation.) with dexmedetomidine alone and rehabilitation was performed under a ventilator. Early mobilisation by light sedation with dexmedetomidine can inhibit performance status decline attributable to mechanical ventilation. Bridging tracheal intubation with light sedation by dexmedetomidine for temporary chemoradiation therapy to reduce tumour volume might present a good alternative for patients with malignant tumour.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [^113X3efn]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

COVID-19 is a new disease in the human population and this has led to an increase in the number of patients in need of mechanical ventilation, which in turn introduces the risk of VAP. COVID-19 can present in various severe manifestations and reports of co-infections vary. However, often these reports suffer from a lack of clarity around the severity of illness, location of patients (critical care vs non-critical care), timing of sampling relative to onset of disease and, where applicable, the use of mechanical ventilation. Here, we report on the most severely affected COVID-19 patients who required ICU admission with mechanical ventilation. We found that relative to patients without COVID-19, the hazard of VAP was significantly elevated.

Conventional surveillance for VAP uses incidence density, which we calculated to allow comparison with previously published reports. We found a high incidence density of confirmed VAP (28/1000 ventilator days) amongst patients with COVID-19, whilst those without COVID-19 had rates closer to those reported from other units in the pre-COVID-19 era, where incident densities were 6–14/1000 ventilator days for confirmed VAP were reported. As sessional use of personal protective equipment remained in place until the end of July 2020, for management of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, we do not think that this influenced the differential acquisition of VAP amongst these two groups.

The distribution of infecting organism was similar between patients with and without COVID-19, and reflects that reported in the literature from previous surveys of ICU-acquired infections from before the COVID era. The use of the TAC allowed more rapid identification of organisms, most of which were subsequently identified by culture. Notably there were a few organisms the TAC did not detect, largely because sequences for these organisms were not present on the card, these were distributed between both the COVID-19 and non-COVID patients.

At the lung microbiome level, we observed no difference in the composition of organisms between COVID-19 positive and non-COVID patients who developed VAP. Reassuringly, antibiotic susceptibility of the causative pathogens was similar in the two groups (data not shown) and this meant that conventional antimicrobial regimens could be used.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^1124atEF]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Low tidal volume ventilation in non-ARDS respiratory failure — For adults with sepsis-induced respiratory failure (without acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), we suggest using low tidal volume ventilation as compared to high tidal volume ventilation. This is a weak recommendation with low quality of evidence. Prior guidance in ARDS specified low tidal volume (Vt 4–8 mL/kg of predicted body weight) versus higher volumes (Vt > 8 mL/kg). Supporting evidence includes a systematic review showing reduced composite ARDS or pneumonia with low versus high tidal volume ventilation (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98) and an analysis of three RCTs (1,129 patients) showing no mortality difference with low Vt (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.26) with a trend toward lower ARDS risk (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.02). The rationale adds, We therefore suggest that low tidal volume ventilation be used in all patients with sepsis who are receiving mechanical ventilation to avoid underuse or delayed use of this intervention.

Figure 3
Influence of minute ventilation on breathing frequency for two patients of differing body size. Minute ventilation influences on breathing frequency for two patients of differing body size (50 kg and 85 kg). Using the 6 ml/kg predicted body weight guideline, a small patient would be obligated to breathe at an unacceptably high frequency as minute ventilation increases (15 and 20 l/minute). Observing the commonly used upper limit of 30 breaths/minute, tidal volumes far in excess of the 6 ml/kg criterion would be required to ventilate the smaller patient in this higher range (500 and 670 ml, as opposed to 300 ml). br, breaths; pbw, predicted body weight.

We should also modify therapy according to the patient's physiological need. For example, employing a guideline-approved small tidal volume without reducing a high minute ventilation demand may incur dyspnea as well as inappropriate high breathing frequencies. Whenever possible, we should attempt to reduce the ventilation intensity as well as the patient's demand for support. Reducing agitation, pain, body temperature, and metabolic acidosis are often addressable. Sedation may also be required to tolerate permissive hypercapnia. Refocusing on the pressure difference across the lung is important, as the peak and driving transpulmonary (transalveolar) pressures are those that count with respect to the causation of iatrogenic lung damage. In theory, knowing the functional residual capacity and the transalveolar (as opposed to plateau) static pressure would be necessary to interpret the safety of our tidal volume selection.

### Ventilation failure with elective tracheostomy during oral cancer surgery: a case of tracheal diverticulum [^114ZMTM9]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Tracheal diverticulum is usually detected incidentally. Rarely, it may lead to difficulty in securing the airway intraoperatively. Our patient underwent oncological resection under general anaesthesia for advanced oral cancer. Elective tracheostomy was performed at the end of the surgery, and a cuffed tracheostomy tube (T-tube) of 7.5mm size was inserted through the tracheostoma. Despite repeated attempts at T-tube insertion, ventilation could not be established. However, on advancing the endotracheal tube beyond tracheostoma, ventilation was restored. The T-tube was inserted into the trachea under fibreoptic guidance achieving successful ventilation. A fibreoptic bronchoscopy through the tracheostoma performed after decannulation revealed a mucosalised diverticulum extending behind the posterior wall of the trachea. The bottom of the diverticulum showed mucosa-lined cartilaginous ridge with differentiation into smaller bronchiole-like structures. Tracheal diverticulum should be considered as a possible differential in case of failed ventilation following an otherwise uneventful tracheostomy.

### Diagnostic utility of the soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with bilateral lung infiltrates [^1173S91B]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Differential diagnosis of patients with bilateral lung infiltrates remains a difficult problem for intensive care clinicians. Diverse presumptive clinical diagnoses of bilateral lung infiltrates include severe pneumonia induced by bacteria, virus, fungi or tuberculosis, and noninfectious inflammatory diseases caused by collagen vascular disease associated with interstitial lung disease, acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome or drug-induced lung disease. Notably, several noninfectious processes other than pneumonia lead to fever, leukocytosis, hypoxemia, purulent tracheal secretions, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. To enhance the specificity of clinical criteria for diagnosing ventilator-associated pneumonia, the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) was introduced, which showed a high diagnostic accuracy for ventilator-associated pneumonia in some cases. Gibot and colleagues also showed that CPIS could differentiate between patients with and without pneumonia. However, the utility of CPIS remains to be validated, particularly in patients with bilateral infiltration. The need for serology and microbiological tests could delay differential diagnosis for 48 to 72 hours, and the positive culture rate may be low.

Triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREMs) are members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, a critical component of the innate immune defense system against infection. TREM-1 expression is upregulated by extracellular bacteria and fungi but is weak in mycobacterial, viral, intracellular bacterial, and noninfectious inflammatory disorders. However, there are conflicting reports on the potential function of soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid as a biomarker of ventilator-associated pneumonia measured by mini-bronchoalveolar lavage or non-directed bronchial lavage (NBL). Consequently, more clinical evidence is required to establish the diagnostic role of sTREM-1 in BAL fluid. In this study we focus solely on patients with bilateral lung infiltrates, regardless of mechanical ventilation.

### Liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults: executive summary of an official American College of Chest Physicians / American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1118QjN6]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This clinical practice guideline addresses six questions related to liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults. It is the result of a collaborative effort between the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST).

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel posed six clinical questions in a population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) format. A comprehensive literature search and evidence synthesis was performed for each question, which included appraising the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The Evidence-to-Decision framework was applied to each question, requiring the panel to evaluate and weigh the importance of the problem, confidence in the evidence, certainty about how much the public values the main outcomes, magnitude and balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, resources and costs associated with the intervention, impact on health disparities, and acceptability and feasibility of the intervention.

Results

Evidence-based recommendations were formulated and graded initially by subcommittees and then modified following full panel discussions. The recommendations were confirmed by confidential electronic voting; approval required that at least 80% of the panel members agree with the recommendation.

Conclusions

The panel provides recommendations regarding liberation from mechanical ventilation. The details regarding the evidence and rationale for each recommendation are presented in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine and CHEST.

Domain 5: Low tidal volume ventilation

Question 5.1: In adult patients ARDS and COVID-19-related ARDS, does low tidal volume ventilation alone compared with more traditional approaches to ventilation decrease mortality?

Background

In the early 1960s, researchers and clinicians showed that mechanical ventilation with small Vt caused gradual loss of lung volume with hypoxemia due to right-to-left shunting through regions with poor ventilation. Consequently, use of large tidal volumes of 12–15 mL/kg body weight was recommended. Recognition of a number of physiological concepts changed this approach and led to the current era of lung-protective ventilation using small Vt: (i) hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis are well tolerated if the patient is well oxygenated, (ii) mechanical ventilation that allows for derecruitment and recruitment of lung units and/or over-distension of lung units associated with high transpulmonary pressures can worsen existing lung injury or may lead to de novo lung injury, and (iii) the effective pulmonary gas volume in patients with ARDS is decreased (baby lung) and thus ventilation with even 'normal Vt' can lead to over-distension and VILI. A corollary of this latter concept is that in patients with severe ARDS, regional lung over-distension can occur even if these patients are ventilated with small tidal volumes. The recognition of VILI lead to the concept of "protective ventilation" as many of the pathophysiological consequences of VILI mimic those of ARDS. This development heralded current use of low Vt ventilation strategies with appropriate levels of PEEP to limit lung distention and atelectrauma.

Use of ventilation strategies with low Vt has been shown in animal and human studies to decrease VILI. In the clinical setting, low Vt ventilation is implemented by delivering tidal volumes in the range of 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW)], without aiming for optimal gas exchange, but accepting gas exchange within safety parameters. Traditionally used approaches to invasive mechanical ventilation have not prioritized limiting VILI but have focused on normalizing arterial blood gases.

### Flow dynamics using high-frequency jet ventilation in a model of bronchopleural fistula [^116AGRDR]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Positive pressure ventilation in patients with a bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is associated with variable, unpredictable gas leaks that can impair gas exchange. The optimum settings for high-frequency jet ventilation in this scenario are unclear. We investigated flow dynamics with BPFs of 2 and 10 mm, at various positions and with different jet ventilator settings in a bench-top model.

Methods

A 2 or 10 mm length fistula was created at proximal, middle, or distal sites in standard artificial ventilator 'test' lungs and cadaveric porcine lungs. The effects of alterations in frequency, applied pressure, and on entrained, expired, and leak volumes were determined using gauge and differential pressure sensors.

Results

Entrained, delivered, and leak volumes were affected markedly by ventilator settings, particularly frequency: leaks were much greater at frequencies < 100 min(-1). The leak/expired volume ratio varied between 0% and 92%. Leak and entrained volumes increased progressively with more proximally situated fistulae, whereas the measured expired volume decreased. Leak volumes with a 2 mm fistula were approximately half that of a 10 mm fistula across all ventilator frequencies. All volumes increased with increased driving pressure. The optimum injection time varied depending on BPF position and the accepted compromise between leak and expired volumes. Entrained volume contributed up to 50% of the total tidal volume.

Conclusions

These data suggest that gas leak will be minimized and ventilator volumes maintained during jet ventilation using frequencies > 200 min(-1) and lower driving pressures, but confirmatory clinical studies are required. Values displayed by the jet ventilator are unreliable.

### Image phenotyping of preterm-born children using hyperpolarizedXe lung magnetic resonance imaging and multiple-breath washout [^113YR7dh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Preterm birth is associated with low lung function in childhood, but little is known about the lung microstructure in childhood. Objectives: We assessed the differential associations between the historical diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and current lung function phenotypes on lung ventilation and microstructure in preterm-born children using hyperpolarized 129 Xe ventilation and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multiple-breath washout (MBW). Methods: Data were available from 63 children (aged 9–13 yr), including 44 born preterm (≤ 34 weeks' gestation) and 19 term-born control subjects (⩾37 weeks' gestation). Preterm-born children were classified, using spirometry, as prematurity-associated obstructive lung disease (POLD; FEV 1 < lower limit of normal [LLN] and FEV 1 /FVC < LLN), prematurity-associated preserved ratio of impaired spirometry (FEV 1 < LLN and FEV 1 /FVC⩾LLN), preterm-(FEV 1 ⩾LLN) and term-born control subjects, and those with and without BPD. Ventilation heterogeneity metrics were derived from 129 Xe ventilation MRI and SF 6 MBW. Alveolar microstructural dimensions were derived from 129 Xe diffusion-weighted MRI. Measurements and Main Results: 129 Xe ventilation defect percentage and ventilation heterogeneity index were significantly increased in preterm-born children with POLD. In contrast, mean 129 Xe apparent diffusion coefficient, 129 Xe apparent diffusion coefficient interquartile range, and 129 Xe mean alveolar dimension interquartile range were significantly increased in preterm-born children with BPD, suggesting changes of alveolar dimensions. MBW metrics were all significantly increased in the POLD group compared with preterm- and term-born control subjects. Linear regression confirmed the differential effects of obstructive disease on ventilation defects and BPD on lung microstructure. Conclusion: We show that ventilation abnormalities are associated with POLD, and BPD in infancy is associated with abnormal lung microstructure.

### Influence of compliance and resistance of the test lung on the accuracy of the tidal volume delivered by the ventilator [^112g7URv]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, the influence of test lung compliance and resistance on the accuracy of the delivered tidal volume was evaluated in vitro on two typical commercial ventilators under well-controlled conditions. Our results showed that for the tested ventilator S1with a flow sensor near the expiratory valve, both inspired and expired VT errors correlated to test lung compliance, whereas for the tested ventilator S2 with a flow sensor located at the Y piece, no such a clear relationship was found. Furthermore, both ventilators exhibited poor correlation between test lung resistance and the errors of VT delivery. At the high resistance value of 200 cmH₂O/(L/s), the recordedwas much higher than theestimated by the classical equation of motion. In contrast, at the lower resistance values of 5, 20, 50 and 100 cmH₂O/(L/s), the recordedwas very close to the estimated. Overall, the errors of VT delivery were in the range of ± 14% on two ventilators studied.

In fact, the effect of compliance and resistance on the accuracy of VT delivery depends on two key factors: the type of flow sensor and the site of flow measurement. The most common flow sensor technologies used in commercially available ventilators are: differential pressure flow sensors, hot wire anemometers and ultrasonic flowmeters. Each kind of the flow sensor is based on the different working principle, and thus has a specific sensitivity throughout the flow range. Among them, the ventilator S1 tested currently used hot wire anemometers and the ventilator S2 adopted differential pressure flow sensors for the flow measurement. The functional principles of these two flow sensors are schematically shown in Fig. 6.

### Mechanical ventilation strategies: what's new and what's worth keeping? [^115sPihR]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

Many technologic and management strategies related to mechanical ventilation have been introduced in recent years. Strategies that avoid intubation and get patients extubated sooner decrease costs related to mechanical ventilation. In general, "people" solutions such as weaning protocols are preferable to "technology" solutions such as new ventilator modes. It must be remembered that mechanical ventilation is supportive-it is not curative-and has the potential to do harm if applied incorrectly. There is an increasing list of examples in which short-term physiologic outcomes such as improvements in blood gas values are not related to patient-important outcomes such as survival. When new mechanical ventilation technology and strategies are introduced, a question we need to ask ourselves is whether these are solutions for problems or whether these are simply solutions in search of problems.

### Development and assessment of the performance of a shared ventilatory system that uses clinically available components to individualize tidal volumes [^1119npje]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Article Summary

Strengths and limitations of this study

Our solution demonstrates the potential to ventilate two patients simultaneously while delivering differing tidal volumes in each circuit, using equipment readily available in most hospitals.
Accurate and reproducible titration of tidal volumes to each 'lung' was possible over a wide range of ventilator settings, and under conditions of varying compliance and resistance.
Alteration of one simulated 'lung' conditions had minimal impact on the tidal volumes delivered to the unaffected lung.
The system relies on patients being sedated and paralysed.
The system does allow for measurement of peak and plateau pressures in individual patients, though a complex intervention to isolate each patient is required.

### Effects of a catecholamine-induced increase in cardiac output on lung injury after experimental unilateral pulmonary acid instillation [^116d7GT1]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Increasing pulmonary blood flow aggravated ventilation-associated lung injury in ex vivo animal experiments, but data were less consistent in an in vivo animal model and do not reflect redistributed lung perfusion seen in clinical acute lung injury. We sought to determine the effects of increased cardiac output on markers of lung injury in an in vivo model of inhomogeneous lung perfusion and injury.

Design

Prospective, controlled animal study.

Setting

Experimental research laboratory of a university hospital.

Subjects

A total of 50 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, male Wistar rats.

Interventions

Unilateral lung injury was induced in rats by left lung acid instillation. After 24 hrs, animals were anesthetized and subjected to mechanical ventilation (tidal volume, 8 mL/kg; positive end-expiratory pressure, 7 cm H2O; FIO2, 0.4) and continuous infusion of either 10 microg x kg x min dobutamine or isotonic saline (control) for 4 hrs.

Measurements and Main Results

Cardiac output and differential lung perfusion were recorded throughout the ventilation period. Right and left lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, cytokines and inflammatory cells in lung lavage, and histologic lung injury were measured postmortem. After acid injury, lung perfusion was preferentially distributed to the noninjured lung. Dobutamine increased baseline cardiac output (> 70%) and perfusion of both lungs (left, acid-instilled lung: from 16 ± 2 to 29 ± 6 mL/min; right, non-acid-instilled lung: from 54 ± 3 to 98 ± 7 mL/min). There was no difference in left lung injury between dobutamine- and saline-infused animals, but right lung injury was aggravated in dobutamine-infused animals, as indicated by increased lung edema, histologic lung injury, and cell counts in lavage.

Conclusions

In the setting of unilateral lung injury and uneven lung perfusion, a dobutamine-induced increase in cardiac output has potentially detrimental effects on the opposite lung.

### A randomized trial of mesenchymal stromal cells for moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19 [^113JJyK7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In our trial, MSC therapy, compared with sham control, in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19–related ARDS did not produce the hypothesized reduction in 30-day mortality or improve ventilator-free days over 60 days after randomization. During the pandemic, new insights emerged into the existence of different inflammatory subtypes and the importance of age within the overall COVID-19–related ARDS population, which might underlie a differential response to immunomodulatory therapy. Future research is needed to identify the potential benefits of MSCs in susceptible phenotypes.

### Effects of propofol and desflurane anaesthesia on the alveolar inflammatory response to one-lung ventilation [^116aCNWU]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

One-lung ventilation (OLV) induces a pro-inflammatory response including cytokine release and leucocyte recruitment in the ventilated lung. Whether volatile or i.v. anaesthetics differentially modulate the alveolar inflammatory response to OLV is unclear.

Methods

Thirty patients, ASA II or III, undergoing open thoracic surgery were randomized to receive either propofol 4 mg kg(-1) h(-1) (n = 15) or 1 MAC desflurane in air (n = 15) during thoracic surgery. Analgesia was provided by i.v. infusion of remifentanil (0.25 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) in both groups. The patients were mechanically ventilated according to a standard protocol during two-lung ventilation and OLV. Fibre optic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the ventilated lung was performed before and after OLV and 2 h postoperatively. Alveolar cells, protein, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin (IL)-8, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM), IL10, and polymorphonuclear (PMN) elastase were determined in the BAL fluid. Data were analysed by parametric or non-parametric tests, as indicated.

Results

In both groups, an increase in pro-inflammatory markers was found after OLV and 2 h postoperatively; however, the fraction of alveolar granulocytes (median 63.7 vs 31.1%, P < 0.05) was significantly higher in the propofol group compared with the desflurane group. The time courses of alveolar elastase, IL-8, and IL-10 differed between groups, and alveolar TNFalpha (7.4 vs 3.1 pg ml(-1), P < 0.05) and sICAM-1 (52.3 vs 26.3 ng ml(-1), P < 0.05) were significantly higher in the propofol group.

Conclusions

These data indicate that pro-inflammatory reactions during OLV were influenced by the type of general anaesthesia. Different patterns of alveolar cytokines may be a result of increased granulocyte recruitment during propofol anaesthesia.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: we can' T miss regional lung perfusion! [^114mPjXV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

In adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), life-threatening hypoxemia may occur, dictating the need for differentiated ventilator strategies. Pronounced consolidation and/or atelectasis have been well documented in ARDS, but the contribution of regional perfusion to oxygenation has been poorly addressed. Evidence has accumulated that, in ARDS, regional perfusion is extremely variable and may affect oxygenation, independently from the amount of atelectatic-consolidated lung regions. Thus, the response in oxygenation to different ventilatory settings, both during controlled and assisted mechanical ventilation, should be interpreted with caution. In fact, gas exchange may be not determined solely by changes in aeration, but also redistribution of perfusion. Furthermore, regional perfusion can play an important role in worsening of lung injury due to increased transmural pressures. In addition, distribution of perfusion in lungs might affect the delivery of drugs through the pulmonary circulation, including antibiotics. In recent years, several techniques have been developed to determine pulmonary blood flow with increasing level of spatial resolution, allowing a better understanding of normal physiology and various pathophysiological conditions, but most of them are restricted to experimental or clinical research. Lung ultrasound and novel algorithms for electrical impedance tomography represent new promising techniques that could enable physicians to assess the distribution of pulmonary blood flow at the bedside. In ARDS, we cannot afford missing regional lung perfusion! Please see related article: http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12871-015-0013-0.

Regarding respiratory support for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to mechanical ventilation, SCCM 2021 guidelines recommend to use low tidal volume ventilation (4–8 mL/kg of predicted body weight) over higher tidal volumes (> 8 mL/kg) in mechanically ventilated adult patients with COVID-19 and ARDS.

### Pediatric pulmonary hypertension: guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society [^111tp8XA]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn — clinical diagnosis and general care specify that clinical manifestations include labile oxygenation, differential saturation with higher Spo2 in the right upper extremity compared with a lower extremity, or profound hypoxemia despite oxygen and mechanical ventilation; these findings are not specific for PPHN, and echocardiography is required to exclude CHD and thus establish the diagnosis while also determining whether LV dysfunction is present. Management includes optimization of lung volume and function, oxygen delivery, and support of cardiac function; systemic blood pressure should be maintained at normal levels for age with volume and cardiotonic therapy, whereas increasing blood pressure to supraphysiological levels solely to drive a left-to-right shunt across the PDA may transiently improve oxygenation but will not reduce PVR and should be avoided. Oxygen is commonly used, but extreme hyperoxia (Fio2 > 0.6) may be ineffective and may aggravate lung injury; poor lung expansion will exacerbate PPHN, exogenous surfactant may improve lung expansion and reverse PPHN in significant parenchymal disease but did not reduce ECMO use and carries a risk for acute airway obstruction, therefore the use of surfactant should be considered only for infants with severe parenchymal lung disease and poor lung recruitment. Acidosis can induce pulmonary vasoconstriction and should be avoided; forced alkalosis induced by hyperventilation or infusion of sodium bicarbonate yields transient improvements in Pao2 without demonstrated long-term benefit.
