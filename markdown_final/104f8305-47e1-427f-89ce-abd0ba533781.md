In patient treatment of sepsis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about inpatient sepsis management, preserving natural self-verification and any initial missteps with corrections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about early recognition and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the immediate stabilization priorities, including fluids and vasopressors. Next, I will examine antimicrobial therapy timing, spectrum, and stewardship. After that, I need to check source control and organ support strategies. Finally, I will review de-escalation, monitoring, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: sepsis is a time-critical medical emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment, and I should anchor this to Sepsis-3 and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 recommendations to ensure I'm not overstating any single element [^111T4vxG] [^1164Az2o].

> I will now examine early recognition and risk stratification; wait, let me verify the screening tools and thresholds. The qSOFA criteria (respiratory rate ≥ 22, altered mentation, systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg) help flag high-risk patients outside the ICU, while SOFA helps quantify organ dysfunction and prognosticate, but I should confirm that neither tool alone diagnoses sepsis and that clinical judgment remains essential [^111T4vxG] [^1138QvVG]. Hold on, I should verify the lactate threshold; I initially thought a lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L defined septic shock, but that's not correct — septic shock is defined by vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with lactate > 2 mmHg despite fluids, so I need to correct that and avoid propagating a misconception [^notfound].

> Next, I should review immediate stabilization. Let me think about fluids first: for adults with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, I should confirm the suggestion to give at least 30 mL/kg IV crystalloids within the first 3 hours, while emphasizing frequent reassessment and dynamic measures to guide ongoing needs, and I should remember that the ESICM 2025 guidance supports crystalloids up to 30 mL/kg initially with individualized optimization thereafter [^1164Az2o] [^1145gRY3]. Wait, I should double-check the vasopressor anchor: norepinephrine is first-line to target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, with vasopressin as an adjunct to reduce norepinephrine dose; epinephrine is reasonable if norepinephrine is inadequate, and I need to ensure I'm not prematurely favoring dopamine outside of selected bradycardia contexts [^114zHw6V].

> Now, antimicrobial therapy — this is where timing is critical, so I should confirm the hierarchy. For suspected septic shock, administer broad-spectrum IV antibiotics immediately, ideally within 1 hour; for sepsis without shock, obtain cultures and assess rapidly, giving antibiotics within 3 hours if infection remains likely, while deferring in low-likelihood, non-shock presentations with close monitoring, and I should verify that this aligns with SSC 2021 and emergency care consensus [^117TtP7Y] [^112RX5uz] [^113WEazN] [^111Dk1ff]. Hold on, I should verify spectrum choices: in patients at high risk for multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms, empiric double gram-negative coverage is suggested, whereas in low-risk patients, single-agent coverage is reasonable, with de-escalation once susceptibilities return; I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing combination therapy beyond the high-risk context [^114jogr7] [^114ENnHa].

> I need to ensure source control is addressed promptly. Source control should be pursued as soon as feasible after initial resuscitation, generally within 6–12 hours when possible, balancing invasiveness with effectiveness and choosing the least invasive option that achieves control; I should confirm that prolonged medical stabilization in lieu of source control is discouraged in severe cases, especially septic shock [^114tWm4Z].

> Next, I should review organ support and adjunctive therapies. For ARDS, I should confirm lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes, limitation of plateau pressures, appropriate PEEP, and consider prone positioning for severe hypoxemia; for sedation, I need to minimize depth and use daily interruption strategies; for glucose, a reasonable target is 140–180 mg/dL; and for transfusion, a hemoglobin threshold around 7 g/dL is acceptable in stable patients without ischemic heart disease or ongoing hemorrhage, with higher targets individualized when tissue hypoperfusion is suspected [^114zHw6V] [^113GKuUS]. But wait, what about corticosteroids? I should confirm that for adults with septic shock requiring vasopressors, IV hydrocortisone 200 mg/day can be considered if hypotension persists despite fluids and vasopressors, acknowledging persistent controversy and the need to individualize decisions [^114zHw6V].

> I will now examine antimicrobial stewardship and de-escalation. Daily reassessment for de-escalation is recommended, and when source control is adequate and the clinical course is favorable, shorter courses of therapy are suggested; I should also consider procalcitonin plus clinical evaluation to inform discontinuation when duration is unclear, while remembering that evidence quality is low and clinical judgment remains paramount [^111mfgHu] [^1122xiuH] [^113JyKUf]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there was strong RCT evidence for de-escalation improving mortality, but I should verify — Cochrane found no adequate RCTs to support or refute de-escalation on mortality grounds, so I need to frame this as a stewardship and safety practice rather than a mortality-proven strategy [^117TVvCi].

> Let me consider monitoring and reassessment. I should confirm that dynamic measures such as passive leg raise, stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, or echocardiography are preferred over static parameters to guide fluid responsiveness, and that lactate clearance can be used alongside clinical endpoints to track perfusion, while continuously re-evaluating for alternative diagnoses and discontinuing antibiotics if infection is excluded [^1164Az2o] [^111NPCkz]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overinterpreting any single number; trends and the patient's trajectory matter more than isolated values [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations and settings. In pediatrics, I need to adjust fluid volumes and vasopressor choices, and limit hydrocortisone to suspected absolute adrenal insufficiency; in resource-limited settings, I should prioritize early recognition, rapid antibiotics for high-likelihood sepsis, and simplified resuscitation strategies, recognizing that large crystalloid volumes may be harmful in some contexts; in chronic liver disease, I should individualize fluids and consider albumin earlier; in pregnancy, I should maintain higher MAP targets and involve obstetrics early [^114zHw6V] [^114stj1t] [^116JnXM9]. I should double-check that these adaptations align with consensus statements and local feasibility constraints [^114XrJKL].

> Finally, I need to synthesize the core principles. Early recognition with qSOFA/SOFA plus clinical judgment, immediate resuscitation with fluids and norepinephrine, rapid broad-spectrum antibiotics tailored to risk and local epidemiology, timely source control, protocolized organ support, and disciplined stewardship with daily de-escalation together constitute the evidence-aligned backbone of inpatient sepsis care; I should emphasize that mortality improvements over recent decades likely reflect these systems-based practices rather than any single drug, and that ongoing research priorities include precision phenotyping and individualized resuscitation strategies to address heterogeneity of treatment effects [^111T4vxG] [^111j6k7T] [^116oeu3W].

Inpatient sepsis care centers on **early recognition** with qSOFA/SOFA [^114m6UYR], **immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour** [^117TtP7Y], and **rapid source control** [^114tWm4Z]. Initial resuscitation uses **30 mL/kg crystalloids** [^1164Az2o] with norepinephrine to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^114zHw6V]; vasopressin or epinephrine are added if needed [^114zHw6V]. Hydrocortisone is for refractory shock [^114zHw6V], and daily antimicrobial de-escalation is essential [^111mfgHu]. Supportive care includes lung-protective ventilation, glucose control, DVT/ulcer prophylaxis, and early nutrition [^114zHw6V]; **early ICU transfer** is indicated for shock or high-risk organ failure [^112onkXQ]. Early, protocolized care reduces mortality and complications [^112vFMAx].

---

## Early recognition and assessment

- **Screening tools**: Use qSOFA/SOFA for early detection and risk stratification [^114m6UYR] [^1138QvVG].
- **Initial evaluation**: Obtain blood cultures before antibiotics, assess lactate, and identify the infection source [^114zHw6V] [^114qFyMu].
- **Severity assessment**: Use qSOFA, SOFA, and lactate to guide urgency and level of care [^114m6UYR].

---

## Antimicrobial therapy

- **Timing**: Start broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour of recognition [^117TtP7Y] [^114zHw6V].
- **Empiric coverage**: Tailor to likely source, local resistance, and patient risk factors [^114jogr7] [^111W8GHj].
- **De-escalation**: Reassess daily and narrow therapy based on cultures [^111mfgHu] [^117TVvCi].
- **Duration**: Use shorter courses (7–8 days) if source control is adequate [^1122xiuH].

---

## Hemodynamic resuscitation

- **Initial fluids**: Give 30 mL/kg crystalloids within 3 hours for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion [^1164Az2o].
- **Vasopressors**: Start norepinephrine to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^114qFyMu] [^114zHw6V].
- **Adjuncts**: Add vasopressin or epinephrine if MAP remains inadequate [^114qFyMu] [^114zHw6V].
- **Steroids**: Use hydrocortisone for refractory shock [^114qFyMu] [^114zHw6V].

---

## Source control

Source control should be pursued **as soon as feasible after resuscitation** [^114tWm4Z], using the least invasive effective method and escalating to open surgery if needed [^114tWm4Z].

---

## Supportive care and organ support

- **Respiratory**: Use lung-protective ventilation for ARDS [^114zHw6V].
- **Renal**: Use continuous or intermittent renal replacement therapy as indicated [^114zHw6V].
- **Glycemic control**: Target glucose 140–180 mg/dL [^notfound].
- **DVT/ulcer prophylaxis**: Provide standard prophylaxis [^114zHw6V].
- **Nutrition**: Start early enteral nutrition when feasible [^114zHw6V].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Monitoring should include **continuous vital signs, lactate, and organ function** [^notfound]. Reassessment entails **daily review for de-escalation, source control, and complications** [^111mfgHu].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and communication

Multidisciplinary involvement of **ICU, infectious diseases, pharmacy, and nursing** is essential [^notfound]. Communication with **early goals-of-care discussions** and family engagement is recommended [^117GHbkz].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **resource-limited settings**, where care must be adapted to local constraints [^114XrJKL] [^114stj1t], and **pediatric patients**, who require weight-based fluids and vasoactive dosing [^114zHw6V].

---

## Outcomes and quality improvement

Outcomes improve with **early recognition, antibiotics, and source control**, reducing mortality and complications [^114vEDrH] [^114tWm4Z]. Quality improvement through **sepsis bundles and performance programs** enhances adherence and outcomes [^112vFMAx] [^114QsdDa].

---

Inpatient sepsis care requires **early recognition**, **prompt antibiotics**, **source control**, and **supportive care**, with **multidisciplinary coordination** to improve survival and reduce complications.

Conclusions

The last few decades of sepsis research have helped clinicians better understand the importance of identifying sepsis early and treating aggressively. Nonetheless, there is still much debate about how to identify these patients and which criteria are most predictive for the development of sepsis and septic shock. The recent updates, particularly the recommendations regarding SOFA and qSOFA scores, operationalize the definitions of sepsis into a clinically useful model that can be used by clinicians to identify the patients most at risk of deterioration. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

The diagnosis and management of severe sepsis and septic shock is a complex and dynamic process. Newer evidence-based interventions are constantly being developed and implemented with the purpose of improving morbidity and mortality. Current investigations are being performed in hospital environments to determine the change in behaviors and clinical impact with the most recent recommendations. The use of standardized treatment protocols in addition to newer diagnostic and treatment modalities in patients who have severe sepsis and septic shock can continue to improve patient-related outcomes and the damaging effect of these diseases on society.

Sepsis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. Since the development of early goal-directed therapy, mortality rates have decreased, but sepsis remains a major cause of death in patients arriving at the emergency department or staying in hospital. In this forum article, we asked clinicians and researchers with expertise in sepsis care to discuss the importance of rapid detection and treatment of the condition, as well as special considerations in different patient groups.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114m6UYR]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis remains a highly lethal entity resulting in more than 200 000 deaths in the United States each year. The in-hospital mortality approaches 30% despite advances in critical care during the last several decades. The direct health care costs in the United States exceed $24 billion dollars annually and continue to escalate each year especially as the population ages. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign published their initial clinical practice guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008, 2012 and most recently in 2016 following the convening of the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force. This task force was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine to address prior criticisms of the multiple definitions used clinically for sepsis-related illnesses. In the 2016 guidelines, sepsis is redefined by the taskforce as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In addition to using the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to more rapidly identify patients with sepsis, the task force also proposed a novel scoring system to rapidly screen for patients outside the ICU who are at risk of developing sepsis: the 'quickSOFA' (qSOFA) score. To date, the largest reductions in mortality have been associated with early identification of sepsis, initiation of a 3-hour care bundle and rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial, and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111uSmjV]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common and life-threatening illness in the ICU, requiring timely and effective antimicrobial therapy. The aims of this review are to identify the most common sites of sepsis, the likely pathogens, and the optimal approach to antimicrobial therapy. Effective therapy must be balanced by the need to avoid overuse of broad spectrum agents and thus must be accompanied by a commitment to antimicrobial stewardship. Using experts in this topic, we reviewed the literature relevant to antimicrobial management of sepsis and recommend key principles for management.

### Timing and spectrum of antibiotic treatment for suspected sepsis and septic shock: why so controversial? [^116tRBaf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis guidelines and mandates encourage increasingly aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials for suspected sepsis and septic shock. This has caused considerable controversy due to weaknesses in the underlying evidence and fear that overly strict antibiotic deadlines may harm patients by perpetuating or escalating overtreatment. Indeed, a third or more of patients currently treated for sepsis and septic shock have noninfectious or nonbacterial conditions. These patients risk all the potential harms of antibiotics without their possible benefits. Updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines now emphasize the importance of tailoring antibiotics to each patient's likelihood of infection, risk for drug-resistant pathogens, and severity-of-illness.

### Equilibrating SSC guidelines with individualized care [^111c3qx8]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a major cause of death worldwide, not least because complex interventions need to be provided within a short window of opportunity. Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of sepsis are therefore welcome, providing a common ground for all clinicians involved in decision-making regardless of their expertise. Such guidelines should therefore serve as an overarching reference document. As previously stated, ' Guidelines are the product of an explicit, systematic approach to the evaluation and synthesis of available information on a particular clinical topic. They are not a compilation of truths, but are a summary of what is accepted by the authors as the best available evidence at that time '.

As the evidence base evolves over time, the new Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines are timely and important. We appreciate the tremendous amount of time invested by the experts who formulated the new guidelines to provide the intensive care community with a clear and comprehensive manuscript. We also recognize the challenge of providing evidence-based guidelines when the strength of evidence available to direct recommendations is limited. Indeed, the large majority of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) performed over the last three decades in intensive care medicine, including those in sepsis, have shown no significant beneficial effect of the tested intervention on outcomes. At face value, this may simply suggest that the myriad of interventions that have been tested are all ineffective. However, it is more likely that subsets of patients who benefit from specific treatments have yet to be identified. The often broad patient inclusion criteria could easily lead to dilution of positive findings by non-responders, or to positive effects in some patients being offset by harm in others. This treatment effect heterogeneity has been clearly indicated in many trials (for example).

### Surviving sepsis: a guide to the guidelines [^115LHQs5]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The revised Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock have recently been published. These guidelines represent the end product of an intense process and provide a template approach to the early resuscitation and support of patients with sepsis, based on a synthesis of evidence that has been shown to improve the outcome of the septic patient. The SSC guidelines arose from a recognition that care of the septic patient was suboptimal for at least three reasons. First, the entity of sepsis was frequently not diagnosed in a timely fashion, allowing the process to evolve into a life-threatening syndrome of major physiologic organ system dysfunction. Secondly, even when sepsis was recognized, the urgency of treatment was underappreciated - and so haemodynamic resuscitation was tentative, and the administration of effective antibiotic therapy was often delayed. Finally, treatment was often suboptimal, and failed to take advantage of emerging insights into optimal approaches to patient management. The revised guidelines are far from perfect, but they represent the best available synthesis of contemporary knowledge in this area and as such should be promoted.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign research priorities 2023 [^111j6k7T]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome, and pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

Shortly after publication of the most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, the Surviving Sepsis Research Committee, a multiprofessional group of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, convened virtually and iteratively developed the article and recommendations, which represents an update from the 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities.

Methods

Each task force member submitted five research questions on any sepsis-related subject. Committee members then independently ranked their top three priorities from the list generated. The highest rated clinical and basic science questions were developed into the current article.

Results

A total of 81 questions were submitted. After merging similar questions, there were 34 clinical and ten basic science research questions submitted for voting. The five top clinical priorities were as follows: 1) what is the best strategy for screening and identification of patients with sepsis, and can predictive modeling assist in real-time recognition of sepsis? 2) what causes organ injury and dysfunction in sepsis, how should it be defined, and how can it be detected? 3) how should fluid resuscitation be individualized initially and beyond? 4) what is the best vasopressor approach for treating the different phases of septic shock? and 5) can a personalized/precision medicine approach identify optimal therapies to improve patient outcomes? The five top basic science priorities were as follows: 1) How can we improve animal models so that they more closely resemble sepsis in humans? 2) What outcome variables maximize correlations between human sepsis and animal models and are therefore most appropriate to use in both? 3) How does sepsis affect the brain, and how do sepsis-induced brain alterations contribute to organ dysfunction? How does sepsis affect interactions between neural, endocrine, and immune systems? 4) How does the microbiome affect sepsis pathobiology? 5) How do genetics and epigenetics influence the development of sepsis, the course of sepsis and the response to treatments for sepsis?

Conclusions

Knowledge advances in multiple clinical domains have been incorporated in progressive iterations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, allowing for evidence-based recommendations for short- and long-term management of sepsis. However, the strength of existing evidence is modest with significant knowledge gaps and mortality from sepsis remains high. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114sswqQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.

### Non-antibiotic strategies for sepsis [^113a4ft4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock remain a considerable therapeutic challenge. Despite significant advances in supportive care and the availability of potent, broad-spectrum antibiotics, the overall mortality due to sepsis is still approximately 35%, and this increases to 60% if patients develop septic shock. Antibiotics constitute a necessary part of the treatment of sepsis, and there is probably considerable scope to improve the way in which they are used. Nevertheless, antibiotics alone, even used optimally, are probably not sufficient to substantially reduce the mortality that accompanies the multiorgan failure that occurs in septic patients. For this reason, considerable efforts have been expended in developing non-antibiotic (or so-called adjunctive) forms of treatment, and here the general approaches to these types of treatment are reviewed. There are three main categories: improvements in supportive care, treatments aimed at bacterial virulence factors, and treatments aimed at host mediators. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review, but rather to provide examples in each category to illustrate the general principles-and the hurdles-that have characterized these approaches to therapy.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: research priorities for sepsis and septic shock [^117MBfak]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

A consensus committee of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups had teleconference and electronic-based discussion. The entire committee iteratively developed the entire document and recommendations.

Methods

Each committee member independently gave their top five priorities for sepsis research. A total of 88 suggestions (ESM 1 - supplemental table 1) were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, leading to the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup had teleconferences to go over each priority followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Of these, the top six clinical priorities were identified and include the following questions: (1) can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times?; (2) what are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?; (3) should rapid diagnostic tests be implemented in clinical practice?; (4) should empiric antibiotic combination therapy be used in sepsis or septic shock?; (5) what are the predictors of sepsis long-term morbidity and mortality?; and (6) what information identifies organ dysfunction?

Conclusions

While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines give multiple recommendations on the treatment of sepsis, significant knowledge gaps remain, both in bedside issues directly applicable to clinicians, as well as understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of sepsis. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

### Sepsis: personalization V protocolization? [^113eBJMS]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The founding tenet of evidence-based medicine is to combine best evidence with clinical expertise. As David Sackett opined 'Without clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannised by evidence'. Rigid protocols and mandates, based on an inconclusive and low-level evidence base, cannot suit the physiological, biochemical and biological heterogeneity displayed by the individual septic patient. Indeed, clear proof of outcome benefit through adoption of an inflexible management approach is lacking and will certainly be detrimental to some. Therapy thus needs to be tailored to meet the individual patient's needs. The same principle should be applied to clinical trials; the continued disappointments of multiple investigational strategies trialled over three decades, despite (often) a sound biological rationale, suggest a repeated methodological failure that does not account for the marked heterogeneity within the septic patient's biological phenotype and thus marked variation in their host response. The increasing availability of rapid point-of-care diagnostics and theranostics should facilitate better patient selection and titrated optimization of the therapeutic intervention.

### Evidence-based personalised medicine in critical care: a framework for quantifying and applying individualised treatment effects in patients who are critically ill [^116oeu3W]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinicians aim to provide treatments that will result in the best outcome for each patient. Ideally, treatment decisions are based on evidence from randomised clinical trials. Randomised trials conventionally report an aggregated difference in outcomes between patients in each group, known as an average treatment effect. However, the actual effect of treatment on outcomes (treatment response) can vary considerably between individuals, and can differ substantially from the average treatment effect. This variation in response to treatment between patients-heterogeneity of treatment effect-is particularly important in critical care because common critical care syndromes (eg, sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome) are clinically and biologically heterogeneous. Statistical approaches have been developed to analyse heterogeneity of treatment effect and predict individualised treatment effects for each patient. In this Review, we outline a framework for deriving and validating individualised treatment effects and identify challenges to applying individualised treatment effect estimates to inform treatment decisions in clinical care.

### Towards personalized medicine: a scoping review of immunotherapy in sepsis [^117TdqQ5]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Decades of extensive investigation into immunomodulatory treatments has led to over 700 studies investigating these treatment for sepsis, with often conflicting results. The lack of therapeutic efficacy appears to be related to the difficulty to enroll the right patients for the intervention. Since it is highly unlikely that one single immunomodulatory treatment will be universally effective in all sepsis patients, a personalized approach seems the way forward. To date, only a small proportion of studies have looked into enrichment strategies in sepsis, and for several interventions the therapeutic efficacy appears to emerge when a personalized approach was used. Patient stratification will play a pivotal role in the identification of patients that may benefit from targeted immunotherapy.

### The need for change in generating evidence for the critically ill [^11469E94]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Critical illness often represents a turning point in patients' journeys. Sepsis, one of the main drivers of critical illness, is the leading cause of death worldwide. The last edition of the sepsis management international guidelines has 93 statements, most recommendations having low or very low quality of evidence. Randomized controlled trials remain the gold standard for evidence generation, but the costs, time, and resources needed to test all the recommendations using traditional trials could take decades and cost billions of dollars.

### Key challenges in providing effective antibiotic therapy for critically ill patients with bacterial sepsis and septic shock [^115emsYC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Early initiation of effective antibiotic therapy is vitally important for saving the lives of critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock. The susceptibility of the infecting pathogen and the ability of the selected dosage regimen to safely achieve the required antibiotic exposure need to be carefully considered to achieve a high probability of a successful outcome. Critically ill patients commonly experience substantial pathophysiological changes that impact the functions of various organs, including the kidneys. Many antibiotics are predominantly renally eliminated and thus renal function is a major determinant of the regimen needed to achieve the required antibiotic exposure. However, currently, there is a paucity of guidelines to inform antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients, including those with sepsis or septic shock. This paper briefly reviews methods that are commonly used in critically ill patients to provide a measure of renal function, and approaches that describe the relationship between the exposure to an antibiotic and its antibacterial effects. Two common conditions that very substantially complicate the use of antibiotics in critically ill patients with sepsis, unstable renal function, and augmented renal clearance, are considered in detail and their potential therapeutic implications are explored. Suggestions are provided on how treatment of bacterial infections in critically ill patients with sepsis might be improved. Of high potential are model-informed approaches that aim to individualize initial treatment regimens based on patient and bacterial characteristics, with refinement of regimens during treatment in response to monitoring antibiotic concentrations, responsive measures of renal function, and other important clinical data.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111W8GHj]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of suspected sepsis requires thoughtful and individualized care. Initial empiric therapy should be immediate for those with a high likelihood of infection, severe illness and/or shock. Specific empiric antimicrobial therapy should be chosen with consideration of the likely site of infection, common pathogens for these sites, and with modification made by consideration of patient-specific risk factors for resistance and knowledge of local microbiology. While timely and appropriate therapy is necessary to reduce mortality, it must be accompanied by a commitment to de-escalate once we get culture and serial clinical and laboratory data, since indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum empiric therapy is a driving force for antimicrobial resistance. Key recommendations for management are summarized in Table 1.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — source control timing and approach in sepsis and septic shock specifies that source control should be achieved as soon as possible following initial resuscitation. Smaller studies suggest that source control within 6 to 12 hours is advantageous, and studies generally show reduced survival beyond that point. The failure to show benefit with source control implemented in less than 6 hours may be a consequence of the limited number of patients and the heterogeneity of the intervention. Any required source control intervention should ideally be implemented as soon as medically and logistically practical after the diagnosis is made, and prolonged efforts at medical stabilization in lieu of source control for severely ill patients, particularly those with septic shock, are generally not advised. In general, the least invasive option that will effectively achieve source control should be pursued; open surgical intervention should be considered when other interventional approaches are inadequate or cannot be provided in a timely fashion; surgical exploration may also be indicated when diagnostic uncertainty persists; and logistic factors unique to each institution may also play a role in the decision.

### Targeting the host response in sepsis: current approaches and future evidence [^113b9NXs]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis, a dysregulated host response to infection characterized by organ failure, is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Disbalances of the immune response play an important role in its pathophysiology. Patients may develop simultaneously or concomitantly states of systemic or local hyperinflammation and immunosuppression. Although a variety of effective immunomodulatory treatments are generally available, attempts to inhibit or stimulate the immune system in sepsis have failed so far to improve patients' outcome. The underlying reason is likely multifaceted including failure to identify responders to a specific immune intervention and the complex pathophysiology of organ dysfunction that is not exclusively caused by immunopathology but also includes dysfunction of the coagulation system, parenchymal organs, and the endothelium. Increasing evidence suggests that stratification of the heterogeneous population of septic patients with consideration of their host response might led to treatments that are more effective. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of current studies aimed at optimizing the many facets of host response and to discuss future perspectives for precision medicine approaches in sepsis.

### Future of sepsis therapies [^117VBBon]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In the past decades many clinical trials tested immune modulatory compounds designed to restore homeostasis in patients with sepsis. In spite of these efforts, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, not a single new drug was integrated into clinical practice. Thus, it is obvious that the clinical and scientific communities need to reconsider the therapeutic approach to sepsis. Novel strategies to treat sepsis face serious challenges in their path to the patient in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The first question one might ask when confronted with the many negative sepsis trials is whether our current understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis is correct. The traditional concept of sepsis as a syndrome caused by uncontrolled injurious inflammation has been replaced by the current model of a multifaceted host response, entailing not only abundant and sustained inflammation, but also lengthy immune suppression. It is now widely acknowledged that acute preclinical sepsis models do not adequately capture the prolonged course in patients with sepsis, in whom the majority develop organ dysfunction over the course of days with deaths occurring mostly more than 1 week after ICU admission. Preclinical research on novel therapeutic interventions should better integrate current knowledge of the course and consequences of sepsis, incorporating aged animals with comorbidity and supportive care, including resuscitation and antibiotic therapy, in different models relevant for sepsis.

### Sepsis: older and newer concepts [^114vkeXW]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a common complication in patients in intensive care units and a frequent reason for intensive care unit admission. Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and, without specific antisepsis therapies, management relies on infection control and organ support. For these interventions to be most effective, they must be started early, which highlights the need for all health-care workers to be aware of sepsis so that diagnosis can be made as early as possible. In this Viewpoint, we discuss some of the earlier terms used to characterise and define sepsis, and point out some of their limitations. We then introduce some aspects of new consensus definitions, proposed by an expert panel, which highlight in particular the importance of organ dysfunction. These definitions should help provide a more standardised approach to the identification of patients with suspected sepsis in both clinical practice and clinical research.

### Towards personalized medicine: a scoping review of immunotherapy in sepsis [^112F2Gbr]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite a global decrease in sepsis burden, sepsis still causes almost 20% of all deaths worldwide. Over the past few decades, significant progress has been made in the understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis, however, treatment is still limited to tackling the pathogens and providing supportive care. To date, limited proven therapies address the underlying mechanisms of this life-threatening condition.

The host response to infection can be dysregulated in multiple ways, resulting in a highly heterogeneous clinical presentation, treatment response, and prognosis. The pathophysiology of sepsis involves dysregulation of the inflammatory response, but also catabolic, metabolic and immune-suppressive features can be present, together resulting in failure to return to homeostasis. Modulating these various immune responses to infection represents a promising treatment option. Reason for the numerous failed clinical trials could be the use of "one-size-fits-all" approaches, suggesting that personalized immunomodulatory treatment tailored to an individual patient's immune profile may be a more successful treatment approach. The first step towards implementation of such a personalized strategy is providing a structured and in-depth overview of currently available evidence on immunotherapy in sepsis. The aim of this scoping review is to describe and summarize the literature evaluating immunotherapy in adult patients with sepsis, and to evaluate methods by which a personalized immunotherapy approach has been studied so far.

### A blueprint for a sepsis protocol [^117DoGuu]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Despite numerous advances in medicine, sepsis remains an unconquered challenge. Although outcomes have improved slightly over decades, the unacceptably high mortality rate of 30%-50% for severe sepsis and septic shock continues. However, after years of unsuccessful clinical trials, several investigations over the last few years have reported survival benefit in the treatment of sepsis. Physicians now have several proven therapies to treat sepsis, but have yet to implement them on a widespread, systematic basis. This led 11 international professional societies spanning multiple specialties and continents to come together to create the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. The product of their work is an international effort organized to improve care of patients with sepsis and includes consensus, evidence-based guidelines for care that improves survival in septic patients, and an action plan for change. Given the clear role of early identification and treatment in stopping the sepsis cascade, therapy must start early in the emergency department (ED) and continue throughout the hospital course. The first of the recommendations by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign is the aggressive resuscitation strategy of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). EGDT is reported to reduce absolute mortality by a staggering 16%. The use of recombinant activated protein C was demonstrated to confer a 6% absolute survival benefit. Steroid supplementation in adrenal insufficiency produced a 10% benefit. Additionally, early and appropriate use of antibiotics remains a cornerstone of therapy. Although no randomized trial will be performed, the effects are undisputed. Finally, although predominantly intensive care unit therapies, tight glucose control and low-tidal-volume ventilation strategies have also led to improved survival. Armed with these new therapies, the medical community must rise to this call to action. Clinicians must change the approach to this disease, as well as the way the septic patient is viewed. Although complex and challenging, these therapies must be brought to the patient's bedside. We propose and describe the Multiple Urgent Sepsis Therapies (MUST) protocol as a practical way to implement a comprehensive treatment plan using available evidence-based therapies.

### Sepsis and septic shock strategies [^115uKNGM]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Three therapeutic principles most substantially improve organ dysfunction and survival in sepsis: early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy; restoration of adequate cellular perfusion; timely source control. The new definitions of sepsis and septic shock reflect the inadequate sensitivity, specify, and lack of prognostication of systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment more effectively prognosticates in sepsis and critical illness. Inadequate cellular perfusion accelerates injury and reestablishing perfusion limits injury. Multiple organ systems are affected by sepsis and septic shock and an evidence-based multipronged approach to systems-based therapy in critical illness results in improve outcomes.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — empiric and targeted gram-negative coverage in adults with sepsis or septic shock: For high risk for multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms, "we suggest using two antimicrobials with gram-negative coverage for empiric treatment over one gram-negative agent" (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence); for low risk for MDR organisms, "we suggest against using two gram-negative agents for empiric treatment, compared with one gram-negative agent" (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence); once pathogen and susceptibilities are known, "we suggest against using double gram-negative coverage" (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Rationale notes that "the initial use of multidrug therapy is often required to ensure the empiric regimen includes at least one effective agent that is active against the offending organism", and that in the empiric phase choice depends on "the local prevalence of resistant organisms, patient risk factors for resistant organisms, and the severity of illness".

### De-escalation of antimicrobial treatment for adults with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock [^117TVvCi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Mortality rates among patients with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock ranges from 27% to 54%. Empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment is aimed at achieving adequate antimicrobial therapy and thus reducing mortality. However, there is a risk that empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment can expose patients to overuse of antimicrobials. De-escalation has been proposed as a strategy to replace empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment with a narrower antimicrobial therapy. This is done by either changing the pharmacological agent or discontinuing a pharmacological combination according to the patient's microbial culture results.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of de-escalation antimicrobial treatment for adult patients diagnosed with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock caused by any micro-organism.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 8); MEDLINE via PubMed (from inception to August 2010); EMBASE (from inception to August 2010); LILACS (from inception to August 2010); Current Controlled Trials and bibliographic references of relevant studies. We also contacted the main authors in the area. We applied no language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomized controlled trials comparing de-escalation (based on culture results) versus standard therapy for adults with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. The primary outcome was mortality (at 28 days, hospital discharge or the end of the follow-up period). Studies including patients initially treated with an empirical but not adequate antimicrobial therapy were not considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors planned to independently select and extract data and evaluate methodological quality of all studies. We planned to use relative risk (risk ratio) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals. We planned to use the random-effects statistical model when the estimate effects of two or more studies could be combined in a meta-analysis.

Main Results

We retrieved 436 references via the search strategy. No randomized controlled trials testing de-escalation antimicrobial treatment for adult patients diagnosed with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock could be included in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no adequate, direct evidence as to whether de-escalation of antimicrobial agents is effective and safe for adults with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. Therefore, it is not possible to either recommend or not recommend the de-escalation of antimicrobial agents in clinical practice for septic patients. This uncertainty warrants further research via randomized controlled trials or cohort studies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of severe sepsis [^113WL7Uc]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The burden of infection in industrialized countries has prompted considerable effort to improve the outcomes of patients with sepsis. This has been formalized through the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 'bundles', derived from the recommendations of 11 professional societies, which have promoted global improvement in those practices whose primary goal it is to reduce sepsis-related death. However, difficulties remain in implementing all of the procedures recommended by the experts, despite the apparent pragmatism of those procedures. We summarize the main proposals made by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and focus on the difficulties associated with making a proper diagnosis and supplying adequate treatment promptly to septic patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock: 2016 [^112JPJMT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012".

Design

A consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict-of-interest (COI) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. A stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in December 2015. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The panel consisted of five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventilation. Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles were generated. Each subgroup generated a list of questions, searched for best available evidence, and then followed the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence from high to very low, and to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or best practice statement when applicable.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Guideline panel provided 93 statements on early management and resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Overall, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 18 were best-practice statements. No recommendation was provided for four questions.

Conclusions

Substantial agreement exists among a large cohort of international experts regarding many strong recommendations for the best care of patients with sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for these critically ill patients with high mortality.

### Management of sepsis in hospitalized patients [^112onkXQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is the leading cause of death worldwide. Mortality has improved in the past few decades but remains high, and survivors frequently have long-term complications. Initial diagnostic evaluation focuses on risk stratification and source and pathogen identification. Treatment includes intravenous fluids, vasopressors, steroids if shock is present, antimicrobial therapy targeting the most likely source of infection, and source control. Patients with shock or high-risk organ failure syndromes should be admitted early to an intensive care unit. After initial antimicrobials and resuscitation, care should focus on antimicrobial deescalation, volume management, and high-quality supportive care. Shared decision making about goals of care and transitions is important to support survivors after discharge.

### Sepsis subphenotypes, theragnostics and personalized sepsis care [^114VeMx1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneity between critically ill patients with sepsis is a major barrier to the discovery of effective therapies. The use of machine learning techniques, coupled with improved understanding of sepsis biology, has led to the identification of patient subphenotypes. This exciting development may help overcome the problem of patient heterogeneity and lead to the identification of patient subgroups with treatable traits. Re-analyses of completed clinical trials have demonstrated that patients with different subphenotypes may respond differently to treatments. This suggests that future clinical trials that take a precision medicine approach will have a higher likelihood of identifying effective therapeutics for patients based on their subphenotype. In this review, we describe the emerging subphenotypes identified in the critically ill and outline the promising immune modulation therapies which could have a beneficial treatment effect within some of these subphenotypes. Furthermore, we will also highlight how bringing subphenotype identification to the bedside could enable a new generation of precision-medicine clinical trials.

### A new paradigm for the treatment of sepsis: is it time to consider combination therapy? [^115aYzBB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Despite the advances in supportive care and the availability of potent antimicrobial agents, mortality from sepsis, a leading cause of death in intensive care units, has not improved. Over the last decade, clinical trials with numerous adjunctive therapies, including antiendotoxin antibodies and inhibitors of the inflammatory response, have yielded disappointing results. Recently, treatment with recombinant human activated protein C reduced mortality 6% compared with controls. Given the likelihood that many processes in the complex pathophysiology of sepsis are simultaneously activated, it is unlikely that therapy directed at any one of them, as has been done in the past, will dramatically improve survival. Rather, a combination of therapies directed at many arms of the septic process, much like the strategy used for cancer and HIV infection, is required. Given the likelihood that sepsis represents an excessive innate immune response to microbial products, vigorous attempts must be made to develop rapid assays that reflect the level of innate immune activation. Such assays could be used to identify patients who would benefit from therapy and to monitor their response so that overtreatment does not completely abrogate host defense mechanisms and render these patients susceptible to fatal infection. It is now time to test a new therapeutic paradigm based on an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of the septic process and the recognition that we may have reached the limits of adjunctive monotherapy.

### Pitfalls in the treatment of sepsis [^111uunSK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a challenging, dynamic, pathophysiology requiring expertise in diagnosis and management. Controversy exists as to the most sensitive early indicators of sepsis and sepsis severity. Patients presenting to the emergency department often lack complete history or clinical data that would point to optimal management. Awareness of these potential knowledge gaps is important for the emergency provider managing the septic patient. Specific areas of management including the initiation and management of mechanical ventilation, the appropriate disposition of the patient, and consideration of transfer to higher levels of care are reviewed.

### Sepsis: pathophysiology and clinical management [^114vEDrH]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock represent increasingly severe systemic inflammatory responses to infection. Sepsis is common in the aging population, and it disproportionately affects patients with cancer and underlying immunosuppression. In its most severe form, sepsis causes multiple organ dysfunction that can produce a state of chronic critical illness characterized by severe immune dysfunction and catabolism. Much has been learnt about the pathogenesis of sepsis at the molecular, cell, and intact organ level. Despite uncertainties in hemodynamic management and several treatments that have failed in clinical trials, investigational therapies increasingly target sepsis induced organ and immune dysfunction. Outcomes in sepsis have greatly improved overall, probably because of an enhanced focus on early diagnosis and fluid resuscitation, the rapid delivery of effective antibiotics, and other improvements in supportive care for critically ill patients. These improvements include lung protective ventilation, more judicious use of blood products, and strategies to reduce nosocomial infections.

### Antimicrobial treatment duration in sepsis and serious infections [^115kkPFN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis mortality has improved following advancements in early recognition and standardized management, including emphasis on early administration of appropriate antimicrobials. However, guidance regarding antimicrobial duration in sepsis is surprisingly limited. Decreased antibiotic exposure is associated with lower rates of de novo resistance development, Clostridioides difficile-associated disease, antibiotic-related toxicities, and health care costs. Consequently, data weighing safety versus adequacy of shorter treatment durations in sepsis would be beneficial. We provide a narrative review of evidence to guide antibiotic duration in sepsis. Evidence is significantly limited by noninferiority trial designs and exclusion of critically ill patients in many trials. Potential challenges to shorter antimicrobial duration in sepsis include inadequate source control, treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms, and pharmacokinetic alterations that predispose to inadequate antimicrobial levels. Additional studies specifically targeting patients with clinical indicators of sepsis are needed to guide measures to safely reduce antimicrobial exposure in this high-risk population while preserving clinical effectiveness.

### Sepsis subphenotypes, theragnostics and personalized sepsis care [^113VeMWH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a heterogenous condition characterised by a dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life threatening organ dysfunction. Globally, sepsis accounts for eleven million deaths each year and continues to be one of the leading causes of death. Treatment has remained fundamentally unchanged over decades and comprises early antibiotics, source control and supportive care with interventions such as intravenous fluids and vasopressors. No biological therapies that modulate the host response have reached sustained clinical practice with many negative or neutral clinical trials. The reason for this is at least in part due to the clinical, microbiological, and immunological heterogeneity of sepsis, where patients with similar disease entities can have very different presentations or responses to treatment. Increasing recognition of the immunological concepts underpinning heterogeneity, including resistance, disease tolerance and repair, may enable the identification of further mechanisms which could be targeted by therapeutics. Furthermore, there is also emerging evidence that this heterogeneity extends to individual patients' response to interventions: that while some patients may derive benefit from an intervention, others may not and may even experience harm. In order to better target treatments and deliver effective therapies, it is necessary to identify which patients will benefit from specific therapies. This personalised medicine approach has been identified as a research priority by clinicians, patients and their families.

Generally, approaches that classify patients into subgroups based on clinical severity or single biomarkers have failed to identify which patients could be predicted to best respond to treatment, even where the subgroups have face validity. For example, activated protein C showed no therapeutic benefit even in subgroups with the most depleted protein C levels. In recent years, the application of machine learning methods to either clinical or biological data, has made it possible to identify subphenotypes or endotypes (Table 1) with greater biological and clinical relevance. These methods identify distinct groups within data that are not apparent clinically, with the aim of predicting outcome (prognostic enrichment) and/or treatment responsiveness (predictive enrichment) (Fig. 1). This approach has been highly effective in disease areas such as oncology and asthma, allowing the development of therapies that follow a precision medicine approach. In this review, we will provide an up-to-date summary of relevant subphenotypes in sepsis, before reviewing their theragnostic implications and the future potential for this approach.

### Future of sepsis therapies [^115V9h3Y]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Another point of attention comes from the question how to measure the success of a novel therapeutic. Since the case fatality rate of sepsis has decreased, the long-term morbidity of sepsis has received increasing attention. End points beyond the traditional 28-day mortality can capture late physical and cognitive sequelae, and could alter the focus for drug development, moving away from attempts to modify the early course of the host response and instead seeking to support faster and more complete recovery.

Evidence is emerging that non-infectious critical illness can be associated with similar disturbances in host-response pathways as observed in sepsis, especially after a prolonged stay on the ICU. Some critically ill patients without infection might benefit from similar immune modulatory therapies as patients with sepsis, yet they have been systemically excluded from sepsis trials. From a theoretical perspective, it is worthy to evaluate drugs targeting a specific host-response pathway in critically ill patients in whom that pathway is disturbed irrespective of the presence of infection as a triggering event.

It is time to implement new knowledge and technology in the clinical evaluation of new sepsis treatments. The challenge for the coming years will be to translate the rapidly increasing understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of sepsis into new drugs to be tested in only those patients with sepsis (or non-infectious critical illness) in whom the targeted pathway is derailed, making use of rapid tests that can also monitor the drug effect in time. The technology to manufacture bedside molecular tests with very limited hands-on time is there, we now need the intellectual contents with which these tests can be filled. This approach, possibly combined with alternative trial designs and/or end points, may deliver the positive sepsis trials and the clinical implementation of new sepsis strategies for which researchers and clinicians have waited for a long time.

### Sepsis: an update in management [^116m6dEG]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hospitalists are a critical link in providing evidence-based care for patients with sepsis across the disease spectrum, from early recognition to recovery. The past decade of sepsis research has led to significant findings that will change clinical practice for hospital medicine practitioners. Although the incidence of severe sepsis in the United States has continued to rise, in-hospital mortality has declined. Management of the spectrum of sepsis disorders is no longer restricted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This review article will provide an update in the management of sepsis for hospitalists based on recently published pivotal studies. The expanding evidence base in sepsis includes early goal-directed therapy/clinical endpoints/sepsis bundles, antibiotics and source control, volume resuscitation, ICU considerations (including the use of insulin and corticosteroids), mortality/complications, and the newly recognized condition of "sepsis survivorship".

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^114rakAt]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built upon a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along 5 levels to create recommendation grades from A-E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Participants

Participants included 44 critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations.

Results

A total of 46 recommendations plus pediatric management considerations.

Conclusions

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that will hopefully translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually, and even more rapidly when some important new knowledge becomes available.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^111Rnrdp]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Despite timely intervention, there exists a small subgroup of patients with septic shock who develop progressive multi-organ failure. Seemingly refractory to conventional therapy, they exhibit a very high mortality. Such patients are often poorly represented in large clinical trials. Consequently, good evidence for effective treatment strategies is lacking. In this article, we describe a pragmatic, multi-faceted approach to managing patients with refractory septic shock based on our experience of toxin-mediated sepsis in a specialist referral centre. Many components of this strategy are inexpensive and widely accessible, and so may offer an opportunity to improve outcomes in these critically ill patients.

### Revising sepsis definitions to better target and tailor sepsis care [^112HH8jE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

How we define sepsis has significant implications for clinical care, quality improvement, and regulatory policies. Current sepsis criteria identify heterogenous patients that vary widely in their clinical syndromes, triggering pathogens, and prognoses; one-third have viral or non-infectious processes and crude mortality rates vary 30-fold. Nonetheless, clinicians have been trained to treat all patients with possible sepsis immediately, aggressively, and uniformly with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Evidence continues to mount, however, that immediate antibiotics are critical for patients with septic shock or multiorgan dysfunction but short delays can safely be tolerated by patients with single organ dysfunction without shock. This allows time to clarify whether these patients are infected or not. We suggest modifying sepsis operational definitions to flag just those patients in whom short antibiotic delays are associated with worse outcomes. This will help focus sepsis care where it is needed, aid antibiotic stewardship, and increase the validity of sepsis quality measures.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^1174NCq1]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — triggers and outcomes of structured interventions for goals-of-care discussions indicate mixed effects on utilization without mortality benefit, and no specific trigger is recommended. In randomized ICU studies where conflict over values-based treatment triggered ethics consultation, reductions in ICU and ventilator days were observed in some subgroups, but ethics consultation did not affect overall mortality in any study. Trials using duration-based triggers randomized patients after 7 days of mechanical ventilation to palliative care meetings and information versus ICU-team–led meetings, which failed to decrease anxiety and depression, increased post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and showed no benefit on family satisfaction, ICU days, or hospital days; another trial randomized patients after 5 days or more in a medical-surgical ICU to proactive ethics consultation versus usual care and did not reduce ICU stay, hospital stay, or life-sustaining treatments in patients who did not survive to discharge, and neither study showed a mortality effect. An automated early warning system alert study in medical units, with 27% with infection, did not impact hospital mortality or hospital length of stay but did reduce ICU transfers and ICU length of stay and increased documentation of advance directives and resuscitation status compared with usual care. Given heterogeneous triggers and absence of a superior approach, no recommendation can be made for specific criteria to initiate a goals of care discussion, and timing/triggers should take into consideration patient condition, premorbid health and quality of life, prognosis, response to treatment, interventions under consideration, anticipated quality of life following treatment, resource availability, and readiness and ability of the patient or family to engage.

Goals of care in adults with sepsis or septic shock — discussion timing and criteria: We recommend discussing goals of care and prognosis with patients and families over no such discussion (Best practice statement.). We suggest addressing goals of care early (within 72 hours) over late (72 hours or later) (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.). There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for any specific standardized criterion to trigger goals of care discussion.

### Systemic steroids in severe sepsis and septic shock [^114d5wuV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Despite more than 5 decades of study and debate, the role of corticosteroid treatment in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock remains controversial. Data support a beneficial effect on systemic blood pressure in patients with septic shock. However, the ability of corticosteroid therapy to improve mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock remains controversial, with contradictory results from recent large multicenter clinical trials. Although it appears clear that high-dose corticosteroid treatment provides no benefit and possibly harm in septic patients, the experimental design flaws and biases of recent low-dose (physiologic) steroid treatment trials limit their ability to provide adequate answers to the important questions of which septic patients should be treated, how much steroid to give, and the optimum duration of treatment. Unfortunately, the answer to these important questions is not readily evident based on the current evidence or the application of metaanalysis to the available clinical data. This concise evidence-based review highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the current data to inform the practicing clinician as to which patients are likely to derive significant benefit from corticosteroid treatment, while we await more definitive guidance from future multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trials designed to better answer these important therapeutic questions.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — antimicrobial de-escalation states that for adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest daily assessment for de-escalation of antimicrobials over using fixed durations of therapy without daily re-assessment for de-escalation, which is a weak recommendation with very low quality of evidence. The rationale notes that antimicrobial exposure is linked to the development of antimicrobial resistance and efforts to reduce both the number of antibiotics administered and their spectrum.

### Sepsis and septic shock [^111T4vxG]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Sepsis is a common condition that is associated with unacceptably high mortality and, for many of those who survive, long-term morbidity. Increased awareness of the condition resulting from ongoing campaigns and the evidence arising from research in the past 10 years have increased understanding of this problem among clinicians and lay people, and have led to improved outcomes. The World Health Assembly and WHO made sepsis a global health priority in 2017 and have adopted a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis. In 2016, a new definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3) was developed. Sepsis is now defined as infection with organ dysfunction. This definition codifies organ dysfunction using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Ongoing research aims to improve definition of patient populations to allow for individualised management strategies matched to a patient's molecular and biochemical profile. The search continues for improved diagnostic techniques that can facilitate this aim, and for a pharmacological agent that can improve outcomes by modifying the disease process. While waiting for this goal to be achieved, improved basic care driven by education and quality-improvement programmes offers the best hope of increasing favourable outcomes.

### Toward precision in critical care research: methods for observational and interventional studies [^113GmKSc]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Critical care trials evaluate the effect of interventions in patients with diverse personal histories and causes of illness, often under the umbrella of heterogeneous clinical syndromes, such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Given this variation, it is reasonable to expect that the effect of treatment on outcomes may differ for individuals with variable characteristics. However, in randomized controlled trials, efficacy is typically assessed by the average treatment effect (ATE), which quantifies the average effect of the intervention on the outcome in the study population. Importantly, the ATE may hide variations of the treatment's effect on a clinical outcome across levels of patient characteristics, which may erroneously lead to the conclusion that an intervention does not work overall when it may in fact benefit certain patients. In this review, we describe methodological approaches for assessing heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), including expert-derived subgrouping, data-driven subgrouping, baseline risk modeling, treatment effect modeling, and individual treatment rule estimation. Next, we outline how insights from HTE analyses can be incorporated into the design of clinical trials. Finally, we propose a research agenda for advancing the field and bringing HTE approaches to the bedside.

Long-term outcomes — palliative care: For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend that the principles of palliative care (which may include palliative care consultation based on clinician judgement) be integrated into the treatment plan, when appropriate, to address patient and family symptoms and suffering (Best practice statement). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against routine formal palliative care consultation for all patients over palliative care consultation based on clinician judgement (Weak, low quality of evidence).

### What is the preferred resuscitation fluid for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock? [^1142X2co]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock recommend crystalloids as the initial fluid solution of choice in the resuscitation of these patients. In recent years, there have been numerous studies published on the type of fluid used in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis. The primary goal of this article is to determine the preferred intravenous fluid for the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature review was completed to identify studies that investigated the type of resuscitation fluid in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Articles included were those published in English between 2011 and 2016, enrolled human subjects, and limited to the following types: randomized controlled trial, prospective observational trial, retrospective cohort trial, and meta-analyses. All selected articles then underwent a structured review by the authors.

Results

Nine thousand sixty-two articles were identified in the search. After use of predetermined criteria, 17 articles were selected for review. Eleven of these were original investigations and six were meta-analyses and systemic reviews.

Conclusion

Crystalloids are the preferred solution for the resuscitation of emergency department patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Balanced crystalloids may improve patient-centered outcomes and should be considered as an alternative to normal saline, if available. There is strong evidence that suggests semi-synthetic colloids decrease survival and should be avoided. The role of albumin in the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and sepsis is uncertain.

### Considerations for empiric antimicrobial therapy in sepsis and septic shock in an era of antimicrobial resistance [^114h6N1R]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with sepsis present across a spectrum of infection sites and severity of illnesses requiring complex decision making at the bedside as to when prompt antibiotics are indicated and which regimen is warranted. Many hemodynamically stable patients with sepsis and low acuity of illness may benefit from further work up before initiating therapy, whereas patients with septic shock warrant emergent broad-spectrum antibiotics. The precise empiric regimen is determined by assessing patient and epidemiological risk factors, likely source of infection based on presenting signs and symptoms, and severity of illness. Hospitals should implement quality improvement measures to aid in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of septic patients and to ensure antibiotics are given to patients in an expedited fashion after antibiotic order.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^114bwYBf]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines provide a suitable framework to guide therapy for the majority of patients with septic shock. Appropriate and timely antimicrobial therapy, source control if indicated, fluid therapy, and targeted vasopressors remain the backbone of treatment. However, a small proportion of patients fail to respond to these measures and deteriorate precipitously into refractory shock and progressive multi-organ failure. This subgroup of patients is often poorly represented in large randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of interventions in septic shock. As a result, there is little conclusive evidence to guide management in this particular population.

Refractory septic shock is variably defined as the presence of hypotension, with end-organ dysfunction, requiring high-dose vasopressor support often greater than 0.5 μg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent. Regardless of the precise definition, there is an associated mortality of up to 60%. Furthermore, patients with vasopressor requirements greater than 1 μg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent who continue to deteriorate clinically have a reported mortality as high as 80–90%. Microcirculatory failure and associated ischaemic consequences are frequently observed and alternative therapeutic strategies are desperately needed to improve outcomes in this small subgroup of critically ill patients.

In this viewpoint article we describe a pragmatic, multi-faceted approach to managing patients with refractory septic shock. The list of interventions described below is drawn from our clinical experience managing patients with confirmed, or suspected, toxin-producing bacteria in a specialist Severe Respiratory Failure centre in the UK. It is recognised that some of these interventions lack a robust evidence base. Our intention is not to rehearse the current evidence for each component of therapy, but merely to describe our institutional approach with brief reference to selected relevant literature.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — antimicrobial timing: In all patients with potential septic shock, the panel issued a strong recommendation to administer antimicrobials immediately, and within one hour; for patients with confirmed/very likely sepsis, antimicrobials be administered immediately. For patients with possible sepsis without shock, a rapid assessment of infectious and noninfectious etiologies should be undertaken to determine, within 3 hours, whether antibiotics should be administered or deferred while monitoring closely. Administer antimicrobials immediately, ideally within 1 hour of recognition; perform rapid assessment of infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness; and administer antimicrobials within 3 hours if concern for infection persists.

### Procalcitonin-guided therapy in intensive care unit patients with severe sepsis and septic shock – a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uDzwy]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

An approach along a biomarker-guided treatment algorithm using procalcitonin levels may be helpful to guide antimicrobial treatment in severe sepsis patients, treated in ICUs and reduces the duration of antimicrobial therapy without an obvious increase in mortality. However, more research is urgently needed to investigate the safety and effectiveness in subgroups of surgical and medical severe sepsis patients, treated in ICUs. Most importantly, treatment algorithms differ substantially and have to be clarified in future studies.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^113GKuUS]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^1143BM5N]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The exact number of patients suffering from sepsis is difficult to capture, but it is estimated to affect at least 1–1.5 million persons each year in the United States.and 19 million patients worldwide. Sepsis remains a highly lethal entity resulting in more than 200 000 USA deaths per yearand an in-hospital mortality upward of 30% despite advances in critical care. During the last several decades, the mortality rates have decreased, but the incidence is rising. The condition affects all ages, however, among those with sepsis, 49% are between the ages of 65–84 years old. It also commonly affects those with compromised immune systems, chronic disease, infants and those suffering traumatic injury. The direct healthcare costs in the United States exceed $24 billion dollars per yearand rises on average more than 11% per year in cost. Sepsis remains in the top 10 leading causes of death despite plentiful investigative attention toward new therapies and adjuncts to mitigate poor outcome.

The newest developments in our understanding of sepsis reflect revisions to the definitions of the terms sepsis, septic shock and severe sepsis. Since 1991 there have been three consensus conferences convened (in 1991, 2001 and 2014) to adjudicate the definition of sepsis. In 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force published the 'The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)". This task force was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine to address prior criticisms of the multiple definitions used clinically for sepsis-related illnesses. These new definitions were followed shortly by the 'Assessment of Clinical Criteria for Sepsis For the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)'. The aim of this publication was to evaluate and recommend clinical criteria that could help identify patients at risk of developing sepsis.

### Towards personalized medicine: a scoping review of immunotherapy in sepsis [^111Y1puf]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of immunomodulatory treatments investigated in adult patients with sepsis, highlighting studies with a personalized treatment approach. Our results show that trials often showed conflicting results. Possibly due to the lack of patient stratification, requiring the need to confirm positive findings in large multicenter populations or the potential influence of severity and timing on immunomodulatory therapy results. Several immunomodulatory treatments described in this review suggest possible efficacy, laying the groundwork for future trials to demonstrate their effectiveness. If a personalized approach is applied, clinical benefits of treatment appear to emerge in several studies. This emphasizes the need to decipher different host response endo-/phenotypes for the intervention to modulate.

Over 700 studies investigating immunotherapy in patients with sepsis have been performed and despite this body of evidence, the 2021 surviving sepsis campaign guidelines only include intravenous hydrocortisone as an immunomodulatory treatment for patients with vasopressor refractory septic shock. Perhaps patient stratification might be the way forward, in which we have witnessed notable advancements in recent years, including therapies targeted by biomarker measurements. For instance, the ratio of IFN-γ to IL-10 has been used to guide corticosteroid therapy decisions, while HLA-DR levels on monocytes and plasma IL-10 concentrations have been used for stratification of treatment with either GM-CSF or IFN-γ. In ongoing and upcoming sepsis trials, an increase in patient stratification has been observed. The personalized approach most applied is a cut-off value for inflammatory markers such as IL-6 or procalcitonin. Two studies use more complex stratification methods. One is the ImmunoSep trial (NCT04990232) which uses biomarker stratification to identify patients with either hyperinflammation or immunoparalysis. Another example is the RECORDS trial, which aims at defining endotypes in sepsis adults associated with responsiveness to corticosteroids. This multicenter, placebo-controlled, biomarker-guided, adaptive Bayesian design basket trial will randomly assign 1800 adults to a biomarker stratum to identify resistant or sensitive sepsis to corticosteroid treatment. In our opinion, using biomarker-based protocols for patient stratification will be the way forward in sepsis research.

### Sepsis bundles: just do it [^114QsdDa]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

The initial management of patients with septic shock appears to be critical in terms of determining outcome; a standardized systematic approach for the management of patients with severe infections appears to consistently improve the delivery of recommended therapies and, as a result, may improve patient outcomes. With minimal-to-no risk or acquisition costs, severe sepsis bundle implementation should become the standard of care for the management of septic shock. A multifaceted approach may aid in the success of implementation of sepsis bundles in teaching and nonteaching institutions. Bundle implementation should change clinical practice by including surveillance, feedback reporting, and staff education to organize the target interventions into packages that must be implemented in strict compliance, for every patient, to ensure uniformity and provide practical applicability. Quality improvement via utilization of protocols can be achieved, regardless of institution size or academic status, and should continue to be promoted in the intensive care unit setting.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^111Dk1ff]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis antimicrobials — timing and spectrum: We support early antibiotics once sepsis is diagnosed or deemed likely, with the strongest support for initial intravenous antibiotics in those with suspected diagnosis of septic shock — that is, patients with infection and any hypotension or hypoperfusion; shorter time to antibiotics is preferred, but the precise time frame to optimally support outcomes remains to be defined, and antivirals are less clearly time sensitive in the earliest phases of disease. For sepsis patients without an identified pathogen, we recommend initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria according to local susceptibility patterns. Most sepsis patients receive initial doses of antimicrobials in the ED prior to the availability of culture results, and clinicians should base the initial selection of antimicrobials on the most likely and most harmful potential pathogens rather than targeting a specific pathogen, unless the clinical presentation directs such a focused approach; narrow-spectrum therapy is uncommon and should not be anticipated in usual practice. Whereas some data suggest that an earlier administration of antibiotics is associated with better survival, other data suggest that small variations in the timing of a first dose of antibiotics are not associated with mortality differences; we agree that once the diagnosis of sepsis is established, rapid and comprehensive therapy — not just antibiotic administration — is optimal, but the current data do not recommend a singular time.

### The sepsis chain of survival: a comprehensive framework for improving sepsis outcomes [^112VJ626]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The Sepsis Chain of Survival concept represents a comprehensive and systematic approach to improve outcomes for patients with suspected sepsis, recognizing that timely and coordinated interventions are crucial to manage this life-threatening condition. By extending and contextualizing the well-established principles of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Chain of Survival model to sepsis management, patient survival and recovery can be enhanced across diverse and global settings, and it can be adapted based on resource availability. Sepsis Chain of Survival does not aim to replace advanced sepsis care but to complement it by establishing a foundation of care that is accessible, actionable, and adaptable.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^114zHw6V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO₂/FIO₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Addressing heterogeneous treatment effects in acute care syndromes: principles and practical considerations [^1166LpwC]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Critical care medicine has historically relied on syndromic diagnoses such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury to guide research and treatment. While this approach has advanced clinical practice, the growing recognition of patient heterogeneity presents significant challenges for treatment optimisation and trial interpretation. Understanding heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) has emerged as a crucial methodological frontier, particularly for complex critical care syndromes where patient responses to interventions vary substantially.

Findings

There are three major methodological frameworks for analysing HTE: (1) Risk-based analyses, guided by the Predictive Approaches to Treatment effect Heterogeneity statement, provide an accessible framework for examining treatment effect variation across baseline risk strata but may overlook important effect modifiers. (2) Clustering techniques have successfully identified distinct phenotypes in both ARDS and sepsis, though external validation remains challenging. (3) Effect-based methods employing new methods offer sophisticated capabilities for identifying treatment effect modifiers but require careful consideration to model specification.

Conclusion

This review examines these methodological approaches through both theoretical framework and practical application. Considerations on the applicability of HTE are also provided. We conclude that while HTE methods offer promising tools for personalising critical care interventions, their successful implementation requires careful consideration of both methodological rigour and practical feasibility.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116JnXM9]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should we individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation and, if so, how? Applying a standard fluid dose to all patients with sepsis is inconsistent with other areas of sepsis management, where efforts are made to personalize care where possible. What alternative strategies can be readily used in clinical practice to individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation to maximize benefit and reduce harms?
2) Which variables should be used to titrate fluid resuscitation? Rigorous trials comparing various dynamic and static variables to evaluate fluid responsiveness are needed. Furthermore, testing various dynamic variables in subgroups of patients with sepsis would be informative. Trials should be designed to incorporate multiple methods of assessing fluid responsiveness.
3) What is the optimal timing for fluid resuscitation? After rapid identification of sepsis and septic shock, time-series studies of fluid resuscitation are needed, especially evaluating the benefits and harms of additional therapies (e.g. vasopressors) and their respective interplay.
4) Which variables should be used to trigger fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation? Related to the timing of fluid resuscitation, should a particular set of physiologic variables be assessed in a serial fashion to determine when to shift from resuscitation to deresuscitation in a structured manner?
5) Is a combined approach using several indices of fluid responsiveness better than using a single measurement in isolation? Furthermore, how should various measures be prioritized to inform clinical judgment?
6) What is the efficacy of using CRT to guide resuscitation in patients with normal lactate levels? Would the use of a rapidly assessable physiologic test be of value in patients without a derangement in lactate levels?
7) What is the duration of effect of fluid resuscitation? Recognizing that the duration of benefit of fluid resuscitation will vary between patients, having some population estimates in mind via pharmacokinetic studies would be useful to clinicians in evaluating therapeutic options and subsequent care.
8) Do early vasopressors limit the amount of fluids required to reach the same hemodynamic target? If so, what is the appropriate ratio of fluids and vasopressors? Identifying if there is a benefit to applying a polytherapeutic approach to early resuscitation is particularly interesting given the concerns regarding excessive fluid administration. A polytherapeutic approach of early fluid administration and vasopressors using a standardized assessment approach considerate of patient variables may be more precise and individualized, thereby maximizing benefit and limiting adverse effects.
9) Should the initial resuscitation of fluids be restricted to hypotensive patients or patients with lactate greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L? In an effort to limit the effects of excessive fluid administration while maximizing benefit in those patients with malperfusion, comparing strategies of fluid resuscitation in distinctive groups of septic shock would be useful.
10) Should the initial fluid resuscitation be administered as a fixed dose of 30 mL/kg or should it be administered in smaller aliquots, with further administration contingent on reassessing the patient condition prior to administering the next bolus? Although the 30 mL/kg bolus carries the risk of under- and overdosing, it has the advantage of being relatively simple to apply, especially in resource-limited settings where advanced measurements cannot be obtained. Administration of smaller doses, repeated as needed according to hemodynamic assessment, has the advantage of fine-tuning fluid administration according to an individual patient's needs. The risk associated with this approach is the potential for adding additional complexity, while still resulting with relatively similar amount of fluids administered and diverting the healthcare team from completing other essential tasks in the initial management of the patient with sepsis.
11) Should sicker patients receive a greater amount of initial resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, should those patients with more severe physiologic derangements receive greater initial amounts of fluid resuscitation to restore perfusion at the cellular level? Understanding that there may be dose gradient to the initial volume of fluid resuscitation based on the severity of shock would be informative and guide further, targeted research in the field.
12) Should resuscitation differ in patient populations less able to tolerate large volumes? In an effort to individualize sepsis care for subgroups at greater risk of harm from vigorous resuscitation, trials evaluating subgroups of patients with particular comorbidities (heart failure, dysrhythmias, end-stage renal disease) are necessary. The ideal trial in this domain should test two fluid resuscitation strategies using tiered severity in the triggering variables, whereas the fluid boluses should be of similar amount and given only after the evaluation of fluid responsiveness. Ideally, the study should be stratified for subgroups such as heart failure and kidney disease.
13) What is the optimal strategy for fluid resuscitation in resource-limited settings? Data on resuscitation vary significantly between well-resourced and resource-limited settings, as in sub-Saharan Africa, the administration of fluids was associated with an increased risk of death. Understanding the physiology of fluid resuscitation in the absence of other elements of critical care provided in ICUs with higher resources is a key question for a large portion of the world's population. Developing simplified strategies for patient assessment and fluid administration would greatly improve the quality of care delivered.

### Management of adult sepsis in resource-limited settings: global expert consensus statements using a Delphi method [^114stj1t]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial clinical guidance for managing sepsis in resource-limited settings should recognize that

When there is a high likelihood of sepsis or septic shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately, ideally within one hour.
For adults with possible sepsis without shock, where investigations (such as laboratory or imaging) to exclude a non–infectious cause of acute illness are not readily available and if concern for infection persists, antimicrobials should be administered without delay.
Administration of antiparasitic agents should not be delayed in patients with suspicion of sepsis of parasitic origin.
In patients with sepsis and where the source has been adequately controlled, clinical improvement with an improving trend in white blood cell count can be used to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Providing appropriate and timely antimicrobial therapy in sepsis is central to improving outcomes. However, in resource-limited settings, achieving this goal must be balanced against providing other aspects of care, especially to the sickest patients. Providing timely antimicrobial therapy should also be balanced with concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance where infections are commonly caused by resistant organisms and empiric therapy is likely to include broad-spectrum antibiotics. While the World Health Assembly recognises the need to promote 'judicious use of antimicrobials' in sepsis management, how best to do this in patients with sepsis is unclear and likely will need significant improvements in both diagnostics and antimicrobial stewardship programmes. The WHO's global research agenda for antimicrobial resistance includes research priorities of context-specific optimization of antimicrobial stewardship and empiric antimicrobial regimens and new rapid point-of-care diagnostics which would be of great value in addressing this complex issue.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^113SNDxk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.

Methods

We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy.

Conclusion

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^111HJpFZ]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The management of refractory septic shock remains extremely challenging. We believe that where established conventional interventions fail to deliver improvements, a different approach using pragmatic strategies is necessary. Many of the interventions described here have proven biological plausibility but lack conclusive evidence. However, many remain unstudied in the context of refractory septic shock. Most of these strategies are relatively inexpensive, widely accessible, and are likely to be available in the majority of institutions. Our collective belief is that a bespoke approach can help to achieve haemodynamic stability and reverse progressive deterioration in this small subgroup of critically ill patients with a very high mortality.

Clinical practice guidelines are useful in improving quality of care and outcomes, reducing inappropriate variation in practice, promoting efficient use of resources, informing and empowering patients and informing public policy. However, difficulties arise when guidelines are poorly introduced into routine daily practice and, as a consequence, many patients do not receive the care intended or receive harmful or unnecessary care.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2012 [^114qFyMu]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG). Recommendations were classified into three groups: 1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; 2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and 3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 hr of recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 hrs of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1C); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients) (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement, as based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 hrs) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hrs after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 hrs of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Fluid therapy in resuscitated sepsis: less is more [^1149MoAe]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Fluid infusion may be lifesaving in patients with severe sepsis, especially in the earliest phases of treatment. Following initial resuscitation, however, fluid boluses often fail to augment perfusion and may be harmful. In this review, we seek to compare and contrast the impact of fluids in early and later sepsis; show that much fluid therapy is clinically ineffective in patients with severe sepsis; explore the detrimental aspects of excessive volume infusion; examine how clinicians assess the intravascular volume state; appraise the potential for dynamic indexes to predict fluid responsiveness; and recommend a clinical approach.

### Are we close to the ideal intravenous fluid? [^113fy4d3]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

The approach to i.v. fluid therapy for hypovolaemia may significantly influence outcomes for patients who experience a systemic inflammatory response after sepsis, trauma, or major surgery. Currently, there is no single i.v. fluid agent that meets all the criteria for the ideal treatment for hypovolaemia. The physician must choose the best available agent(s) for each patient, and then decide when and how much to administer. Findings from large randomized trials suggest that some colloid-based fluids, particularly starch-based colloids, may be harmful in some situations, but it is unclear whether they should be withdrawn from use completely. Meanwhile, crystalloid fluids, such as saline 0.9% and Ringer's lactate, are more frequently used, but debate continues over which preparation is preferable. Perhaps most importantly, it remains unclear how to select the optimal dose of fluid in different patients and different clinical scenarios. There is good reason to believe that both inadequate and excessive i.v. fluid administration may lead to poor outcomes, including increased risk of infection and organ dysfunction, for hypovolaemic patients. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on this topic and identify some key pitfalls and some areas of agreed best practice.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^1162kEfQ]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric guidelines — application by local resource availability states that the intended users are health professionals caring for children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in hospital, emergency, or other acute care settings. These guidelines were largely developed without consideration of healthcare resources, with some specific exceptions such as fluid resuscitation. The panel supports that these guidelines should constitute a general scheme of "best practice", but translation to treatment algorithms or bundles and standards of care will need to account for variation in the availability of local healthcare resources, and the panel acknowledges the need for future research to test adaptation to locally available resources.

### Protocolised management in sepsis (proMISe): a multicentre randomised controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early, goal-directed, protocolised resuscitation for emerging septic shock [^1169UN6R]. Health Technology Assessment (2015). Low credibility.

The study ProMISe was published by Mouncey PR and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Health Technol Assess. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the ProMISe study, the trial question was: what is the effect of early goal-directed therapy for the resuscitation of patients presenting with early septic shock? In the ProMISe study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ProMISe study, the population was: 1260 patients (532 female, 728 male). The inclusion criteria were patients presenting with early septic shock. The key exclusion criteria were aged < 18 years, known pregnancy, drug overdose, injury from burns or trauma, acute coronary syndrome, requirement for immediate surgery, hemodynamic instability, known history of AIDS, or contraindication to central venous catheterization or blood transfusion. In the ProMISe study, the interventions were: n = 630 early goal-directed therapy (target CVP > 8 mmHg, MAP > 65 mmHg, ScvO2 > 70%) n = 630 usual care (decisions at discretion of treating clinician). In the ProMISe study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at 90 days (29.5% vs. 29.2%; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.2). In the ProMISe study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant decrease in quality-adjusted life years (4.584 vs. 4.582; ARR 0.002, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.41) No significant difference in lifetime cost per patient (33620 £ vs. 32142 £; AD 1478 £, 95% CI -1434 to 4390). In the ProMISe study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the ProMISe study, the conclusion was: in patients presenting with early septic shock, early goal-directed therapy was not superior to usual care with respect to death at 90 days.

### The key advance in the treatment of sepsis in the last 10 years… doing less [^114ugFgu]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Although many pharmaceutical and technological advances are heavily touted, they have had relatively little impact on overall outcome improvements in the critically ill. Acting on the increasing recognition that 'less may be best' has, in my opinion, been the greatest single advance in patient management in the intensive care unit in the past 10 years. Although certainly not qualifying as a 'brave new world' in terms of daring and exciting innovation, the importance of (often covert) iatrogenic complications should not be underestimated.

### Management of sepsis [^115bCMjQ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis remains a common cause of death in surgical patients. Eradication of the septic source and supportive care has long been the mainstay of treatment. In recent years, however, early goal-directed therapy, tighter glucose control, administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated), and steroid replacement have produced improved morbidity and mortality. In the future, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis and clinical studies may further improve outcomes from severe sepsis.

Initial resuscitation — timing, volume, and assessment approach: Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and "we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately" (Best practice statement). For patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, "we suggest that at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given within the first 3 hours of resuscitation" (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, "we suggest using dynamic measures to guide fluid resuscitation over physical examination or static parameters alone" (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with dynamic parameters including response to a passive leg raise or a fluid bolus using stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), or echocardiography. A retrospective analysis "showed that failure to receive 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid therapy within 3 hours of sepsis onset was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, delayed resolution of hypotension and increased length of stay in ICU".

### Management of adult sepsis in resource-limited settings: global expert consensus statements using a Delphi method [^114XrJKL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2017, sepsis was estimated to be responsible for 49 million cases with 11 million associated deaths globally. Eighty-five percent of sepsis cases and resultant deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) particularly in Africa, Asia and South America. Many cases occur in vulnerable and underserved populations. Improving detection and appropriate management of sepsis in such settings are high priorities to reduce the global burden of sepsis.

The World Health Assembly Resolution (70.7) on 'Improving the Diagnosis and Management of Sepsis' specifically recommends that Member States should establish guidelines and capability for effective sepsis diagnosis and management. The most widely used guidelines globally are focussed primarily on high-income settings. A 2019 survey in the Asia Pacific Region showed over 80% of middle-income countries in the region used the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Guidelines. However, multiple studies highlight the difficulties in implementing non-contextualised guidelines in resource-limited settings.

Limited resources may be a significant factor impeding the implementation of sepsis guidelines in LMICs, but there may also be other important contextual factors that restrict applicability of international guidelines. For example, there are differences in disease aetiology, comorbidities and case-mix of sepsis populations, necessitating different management strategies. Additionally, international guidelines do not address the safe management of critically ill patients with sepsis in the absence of an intensives care unit (ICU) beds, when factors such as the location for management, minimum monitoring, triggers for escalation of care and safe transport are important.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is aiming to use the best available evidence to generate recommendations for management of sepsis which can support national programs around the world. However, high quality research on sepsis management in resource-limited settings is lacking. Therefore, to complement existing guidelines, we conducted a Delphi study among global experts in sepsis management representing diverse geographical and income settings, with the aim of generating consensus on strategies for management of sepsis in resource-limited settings where barriers to the effective implementation of current international guidelines exist or where guidance for specific sepsis management issues relevant in these settings is lacking.

Sepsis and septic shock — gram-negative empiric coverage by multidrug-resistant (MDR) risk: In patients at high risk for MDR organisms, we suggest using two gram negative agents for empiric treatment to increase the likelihood of adequate coverage, while in patients with a low risk for MDR organisms, we suggest using a single agent for empiric treatment, and recommend tailoring the use of double coverage based on patients' risk of MDR pathogens. Empiric double coverage of gram-negative bacilli is most important in patients at high risk for resistant organisms with severe illness, particularly septic shock, and in the directed/targeted phase, once causative agent(s) and susceptibilities are known, sustained double gram-negative coverage is not necessary except possibly for patients with highly resistant organisms with no proven safe and efficacious therapeutic option; the overall quality of evidence was very low.
