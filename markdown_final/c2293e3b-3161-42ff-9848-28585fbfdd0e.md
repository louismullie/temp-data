## Question

Assessment for lower back pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to assess lower back pain, specifically looking for a step-by-step framework that preserves the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial triage and red flags. Then, I should verify the focused history elements and how to classify the pain. Next, I will examine the physical examination strategy and which maneuvers are actually useful. After that, I need to check the imaging and laboratory indications and when to avoid unnecessary tests. Then, I should review psychosocial risk screening and prognostic tools. Finally, I will consider functional assessment, outcome measures, and when to refer, making sure each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial triage priorities: screen for red flags and serious pathology, and classify the episode by duration because this drives imaging and urgency decisions. Acute is less than 6 weeks, subacute is 6–12 weeks, and chronic is greater than 12 weeks, and I should double-check that these definitions align with major guidelines, which they do per NASS and VA/DoD frameworks [^115XcvMN] [^112z8Hy5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging. I need to ensure red flags are explicitly cataloged and linked to appropriate actions. Serious red flags include progressive or severe neurologic deficits, suspected malignancy, infection, fracture, and cauda equina syndrome. When present, imaging and labs are indicated, whereas in uncomplicated acute low back pain without red flags, routine imaging is discouraged by VA/DoD, ACP/APS, AAFP Choosing Wisely, and ACR, and randomized data show early MRI does not improve outcomes in uncomplicated cases, so I should avoid reflex imaging unless criteria are met [^113MwM4Q] [^115WtuGg] [^116xPMBX] [^1163LDmg] [^114UfaS5].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that meaningfully change management: onset and trajectory, location and radiation, pain character, aggravating and relieving factors, prior episodes and treatments, trauma or heavy lifting, systemic features like fever or weight loss, and bowel or bladder changes. I should also ask about cancer history, immunosuppression, and osteoporosis risks because these shape pretest probabilities for infection, malignancy, and fracture, and I must not forget occupational and psychosocial factors that predict chronicity, as emphasized by VA/DoD and ACP/APS [^111cpn9T] [^116xPMBX].

> I will now examine the pain classification because it guides next steps: nonspecific mechanical low back pain, radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, and specific spinal causes. I should confirm that this triage remains the backbone of initial categorization in high-quality guidelines, which it does per ACP/APS and VA/DoD, and I need to remember that most low back pain is nonspecific and improves with conservative care, so I should avoid anchoring on rare pathologies early [^116xPMBX] [^111cpn9T] [^111AMUxe].

> Next, I should review the physical examination with a focus on what actually changes decisions: vital signs for fever or hemodynamic instability, gait and posture, inspection for deformity or ecchymosis, palpation for focal tenderness, range of motion, and a targeted neurologic exam including strength, sensation, reflexes, and dermatomal mapping. I need to check which provocative tests are evidence-informed, and while straight leg raise is traditional, seated slump may outperform it for sensitivity in suspected radiculopathy, though I should not overinterpret any single test and must correlate with the clinical picture [^111cpn9T] [^115bLZws].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought Trendelenburg could help localize hip abductor pathology contributing to lateral hip pain, but I should double-check its specificity. It is indeed sensitive but nonspecific in chronic low back pain populations, so a positive sign supports abductor weakness but does not by itself establish a specific diagnosis like greater trochanteric pain syndrome, reinforcing the need to correlate with focal tenderness and functional context [^1166oqRx].

> I need to ensure I do not over-order tests. In the absence of red flags, routine imaging does not improve outcomes and may provoke unnecessary interventions, so I should avoid imaging in acute nonspecific low back pain, and if imaging is ultimately needed for persistent symptoms or intervention planning, MRI is preferred for soft tissue and neural structures, whereas plain radiographs are reasonable when fracture is suspected or in postoperative spines with hardware concerns [^113MwM4Q] [^114pK5br] [^1151j7Un] [^116NfdxE].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist beyond 6 weeks and the patient is a candidate for injection or surgery? I should confirm that MRI is then appropriate, which ACR supports, and I must also remember that early MRI in uncomplicated cases has been shown not to improve long-term outcomes, so timing and indication matter greatly [^1151j7Un] [^114UfaS5].

> Let me consider psychosocial screening next because it meaningfully predicts transition to chronic pain. Tools like STarT Back and the Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire can stratify risk and guide intensity of intervention, and I should document depression, anxiety, fear-avoidance, catastrophizing, and work-related factors since these are associated with delayed recovery and disability [^113MwM4Q] [^1157T5tv] [^117YPnXG].

> I should confirm prognostic markers that warrant closer follow-up: high baseline pain intensity, high disability scores, prior sick leave or back-related disability, low education, workers' compensation, and poor general health are all associated with higher risk of chronicity, so early identification allows stepped, more intensive management and may mitigate poor outcomes [^1157T5tv] [^117N3SvF].

> Next, I should review functional assessment and outcome tracking. Validated instruments like the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire and Oswestry Disability Index quantify baseline function and enable monitoring, and performance-based measures complement self-report to capture activity limitation and participation restriction. I need to ensure I reassess at defined intervals to detect nonresponse early and pivot care accordingly [^112PnWPM].

> Hold on, I should verify the ICF framing because it helps structure goals. Integrating body functions, activity, and participation domains ensures a biopsychosocial plan, and emerging tools aligned with ICF functioning and disability constructs can support comprehensive, patient-centered assessment and communication across disciplines [^114xbNVg].

> I will now examine when to refer. Urgent referral is warranted for cauda equina, progressive neurologic deficits, suspected infection, malignancy, or fracture, and routine referral is appropriate for persistent radiculopathy beyond about 6–12 weeks, refractory symptoms despite guideline-concordant care, diagnostic uncertainty, or when interventional procedures are being considered. I should double-check that these thresholds align with VA/DoD and ACR guidance, which they do [^113MwM4Q] [^1151j7Un].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure nothing is missing: triage and red flags, focused history with classification, targeted physical exam, selective imaging only when indicated, psychosocial risk screening, functional assessment with validated tools, and timely referral for high-risk or nonresponders. This sequence reflects consensus from VA/DoD, ACP/APS, and contemporary reviews emphasizing conservative-first, risk-stratified care [^111cpn9T] [^116xPMBX] [^116MmT2N].

---

A focused history and physical examination are the cornerstone of lower back pain assessment [^111cpn9T], with **red flags guiding imaging** [^113MwM4Q] and **psychosocial screening informing risk** [^113MwM4Q]. Routine imaging is not indicated without red flags [^115WtuGg]; reserve MRI for **persistent symptoms beyond 6 weeks** [^1151j7Un] or when surgery or intervention is considered [^116xPMBX]. Use validated tools (ODI, RMQ, STarT Back) [^114ue9VZ] to track pain, function, and risk, and apply classification systems to tailor treatment [^116amLw1]. Most cases are nonspecific and improve with conservative care; reassess at 2–4 weeks and escalate only if no improvement [^116sAwsZ].

---

## Clinical history

A thorough clinical history should include the following:

- **Pain characteristics**: onset, duration, location, intensity (0–10 scale), quality, aggravating and relieving factors, and temporal pattern (constant vs. intermittent) [^notfound].

- **Associated symptoms**: leg pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, bowel or bladder dysfunction, fever, weight loss, night pain, morning stiffness [^111GTPcY].

- **Functional impact**: activity limitations, work status, and daily living restrictions [^114GnoGL].

- **Psychosocial factors**: depression, anxiety, fear-avoidance beliefs, catastrophizing, and stressors [^112s8rbR].

- **Medical history**: previous episodes, surgeries, trauma, cancer, osteoporosis, rheumatologic conditions, and medication use [^notfound].

---

## Physical examination

The physical examination should include:

- **Inspection**: posture, gait, deformities, and asymmetry [^notfound].

- **Palpation**: tenderness over spinous processes, paraspinal muscles, sacroiliac joints, and greater trochanter [^1166oqRx].

- **Range of motion**: flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation [^notfound].

- **Neurological examination**: motor strength, sensory testing, deep tendon reflexes, and straight leg raise (SLR) or crossed SLR [^115bLZws].

- **Special tests**: Trendelenburg, Ober's test, seated slump test, and femoral nerve stretch test [^115bLZws].

---

## Red flags indicating serious underlying conditions

Red flags that warrant further investigation include:

| **Condition** | **Red flags** |
|-|-|
| Malignancy | - History of cancer <br/> - Unexplained weight loss <br/> - Age > 50 years <br/> - Failure to improve after 4–6 weeks [^114GnoGL] |
| Infection | - Fever <br/> - Recent infection <br/> - Immunosuppression <br/> - Intravenous drug use [^114UwfEa] |
| Fracture | - Trauma <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Prolonged corticosteroid use <br/> - Age > 65 years [^113YVuoR] |
| Cauda equina syndrome | - Saddle anesthesia <br/> - Bowel or bladder dysfunction <br/> - Severe or progressive neurological deficits [^114pK5br] |

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Imaging is **not routinely indicated** for acute lower back pain without red flags [^115WtuGg]. Reserve imaging for **persistent symptoms beyond 6 weeks** [^1163LDmg] or when surgery or intervention is considered [^112LAe3S]. MRI is preferred for suspected **radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, infection, or malignancy** [^116xPMBX]; obtain plain radiographs when fracture is suspected [^114pK5br].

---

## Functional assessment tools

Validated questionnaires assess pain, function, and disability:

- **Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)**: Measures disability related to back pain [^114ue9VZ].

- **Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMQ)**: Assesses functional impairment [^114ue9VZ].

- **STarT Back Screening Tool**: Stratifies risk of chronicity and guides intervention intensity [^113MwM4Q].

---

## Classification systems

Classification systems guide treatment selection:

- **ICF-based classification**: Mobility deficits, movement coordination impairments, radiating pain, and generalized pain [^116amLw1].

- **Treatment-based classification**: Mobilization, specific exercise, immobilization, and traction [^111xmeak].

---

## Prognostic factors

Factors influencing prognosis include:

- **Demographic factors**: Age, education level, and occupation [^1157T5tv].

- **Clinical factors**: Pain intensity, disability, previous episodes, and psychological distress [^117N3SvF].

- **Psychosocial factors**: Depression, anxiety, fear-avoidance beliefs, and catastrophizing [^112s8rbR].

---

## Follow-up and reassessment

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor progress and adjust treatment. Reassess at 2–4 weeks; if there is no improvement, consider advanced imaging, specialist referral, or alternative treatments [^115fTqge].

---

A focused history and physical examination, with selective imaging and validated tools, enable accurate assessment and management of lower back pain. Most cases are nonspecific and improve with conservative care; **reassess at 2–4 weeks** and escalate only if no improvement [^116MmT2N].

### Rapid magnetic resonance imaging vs radiographs for patients with low back pain: a randomized controlled trial [^114UfaS5]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

The study Early MRI for low back pain was published by Jarvik JG and colleagues in 2003 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Low back pain. In the Early MRI for low back pain study, the trial question was: what is the role of rapid MRI for patients with low back pain? In the Early MRI for low back pain study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Early MRI for low back pain study, the population was: 380 patients (211 female, 169 male). The inclusion criteria were patients age ≥ 18 years with low back pain. The key exclusion criteria were lumbar surgery within 1 year prior to enrollment, history of acute external trauma, metallic implants in the lumbar spine, contraindications for MRI, age < 18 years, or pregnancy. In the Early MRI for low back pain study, the interventions were: n = 190 early MRI (pulse sequences of sagittal and axial T2-weighted fast spin echo images with total acquisition time of approximately 2 minutes on a 1.5-T scanner) n = 190 initial imaging with spine radiograph (lumbar spine evaluation with anteroposterior, lateral, or oblique view). In the Early MRI for low back pain study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in back-related disability measured by the 12-month Roland Scale score (9.34 points vs. 8.75 points; MD -0.59, 95% CI -1.69 to 0.87). In the Early MRI for low back pain study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in SF-36 subscales of bodily pain (51.34 points vs. 52.59 points; MD 1.25, 95% CI -4.46 to 4.96) No significant difference in 12-month Roland Scale score (9.34 points vs. 8.75 points; MD -0.59, 95% CI -1.69 to 0.87). In the Early MRI for low back pain study, the conclusion was: in patients age ≥ 18 years with low back pain, early MRI was not superior to initial imaging with spine radiograph with respect to a back-related disability measured by the 12-month Roland Scale score.

### Low back pain [^114GS117]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Low back pain affects individuals of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Despite advancements in assessment and treatment methods, the management of low back pain remains a challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. One reason for the limited success in identifying effective treatments is the large variation in the manifestations, possible causes, precipitating and maintaining factors, course, prognosis and consequences in terms of activity interference and quality of life. However, despite these challenges, steady progress has been achieved in the understanding of back pain, and important steps in the understanding of the psychological and social risk factors, genetics and brain mechanisms of low back pain have been made. These new findings have given impetus to the development of new diagnostic procedures, evidence-based screening methods and more targeted interventions, which underscore the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of low back pain that integrates biological, psychological and social aspects.

### Assessment of functioning and disability in patients with low back pain-the low back pain assessment tool. part 1: development [^114xbNVg]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To present the process used to develop the low back pain (LBP) assessment tool including evaluation of the initial content validity of the tool.

Methods

The development process comprised the elements: definition of construct and content, literature search, item generation, needs assessment, piloting, adaptations, design, and technical production. The LBP assessment tool was developed to assess the construct "functioning and disability" as defined by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Involvement of patients and health professionals was essential.

Results

The elements were collapsed into five steps. In total, 18 patients and 12 health professionals contributed to the content and the design of the tool. The LBP assessment tool covered all ICF components shared among 63 ICF categories.

Conclusions

This study presents the process used to develop the LBP assessment tool, which is the first tool to address all ICF components and integrate biopsychosocial perspectives provided by patients and health professionals in the same tool. Initial evaluation of content validity showed adequate reflection of the construct "functioning and disability". Further work on the way will evaluate comprehensiveness, acceptability, and degree of implementation of the LBP assessment tool to strengthen its use for clinical practice. Implications for RehabilitationA biopsychosocial and patients-centred approach is a strong foundation for identifying the many relevant aspects related to low back pain (LBP). Responding to a lack of tools to support a biopsychosocial and patients-centred approach the LBP assessment tool was developed using a robust, multi-step process with involvement of patients and health professionals. The LBP assessment tool is a strong candidate for a user-friendly tool to facilitate use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health in routine clinical practice.

Differential diagnosis — Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications associated with serious medical conditions or psychosocial factors and initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner when the patient's clinical findings are suggestive of serious medical or psychological pathology, when reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those in the diagnosis/classification section of these guidelines, or when the patient's symptoms are not resolving with interventions aimed at normalization of the patient's impairments of body function.

### Pain and the brain: lower back pain [^117ULrRc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic lower back pain is a common and frequently disabling problem, but an organic cause cannot always be identified. Pain often co-occurs with mood and anxiety disorders, but when patients present with somatic symptoms in the primary care setting, clinicians often overlook mood and anxiety symptoms. Because appropriate treatment includes both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies, a team approach that includes both mental health and primary care professionals is warranted to alleviate the patient's pain, manage psychiatric comorbidities, and improve the patient's functioning and quality of life. Additionally, when prescribing pain medication, clinicians should monitor patients for substance misuse.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^112kaxsD]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis & treatment of low back pain — advanced imaging indications from history and physical examination: The guideline asks whether history and physical examination findings would warrant obtaining advanced imaging studies, but a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question; the work group consensus states that in the absence of reliable evidence supporting an absolute indication for advanced imaging based upon history and physical examination, in patients with severe and intractable pain syndromes who have failed medical/interventional treatment, advanced imaging may be indicated, and while subgroups show higher or lower incidence of radiographic abnormalities based on acuity, tenderness to palpation, and provocation maneuvers, the utility of these findings in guiding treatment is not clear; the work group does not have any recommendations for future research on this topic.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115kEBdF]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) guideline scope — recommendations were developed using specific inclusion/exclusion criteria that excluded conditions such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee; given these exclusions, the recommendations address a subset of low back pain care; the guideline is not intended to be a fixed treatment protocol and should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods, with ultimate judgment made by the physician and patient.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracic back pain [^113oyNgG]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for low back pain, more specifically with respect to patients with upper back pain, ACR 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain MRI without contrast as initial imaging in adult patients with thoracic back pain with myelopathy or radiculopathy.
Consider obtaining thoracic spine X-ray, contrast-enhanced MRI of the thoracic spine, CT of the thoracic spine, or CT myelography of the thoracic spine in selected cases.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^111wmKe4]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

As described in-depth in the series introduction, a modified Delphi approach was used by a content expert panel comprised of geriatric and physiatry specialists and physical therapists, in collaboration with a primary care panel. An evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithm (Figure 1) was developed iteratively. A corresponding table outlining the supporting evidence is presented in Table 1. The panelists included clinicians who treat both civilians and Veterans, and the algorithm was developed so that all required resources are available within the Veterans Health Administration system.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^112z8Hy5]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain — Module A red flags and serious conditions decision specifies that Box 3 asks, "Are there progressive or otherwise serious neurologic deficits or other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) for serious conditions?" If yes, Box 4 instructs to "Perform appropriate evaluation for serious conditions", after which Box 5 asks, "Are serious conditions identified?" If yes to Box 5, Box 6 directs to "Address any serious conditions as indicated; consider specialty consultation". If no to Box 5, proceed to Box 7, which asks, "Is back pain chronic (≥ 3 months)?"

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^113MwM4Q]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and diagnostic approach — For patients with low back pain, we recommend the history and physical examination include evaluation for progressive or otherwise serious neurologic deficits and other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) associated with serious underlying pathology (e.g., malignancy, fracture, infection) (Strong for). For patients with low back pain, we recommend diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when neurologic deficits are progressive or otherwise serious or when other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) are present (Strong for). For patients with acute low back pain, without focal neurologic deficits or other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history), we recommend against routinely obtaining imaging studies or performing invasive diagnostic tests (Strong against). For patients with low back pain, we suggest assessing psychosocial factors and using predictive screening instruments (e.g. STarT Back and The Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire) to inform treatment planning (Weak for). For patients with low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against specific physical examination maneuvers to assist in the diagnosis of facet or sacroiliac joint pain, or a lumbar/lumbo-sacral radiculopathy (Neither for nor against).

### Low back pain [^114ue9VZ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain — examination: outcome measures (A) — Clinicians should use validated self-report questionnaires, such as the Oswestry Disability Index and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, to identify a patient's baseline status relative to pain, function, and disability and to monitor a change in a patient's status throughout the course of treatment.

### Can screening instruments accurately determine poor outcome risk in adults with recent onset low back pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115k3pmU]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Types of participants

Studies were eligible if they involved adults (aged 18 or over) with 'recent onset' LBP (i.e. acute LBP (0–6 weeks) or subacute LBP (6 weeks to 3 months)), with or without leg pain. Studies involving participants with recent-onset and participants with chronic symptoms were included with the intention of requesting from study authors the data from the 'recent onset' participants only. Studies including participants with pain in other body regions were considered eligible if more than 75% had LBP. Cohorts of compensable and non-compensable patients presenting to primary, secondary and tertiary care settings were eligible for inclusion. It was also considered appropriate to include individuals registered on workers compensation databases, because it was assumed that this occurs in conjunction with presentation to a healthcare provider. Participants may have presented with a first episode of pain or report episodic/recurrent LBP, provided that the current painful episode was immediately preceded by a minimum of one pain-free month as suggested previously.

Table 2
Key questions to ask a patient when evaluating lateral hip/thigh pain, organized by supported diagnosis

Because GTPS is a clinical syndrome, the diagnosis can be confirmed with physical examination. Table 3 describes an efficient method to perform several exam maneuvers to assess for GTPS and other common lumbopelvic and hip conditions. To localize the GT, palpate the proximal lateral thigh of the limb being tested while the patient is standing on both feet and pivoting the leg being tested into hip internal and external rotation. The bony protuberance that is most prominent to the examiner's touch is the GT. Focal tenderness over this bony protuberance is the definition of GTPS. Another common finding in GTPS is a positive Trendelenburg sign because hip abductor weakness is often the leading biomechanical cause of GTPS. If the patient is able, a positive Trendelenburg can be determined by asking the patient to stand on one leg. If the pelvis contralateral to the stance leg drops, there is weakness of the stance leg hip abductor muscles. This is a positive Trendelenburg sign. If the patient intentionally shifts his/her trunk over the stance leg (thereby elevating the contralateral pelvis) in order to perform the task, this is considered a positive compensated Trendelenburg sign. This finding also corroborates hip abductor weakness of the stance leg. The presence of a Trendelenburg or compensated Trendelenburg sign can help a provider identify biomechanical issues to help direct treatment. However, a Trendelenburg's sign is positive in 54% of all people with CLBP and it is not a finding specific to the diagnosis of GTPS, so it was not included in the diagnostic algorithm.

### Initial assessment and management of pain: a pathway for care developed by the British pain society [^115KTvkM]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

There is wide variation in how pain is managed in the UK. Patients often find themselves caught in a sea of referrals while continuing to suffer with poorly relieved symptoms. The British Pain Society's (BPS) Initial Assessment and Management of Pain care pathway (one of the five new BPS care pathways published by the Map of Medicine(®)) sets out how best to initially manage persistent pain. Patient education and supported self-management is recommended from an early stage. This pathway focuses on the start of the journey of a patient with pain, where a full diagnostic work-up is not yet complete. The pathway covers diverse recommendations such as appropriate content of a pain consultation, the use of clinical decision management tools to aid stratification of care, and resources to support patients to make informed decisions. Recommendations for monitoring of therapeutic effect are also included. Early identification of people at high risk of chronic disability may allow more intensive management, better use of resources, and reduction in disability. Implementation poses significant challenges; more research is needed to determine the most effective interventions. This article highlights practice points for the non-specialist, discusses areas of controversy, and examines the challenges of implementation.

Case Presentation

Relevant History

The patient is a 90-year-old female with past medical history including a left sacral insufficiency fracture, thoracic vertebral compression fracture, and degenerative left medial meniscus tear, who presented with stabbing left lateral hip pain. The pain was chronic but had been progressing in severity over the past month. There was no inciting event or fall. The pain was exacerbated by lying on her left side and was affecting her sleep. At baseline, she ambulated with a rollator walker, but the pain was starting to limit her ability to walk. She had a history of low back and posterior left buttock pain, but she denied current pain in these regions. She also denied weakness or pain radiation into her lower extremities.

Relevant Physical Examination

On examination, she had no pain with lumbar or hip range of motion. She had full, symmetric, and pain-free lower extremity strength, and deep tendon reflexes and sensation to light touch were intact and symmetric in her lower extremities. She had a positive Trendelenburg sign with single-leg stance bilaterally, and she was tender to palpation over the left greater trochanter but not the right. Ober's, seated slump, and straight leg raise tests were negative. (See Figures 2 and 4 for descriptions of Ober's and the seated slump test.)

Figure 2
Ober's test: 1) The patient is positioned side-lying, and the leg to be tested is on top; the pelvis is stabilized perpendicular to the exam table by the examiner's hand; 2) The knee of the affected leg is passively flexed to 90°, and then the hip is passively stretched through abduction and extension (to position the iliotibial band behind the greater trochanter) by the examiner; (A) shows the view from above and (B) shows the anterior perspective; 3) The knee of the affected leg is allowed to slowly drop by gravity until reaching its final resting angle. If the final angle is greater than 0° when compared to the plane of the table (i.e. the hip is still abducted), Ober's test is positive; (C) highlights a negative Ober's test.

Imaging

Focused ultrasound performed by a musculoskeletal physiatrist with ultrasound training revealed evidence of bursitis of the left greater trochanter, which correlated with the patient's point of maximal tenderness.

### Assessment of patients with chronic pain [^112HK8HM]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is a public health concern affecting 20–30% of the population of Western countries. Although there have been many scientific advances in the understanding of the neurophysiology of pain, precisely assessing and diagnosing a patient's chronic pain problem is not straightforward or well-defined. How chronic pain is conceptualized influences how pain is evaluated and the factors considered when making a chronic pain diagnosis. There is no one-to-one relationship between the amount or type of organic pathology and pain intensity, but instead, the chronic pain experience is shaped by a myriad of biomedical, psychosocial (e.g. patients' beliefs, expectations, and mood), and behavioural factors (e.g. context, responses by significant others). Assessing each of these three domains through a comprehensive evaluation of the person with chronic pain is essential for treatment decisions and to facilitate optimal outcomes. This evaluation should include a thorough patient history and medical evaluation and a brief screening interview where the patient's behaviour can be observed. Further assessment to address questions identified during the initial evaluation will guide decisions as to what additional assessments, if any, may be appropriate. Standardized self-reported instruments to evaluate the patient's pain intensity, functional abilities, beliefs and expectations, and emotional distress are available, and can be administered by the physician, or a referral for in depth evaluation can be made to assist in treatment planning.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^117N3SvF]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis & Treatment of Low Back Pain — risk stratification for conversion from acute to chronic emphasizes that it is recommended that pain severity and functional impairment be used to stratify risk of conversion from acute to chronic low back pain and is graded A. Supporting evidence includes a cohort in which patients with LBP < 72 hours who self-referred to a general practitioner for LBP (n = 113) completed baseline assessments including pain intensity (on a 100-mm VAS), functional disability (RMDQ) and HRQOL (SF–36), and this study provides Level I evidence that prior back disability, high scores on disability questionnaire, temporary disability status and SF–36 general health measure were strong determinants of conversion of acute to chronic pain; additionally, another study assessed the relationship between psychological characteristics and conversion of acute to chronic LBP, enrolling a total of 324 participants with acute LBP ≤ 6 weeks who completed baseline assessments including pain and disability (Million VAS) and psychopathology (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM–III–R).

Low back pain — lack of improvement as a red flag states that failure to improve with conservative care can be a sign of a serious medical condition or misdiagnosis, and as a general guideline, failure of a patient to demonstrate improvement in a period of time no longer than 30 days can be interpreted as a red flag.

### Low back pain [^111xmeak]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain diagnosis and classification — the development of classification systems has been identified as a priority among researchers in the primary care management of patients with low back pain, and recent reports in the literature suggest that interventions based on subgroup classification have the potential to enhance effect sizes over studies where the identical interventions were administered in a one-size-fits-all approach. There are a variety of low back pain classification systems described in the literature, and the underlying premise is that classifying patients into groups based on clinical characteristics and matching these patient subgroups to management strategies likely to benefit them will improve the outcome of physical therapy interventions. The treatment-based classification system uses information from the history and physical examination to place patients into 1 of 4 separate treatment subgroups, and the labels of these 4 subgroups, which are mobilization, specific exercise, immobilization, and traction, intend to capture the primary focus of the physical therapy intervention.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^1156pPgP]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The usefulness and clinical adoption of this algorithm is predicated on a grasp of several key takeaway points and the flexibility to incorporate rapidly emerging new technologies into the continuum of care. Many patients with chronic lumbar discogenic pain are in their 30–50s underscoring the reality that their spine care will span many forthcoming decades. In summary, the starting point for the physical examination assessment is in the identification of patients with midline low back pain with no neurologic deficits that is increased with forward flexion and sitting who have a positive sustained hip flexion test that narrows the diagnostic aperture to anterior column involvement as the primary pain source. The identification of painful intervertebral discs is done via MRI and MRS which represents a potentially novel breakthrough in the precise and personalized diagnosis of lumbar discogenic pain. When these advancements in quantitative imaging are combined with effective first line intradiscal interventions, the potential exists to optimize spine care by restoring and preserving native disc structure and mechanics. There has been a renewed appreciation of the importance of the intervertebral disc as a catalyst in spine degeneration and this has hastened the development of new diagnostic and treatment technologies aimed at averting spinal surgery. A concerted and collaborative effort will be necessary from all stakeholders to amass the supporting compendium of data to fulfill regulatory and reimbursement requirements so that effective treatments can be made available to patients.

### Sonography in evaluation of lower abdominal pain… [^116uQeDY]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint in children and young adults, resulting in a significant number of visits to the hospital emergency department. Of all possible diagnoses associated with abdominal pain, acute appendicitis is the most serious and perhaps one of the most difficult to diagnose based solely on clinical findings. For more than 10 years, sonography has been considered an accurate diagnostic tool for examining patients with acute appendicitis. However, the role of sonography in the initial diagnosis of lower abdominal or pelvic pain has not been well researched. Carrico and colleagues evaluated the impact of sonography on physicians' initial diagnostic confidence and their treatment of nontraumatic abdominal pain in children and young adults.

Children and young adults who presented to a large urban pediatric emergency department during a six-month period in 1997 with acute abdominal pain, pelvic pain, or both, and who underwent sonographic examination were eligible for the study. Physicians were asked to state the most likely diagnosis and then estimate the probability of that diagnosis both before and after the results of sonography were available. They were also asked to describe their treatment plan if sonography had not been performed. Of the 101 patients who met the study criteria, data were collected for 94. Sonographic data significantly affected the initial diagnosis in 38 patients who were thought to have appendicitis after clinical examination. Of these patients, 20 had a change in diagnosis after sonographic examination. The remainder of the total study group had abdominal conditions other than appendicitis.

The use of sonography improved physicians' clinical confidence, particularly in those patients whose diagnoses changed after the procedure. In this group, there were no false-positive results, and the true negative rate was 100 percent. The treatment plans of 43 patients overall changed as a result of sonographic information. Before the sonography, physicians planned to discharge two and admit for observation 12 of the 17 patients with surgically proven appendicitis. The authors conclude that sonography is an important tool in the assessment of abdominal or pelvic pain in children and young adults. Sonographic information changed initial diagnoses, increased clinical confidence and led to changes in treatment plans. In this study, the results of sonography reassured physicians that, in most instances, patients' abdominal pain did not require surgical intervention. For patients who had acute appendicitis, sonography reduced delays in diagnosis.

### Do we really apply evidence-based-recommendations to spine surgery? Results of an international survey [^112qaGEN]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the application of clinical methodology and decision-making thoroughly tested by duly controlled peer-reviewed studies. With the exponentially increasing number of publications, EBM aims to shift the traditional paradigm of making decisions based purely on the judgment of the physician or the experience of senior doctors to the use of results obtained from systematic and unbiased research in a patient-centered diagnosis and treatment model with the highest available evidence. The definition of EBM has evolved, but the most widely accepted definition was from Sackett et al. in 1996 and revised in 2000. In summary, it stated that clinicians should use the best, unbiased, clinically sound, and up-to-date data available on a patient basis in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery are the pioneers of spine surgery throughout the world. Neurosurgeons have utilized EBM and clinical guidelines to make sound decisions for the last three decades. However, the increasing number of guidelines have questioned the validity of these recommendations as they may stray away from the rigorous process outlined by The Institute of Medicine (IOM). Orthopedic Surgery also recognized the importance of EBM in the early 2000s, and journal sections reserved for "Evidence-Based Orthopedics" emerged. The classical paradigm of trying non-operative treatment first and operative treatment, if the first step fails, has shifted towards surgical treatment vs. other treatment options.

Evidence-Based Spine Surgery (EBSS) has also emerged parallel to the development of EBM. The North American Spine Society (NASS) and Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) frequently publish guidelines with evidence-based suggestions to provide the highest evidence-based decisions in spinal pathologies. For example, EBSS supported by randomized controlled trials has shown discectomy for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation (LDH), decompression of spinal stenosis, and decompression with fusion of degenerative spondylolisthesis offer clinical benefit in relieving lower back and radicular pain compared to conservative treatment. However, pursuing EBSS as the sole deciding factor for diagnosing and treating spinal pathologies is unrealistic. Most of the publications on spine surgery are case-controlled retrospective cohorts or case series. Thus, the number of high-quality evidence parallel to spine surgery development is lacking. Considering the value of EBM and the probability of further implementation into decision-making, this study sheds light on the reception and application of EBM by spinal surgeons and the use of evidence-based modalities in their clinical practice.

Low back pain: clinical practice guidelines — ICF impairment-based classification and acuity criteria are outlined, naming categories "low back pain with mobility deficits", "low back pain with movement coordination impairments", "low back pain with related lower extremity pain", "low back pain with radiating pain", and "low back pain with related generalized pain", and adding the patient's level of acuity defined by "(1) time since onset of symptoms and (2) movement/pain relations". Traditional time frames are specified as "acute (less than 1 month), subacute (between 2 and 3 months), and chronic (greater than 3 months)", and for patients "who have had low back pain for more than 3 months and/or… recurring low back pain", the guidelines "promote categorizing acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain based on movement/pain relations rather than solely using time since the patient's initial onset of low back pain". Movement/pain relations are described as "commonly used in physical therapy for classifying patients into treatment categories that respond best to matched intervention strategies" and to "guide dosing of manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, and patient education interventions", with dosing "consistent with the concept of tissue irritability" to guide "treatment frequency, intensity, duration, and type".

### Evaluation and treatment of low back pain: an evidence-based approach to clinical care [^116sAwsZ]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

Low back pain is a common reason for patient visits to a health care provider. For most patients, low back symptoms are nonspecific, meaning that the pain is localized to the back or buttocks and is due to a presumed musculoligamentous process. For patients with radicular leg symptoms, a precise etiology is more commonly identified. The history and physical examination usually provide clues to the uncommon but potentially serious causes of low back pain, as well as to those patients at risk for prolonged recovery. Diagnostic testing should not be a routine part of the initial evaluation, but used selectively based upon the history, examination, and initial treatment response. For patients without significant neurological impairment, initial treatments should include activity modification, nonnarcotic analgesics, and education. For patients whose symptoms are not improving over 2 to 4 weeks, referral for physical treatments is appropriate. A variety of therapeutic options of limited or unproven benefit are available for patients with radicular leg symptoms or chronic low back pain. Patients with radicular pain and little or no neurological findings should receive conservative treatment, but elective surgery is appropriate for those with nerve root compression who are unresponsive to conservative therapy.

### Predicting outcome in acute low back pain using different models of patient profiling [^112QL1Gx]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective observational study of prognostic indicators, using data from a randomized, controlled trial of physiotherapy care of acute low back pain (ALBP) with follow-up at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.

Objective

To evaluate which patient profile offers the most useful guide to long-term outcome in ALBP.

Summary Of Background Data

The evidence used to inform prognostic decision-making is derived largely from studies where baseline data are used to predict future status. Clinicians often see patients on multiple occasions so may profile patients in a variety of ways. It is worth considering if better prognostic decisions can be made from alternative profiles.

Methods

Clinical, psychological, and demographic data were collected from a sample of 54 ALBP patients. Three clinical profiles were developed from information collected at baseline, information collected at 6 weeks, and the change in status between these 2 time points. A series of regression models were used to determine the independent and relative contributions of these profiles to the prediction of chronic pain and disability.

Results

The baseline profile predicted long-term pain only. The 6-week profile predicted both long-term pain and disability. The change profile only predicted long-term disability (P < 0.01). When predicting long-term pain, after the baseline profile had been added to the model, the 6-week profile did not add significantly when forced in at the second step (P > 0.05). A similar result was obtained when the order of entry was reversed. When predicting long-term disability, after the 6-week profile was entered at the first step, the change profile was not significant when forced in at the second step. However, when the change profile was entered at the first step and the 6-week clinical profile was forced in at the second step, a significant contribution of the 6-week profile was found.

Conclusion

The profile derived from information collected at 6 weeks provided the best guide to long-term pain and disability. The baseline profile and change in status offered less predictive value.

### Triage for nonspecific lower-back pain [^112QNZGQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Unremitting lower-back pain has long been a costly and personally devastating problem in society. Guidelines for the treatment of lower-back pain have provided evidence-based recommendations to help identify patients who will benefit from specific types of treatment in an effort to reduce costs and human suffering. However, there is little evidence that these guidelines are being applied in the daily practice of health care providers. Practical information is required to assist health care providers in triaging patients for specific treatments so that interventions can be targeted only to those who need them. In this way, iatrogenic complications and unnecessary costs can be contained. This chapter provides information on how to triage the patient with nonspecific lower-back pain for optimal care. The recommendations are supported by evidence-based guidelines, and when these are not available, best practice principles. Because appropriate treatment varies depending on the length of time a patient is suffering from lower-back pain, the chapter is divided into recommendations for acute, subacute, chronic and recurrent phases of lower-back pain.

Level Of Evidence

### Do we really apply evidence-based-recommendations to spine surgery? Results of an international survey [^116t8smW]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Years of medical practice

The participants were divided into five groups based on years of medical practice (Currently Training, 0–5, 6–10, 11–15, > 15 years). Cross-table analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the participants' understanding of EBM, their definitions, and their understanding of various concepts related to it, such as validity, randomization, and double-blind, based on the years of medical practice (p > 0.05 for all cases). The majority of participants (64–73.2%) have stated that they understand EBM and use it in their practice, and this rate has stayed chiefly the same according to the years of medical practice. Also, most participants (64–75.7%) have indicated that the best definition of "evidence-based medicine" is "combining personal clinical experience with the best evidence derived from medical, scientific research", and again, this rate has not significantly changed according to the years of medical practice.

A chi-square test was performed for each category's decisions in various spinal pathologies. In the question "In patients where no guideline or scoring system is used, what is your decision mostly based on?", "Social media collaboration with colleagues" showed significant variance with a p -value below 0.001. Currently Training and the 11–15 years of experience group had a higher rate of social media collaboration. It can be interesting to note that more experienced practitioners (15 + years of medical practice) frequently adhere to guidelines or scoring systems and more regularly base their decisions on personal experience rather than on social media collaboration.

Similarly, for the question "In a patient applying to your clinic with severe low back pain that has affected their quality of life with no red-flag signs detected during examination, what is your FIRST step?", the responses varied significantly with a p -value of 0.026. The Currently Training group opted for X-ray/CT, whereas the advanced years of medical practice groups tended to obtain MRI. "Do you believe the choice of surgical approach improves clinical outcomes in patients with thoracic and lumbar fractures?" also showed significant differences among the responses with a p -value of 0.036. While the training group mostly responded as Always, with advancing years, this trend shifted towards Sometimes. In other questions, no significant variation was observed despite differences in percentage values across different years of practice.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^115bLZws]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 4
Seated slump test: 1) While seated, the patient is instructed to place her hands behind her back and then slump into cervical, thoracic, and lumbar flexion; 2) The examiner then extends the knee and dorsiflexes the ankle of the affected leg (A); 3) The test is positive if the patient's typical pain is reproduced with this maneuver and is subsequently relieved with neck extension (B).

For lumbar disc herniations, the seated slump test has a sensitivity of 0.84 and specificity of 0.83, which is overall superior to the straight leg raise test (sensitivity of 0.52 and specificity of 0.89). The predictive value of the seated slump test for lumbar radicular pain is not ideal. In patients with a negative seated slump test but high clinical suspicion for radicular pain, conservative management can be pursued despite the negative test. Additionally, the patient can be referred to a non-operative musculoskeletal specialist for further evaluation. Of note, thorough discussion of the femoral nerve stretch test is beyond the scope of this article, but this test has also been shown to have a high likelihood ratio for mid-lumbar nerve root impingement.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^114H8MP2]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For radicular pain, whether from radiculitis or radiculopathy, we only recommend a short course of oral corticosteroids (such as a 6-day methylprednisolone taper) if a patient has incapacitating pain interfering with functioning and/or engaging in physical therapy. For lumbar disc herniation, oral corticosteroids have been shown to offer only modest improvement in function and have not been proven to reduce pain. In older adults, the systemic side effects are often limiting and should not be prescribed without carefully considering the risks and benefits and involving the patient and/or caregiver in the decision-making process.

Another treatment option for patients with incapacitating pain limiting function is fluoroscopically-guided epidural corticosteroid injections. Full discussion of the indications and expected efficacy of these injections is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is important to appreciate that these injections must be utilized thoughtfully because in an improperly selected older patient, there is a risk for significant side effects from the procedure itself and from epidural corticosteroid administration, potentially without a high likelihood for clinical improvement. Based on a modified Delphi method, our expert panel believes that best practice is for primary care clinicians who are considering the use of an injection to first refer the patient to a non-operative musculoskeletal specialist (such as a physiatrist, anesthesia pain physician, or sports medicine physician), prior to ordering the injection, in order to evaluate for proper patient selection.

Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS)

LSS is another common condition in older adults and can cause positional-dependent nerve root irritation due to degenerative changes resulting in narrowing of the spinal canal. The most common presenting symptom of LSS is progressive pain down the leg with continued walking that improves with sitting. In a study by Kalichman et al. up to 20% of 60–69-year-olds had CT-evidence of LSS, and while not everyone with the finding was symptomatic, people with imaging-diagnosed LSS were over three times more likely to have LBP. When symptomatic, 42% of patients with LSS present with lateral thigh pain. The diagnosis of LSS is important to consider when older adults present with lateral hip or thigh pain that improves by functionally increasing the spinal canal area with lumbar flexion. Management of LSS is discussed in Part VI of this series.

### Low back pain investigations and prognosis: a review [^116pcDrz]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Low back pain is reviewed in terms of when investigations are useful and its clinical course. Despite the extensive evaluation of the accuracy of investigations such as radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and myelography, there is a surprising dearth of research to inform their use in primary care. There is no clear evidence on which to base judgments for selection of appropriate tests to confirm or exclude low back pain pathology. It appears that investigations are rarely necessary for low back pain. Specific investigations should be ordered to identify a particular pathology but should not be ordered routinely for general screening. In the absence of pathology, low back pain and its associated disability improve rapidly in the first weeks after onset, but, in contradiction to all guidelines, both commonly persist and the best evidence suggests that recurrences are common.

Acute low back pain is a common reason for patient calls or visits to a primary care clinician. Despite a large differential diagnosis, the precise etiology is rarely identified, although musculoligamentous processes are usually suspected. For most patients, back symptoms are nonspecific, meaning that there is no evidence for radicular symptoms or underlying systemic disease. Because episodes of acute, nonspecific low back pain are usually self-limited, many patients treat themselves without contacting their primary care clinician. When patients do call or schedule a visit, evaluation and management by primary care clinicians is appropriate. The history and physical examination usually provide clues to the rare but potentially serious causes of low back pain, as well as to identify patients at risk for prolonged recovery. Diagnostic testing, including plain x-rays, is often unnecessary during the initial evaluation. For patients with acute, nonspecific low back pain, the primary emphasis of treatment should be conservative care, time, reassurance, and education. Current recommendations focus on activity as tolerated (though not active exercise while pain is severe) and minimal if any bed rest. Referral for physical treatments is most appropriate for patients whose symptoms are not improving over 2 to 4 weeks. Specialty referral should be considered for patients with a progressive neurologic deficit, failure of conservative therapy, or an uncertain or serious diagnosis. The prognosis for most patients is good, although recurrence is common. Thus, educating patients about the natural history of acute low back pain and how to prevent future episodes can help ensure reasonable expectations.

'Red Flags' Requiring Diagnostic Imaging In a study 7 of the use of imaging tests in the evaluation of low back pain among internists and family physicians, the average use rates were 16 percent for radiography, 5 percent for computed tomography, and 1 percent for magnetic resonance imaging. More importantly, there were wide ranges among physicians: 2 to 48 percent for radiography; zero to 30 percent for CT, and zero to 9 percent for MRI.
7. |Recent onset of bladder dysfunction Severe or progressive neurologic deficit in lower extremity| Patients who have experienced recent trauma should be considered for radiographic evaluation. Imaging studies are used to evaluate the extent of osseous, ligamentous, neural, and soft tissue injuries. The initial imaging study should be cost-effective and expeditious, and maintain a minimal diagnostic error rate. For these reasons, a radiographic series may be the most appropriate screening examination.

The initial radiographic series should be followed with MRI and/or CT if results of the screening examination or the physical examination are abnormal. In cases of neurologic deficit, CT and/or MRI scans should be obtained to depict the spinal cord and surrounding tissue. The superiority of CT in capturing details of osseous structures allows for thorough assessment of fractures. The degree of spondylolisthesis is categorized as grade 1 through grade 4, based on that position. If the lumbar vertebra is completely anterior to the sacral base, spondylolisthesis has occurred. Oblique views with the radiograph tube angled at 45 degrees improve visualization of the neural foramina and pars interarticularis and are used to confirm suspicions generated from the initial imaging assessment. Oblique views are used to show tumors, facet hypertrophy, and spondylosis or spondylolisthesis.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI has emerged as the procedure of choice for diagnostic imaging of neurologic structures related to low back pain. Although a significant variation can exist in the quality of lumbar spine MRI images as a function of the imaging center and the image interpreter, 20 MRI is better than CT in showing the relationship of the disc to the nerve, and at locating soft tissue and nonbony structures. For this reason, it is better than CT at detecting early osteomyelitis, discitis, and epidural-type infections or hematomas.

### Interventional therapies, surgery, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain: an evidence-based clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society [^1144ayFA]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Clinical practice guideline.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations on use of interventional diagnostic tests and therapies, surgeries, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain of any duration, with or without leg pain.

Summary Of Background Data

Management of patients with persistent and disabling low back pain remains a clinical challenge. A number of interventional diagnostic tests and therapies and surgery are available and their use is increasing, but in some cases their utility remains uncertain or controversial. Interdisciplinary rehabilitation has also been proposed as a potentially effective noninvasive intervention for persistent and disabling low back pain.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel was convened by the American Pain Society. Its recommendations were based on a systematic review that focused on evidence from randomized controlled trials. Recommendations were graded using methods adapted from the US Preventive Services Task Force and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group.

Results

Investigators reviewed 3348 abstracts. A total of 161 randomized trials were deemed relevant to the recommendations in this guideline. The panel developed a total of 8 recommendations.

Conclusion

Recommendations on use of interventional diagnostic tests and therapies, surgery, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation are presented. Due to important trade-offs between potential benefits, harms, costs, and burdens of alternative therapies, shared decision-making is an important component of a number of the recommendations.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^113Kh1PP]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

The evaluation of lateral hip and thigh pain in an older adult can be challenging. Potential etiologies include local and referred causes, and clinicians must consider a myriad of lumbopelvic and hip conditions such as GTPS, ITBS, hip OA, lumbar radicular pain, and LSS. Identifying a patient's true pain generator(s) enables initiation of proper treatment and avoidance of unnecessary treatments and their potential adverse effects. Therefore, if a patient is not responding adequately to the conservative measures described in the algorithm, we recommend considering referral to a non-operative musculoskeletal specialist, who has expertise in evaluating the entire lumbopelvic region. We do not recommend prescribing opioids before the patient has completed a trial of conservative management and has been evaluated by a specialist as these medications often place the patient at risk of adverse drug reactions. These side effects may be avoided if the underlying etiology of the pain is addressed.

### Best practice guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of vertebrogenic pain with basivertebral nerve ablation from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^117PGJjg]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Algorithmic Approach to Vertebrogenic Pain with BVN Ablation

The diagnosis of vertebrogenic low back pain is based on history, physical examination, and imaging. Because low back pain is multifactorial, it is important to have an algorithmic approach to identify the right patient for the right therapy (Figure 16). Most therapy failures are a result of poor patient selection and not the therapy itself. In general, the etiology of low back pain can be anatomically characterized as primarily generating from the anterior, middle, or posterior column. Because the fulcrum of the spine is the posterior third of the vertebral column, pain generators that are worse with extension are posterior to this line, whereas pain generators worse with flexion are anterior to this line.

Figure 16
Schematic diagram outlining the algorithmic approach to BVN ablation.

Initial patient evaluation involves identifying anterior column pain, which commonly manifests as pain with sitting, driving, lifting, tying shoelaces, and/or putting on socks. Patients often cannot tolerate remaining in one position for too long and find themselves frequently shifting positions or standing rather than sitting. Such positional triggers can be picked up on the intake form or during the history portion of the exam.

Physical examination generally is used to exclude other pain generators. The physical examination of the patient with vertebrogenic pain may include patients with midline pain, pain with sustained hip flexion, and increased pain with flexion with loading.

Imaging is the third step in identifying a patient with vertebrogenic pain. Identifying Modic 1 or 2 changes on MRI from L3-S1 in these patients supports the diagnosis of vertebrogenic pain. Patients need not have pan-endplate Modic changes to qualify. For patients who cannot obtain MRI, other imaging modalities may support degenerative endplate changes even when Modic cannot be specifically identified.

Anterior column pain generators include discogenic, vertebrogenic, and vertebral compression fracture pain. While these are three distinct pathologies, the nociceptive pathways among these pain generators are likely similar and involve the basivertebral nerve, sinuvertebral nerve, and sympathetic fibers, to varying degrees. It is important to note, however, that there exists a debate concerning the similarities and differences between discogenic and vertebrogenic pain. The majority of the evidence at this time suggests that the two pathologies exists on a continuum that may start with discogenic pain and evolve into vertebrogenic pain.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^114GnoGL]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) clinical evaluation — history, physical examination, and red flags: No quality studies assess the utility and/or components of a history and physical examination; nevertheless, the Panel's consensus recommendation is that a careful history and physical examination is naturally important for appropriate evaluation and diagnosis. The initial assessment of LBP has a unique emphasis on 'ruling out' serious underlying conditions, and this process primarily relies upon the identification of red flags that in employed populations include trauma, history of cancer, immunosuppression, progressive neurological deficit, renal colic, and history of urinary tract infections. The absence of red flags and conditions generally rules out the need for specialist studies, referral, or inpatient care during the first 4 to 6 weeks. A comprehensive evaluation and documentation include history, prior treatment, vocation and avocational activities, functional level, medical and family history, social history including substance(s) use, review of systems, laboratory testing, and imaging studies. Evaluation using repeated end-range testing while monitoring for patterns of pain response determines the presence or absence of directional preference and pain centralization.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^1137KXHe]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Randomized and observational evidence on x-ray referral in LBP without red flags — one Level II study shows that in the absence of red flags, x-rays do not provide additional benefit at initial consultation. Across 94 general practices, over the course of 26 months, patients with LBP aged 16–64 years were allocated to a RCT (n = 153) or an observational arm (n = 506); the RCT randomized to immediate x-ray referral (n = 73) or no immediate x-ray referral (control) (n = 80). Outcomes were assessed at enrollment, 6 weeks and one year, with response rate at one year 67%. In the RCT there were no differences in physical functioning, pain, or disability compared to control, but the immediate radiography group scored higher on psychological wellbeing at 6 weeks and one year. In the observational arm, after adjusting for length of back pain episode at presentation, there were no differences in physical outcomes, and those referred for x-ray had lower depression scores at six weeks and one year. The work group downgraded this potential Level I study due to poor follow-up, significant crossover and potential bias, and this study provides Level II evidence that, in the absence of red flags, x-ray does not provide additional benefit at initial consultation.

Low back pain — prognostic markers for progression to chronicity and delayed recovery are described, with Level I evidence that prior back disability, high scores on disability questionnaire, temporary disability status and SF-36 general health measure were strong determinants of conversion of acute to chronic pain. In an inception cohort, patients who initially presented to primary care with acute (< 2 weeks) low back pain (LBP) that transitioned to chronic (> 3 months) LBP were included (n = 406), with telephone interviews at onset of chronic LBP and after 9 and 12 months and complete recovery defined as pain free, no disability, and return to work for 30 consecutive days; delayed recovery was associated with previous sick leave due to low LBP, high disability levels or pain intensity at onset of chronic LBP, low levels of education, greater perceived risk of persistent pain and birthplace outside of Australia. Level IV evidence identified risk factors for developing chronic symptoms including lower education; workers compensation claims; increased disability at acute presentation; previous sick leave for LBP; feelings of depression, tension or anxiety; high pain intensity; morning back stiffness and perception of having a high risk of persistent pain.

What you need to know

Less than 5–10% of all low back pain is due to a specific underlying spinal pathology
The remaining 90–95% has no indication of a serious cause and should be managed with conservative treatments such as advice and reassurance, exercise, physical therapy, chiropractic care, cognitive-behavioural therapy, or pain management
Diagnostic triage based on clinical history and examination can help distinguish between non-specific or more serious low back pain
Imaging may do more harm than good when serious conditions are not suspected and is likely to prolong recovery in patients with non-specific low back pain
Patients' primary concerns of whether their pain is caused by something serious and what they should do to aid recovery can be addressed by sound education and reassurance, without the need for imaging

RECOMMENDATION 1: Clinicians should conduct a focused history and physical examination to help place patients with low back pain into 1 of 3 broad categories: nonspecific low back pain, back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, or back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause. The history should include assessment of psychosocial risk factors, which predict risk for chronic disabling back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging or other diagnostic tests in patients with nonspecific low back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: Clinicians should perform diagnostic imaging and testing for patients with low back pain when severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or when serious underlying conditions are suspected on the basis of history and physical examination (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 4: Clinicians should evaluate patients with persistent low back pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis with magnetic resonance imaging (preferred) or computed tomography only if they are potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injection (for suspected radiculopathy) (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 5: Clinicians should provide patients with evidence-based information on low back pain with regard to their expected course, advise patients to remain active, and provide information about effective self-care options (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 6: For patients with low back pain, clinicians should consider the use of medications with proven benefits in conjunction with back care information and self-care. Clinicians should assess severity of baseline pain and functional deficits, potential benefits, risks, and relative lack of long-term efficacy and safety data before initiating therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For most patients, first-line medication options are acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RECOMMENDATION 7: For patients who do not improve with self-care options, clinicians should consider the addition of nonpharmacologic therapy with proven benefits-for acute low back pain, spinal manipulation; for chronic or subacute low back pain, intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or progressive relaxation (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Stepped care for back pain: activating approaches for primary care [^115qXmqY]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Interventions that encourage return to normal function and reduce fear of physical activity have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with back pain, but routine medical care for back pain often does not provide such interventions. This paper proposes a stepped-care approach that addresses the functional outcomes of back pain. Step 1, which is relevant to most patients, addresses the common fears of patients with back pain and encourages patients to resume normal activities. Step 2, which targets the substantial minority of patients who require more than simple advice to resume activities, provides brief, structured interventions that support physical exercise and return to normal activities. Step 3 targets patients who require more intensive interventions, including treatment of psychological illness when present, before they can return to normal activities in work and family life. Patient needs relevant to these three levels of care are delineated. This stepped-care approach provides a framework for sequencing progressively more intensive interventions and coordinating the efforts of primary care physicians, allied health professionals, behavioral health clinicians, and patients to improve functional outcomes in patients with back pain.
