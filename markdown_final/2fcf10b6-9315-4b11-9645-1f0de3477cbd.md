## Question

what is a subsolid nodule

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a subsolid nodule is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the base definition of a pulmonary nodule and its size threshold. Then, I should verify the CT attenuation characteristics that make a nodule "subsolid" versus "solid". Next, I will define the two subtypes (pure ground-glass and part-solid) and ensure the terminology aligns with major guidelines. After that, I should integrate key clinical and biological implications, including adenocarcinoma spectrum and risk, and clarify growth assessment. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, integrated definition that is guideline-concordant and reference-supported.

> Let me first confirm the foundational concept: a pulmonary nodule is a focal, rounded lung parenchymal opacity measuring less than 3 cm in diameter; lesions larger than this are termed masses, so I need to keep that threshold in mind as I frame the definition of subsolid nodules.

> Now, I need to check the core radiographic appearance that makes a nodule "subsolid". The key feature is ground-glass attenuation — hazy increased opacity that does not completely obscure underlying structures like vessels and bronchi — distinguishing it from a solid nodule, which fully effaces the internal architecture on CT; let me verify that this language matches guideline wording to avoid ambiguity.

> Next, I will define the two subtypes, but wait, let me verify the standard dichotomy. Although some sources mention "semi-consolidated" patterns, the prevailing, guideline-based classification is: (1) pure ground-glass (nonsolid) nodules, with no solid component at all, and (2) part-solid nodules, which contain both ground-glass and a solid component that obscures the underlying lung architecture; I should confirm the visibility criterion and the requirement that the solid portion be truly opaque on lung windows.

> Hold on, I should verify how growth and measurement are defined for subsolid nodules because this influences both classification over time and management thresholds. Consensus recommendations define growth for subsolid nodules as an absolute increase in mean nodule or solid-component diameter greater than 1.5 mm, and the appearance or enlargement of a solid component is particularly meaningful; semiautomated tools can assist in detecting and quantifying small solid components, but thresholds vary and should be interpreted in context [^113tLC4Y] [^111trTXJ] [^114ubfD3].

> Let me consider the clinical and biological implications so I do not understate risk. Compared with solid nodules, subsolid nodules have a higher likelihood of malignancy but often grow more slowly and correlate strongly with the adenocarcinoma spectrum, including atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, and invasive adenocarcinoma; the size of the solid component correlates with invasiveness and prognosis, but wait, I should double-check that morphology such as spiculation and pleural retraction increases the likelihood of invasive disease, which it does [^114Vh1y6] [^1122zWTN] [^113zZ6Pq] [^116NsGBW].

> But wait, what if the subsolid nodule is transient? I should confirm that many subsolid nodules — especially new ones — can be infectious or inflammatory and resolve on short-interval follow-up, whereas persistence raises concern for neoplasia; early screening cohorts and subsequent studies consistently report a substantial fraction of new subsolid nodules resolving, which supports the distinction between transient inflammatory lesions and persistent lesions more suggestive of the adenocarcinoma pathway [^116u59VN] [^112MAVaq].

> I need to ensure terminology is crisp. "Nonsolid nodule" is synonymous with a pure ground-glass nodule with no solid component; the "solid component" within a part-solid nodule is the region of complete opacification that obscures underlying structures; and "ground-glass opacity" refers to the hazy, partially translucent attenuation in which underlying vessels or bronchi remain visible; let me verify that this aligns with Fleischner and AATS language to avoid misclassification.

> Final integrated definition: A subsolid nodule is a focal pulmonary opacity less than 3 cm in diameter on CT that shows ground-glass attenuation through which underlying vessels and bronchial walls remain visible; subsolid nodules are categorized as either pure ground-glass (nonsolid) nodules, which have no solid component, or part-solid nodules, which contain both ground-glass and a solid component that fully obscures underlying structures; this morphology is closely linked to the lung adenocarcinoma spectrum, carries higher malignancy risk but typically slower growth than solid nodules, and requires attention to the presence and size of any solid component on serial imaging for risk stratification and management decisions [^1115aCvt] [^1115yYZA] [^112B4tW9] [^113zZ6Pq] [^114Vh1y6].

A subsolid nodule is a **CT-identified focal ground-glass opacity** [^1142A5f1] with variable solid components, in which underlying pulmonary vessels or bronchial structures remain visible [^1122zWTN]. Subsolid nodules are categorized as either **nonsolid (pure ground-glass)** [^112B4tW9] or **part-solid** (both ground-glass and solid components) [^112fLWzu]. They are clinically significant because they often represent early-stage lung adenocarcinoma [^114Vh1y6] and **require prolonged surveillance** [^1115yYZA] given their indolent yet potentially progressive course [^114h7NXY].

---

## Radiological characteristics

- **Ground-glass opacity (GGO)**: A hazy area of increased lung attenuation on CT [^1142A5f1] that does not obscure underlying bronchial or vascular structures [^1122zWTN].

- **Solid component**: A denser area within the nodule that obscures underlying structures [^112B4tW9], indicating a higher likelihood of invasive malignancy [^113zZ6Pq].

- **Size**: Typically less than 3 cm in diameter [^1142A5f1], although larger lesions can occur [^112fLWzu].

- **Margins**: Often ill-defined [^112B4tW9] or irregular, particularly in part-solid nodules [^116NsGBW].

---

## Clinical significance

Subsolid nodules are clinically significant because they are associated with **early-stage lung adenocarcinoma** [^114Vh1y6], particularly adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) [^1122zWTN]. They carry a **higher malignancy risk** than solid nodules [^114Vh1y6] but generally grow more slowly and have longer doubling times [^112fLWzu].

---

## Management guidelines

Management of subsolid nodules is guided by their **size, composition, and growth characteristics** [^1115yYZA]. The Fleischner Society and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) [^116ETWxB] recommend the following:

| **Nodule type** | **Size** | **Initial follow-up** | **Subsequent follow-up** | **Intervention** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Pure ground-glass | < 6 mm | No routine follow-up [^116NyWcY] | None | None |
| Pure ground-glass | ≥ 6 mm | 6–12 months [^1115yYZA] | Every 2 years until 5 years [^1115yYZA] | None unless growth or solid component develops [^116ETWxB] |
| Part-solid | < 6 mm | No routine follow-up [^116NyWcY] | None | None |
| Part-solid | ≥ 6 mm | 3–6 months [^1115yYZA] | Annual CT for at least 5 years [^1115yYZA] | Biopsy or resection if solid component ≥ 8 mm or growth occurs |

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of subsolid nodules depends on their composition and growth characteristics [^112MAVaq]. Pure ground-glass nodules generally have a **favorable prognosis**, with low malignancy rates and slow growth [^112fLWzu]. In contrast, part-solid nodules — especially those with larger solid components — have a **higher risk of malignancy** [^114Vh1y6] and may require surgical intervention [^116GvpXE].

---

## Conclusion

Subsolid nodules are focal lung lesions characterized by ground-glass opacity with or without a solid component [^114h7NXY]. Because of their association with early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, they **require careful management and prolonged surveillance** [^1115yYZA].

### Evaluation of the solitary pulmonary nodule: Size matters, but do not ignore the power of morphology [^116NsGBW]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Assessing the likelihood of malignancy in pulmonary nodules remains a challenging task. Morphological assessment is only one part of the diagnostic puzzle, but its role should not be underestimated. A smooth border, a triangular or polygonal shape with perifissural location, and fat and popcorn calcifications indicate a benign nature.

Features that suggest a malignant nature include a persistent subsolid morphology, spiculation, lobulation, and pleural retraction. More complex findings, such as bronchial abnormalities, bubble-like lucencies, an associated cystic airspace, and a vascular convergence sign, are also indicative of a high likelihood of malignancy. In subsolid nodules, spiculation, lobulation, and pleural retraction are indicative of an invasive adenocarcinoma rather than a preinvasive lesion.

### Detection and quantification of the solid component in pulmonary subsolid nodules by semiautomatic segmentation [^114ubfD3]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

To determine whether semiautomatic volumetric software can differentiate part-solid from nonsolid pulmonary nodules and aid quantification of the solid component, 115 nodules were differentiated into nonsolid and part-solid by two radiologists; disagreements were adjudicated by a third radiologist. The diameters of solid components were measured manually. Semiautomatic volumetric measurements were used to identify and quantify a possible solid component, using different Hounsfield unit (HU) thresholds. The measurements were compared with the reference standard and manual measurements.

The reference standard detected a solid component in 86 nodules. The diagnosis of a solid component by semiautomatic software depended on the threshold chosen. A threshold of -300 HU resulted in the detection of a solid component in 75 nodules with good sensitivity (90%) and specificity (88%). At a threshold of -130 HU, semiautomatic measurements of the diameter of the solid component (mean 2.4 mm, SD 2.7 mm) were comparable to manual measurements at the mediastinal window setting (mean 2.3 mm, SD 2.5 mm) [p = 0.63].

Semiautomatic segmentation of subsolid nodules could diagnose part-solid nodules and quantify the solid component similar to human observers. Performance depends on the attenuation segmentation thresholds. This method may prove useful in managing subsolid nodules.

- **Key points**: Semiautomatic segmentation can accurately differentiate nonsolid from part-solid pulmonary nodules. Semiautomatic segmentation can quantify…

### Lung cancer probability and clinical outcomes of baseline and new subsolid nodules detected on low-dose CT screening [^113juvHm]. Thorax (2021). Low credibility.

According to guidelines, the management of subsolid nodules is mainly based on nodule type, size, and growth, and is not additionally weighted by smoking status or age. Limited information is available on the incidence and lung cancer probability of baseline and new subsolid nodules. Moreover, it remains unknown whether screening guidelines are applicable in Asian populations, since the incidence and characteristics of subsolid nodules seem to differ according to race and regions. Currently, in most guidelines, no differentiation is made between the management of baseline and new subsolid nodules. In Lung-RADS, the management of subsolid nodules detected at baseline or follow-up is distinguished, recommending more aggressive follow-up or diagnostic evaluation for new subsolid nodules.

In the I-ELCAP study, nearly 70% of new subsolid nodules resolved or decreased in size at follow-up, and 3.8% of new subsolid nodules (compared with 2.9% of baseline subsolid nodules) were finally diagnosed as lung cancer. The NELSON trial reported a markedly lower incidence of screen-detected subsolid nodules and only three cases of lung cancer diagnosed from new subsolid nodules. Although similar trends were found in the high likelihood of resolution in new subsolid nodules, the probability of lung cancer in new subsolid nodules (6%) was relatively high. In our study, 30.0% of baseline subsolid nodules and 78.9% of new subsolid nodules among those who underwent additional follow-up disappeared or decreased in size. Moreover, 7.1% of baseline subsolid nodules and 2.5% of new subsolid nodules were diagnosed as lung cancer.

### Single-cell characterization of pulmonary nodules implicates suppression of immunosurveillance across early stages of lung adenocarcinoma [^1115aCvt]. Cancer Research (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary nodules, identified as either solid or subsolid, are focal opacifications smaller than 3 cm and are commonly detected on CT of the chest. Radiographically, subsolid nodules are further categorized as either pure ground-glass (focal hazy opacifications in which underlying lung structures, such as vessels, remain visible), semi-consolidated (dense ground-glass), or part-solid nodules. Histologically, persistent or enlarging subsolid nodules often represent the early spectrum of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), which includes premalignant atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), preinvasive ADC in situ (AIS), and minimally invasive ADC (MIA). Although some subsolid nodules remain stable for many years, others progress to become invasive lung ADC. This unpredictable clinical trajectory of subsolid nodules, combined with our poor understanding of the pathogenesis of disease at this stage, leads to uncertainty in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. A better understanding of the early molecular, cellular, and immunological properties that fuel progression would enable cancer interception at the earliest stages of disease.

Recent studies have begun interrogating the molecular and cellular characteristics of the early-spectrum lung cancer. Our recent study evaluating the lung cancer continuum, using whole-exome sequencing and IHC of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens, demonstrated that persistent progression-associated putative tumor neoantigens correlated with T-cell infiltration and PD-L1 upregulation, suggesting potential immune recognition.

### Lung cancer probability and clinical outcomes of baseline and new subsolid nodules detected on low-dose CT screening [^111i5KBC]. Thorax (2021). Low credibility.

This study was designed as a single-centre, retrospective cohort study of participants aged ≥ 18 years who voluntarily underwent LDCT screening for lung cancer between May 2003 and June 2019 at the Health Promotion Centre of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, a tertiary centre in South Korea. All participants underwent LDCT screening as part of their health checkups and were asymptomatic at the time of baseline screening. Questionnaires were used to evaluate the smoking status (never-smoker, ex-smoker, or current-smoker) and the amount of smoking in pack-years. Never-smokers were defined as participants who had never smoked or had smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Participants with unknown smoking history at the time of the first LDCT screening were excluded; however, participants with data on smoking status but without the amount of smoking were included.

Participants with positive nodules, defined as any non-calcified nodule in which the longest diameter was at least 4 mm, were referred to the pulmonary division. Decisions regarding follow-up and pathological evaluations were made by the attending specialist in the pulmonary division. According to guidelines at the time, the decision to perform an invasive biopsy primarily depended on the radiological aspects of the nodule and was not additionally weighted by other demographic factors. The pathological diagnosis of a nodule was performed using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, percutaneous needle biopsy, or bronchoscopic biopsy.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pulmonary nodules, specifically with respect to follow-up imaging, the FS 2017 guidelines recommend deciding on management based on the most suspicious nodule in patients with multiple subsolid nodules with at least one nodule measuring ≥ 6 mm. It is important to consider infectious causes and multiple primary adenocarcinomas if nodules persist after 3–6 months.

### Fleischner recommendations for the management of subsolid pulmonary nodules: High awareness but limited conformance - a survey study [^117S85do]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess awareness and conformance to the Fleischner Society recommendations for the management of subsolid pulmonary nodules (SSN) in clinical practice. An online questionnaire with four imaging cases was sent to 1,579 associates from the European Respiratory Society and 757 from the European Society of Thoracic Imaging. Each respondent was asked to choose from several options which one they thought was the indicated management for the nodule presented. Awareness and conformance to the Fleischner recommendations (FR) were assessed and correlated to respondents' characteristics.

In total, 119 radiologists (response rate 16.0%) and 243 pulmonologists (response rate 16.5%) were included. Awareness of the FR was higher in radiologists than in pulmonologists (93% vs. 70%, p < 0.001), as was implementation in daily practice (66% vs. 47%, p < 0.001). Radiologists conformed to FR in rates of 31, 69, 68, and 82%, and pulmonologists in 12, 43, 70, and 75% for cases 1 to 4, respectively. Overmanagement was common. Conformance in SSN management was associated with awareness, working in an academic practice, larger practice size, teaching residents, and higher SSN exposure.

Although awareness of the Fleischner recommendations for SSN management is widespread, management choices in clinical practice show large heterogeneity.

- **Key points**:
	- Guideline awareness among clinicians is widespread, but conformance shows large heterogeneity.
	- Awareness and conformance is significantly higher among radiologists than pulmonologists.

### Fleischner recommendations for the management of subsolid pulmonary nodules: High awareness but limited conformance - a survey study [^116zzTS7]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The study utilized imaging cases in the questionnaire. Clockwise from the upper-left panel, Figure 1 illustrates a persistent pure ground-glass nodule (case 1), a new part-solid lesion with a small solid component (case 2), a persistent part-solid lesion with a larger solid component (case 3), and a triangular solid nodule (case 4).

First, recipients were asked whether they thought the presented nodule was a subsolid nodule. If so, they were to select the best medical practice from several management options:

- **Options included**: (a) nothing; (b) 4-week follow-up; (c) 3-month follow-up; (d) 6-month follow-up; (e) 24-month follow-up; (f) serial follow-up in 12, 24, and 36 months; (g) additional diagnostics (PET-CT, biopsy, etc); (h) resection of an almost certain malignancy; or (i) other. Respondents were limited to providing a single best answer.

Apart from the four imaging cases, the questionnaire also contained a variety of questions focused on the background and experience of the respondent (e.g. years of experience, type of hospital, practice size). Two slightly different questionnaires were designed for radiologists and pulmonologists, both of which are available in the online supplement.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pulmonary nodules, specifically with respect to follow-up imaging for subsolid nodules, the AATS 2024 guidelines recommend suspecting invasive adenocarcinoma in patients with subsolid nodules that are ≥ 8 mm in size. These include nodules with morphologic features such as lobulated or spiculated margins, a solid component ≥ 6 mm, air bronchograms, or adjacent pleural or vascular changes. It is advised to reduce the surveillance interval and/or perform tissue sampling versus resection based on patient factors.

### Fleischner recommendations for the management of subsolid pulmonary nodules: high awareness but limited conformance - a survey study [^115cko5h]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary nodules represent one of the most frequent incidental findings. Subsolid pulmonary nodules (SSNs) form a distinct subgroup of lung nodules, with different morphology and clinical behavior. Apart from density, the most striking differences are the higher malignancy rate and slower growth rate compared to solid pulmonary nodules. These characteristics lead to an excellent prognosis when treated early; however, they also pose the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. A growing understanding of the meaning of the SSN entity and its stepwise progression in the adenomatous spectrum has considerably increased SSN awareness over the last several years. Subsequently, both radiologists and clinicians are increasingly confronted with the dilemma of choosing the most adequate interpretation and management.

In 2013, the Fleischner Society published recommendations for the management of SSNs in daily practice, based on a careful review of the available scientific evidence and expert opinion. The need for such a directive is apparent from the fact that the report is listed in the online top ten most-viewed articles in Radiology. Such a fundamental document may help to align management in clinical practice, increase healthcare quality, and decrease unnecessary procedures. However, to achieve this, it is important that both radiologists and pulmonologists are not only familiar with the Fleischner recommendations (FR) but moreover, act accordingly. Two years after publication, it is unknown to which degree the FR are known and indeed applied in daily practice.

### Subsolid pulmonary nodules: Imaging evaluation and strategic management [^115KrSeX]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Given the higher rate of malignancy of subsolid pulmonary nodules and the considerably lower growth rate of ground-glass nodules (GGNs), dedicated standardized guidelines for management of these nodules have been proposed, including long-term low-dose computed tomography (CT) follow-up (≥ 3 years). Physicians must be familiar with the strategic management of subsolid pulmonary nodules and should be able to identify imaging features that suggest invasive adenocarcinoma requiring a more aggressive management.

Low-dose CT screening studies for early detection of lung cancer have increased our knowledge of pulmonary nodules, particularly our understanding of the strong, although imperfect, correlation of subsolid pulmonary nodules, including pure GGNs and part-solid nodules, with the spectrum of preinvasive to invasive lung adenocarcinoma. Serial CT imaging has shown stepwise progression in a subset of these nodules, characterized by an increase in size and density of pure GGNs and development of a solid component, the latter usually indicating invasive adenocarcinoma.

There is a close correlation between the CT features of subsolid nodules (SSNs) and the spectrum of lung adenocarcinoma. Standardized guidelines are suggested for the management of SSNs.

### Feasibility of sub-millisievert low-dose computed tomography with deep learning image reconstruction in evaluating pulmonary subsolid nodules: A prospective intra-individual comparison study [^113NJPUM]. Academic Radiology (2025). High credibility.

To comprehensively assess the feasibility of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) using deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) for evaluating pulmonary subsolid nodules, which are challenging due to their susceptibility to noise, the study employed both objective and subjective assessments.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients undergoing both standard-dose CT (SDCT) and LDCT between March and June 2023 were prospectively enrolled. LDCT images were reconstructed with high-strength DLIR (DLIR-H), medium-strength DLIR (DLIR-M), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-V level 50% (ASIR-V-50%), and filtered back projection (FBP). SDCT used FBP as the reference standard. Objective assessment included measures of image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Subjective assessment involved five-point scales evaluated by five radiologists. Detection and false-positive rates of subsolid nodules, as well as morphologic features of nodules, were recorded.

- **Results**: A total of 102 patients (mean age, 57.0 ± 12.3 years) with 358 subsolid nodules identified in SDCT were enrolled. The mean effective doses of SDCT and LDCT were 5.37 ± 0.80 mSv and 0.86 ± 0.14 mSv, respectively (P < 0.001). DLIR-H demonstrated the lowest noise levels, highest CNRs, SNRs, and subjective scores among LDCT groups (all P < 0.001), nearly attaining comparability with SDCT. The detection rates for DLIR-H, DLIR-M, ASIR-V-50%, and FBP were 76.5%, 76.3%, 83.8%, and 72.1%, respectively (P < 0.001), with false-positive rates of 2.5%, 2.2%, 8.3%, and 1.1%, respectively (P < 0.001). DLIR-H showed the highest detection rates for morphologic features, ranging from 79.4% to 95.2%.

### Patient characteristics associated with adherence to pulmonary nodule guidelines [^116rVuK9]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

While pulmonary nodule guidelines provide follow-up recommendations based on nodule size and malignancy risk, these are inconsistently followed in clinical practice. In this study, we sought to identify patient characteristics associated with guideline-concordant nodule follow-up.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with a pulmonary nodule between 2011 and 2014 at Boston Medical Center. Appropriate nodule follow-up evaluation was based upon the 2005 Fleischner Society Guidelines. In primary analysis, we compared patients with guideline-concordant follow-up to those with delayed or absent follow-up. In secondary analysis, we compared those with any follow-up to those without follow-up, as well as the rate of guideline-concordant follow-up in patients seen by a pulmonologist.

- **Results**: Of 3,916 patients diagnosed with a pulmonary nodule, 1,117 were included for analysis. Overall, 598 (53.5%) patients received guideline-concordant follow-up. Lower rates of guideline concordance were seen in patients of Hispanic ethnicity (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36–1.00), while higher rates were seen for nodules 7–8 mm (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.02–2.35) and nodules > 8 mm (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01–2.20). Having a history of COPD (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.26–2.43) and being seen by a pulmonologist (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.51–2.58) were also associated with guideline concordance. Among patients seen by a pulmonologist, 62.2% received guideline-concordant follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: Overall rates of pulmonary nodule follow-up are low. Patient ethnicity, COPD history, and nodule size are important factors influencing guideline adherence.

### Malignancy estimation of Lung-RADS criteria for subsolid nodules on CT: accuracy of low and high risk spectrum when using NLST nodules [^116bWqd3]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Quantification of the potential overestimation of category 4B SSNs was the other purpose of our study. This phenomenon actually has a larger impact on patient management since category 4B results in a more intense and potentially invasive work-up, including a "clinical chest CT, PET-CT, and/or tissue sampling depending on the probability of malignancy, comorbidities, and the radiologist's final decision".

Lung-RADS published an overall malignancy rate for all nodule types of > 15% for category 4B, which is in line with the malignancy rate of 23.9% we found in our analysis for SSNs. This indicates that from a statistical point of view, there is no overestimation. However, more importantly, one third (30.3%) of the benign 4B SSNs were transient as confirmed by follow-up. Although we conclude that the statistical malignancy risk of Lung-RADS 4B SSNs is in agreement with the Lung-RADS guidelines, our results represent a strong argument to include a short-term follow-up after three months to confirm persistency before considering more invasive management strategies, as also has been suggested by other guidelines.

- **Sentence case**: The NCCN suggests performing an LDCT in 3 months to check for growth when there is low suspicion of lung cancer in their highest risk group for part-solid nodules (> 8 mm lesion size). For nonsolid nodules, the BTS recommends a 3-month CT repeat in cases when there is no previous imaging to assess persistence, growth, or change in morphology. Similarly, the Fleischner Guidelines, designed for incidental nodule findings, recommend always…

### Subsolid pulmonary nodule morphology and associated patient characteristics in a routine clinical population [^111Thn4c]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

We present a descriptive paper on the subsolid pulmonary nodule in a routine clinical setting obtained in a single academic institution. As most available data originates from lung cancer screening or Asian study populations, we aimed to evaluate whether the knowledge on this relatively new entity is generalizable to other practices. Clinical data on SSN appearance and evolution over time may be of importance for an adapted and more personalized surveillance management in clinical subjects, where, for example, gender- or age-defined subgroups can be identified that require different follow-up intervals. In the study, we found that women more often show persistent lesions compared to men, and that part-solid SSNs are larger and more often progressive compared to pure GGNs. In our study, a part-solid nature was the single predictor of nodule growth over time.

Because of our retrospective study design and case selection based on the radiological reports, it is challenging to comment on the true incidence of SSNs in clinical practice. In this study, we found an incidence of 1.2% (121/10,271), which is in line with available literature. Nevertheless, highly variable incidence — up to 38% — is reported in the literature, depending on the study population. This high variability also applies to the proportion of transient versus persistent lesions. Beyond study design and possible selection bias, the inherent characteristics of a clinical population (e.g. immune status) can influence the incidence and nodule type distribution of SSNs. This should always be considered in clinical assessments.

### Lung cancer probability and clinical outcomes of baseline and new subsolid nodules detected on low-dose CT screening [^113qzLe5]. Thorax (2021). Low credibility.

Limited data are available regarding the management of subsolid nodules detected on lung cancer screening with low-dose CT (LDCT). We aimed to determine the characteristics of screen-detected subsolid nodules and evaluate the probability of lung cancer and the clinical course of subsolid nodules detected at baseline and during follow-up screening.

- **Methods**: We evaluated 50,132 asymptomatic adults (22,631 never-smokers and 27,501 ever-smokers) who underwent LDCT screening for lung cancer between May 2003 and June 2019 at a tertiary center in South Korea. The incidence, characteristics, and clinical outcomes of the baseline and new screen-detected subsolid nodules were determined.

- **Results**: A total of 6,725 subsolid nodules (5,116 pure ground glass opacity nodules and 1,609 part-solid nodules) were detected in 4,545 participants. There were 1,484 new subsolid nodules detected in 937 (1.9%) participants; the overall incidence of subsolid nodules was 10.7% in never-smokers and 7.7% in ever-smokers (p < 0.001). Among 4,918 subsolid nodules that underwent follow-up with CT scans (the mean number of CT scans, including the baseline LDCT scan, was 4.6), 2,116 nodules (30.0% of baseline subsolid nodules and 78.9% of new subsolid nodules) resolved spontaneously. Among 293 biopsied subsolid nodules, 227 (77.5%) nodules were diagnosed as lung cancer, of which 226 (99.6%) were adenocarcinomas. No significant difference was observed in pathological invasiveness or the initial stage between the baseline and new cancerous subsolid nodules.

Multivariable analyses revealed that new detection at follow-up.

### Lung cancer probability and clinical outcomes of baseline and new subsolid nodules detected on low-dose CT screening [^112MAVaq]. Thorax (2021). High credibility.

Limited data are available regarding the management of subsolid nodules detected on lung cancer screening with low-dose CT (LDCT). We aimed to determine the characteristics of screen-detected subsolid nodules and to evaluate the probability of lung cancer and the clinical course of subsolid nodules detected at baseline and during follow-up screening.

- **Methods**: We evaluated 50,132 asymptomatic adults (22,631 never-smokers and 27,501 ever-smokers) who underwent LDCT screening for lung cancer between May 2003 and June 2019 at a tertiary centre in South Korea.

- **Results**: A total of 6,725 subsolid nodules (5,116 pure ground glass opacity nodules and 1,609 part-solid nodules) were detected in 4,545 participants. There were 1,484 new subsolid nodules detected in 937 (1.9%) participants, with the overall incidence of subsolid nodules at 10.7% in never-smokers and 7.7% in ever-smokers (p < 0.001). Among 4,918 subsolid nodules that underwent follow-up with CT scans (the mean number of CT scans, including the baseline LDCT scan: 4.6), 2,116 nodules (30.0% of baseline subsolid nodules and 78.9% of new subsolid nodules) resolved spontaneously.

No significant difference was observed in pathological invasiveness or the initial stage between the baseline and new cancerous subsolid nodules. Multivariable analyses revealed that new detection at follow-up screening was associated with a higher risk of lung cancer.

### Interobserver variability in lung CT screening reporting and data system categorisation in subsolid nodule-enriched lung cancer screening CTS [^115yPQTa]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

To assess interobserver agreement in Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) categorisation in subsolid nodule-enriched low-dose screening CTs, a retrospective review of low-dose screening CT reports from 2013 to 2017 using keyword searches for subsolid nodules identified 54 baseline CT scans. With an additional 108 negative screening CT scans, a total of 162 CT scans were categorised according to the Lung-RADS by two fellowship-trained thoracic radiologists in consensus.

- **Categorisation process**: We randomly selected 20, 20, 10, and 10 scans from categories 1/2, 3, 4A, and 4B CT scans, respectively, to ensure balanced category representation. Five radiologists classified the 60 CT scans into Lung-RADS categories.

- **Concordance and discordance frequencies**: The frequencies of concordance and minor and major discordance were calculated, with major discordance defined as at least 6 months of management discrepancy. Cohen's κ statistics were used to analyse reader agreement.

An average of 60.3% (181 of 300) of all cases and 45.0% (90 of 200) of positive screens were correctly categorised. The minor and major discordance rates were 12.3% and 27.3% overall and 18.5% and 36.5% in positive screens, respectively. The concordance rate was significantly higher among experienced thoracic radiologists. Overall, the interobserver agreement was moderate (mean κ, 0.45; 95% confidence interval: 0.40–0.51). The proportion of part-solid risk-dominant nodules was significantly higher in cases with low rates of accurate categorisation.

### Evaluation of individuals with pulmonary nodules: When is it lung cancer? Diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116up4tD]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to update previous evidence-based recommendations for the evaluation and management of individuals with solid pulmonary nodules and to generate new recommendations for those with nonsolid nodules. We updated prior literature reviews, synthesized evidence, and formulated recommendations using methods described in the "Methodology for Development of Guidelines for Lung Cancer" in the American College of Chest Physicians Lung Cancer Guidelines, 3rd ed.

We formulated recommendations for evaluating solid pulmonary nodules that measure > 8 mm in diameter, solid nodules that measure ≤ 8 mm in diameter, and subsolid nodules. The recommendations stress the value of assessing the probability of malignancy, the utility of imaging tests, the need to weigh the benefits and harms of different management strategies (nonsurgical biopsy, surgical resection, and surveillance with chest CT imaging), and the importance of eliciting patient preferences.

Individuals with pulmonary nodules should be evaluated and managed by estimating the probability of malignancy, performing imaging tests to better characterize the lesions, evaluating the risks associated with various management alternatives, and eliciting their preferences for management.

### Malignancy estimation of Lung-RADS criteria for subsolid nodules on CT: Accuracy of low and high risk spectrum when using NLST nodules [^113zZ6Pq]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary subsolid nodules (SSNs) are distinctive from solid nodules with respect to CT morphology and underlying pathology. Within the group of SSNs, nonsolid (pure ground-glass) nodules are differentiated from part-solid nodules based on the presence of a solid component. In adenocarcinomas, the size of the solid component correlates with the presence of an invasive component on pathology, which has therapeutic and prognostic implications. Non-solid nodules are commonly associated with more indolent behavior compared to part-solid nodules in terms of doubling time and malignancy rate. Consequently, management recommendations differentiate between part-solid and nonsolid nodules.

Similarly, like solid nodules, SSNs do not always present as malignancies. They are frequently caused by benign conditions, such as infections, focal fibrosis, and organizing pneumonia. Some guidelines, therefore, recommend a 3-month follow-up CT to check lesion persistence for nonsolid nodules larger than 5 mm and part-solid nodules of all sizes.

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that AB-SSNs, NB-SSNs, and M-SSNs have different clinical and imaging characteristics. Significantly, a miniscule number of benign SSNs can also progress to resemble malignancy. A thorough understanding of the clinical and imaging features and development trends of benign SSNs may contribute to their early diagnosis and better management.

### Subsolid pulmonary nodule morphology and associated patient characteristics in a routine clinical population [^1145JpAR]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

To determine the presence and morphology of subsolid pulmonary nodules (SSNs) in a non-screening setting and their relation to clinical and patient characteristics, a study was conducted.

A total of 16,890 reports of clinically obtained chest CT (June 2011 to November 2014, single-center) were searched for descriptions of SSNs. Subjects with a visually confirmed SSN and at least two thin-slice CTs were included. Nodule volumes were measured, with progression defined as volume increase exceeding the software interscan variation. Nodule morphology, location, and patient characteristics were evaluated.

Fifteen transient and 74 persistent SSNs were included, with a median follow-up of 19.6 [8.3–36.8] months. Subjects with an SSN were slightly older than those without (62 vs. 58 years; p = 0.01), but no gender predilection was found. SSNs were mostly located in the upper lobes. Women showed significantly more persistent lesions than men (94% vs. 69%; p = 0.002). Part-solid lesions were larger (1638 vs. 383 mm³; p < 0.001) and more often progressive (68% vs. 38%; p = 0.02) compared to pure ground-glass nodules. Progressive SSNs were rare under the age of 50 years. Logistic regression analysis did not identify additional nodule parameters of future progression, apart from part-solid nature.

This study confirms previously reported characteristics of SSNs and associated factors in a European routine clinical population.

- **Key points**:
	- SSNs in women are significantly more often persistent compared to men.
	- SSN persistence is not associated with age or prior malignancy.

### Growth assessment of pulmonary adenocarcinomas manifesting as subsolid nodules on CT: Comparison of diameter-based and volume measurements [^114PTSgH]. Academic Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

To analyze the performances of diameter-based measurements, either using diameters or by calculating diameter-based volumes, as compared to volume measurements in assessing the growth of pulmonary adenocarcinomas manifesting as subsolid nodules on CT. In this IRB-approved, retrospective study, 74 pulmonary adenocarcinomas presented as subsolid nodules and were resected in 69 patients (21 men, 48 women, mean age 70 ± 9 years). Three CTs were available for each patient. Nodule size on each CT was assessed with diameter measurements, calculated volume based on diameter measurements, and measured volume. Nodule growth was defined as an increase of measured volume ≥ 25% between two sequential CTs. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of diameter-based measurements for growth assessment were calculated. Nodule characteristics were compared with nonparametric tests and analysis of variance.

- **Results**: There were fewer growing nodules during the CT1-CT2 interval (n = 22, 30%) than during the CT2-CT3 interval (n = 33, 45%, p = .060). Specificity and negative predictive value of diameter-based measurements for growth assessment ranged from 52 to 77% and 81 to 83%, respectively, between CT1 and CT2, and from 66 to 76% and 79 to 90%, respectively, between CT2 and CT3. Nongrowing nodules tended to be larger, regardless of how size was measured, and some of these differences in size were statistically significant (p = .002 to .046).

For pulmonary adenocarcinomas presenting as subsolid nodules on CT, diameter-based growth assessments provide valuable insights into nodule characteristics.

### Lung cancer probability and clinical outcomes of baseline and new subsolid nodules detected on low-dose CT screening [^111Haot6]. Thorax (2021). Low credibility.

Characteristics and clinical outcomes associated with screen-detected subsolid nodules are detailed. Online supplemental table 2 presents the characteristics and outcomes of 6,725 screen-detected subsolid nodules (5,241 baseline and 1,484 new). Compared with baseline subsolid nodules, new subsolid nodules tended to present in males (57.2% vs. 76.3%, p < 0.001) and in ever-smokers (44.5% vs. 61.3%, p < 0.001). They were more likely to be part-solid (22.0% vs. 30.7%, p < 0.001) and required additional follow-up (68.8% vs. 88.3%, p < 0.001).

When evaluating subsolid nodules that underwent additional follow-up after first detection, baseline subsolid nodules had a lower rate of resolution (30.0% vs. 78.9%, p < 0.001) and a higher growth rate (7.1% vs. 2.5%, p < 0.001) than new subsolid nodules. A higher rate of undergoing invasive biopsy (5.1% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001) and lung cancer diagnosis (4.0% vs. 1.1%, p < 0.001) was observed for baseline subsolid nodules compared with new subsolid nodules.

Subgroup analyses on the characteristics and clinical course of the screen-detected pure ground-glass nodules (GGNs) and part-solid nodules are provided in tables 2 and 3, respectively. In general, differences in the baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes between baseline and new nodules were similar for pure GGNs and part-solid nodules.

### Prognosis of surgically resected clinical stage 1A non-small cell lung cancers manifesting as a subsolid nodule on computed tomography including pure ground glass nodules [^1114N4ua]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Why is it important to do this review?

Lung cancer screening is currently being implemented in multiple countries based on evidence from CT screening studies performed on people with a history of tobacco use. Additionally, pulmonary nodules are increasingly being detected incidentally. The highest rates of subsolid nodule detection have been reported in non-smokers in East Asia, particularly among women. Recent epidemiological studies from East Asia have identified substantial overdiagnosis of lung cancer in the context of screening non-smokers, likely due to overtreatment of indolent adenocarcinoma spectrum lesions in this population.

Observational studies of ground-glass nodules show that only about 26% of pure ground-glass nodules exhibit growth on follow-up imaging, mostly in the first two years. To our knowledge, there have not been any controlled trials comparing active surveillance of subsolid nodules with early resection. In the absence of these data, we believe it is pertinent to synthesize the evidence regarding the prognosis of resected stage 1A NSCLC which appear subsolid on CT imaging.

Multiple studies have been published with relevant data, including some clinical trials and observational studies. The results of this review will be valuable to consumers, health professionals, and policymakers, particularly in the context of lung cancer screening programs. In addition, our review will likely identify knowledge gaps, which will help inform the ongoing research agenda.

### Evaluating the patient with a pulmonary nodule: A review [^112fLWzu]. JAMA (2022). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Pulmonary nodules are identified in approximately 1.6 million patients per year in the US and are detected on approximately 30% of computed tomographic (CT) images of the chest. Optimal treatment of an individual with a pulmonary nodule can lead to early detection of cancer while minimizing testing for a benign nodule.

- **Observations**: At least 95% of all pulmonary nodules identified are benign, most often granulomas or intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Smaller nodules are more likely to be benign. Pulmonary nodules are categorized as small solid (< 8 mm), larger solid (≥ 8 mm), and subsolid. Subsolid nodules are divided into ground-glass nodules (no solid component) and part-solid (both ground-glass and solid components). The probability of malignancy is less than 1% for all nodules smaller than 6 mm and 1% to 2% for nodules 6 mm to 8 mm. Nodules that are 6 mm to 8 mm can be followed with a repeat chest CT in 6 to 12 months, depending on the presence of patient risk factors and imaging characteristics associated with lung malignancy, clinical judgment about the probability of malignancy, and patient preferences.

The treatment of an individual with a solid pulmonary nodule 8 mm or larger is based on the estimated probability of malignancy; the presence of patient comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease; and patient preferences. Management options include surveillance imaging, defined as monitoring for nodule growth with chest CT imaging, positron emission tomography-CT imaging, and nonsurgical biopsy with bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle aspiration.

### A nomogram for predicting the risk of invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma for patients with solitary peripheral subsolid nodules [^111PPTVJ]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The subsolid nodule is a common clinical concern. The aim of this study was to construct a nomogram to predict the risk of invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma in patients with a solitary peripheral subsolid nodule.

We reviewed the records of 293 patients who had undergone resection of a solitary peripheral subsolid nodule, including the results of pathologic examinations after surgical resection. Clinical parameters and imaging features were analyzed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. A nomogram to predict the risk of invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma was constructed and validated with bootstrap resampling.

Two hundred seventy-three patients were included for analysis; 35 were diagnosed as benign, 3 as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, 18 as adenocarcinoma in situ, 58 as minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, and 159 as invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma. After final regression analysis, the computed tomography attenuation, nodule size, spiculation, signs of vascular convergence, pleural tags, and solid proportion were identified and were entered into the nomogram. The nomogram showed a robust discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.894. The calibration curves for the probability of invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma showed optimal agreement between the probability as predicted by the nomogram and the actual probability.

We developed a nomogram that can predict the risk of invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma for patients with a solitary peripheral subsolid nodule.

### Fleischner recommendations for the management of subsolid pulmonary nodules: High awareness but limited conformance - A survey study [^115gAPSm]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess awareness and conformance to the Fleischner Society recommendations for the management of subsolid pulmonary nodules (SSN) in clinical practice.

An online questionnaire with four imaging cases was sent to 1,579 associates from the European Respiratory Society and 757 from the European Society of Thoracic Imaging. Each respondent was asked to choose from several options which they thought was the indicated management for the presented nodule. Awareness and conformance to the Fleischner recommendations were assessed and correlated to respondents' characteristics.

In total, 119 radiologists (response rate 16.0%) and 243 pulmonologists (response rate 16.5%) were included. Awareness of the recommendations was higher in radiologists than in pulmonologists (93% vs. 70%, p < 0.001), as was implementation in daily practice (66% vs. 47%, p < 0.001). Radiologists conformed to the recommendations in rates of 31%, 69%, 68%, and 82%, while pulmonologists conformed in 12%, 43%, 70%, and 75% for cases 1 to 4, respectively. Overmanagement was common. Conformance in SSN management was associated with awareness, working in an academic practice, larger practice size, teaching residents, and higher SSN exposure.

Although awareness of the Fleischner recommendations for SSN management is widespread, management choices in clinical practice show large heterogeneity.

- **Key points**: Guideline awareness among clinicians is widespread, but conformance shows large heterogeneity. Awareness and conformance are significantly higher among radiologists than pulmonologists.

### Computerized tomography screening for lung cancer: new findings and diagnostic work-up [^117ChPbh]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

On computerized tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer within the Early Lung Cancer Action Project, both at baseline and repeat screening, we found not only solid but also subsolid nodules, which, unlike solid ones, do not completely obscure the lung parenchyma. We established that subsolid nodules represent approximately 20% of the nodules shown on screening and that they have a higher frequency of malignancy than solid nodules. Although we found the growth of solid nodules to be a reliable indicator of malignancy, the growth of subsolid nodules was more difficult to assess.

Upon reviewing our results at the time of writing, we have continued to refine our definition of a positive result from that given in our initial publication. We have also provided an updated screening regimen. It starts with the initial, low-dose CT test, and for all those with positive results on this initial test, the regimen continues by specifying the work-up needed to rule-in a diagnosis of malignancy. In this regimen, we found growth assessed by high-resolution CT to be a useful indicator of malignancy and have developed image-processing tools to aid in this assessment.

Once growth is ascertained, we recommend fine-needle aspiration for confirmation of malignancy. It may be that once criteria for definitive growth are established and validated, fine-needle aspiration may become optional. However, in the meantime, a more cautious approach is warranted in the context of screening.

### Human-recognizable CT image features of subsolid lung nodules associated with diagnosis and classification by convolutional neural networks [^116UD419]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

The interpretability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classifying subsolid nodules (SSNs) is insufficient for clinicians. Our purpose was to develop CNN models to classify SSNs on CT images and to investigate image features associated with the CNN classification.

- **Methods**: CT images containing SSNs with a diameter of ≤ 3 cm were retrospectively collected. We trained and validated CNNs using a 5-fold cross-validation method for classifying SSNs into three categories: benign and preinvasive lesions (PL), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma (IA), which were histologically confirmed or followed up for 6.4 years. The mechanism of CNNs on human-recognizable CT image features was investigated and visualized by gradient-weighted class activation map (Grad-CAM), separated activation channels and areas, and the DeepDream algorithm.

- **Results**: The accuracy was 93% for classifying 586 SSNs from 569 patients into three categories: 346 benign and PL, 144 MIA, and 96 IA in 5-fold cross-validation. The Grad-CAM successfully located the entire region of image features that determined the final classification. Activated areas in the benign and PL group were primarily smooth margins (p < 0.001) and ground-glass components (p = 0.033), whereas in the IA group, the activated areas were mainly part-solid (p < 0.001) and solid components (p < 0.001), lobulated shapes (p < 0.001), and air bronchograms (p < 0.001). However, the activated areas for MIA were variable. The DeepDream algorithm showed the image features in a human-recognizable pattern.

### Malignancy estimation of Lung-RADS criteria for subsolid nodules on CT: Accuracy of low and high risk spectrum when using NLST nodules [^117NBGey]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

In our study, we found a malignancy rate of 2.5% in Lung-RADS 2 subsolid lesions and 23.9% for Lung-RADS 4B subsolid lesions. Malignancy rates published by Lung-RADS, which include all nodule types, are 15% for Lung-RADS 4B.

Lung-RADS chose a relatively large cut-off of 20 mm for nonsolid nodules in the lowest risk category. Both the Fleischner Society and, if there is no previous imaging, also the British Thoracic Society recommend an initial 3-month follow-up for nonsolid lesions ≥ 5 mm to assess persistence. The NCCN further differentiates between nodules 5–10 mm, recommending an LDCT in 6 months, and for lesions > 10 mm, an LDCT in 3–6 months. Uniformly, all guidelines recommend more invasive diagnostics in subsolid nodules with new or growing (solid) components. Pinsky et al. reported in their analysis of NLST data that Lung-RADS underestimates the likelihood of lung cancer in subjects with nonsolid lesions < 20 mm or nodules < 6 mm. In line with the findings reported by Pinsky et al, our analysis of NLST nodules also showed a slight underestimation of the Lung-RADS 2 probability score in subsolid nodules (2.5% versus < 1%).

### Subsolid pulmonary nodule morphology and associated patient characteristics in a routine clinical population [^114qtQ35]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The preference for the upper lobes might suggest a relation with inhalation or smoking, as is described for lung cancer, which is most prevalent in the right upper lobe. Unfortunately, we cannot explain the upper lung location preference with certainty and are unable to determine a possible relationship with smoking as a detailed smoking history is unknown in our clinical cohort. In general, limited data are available on this issue.

In the search for factors associated with future progression of the nodules, we found only the part-solid nature of SSNs to be associated. This is an already well-known and extensively reported parameter, together with the initial lesion size, which is fundamental for management guidelines. We feel that the failure to reproduce other previously reported predictors of progression is likely due to our study population characteristics and relatively small study size.

### Subsolid pulmonary nodule morphology and associated patient characteristics in a routine clinical population [^111DSxFn]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

To determine the presence and morphology of subsolid pulmonary nodules (SSNs) in a non-screening setting, the study relates these findings to clinical and patient characteristics. A total of 16,890 clinically obtained chest CT reports were analyzed from a single center between June 2011 and November 2014 to identify SSNs. Subjects with a visually confirmed SSN and at least two thin-slice CT scans were included. Nodule volumes were measured, and progression was defined as a volume increase exceeding the software interscan variation. Nodule morphology, location, and patient characteristics were evaluated.

Fifteen transient and seventy-four persistent SSNs were observed, with a median follow-up of 19.6 months (range 8.3–36.8 months). Subjects with SSNs were slightly older than those without (62 vs. 58 years; p = 0.01), but no gender predilection was noted. SSNs were predominantly located in the upper lobes. Women exhibited significantly more persistent lesions compared to men (94% vs. 69%; p = 0.002). Compared to pure ground-glass nodules, part-solid lesions were larger (1638 vs. 383 mm³; p < 0.001) and more likely to progress (68% vs. 38%; p = 0.02). Progressive SSNs were uncommon in individuals under the age of 50 years. Logistic regression analysis did not identify additional nodule parameters predicting future progression, apart from their part-solid nature.

This study confirms previously reported characteristics of SSNs and associated factors in a European routine clinical population.

- **Key points**:
	- SSNs in women are significantly more likely to be persistent compared to men.
	- SSN persistence is not associated with age or prior malignancy.

### Cost-effectiveness of follow-up for subsolid pulmonary nodules in high-risk patients [^115niYeC]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various follow-up guidelines and their variants for managing subsolid pulmonary nodules.

- **Methods**: We employed a simulation model informed by data from both the literature and the National Lung Screening Trial to model patients with ground-glass nodules (GGNs) detected at baseline computed tomography undergoing follow-up. The study allowed the nodules to grow and develop solid components over time. We tested guidelines by varying follow-up recommendations for low-risk nodules, specifically pure GGNs or those stable over time. For each guideline, average US costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per patient were computed, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of those on the efficient frontier were identified. Additionally, we compared the costs and effects of the most recent Lung Computed Tomography Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) version 1.1, with those of the previous version, 1.0. Finally, sensitivity analyses of our results were performed by varying several relevant parameters.

- **Results**: Compared to the no follow-up scenario, the guideline system that was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY and had the greatest QALY gain assigned low-risk nodules a follow-up interval of 2 years and stopped follow-up after 2 years for GGNs and after 5 years for part-solid nodules. This strategy yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $99,970. Lung-RADS version 1.1 was less costly but no less effective than version 1.0. These findings were essential…

### Malignancy estimation of Lung-RADS criteria for subsolid nodules on CT: Accuracy of low and high risk spectrum when using NLST nodules [^113jDGDq]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2014, the ACR published Lung-RADS for screen-detected pulmonary nodules. Similarly to other management recommendations, it differentiates nodule types and uses nodule diameter and growth as major input parameters. Nodule management is adapted to estimated malignancy probability, with category 2 corresponding to the finding of a nodule with benign appearance and very low risk of being a malignancy, and category 4B corresponding to the finding of a suspicious nodule with a high malignancy risk, requiring more intense diagnostic work-up including biopsy or resection.

In Lung-RADS, thresholds for nodule diameters and corresponding risk estimates were determined by a consensus panel of experts and were based on publications of data on a summary-level of various screening trials including NLST, ELCAP, and NELSON. Recently, Pinsky et al. published a retrospective analysis of the Lung-RADS performance in the NLST. Lung-RADS scores 1 and 2 were defined as negative, and scores 3 to 4B as positive screening results. Performance was analyzed on a participant level with respect to the presence of diagnosed malignancy. However, no individual nodules were tracked, and no differentiation was made between part-solid nodules with various sizes of solid components (categories 3–4A-4B), since this information is not automatically available by the NLST database.

The fact that a subset of nonsolid nodules < 20 mm in diameter is malignant was well discussed, but no further information on the distribution of diameter with respect to histology was provided. We, therefore, focused our analysis on further exploring these aspects to enhance understanding and accuracy in the assessment of nodule malignancy risk.

### The 2023 American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) expert consensus document: Management of subsolid lung nodules [^114h7NXY]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Lung cancers that present as radiographic subsolid nodules represent a subtype with distinct biological behavior and outcomes. The objective of this document is to review the existing literature and report consensus among a group of multidisciplinary experts, providing specific recommendations for the clinical management of subsolid nodules.

- **Methods**: The American Association for Thoracic Surgery Clinical Practice Standards Committee assembled an international, multidisciplinary expert panel composed of radiologists, pulmonologists, and thoracic surgeons with established expertise in the management of subsolid nodules. A focused literature review was performed with the assistance of a medical librarian. Expert consensus statements were developed with class of recommendation and level of evidence for each of four main topics: (1) definitions of subsolid nodules (radiology and pathology), (2) surveillance and diagnosis, (3) surgical interventions, and (4) management of multiple subsolid nodules. Using a modified Delphi method, the statements were evaluated and refined by the entire panel.

- **Results**: Consensus was reached on 17 recommendations. These consensus statements reflect updated insights on subsolid nodule management based on the latest literature and clinical experience, focusing on the correlation between radiologic findings and pathological classifications, individualized subsolid nodule surveillance and surgical strategies, and multimodality therapies for multiple subsolid lung nodules.

- **Conclusions**: Despite the complex nature of the decision-making process, the consensus provides critical guidelines for medical professionals managing subsolid lung nodules.

### New subsolid pulmonary nodules in lung cancer screening: The NELSON trial [^116u59VN]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening is recommended in the United States. While new solid nodules after baseline screening have a high lung cancer probability at small size and require lower size cutoff values than baseline nodules, there is limited evidence on the management of new subsolid nodules.

- **Methods**: Within the Dutch-Belgian randomized controlled LDCT lung cancer screening trial (NELSON), 7,557 participants underwent baseline screening between April 2004 and December 2006. Participants with new subsolid nodules detected after the baseline screening round were included.

- **Results**: In the three incidence screening rounds, 60 new subsolid nodules (43 [72%] part-solid, 17 [28%] nonsolid) not visible in retrospect were detected in 51 participants, representing 0.7% (51 of 7,295) of participants with at least one incidence screening. Eventually, 6% (3 of 51) of participants with a new subsolid nodule were diagnosed with (pre-)malignancy in such a nodule. All (pre-)malignancies were adenocarcinoma (in situ) and diagnostic workup (referral 950, 364, and 366 days after first detection, respectively) showed favorable staging (stage I). Overall, 67% (33 of 49) of subsolid nodules with an additional follow-up screening were resolving.

- **Conclusions**: Less than 1% of participants in LDCT lung cancer screening present with a new subsolid nodule after baseline. Contrary to new solid nodules, data suggest that new subsolid nodules may not require a more aggressive follow-up.

### Single-cell characterization of pulmonary nodules implicates suppression of immunosurveillance across early stages of lung adenocarcinoma [^1169qnea]. Cancer Research (2023). High credibility.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) captured the transcriptomics of 20,445 CD4+, 5,790 CD8+, and 531 γδ T cells. Among the infiltrating CD45+ cells, the proportion of CD4+ T cells was higher in subsolid nodules than in normal lung (nLung). Analysis of infiltrating CD4+ T cells identified several subsets, including central-like memory T cells (Tcm, cluster C0), effector memory T cells (Tem, C1), Treg (C7), and activated T cells (Tact, C14, and C21). The percentage of C1-Tem was significantly decreased [linear mixed-effects (LME) model P = 0.02], whereas that of C7-Treg was increased (LME model P = 0.01) in subsolid nodules compared with the matched nLung. Consequently, the Tem:Treg ratio was significantly decreased in subsolid nodules, suggesting a suppression of T-cell–mediated immune activity. A similar pattern of CD4+ cell infiltration, with relative enrichment of immunosuppressive Tregs and a significant reduction of the Tem:Treg ratio, was also noted by flow cytometry (FC).

- **Profiles of the CD4+ T-cell subsets in subsolid nodules**
- The percentage of CD4+ T cells identified as Tem and Treg cells and the Tem:Treg ratio in each sample was evaluated via scRNA-seq and FC in the perspective cohort.
- Line patterns indicate the nLung-subsolid (dashed) and nLung-solid (solid) relationships from the same patients.
- Densities of conventional CD4+ and Treg and the percentage of Treg to total CD4+ T cells evaluated by multiplex immunofluorescence (MIF) staining in tissue areas were also assessed.

### The 2023 American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) expert consensus document: Management of subsolid lung nodules [^116GvpXE]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for pulmonary nodules, and more specifically in relation to surgical resection indications, the AATS 2024 guidelines recommend considering lobectomy for subsolid cancers in patients who are medically suitable for and amenable to surgery. This recommendation applies when the nodules have any of the following characteristics:

- **Nonperipheral (central)**: A central location within the lung.
- **> 20 mm with a consolidation-to-tumor ratio > 0.5**: The size of the nodule exceeds 20 mm, and the ratio is greater than 0.5.
- **Adequate surgical margins cannot be obtained with a lesser resection**: Complete removal is not achievable with a more conservative surgery.

### Clinical and non-contrast computed tomography characteristics and disease development in patients with benign pulmonary subsolid nodules with a solid component ≤ 5 mm [^113QAYgj]. Insights into Imaging (2024). High credibility.

Development trends for benign SSNs:

Among the 69 AB-SSNs, 68 nodules (98.55%) gradually decreased in size and had disappeared at the time of follow-up CT. One nodule (1.45%) progressed and then gradually resolved (Fig. 5). This nodule was 5 mm in diameter on the initial CT scan, then showed slight enlargement after 20 months, and subsequently underwent noticeable absorption after another 28 months. Among the 70 NB-SSNs, 67 nodules (95.71%) had no obvious changes on follow-up CT. The interval between the initial CT and the preoperative CT ranged from 90 to 1404 days, with a mean of 95 (± 85) days. Three nodules (4.29%) had progressed on the follow-up CT. The intervals between the initial CT and preoperative CT in these three patients were 96, 159, and 1660 days. Of these, one nodule was 8 mm in diameter on the initial CT and had increased to 12 mm after 54 months. This nodule was surgically confirmed to have a granuloma with inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 6). The other two nodules enlarged within a short time after the first CT scan (3 and 5 months) and were surgically confirmed to be inflammatory.

- **Morphological evolution of absorbable benign pulmonary subsolid nodule during follow-up CT in a 57-year-old woman**:
	- **A**: The initial lung window CT image showed a subsolid nodule in the right middle lobe.
	- **B**: Twenty months later, the lung window CT image showed that the nodule had increased in size.
	- **C**: Forty-eight months later, the lung window CT image showed absorption of the nodule.

### Lung cancer probability and clinical outcomes of baseline and new subsolid nodules detected on low-dose CT screening [^114uAENY]. Thorax (2021). Low credibility.

For detected subsolid nodules, the location, Lung-RADS category at first detection, and the duration and total number of CT scans during follow-up were assessed. All follow-up CT scans were evaluated to determine the clinical course and outcomes of the subsolid nodules. Results from CT scans taken during later screenings, after the detection of subsolid nodules, were included as additional follow-ups. The outcome of the detected subsolid nodules was based on their final status on the last CT scan.

Growth of a subsolid nodule was defined as:

1. ≥ 2 mm increase in size,
2. ≥ 2 mm increase in the solid component of a part-solid nodule, or
3. Emerging new solid component of any size in a pure GGN.

Resolution of a subsolid nodule was defined as:

1. Disappearance, or
2. A decrease in the total size or solid component of ≥ 2 mm from initial detection.

Other conditions were defined as stable. For each subsolid nodule that underwent invasive procedures for a pathological diagnosis, the type of diagnostic procedures and any associated complications were evaluated. The pathological reports, final diagnosis of biopsied subsolid nodules, staging reports, and records of initial treatment and outcomes for diagnosed lung cancer were obtained.

For participants with synchronous multiple lung nodules, medical records revealed the specific target nodule that underwent biopsy and provided specific pathological results for every biopsied nodule. Participants who had screen-detected subsolid nodules but received a pathological diagnosis after developing cancer-related symptoms were noted.

### Subsolid pulmonary nodules: Ct-pathologic correlation using the 2011 IASLC/ATS/ERS classification [^1122zWTN]. Clinical Imaging (2014). High credibility.

Adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer. Recent advances in oncology, molecular biology, pathology, imaging, and treatment have led to an increased understanding of this disease. In 2011, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, the American Thoracic Society, and the European Respiratory Society published a new international multidisciplinary classification. Using this taxonomy, we review the spectrum of subsolid pulmonary nodules seen on computed tomography together with their histopathologic correlates and management guidelines.

### Guidelines for management of incidental pulmonary nodules detected on CT images: From the Fleischner Society 2017 [^116NyWcY]. Radiology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pulmonary nodules, particularly with respect to follow-up imaging of subsolid nodules, FS 2017 guidelines recommend not routinely following up patients with:

- **Solitary pure ground-glass nodules**: Less than 6 mm
- **Solitary subsolid nodules**: Less than 6 mm

### Fleischner recommendations for the management of subsolid pulmonary nodules: High awareness but limited conformance - a survey study [^114Rg8hA]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

On the other hand, we found undermanagement for the persistent part-solid subsolid lesion by both groups of respondents. This type of lesion, if persistent and demonstrating a solid component exceeding 5 mm, is considered highly suggestive for invasive adenocarcinoma. Nevertheless, 33% of radiologists and 54% of pulmonologists would not have recommended an immediate (invasive) work-up. This indicates either insufficient knowledge about the meaning of this type of lesion or the desire to avoid overdiagnosis by at least a subgroup of colleagues.

As mentioned above, some deviation in management may be erroneously due to respondents overlooking or ignoring clinical information on nodule persistence. This seems most relevant in case 1, in which 33% and 42% of the radiologists and pulmonologists, respectively, called for a 3-month follow-up interval (which is indicated in the case of a new nodule) instead of the indicated serial annual follow-up (in the case of a persistent SSN). To a lesser extent, this might also account for some of the undermanagement in case 3, in which 19% and 16% of the respondents chose a 3-month follow-up interval instead of further work-up. Determining the true impact of respondents noting persistence in the presented cases is impossible, but over- and undermanagement may thus be somewhat lower than presented. Nevertheless, this argument cannot fully explain the large heterogeneity throughout and between the cases and respondents. Moreover, previous guideline conformance studies showed comparable percentages of non-conformance.

### Chemical localization with robotic bronchoscopy: Can it aid resection of subsolid lung nodules [^114wAGW3]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). High credibility.

Subsolid nodules or those located deep in lung parenchyma are difficult to localize using minimally invasive thoracic surgery. While image-guided percutaneous needle localization has been performed, it is inconvenient and has potential complications. In this study, the role of chemical localization using robotic bronchoscopy to facilitate resection was evaluated.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients undergoing surgical resection for lung nodules between August 2019 and March 2022 were included. Patients with subsolid lung nodules, or small nodules deep in lung parenchyma that were deemed difficult to localize, were chemically localized (CL) using robotic bronchoscopy before resection. Clinico-demographic data were obtained retrospectively using a prospectively maintained database.

- **Results**: Localization of lung nodules before resection was performed in 139 patients, while 110 patients were not localized. Daily activity score was higher for localized patients. Nodules in the localized group were smaller (P < 0.001) and had similar solid:ground glass ratio. In the localized group, larger margins were observed, and no re-resection of the parenchymal margin was required. Twenty patients in the non-localized group required re-resection intraoperatively due to close pathological margins or inability to locate the nodule in the resected specimen. Operative time was a median of 10–15 minutes longer for localized patients (P < 0.001). Length of stay was shorter in the localized group (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Chemical localization of lung nodules using robotic bronchoscopy appears to be safe.

### Subsolid pulmonary nodule morphology and associated patient characteristics in a routine clinical population [^117XsKDX]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Subsolid pulmonary nodules (SSNs) are a distinct subgroup of lung nodules with specific characteristics, particularly in terms of growth rate and malignancy risk. SSNs can be either transient or persistent, representing benign causes such as infection or focal fibrosis, or (pre)malignant lesions from the adenocarcinomatous spectrum. Regardless of the final etiology, every new and persistent SSN warrants surveillance. Advances in CT technology and emerging data have increased awareness and understanding of SSNs substantially in recent years.

Recently, guidelines have been issued for SSN management based on currently available data. This management primarily involves imaging surveillance over several years, reflective of nodule characteristics (i.e. pure ground-glass or part-solid nature) and growth or transformation over time. If malignancy is suspected, additional examinations — such as biopsy, resection, and/or other therapies — are recommended in a multidisciplinary approach tailored to individual patient characteristics and preferences.

Although these guidelines are designed for clinical practice, most data on SSNs originates from lung cancer screening subjects, a context that likely does not represent daily clinical practice. The current non-screening data mainly comes from Asian cohorts and from pathologically proven SSNs, which may introduce selection bias. Additionally, many studies focus solely on either pure or part-solid lesions.
