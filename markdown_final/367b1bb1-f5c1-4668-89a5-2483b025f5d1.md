## Question

What is the recommended management for a bleeding gastric ulcer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended management of a bleeding gastric ulcer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial assessment and resuscitation targets. Then, risk stratification and timing of endoscopy. Next, pre- and post-endoscopic pharmacotherapy, endoscopic indications and techniques, and management of rebleeding. Finally, I should consider H. pylori strategy, antithrombotic/NSAID decisions, disposition and follow-up, and special scenarios such as adherent clots, large/high-risk ulcers, and malignant ulcers.

> Let me start with stabilization, and I need to ensure I am not missing airway or shock priorities; secure the airway if there is massive hematemesis or aspiration risk, establish two large-bore IV lines, begin balanced crystalloid resuscitation, and apply a restrictive transfusion strategy with a hemoglobin threshold around 7 g/dL, allowing a higher threshold in select ischemic heart disease patients while correcting coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia as clinically indicated, since WSES emphasizes trauma-style damage-control resuscitation targets and ACG/BMJ endorse restrictive transfusion in nonvariceal UGIB [^112unp95] [^111rJkRA] [^115BFPJM].

> Next, I should review risk stratification to guide disposition and timing; the Glasgow-Blatchford score identifies very low-risk patients who may be discharged with early outpatient endoscopy when GBS is 0–1, while higher scores push toward inpatient management and earlier endoscopy, and ACG 2012 provides explicit ED discharge criteria for ultra-low-risk patients without inpatient endoscopy if vitals, hemoglobin, urea, and clinical features meet strict cutoffs — let me double-check that I cite both modern and foundational guidance here [^113B8bqY] [^113QhK8g] [^1149z5jU].

> Hold on, I should verify pre-endoscopic medications; start PPI promptly because most society guidelines support early acid suppression in suspected peptic ulcer bleeding, but I must not overstate the evidence pre-endoscopy since ACG 2021 indicates insufficient evidence to recommend for or against pre-endoscopic PPIs, whereas WSES 2020 recommends initiating PPIs as soon as possible, and pre-endoscopic prokinetic erythromycin can be considered to improve visualization while routine NG lavage should be avoided [^1131nBXw] [^112Nsi5N] [^111NEbxv] [^112a2yHn].

> Now, timing of endoscopy; I almost said "within 6 hours", but wait, that's not aligned with contemporary guidance, so let me correct it — perform endoscopy within 24 hours for admitted patients, and for high-risk features such as tachycardia, hypotension, ongoing hematemesis, or bloody NG aspirate, target within 12 hours after stabilization whenever feasible [^113nvC16] [^116Wnxuj] [^112hTHZ8].

> I will now examine endoscopic indications by stigmata; treat active spurting (Forrest Ia), active oozing (Ib), and non-bleeding visible vessel (IIa), generally do not treat clean-based ulcers (III) or flat pigmented spots (IIc), and be cautious with adherent clots (IIb) because evidence for routine therapy when the clot resists vigorous irrigation is insufficient — if the clot can be removed to reveal a high-risk vessel, treat accordingly [^1121kdKR] [^1164ZZY6] [^11355F3q] [^113WFVrY].

> Let me think about endoscopic hemostasis techniques and I should confirm that epinephrine monotherapy is inadequate; use combination therapy, with injection plus a definitive modality, and favor clips, bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, or APC, avoid epinephrine alone, consider Doppler probe guidance when available, and for difficult or recurrent cases consider over-the-scope clips or, as a temporizing option, hemostatic powder TC-325 in active bleeding [^113b8pjm] [^1137NPd9] [^117Mvut3] [^1153Snxa] [^115Bm9ip].

> Post-endoscopic acid suppression needs careful dosing; after successful hemostasis in high-risk lesions, give high-dose PPI for 72 hours either as an 80 mg IV bolus followed by 8 mg/h continuous infusion or with validated intermittent high-dose regimens, then continue PPI twice daily for 14 days before stepping down to once-daily dosing to complete 6–8 weeks to ensure ulcer healing — wait, let me verify the step-down timing and total duration, yes, that aligns with ACG and WSES [^115XebaE] [^111hW3NR] [^113jnrLc].

> If rebleeding occurs, I should double-check the first-line recommendation; repeat endoscopy with retreatment is preferred and controls most cases with fewer complications than surgery, and if endoscopic therapy fails or bleeding recurs despite optimal re-intervention, escalate to transarterial embolization or surgery, noting that outcomes between IR and surgery are often comparable, with IR generally favored in patients with substantial comorbidity risks [^115rJpMc] [^111hj219] [^112hTHZ8].

> I need to ensure H. pylori is addressed; test during endoscopy when possible, and if positive, provide eradication therapy, with WSES suggesting standard triple therapy when clarithromycin resistance is low, or sequential therapy if high resistance is suspected, and some protocols initiate eradication after 72–96 hours of IV PPI; importantly, confirm eradication and withhold long-term acid suppression unless other indications exist [^114SdqJB] [^117G3fjP] [^11779p8o].

> But wait, what about antithrombotics and NSAIDs; for secondary cardiovascular prevention, resume aspirin within 1–3 days after hemostasis because mortality benefit outweighs a modest rebleeding risk, and for NSAIDs, avoid if possible, otherwise use the lowest dose COX-2 inhibitor with daily PPI, while idiopathic ulcers may require long-term daily PPI given higher recurrence risk [^111Ppvvh] [^112DHpvo] [^116bRmkv].

> Next, I should review disposition and follow-up; high-risk patients warrant monitored care early after hemostasis, whereas patients with clean-based or flat-spot ulcers, stable vitals and hemoglobin, and no serious comorbidities can be discharged early on standard oral PPI with close follow-up, and very low-risk ED patients meeting strict criteria or GBS 0–1 may be discharged without inpatient endoscopy, with gastric ulcers warranting biopsy and, when suspicious or large, consideration of follow-up endoscopy to exclude malignancy [^111utZxK] [^113B8bqY] [^114EDpGW].

> Special scenarios need careful thought; adherent clots that resist vigorous irrigation remain controversial with insufficient evidence for routine endoscopic therapy, large posterior duodenal or high lesser-curvature ulcers bleed from major arterial branches and carry higher rebleeding risk so I should maintain a low threshold for early IR or surgical consultation, and malignant ulcers have high rebleeding rates with endoscopic control often temporary, prompting oncologic evaluation and consideration of definitive therapy where feasible [^11355F3q] [^114mwzGL] [^112hTHZ8].

> In summary, I should confirm that the cornerstones here are prompt resuscitation with restrictive transfusion, risk stratification to guide early endoscopy, endoscopic dual-modality hemostasis for high-risk stigmata while avoiding epinephrine monotherapy, evidence-based PPI protocols post-hemostasis, repeat endoscopy for rebleeding before IR or surgery, systematic H. pylori testing and eradication, careful management of antithrombotics and NSAIDs, and judicious discharge and follow-up planning aligned with risk and endoscopic findings [^116G2nhk] [^113b8pjm] [^115XebaE] [^115rJpMc] [^113B8bqY].

Management centers on **early endoscopy within 24 hours** for diagnosis and hemostasis, plus **high-dose IV PPI** to reduce rebleeding [^113QhK8g] [^115XebaE]. Endoscopic therapy is indicated for active bleeding or high-risk stigmata and should use **dual therapy** (mechanical plus thermal or injection); **epinephrine alone is inadequate** [^113b8pjm] [^116DqzB5]. If rebleeding occurs, **repeat endoscopy is first-line**; persistent bleeding requires transarterial embolization or surgery [^114JXZqZ] [^111hj219]. Test for H. pylori and eradicate if positive, and avoid NSAIDs or use COX-2 plus PPI if necessary [^114SdqJB] [^112DHpvo]. Resume antiplatelets/anticoagulants early after hemostasis, and continue PPI for 6–8 weeks to ensure healing [^113jnrLc].

---

## Initial assessment and resuscitation

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Immediate assessment and stabilization with IV crystalloids; transfuse to hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL, higher if comorbidities [^111rJkRA] [^1147Q66X].

- **Risk stratification**: Use Glasgow-Blatchford and Rockall scores to guide urgency and level of care [^1147Q66X].

- **Laboratory evaluation**: CBC, coagulation profile, renal function, and type and crossmatch.

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacologic therapy should begin with **proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** as soon as possible, using a high-dose IV regimen (e.g. 80 mg bolus then 8 mg/h infusion) to reduce rebleeding and the need for intervention [^112Nsi5N] [^114hGt97]. H. pylori eradication entails **testing all patients** and, if positive, prescribing **standard triple therapy** (PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin) or sequential therapy where resistance is high [^114SdqJB] [^117G3fjP].

---

## Endoscopic therapy

- **Timing**: Perform endoscopy within 24 hours; urgent endoscopy within 12 hours for high-risk patients [^113QhK8g].

- **Indications**: Treat active bleeding (Forrest Ia, Ib), non-bleeding visible vessel (Forrest IIa), and adherent clot (Forrest IIb) [^111pisY5] [^111NEbxv].

- **Techniques**: Use dual therapy (mechanical clips plus thermal or injection); epinephrine alone is inadequate [^113b8pjm] [^116DqzB5].

- **Adjunctive methods**: Consider hemostatic powder (TC-325) or over-the-scope clips for difficult cases [^111dvYdH] [^1153Snxa].

---

## Management of rebleeding

Management of rebleeding begins with **repeat endoscopy** as first-line after initial hemostasis [^114JXZqZ]. If repeat endoscopy fails or is not feasible, transarterial embolization is recommended [^111hj219]. Surgery is reserved for persistent or recurrent bleeding despite endoscopic and radiologic therapy [^111hj219].

---

## Post-endoscopic management and prevention

- **PPI therapy**: Continue high-dose IV PPI for 72 hours, then oral PPI for 6–8 weeks to promote healing [^113jnrLc].

- **NSAID management**: Avoid NSAIDs; if necessary, use COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI [^112DHpvo].

- **Antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy**: Resume early after hemostasis, balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks.

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Follow-up should include **repeat endoscopy at 6–8 weeks** to confirm healing and exclude malignancy, as well as **patient education** on medication adherence, NSAID avoidance, and recognizing recurrence.

---

## Complications and outcomes

Complications — including **rebleeding, perforation, and mortality** — remain significant risks. Outcomes improve with **early endoscopy**, effective hemostasis, and PPI therapy, which reduce rebleeding, surgery, and mortality.

---

Effective management of bleeding gastric ulcer requires coordinated resuscitation, **timely endoscopy**, appropriate pharmacotherapy, and structured follow-up to minimize rebleeding and complications.

### Is early endoscopy in the emergency room beneficial in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer? A "fortuitously controlled" study [^114xwHDd]. Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

In previous randomized trials, early endoscopy improved the outcome in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, though most of these studies defined "early" as endoscopy performed within 24 hours after admission. Using the length of hospital stay as the primary criterion for the clinical outcome, we compared the results of endoscopy done immediately after admission (early endoscopy in the emergency room, EEE) with endoscopy postponed to a time within the first 24 hours after hospitalization but still during normal working hours ("delayed" endoscopy in the endoscopy unit, DEU).

We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 81 consecutive patients with bleeding peptic ulcer admitted in 1997 and 1998 (age range 16–90 years). Of these 81 patients, 38 underwent DEU (the standard therapy at the hospital) and 43 underwent EEE. Patients in the two groups were comparable with regard to admission criteria, were equally distributed with respect to their risk of adverse outcome (assessed using the Baylor bleeding score and the Rockall score), and differed only in the treatment they received. Endoscopic hemostasis was performed whenever possible in all patients with Forrest types I, IIa, and IIb ulcer bleeding.

We found similar rates in the two groups for rebleeding (16% in DEU patients vs. 14% in EEE patients), persistent bleeding (8% in DEU patients vs. none in EEE patients), medical complications (21% in DEU patients vs. 26% in EEE patients), and the need for surgery (8% in DEU patients vs. 9% in EEE patients).

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111hj219]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Ongoing or rebleeding**: The term "further bleeding" encompasses both a lack of haemostasis at index endoscopy and early rebleeding. If acute bleeding persists despite standard endotherapy, European guidelines suggest using the larger over-the-scope clip or haemostatic powder. However, due to reported high rates of rebleeding, haemostatic powder should probably be used as a temporising measure before definitive management through other means, such as interventional radiology.

	- Rebleeding is indicated by externalisation of blood, more than a 20 g/L reduction after stabilisation of haemoglobin concentration, or tachycardia and hypotension. All major guidelines recommend repeat endoscopy in this event. A randomised controlled trial of 100 patients comparing repeat endoscopy with surgery in rebleeding after index endoscopy showed that 35 (73%) of 48 patients having repeat endoscopy had long-term control of bleeding with significantly reduced complications, no increase in the risk of mortality, and reduced resource costs. If bleeding cannot be controlled endoscopically, interventional radiology (for transarterial embolisation) or surgical input should be sought; a meta-analysis reported no difference in mortality or the need for further intervention between these groups. For patients with substantial comorbidities, interventional radiology is generally a safer option than surgery.

- **Variceal bleeding**: If variceal bleeding is uncontrolled by standard endoscopic band ligation or injection techniques, a balloon tamponade might be required. A 1978 trial of 97 patients showed…

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: A review of the literature [^112wxv7D]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

After risk assessments, patients with bleeding peptic ulcers should receive pharmacologic treatment and endoscopic examination within 24 hours. The guideline suggests an intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) as the first choice for gastric acid suppression, and the dose and duration depend on the endoscopic findings. The endoscopic finding of bleeding peptic ulcers can be classified by the Forrest classification, which can identify high or low risk for rebleeding and mortality.

- **Forrest classification**:
	- **Forrest IA**: Spurting vessel
	- **Forrest IB**: Active oozing
	- **Forrest IIA**: Non-bleeding visible vessel
	- **Forrest IIB**: Adherent clots

	- These are defined as major stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH), indicating a higher rebleeding and mortality risk that requires appropriate endoscopic treatment. In contrast:

	- **Forrest IIC**: Flat red spot is defined as minor SRH with a lower risk.
	- **Forrest III**: Clean base is without recent SRH.

In combination with the clinical presentation and endoscopic findings, the complete Rockall score predicts the rebleeding and mortality risk. A complete Rockall score of 0–1 indicates low risk, 2–4 is intermediate risk, and a score of 5 or more is considered a high risk.

- **Pharmacologic treatment**: Peptic ulcer healing is a reconstruction process of mucosa through the formation of granulation tissue. Granulation tissue formation takes place approximately 72 hours through the formation of the ulcer base, blood vessels, and re-establishment of glandular architecture after the ulcer occurs.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of gastric varices [^113mVzyf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Hemorrhage, resulting from gastric varices, can be challenging to treat, given the various precipitating etiologies. A wide variety of treatment options exist for managing the diverse range of underlying disease processes. While cirrhosis is the most common cause of gastric variceal bleeding, the occlusion of the portal or splenic vein in non-cirrhotic states results in a markedly different treatment paradigm. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^115ZiAvn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

These consensus guidelines are an update of the 2013 WSES position paper on this topic. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the board of the WSES to develop questions on six main topics that thoroughly cover the field of this pathology: diagnosis, resuscitation, non-operative management, surgery, angiography-angioembolization, and antimicrobial therapy. Leading specialists in the field were asked to perform a thorough search on each of these topics in different databanks (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE) for relevant papers between 1985 and June 2018 and a systematic review of the available literature. They focused their search to provide evidence-based answers with immediate practical application to each question and summarized them in statements. All statements were presented and discussed during the 5th WSES Congress held in Bertinoro, Italy on June 28th, 2018, and a consensus among the WSES panel of experts was reached. All members contributed to the development of the manuscript, which was reviewed and approved by all authors.

The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology.

- **Diagnosis**: In patients with a suspected perforated peptic ulcer, what are the appropriate biochemical and imaging investigations that should be requested? What is the clinical value of risk scores in patients with a perforated peptic ulcer?

### Accuracy of the initial endoscopic diagnosis in the discrimination of gastric ulcers: is endoscopic follow-up study always needed [^1137WQkv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

An endoscopic follow-up study of gastric ulcers has been recommended routinely due to the possibility that a gastric neoplasm may be missed in the initial endoscopy. However, some authors, particularly those reporting data from areas with low gastric carcinoma incidence, have questioned this approach. This skepticism arises from the low numbers of curable cancers detected and the high cost associated with such a program.

- **Goals**: The study aimed to assess the accuracy of endoscopy diagnosis of gastric ulcers and evaluate the efficacy and cost of a gastric ulcer follow-up endoscopic program in an area with an intermediate incidence rate of gastric cancer.

- **Study**: A retrospective study was conducted to identify all the gastroscopies in which a gastric ulcer had been diagnosed over a 6-year period. The endoscopic impression was compared with the histologic diagnosis, focusing on sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the likelihood ratio. Patients who completed a follow-up program were also reviewed. For each discovered neoplasm, the number of endoscopies and the global cost were calculated.

- **Results**: Out of 741 gastroscopies performed, 547 gastric ulcers were diagnosed in 529 patients. Biopsies were taken from 330 patients, with 341 gastric ulcers found. At the index endoscopy, 41 gastric neoplasms (12.4%) were diagnosed. The accuracy of endoscopic malignancy diagnosis was demonstrated with a positive predictive value of 0.68, a negative predictive value of 0.98, a sensitivity of 0.82, and a specificity of 0.95. The likelihood ratio was 16. A total of 117 patients completed the follow-up program. Three new cases of gastric neoplasm were discovered during follow-up.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1134SYrS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, individual RCTs that compared different regimens of PPIs in peptic ulcer bleeding and even the meta-analysis of these trials remain severely underpowered. What is worse, it is not likely that an adequately powered RCT will be conducted in the near future due to feasibility issues and lack of funding from pharmaceutical companies facing increasing generic competition. Then how will we be able to decide on this issue? It seems that, for the time being, a reasonable approach is the one chosen by the international consensus group, who stated that "strong evidence demonstrates the efficacy of high-dose IV PPI therapy after successful endoscopy, but it is not possible to make conclusions regarding the efficacy of either lower intravenous doses or high-dose oral therapy". This statement was largely based on the results of a 2006 Cochrane review that showed that, among patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions who had received endoscopic hemostatic therapy, high-dose IV PPI therapy (80 mg bolus plus 8 mg/h continuous infusion) significantly reduced rebleeding and mortality. In contrast, lower doses (IV or oral) significantly reduced rebleeding but had no demonstrable effect on mortality. The 2013 update of that review showed very similar results.

It is important to note that even if the guideline recommendations are followed, a significant proportion of patients will rebleed; there is still room for improvement in the management of patients with NVUGIB, especially in those found to have high-risk endoscopic lesions. A recent RCT attempted to improve outc

### Towards personalised management for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113A8nA2]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Guidelines from national and international professional societies on upper gastrointestinal bleeding highlight important clinical issues but do not always identify specific management strategies pertaining to individual patients. Optimal treatment should consider the personal needs of an individual patient and the pertinent resources and experience available at the point of care.

This article integrates international guidelines and consensus into three stages of management: pre-endoscopic assessment and treatment, endoscopic evaluation and haemostasis, and post-endoscopic management. We emphasize the need for personalized management strategies based on patient characteristics, the nature of bleeding lesions, and the clinical setting, including available resources.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically upper gastrointestinal endoscopy timing, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend stratifying patients based on the Blatchford score and adopting a risk-stratified management as follows:

- **Outpatient endoscopy**: Consider performing in the very low-risk group.

- **Early inpatient endoscopy**: Perform within 24 hours of admission for the low-risk group.

- **Urgent inpatient endoscopy**: Perform within 12 hours of admission for the high-risk group.

The management of peptic ulcer bleeding has been revolutionized in the past two decades with the advent of effective endoscopic hemostasis and potent acid-suppressing agents. A prompt initial clinical and endoscopic assessment should allow patients to be triaged effectively into those who require active therapy versus those who require monitoring and preventative therapy.

A combination of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy, using a combination of injection and thermal coagulation, offers the best chance of hemostasis for those with active bleeding ulcers. Surgery, being the most effective way to control bleeding, should be considered for treatment failures. The choice between surgery and repeat endoscopic therapy should be based on the pre-existing comorbidities of the patient and the characteristics of the ulcer.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^111NEbxv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the step-wise management of patients with overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemodynamic status is first assessed, and resuscitation is initiated as needed. Patients are risk-stratified based on features such as hemodynamic status, comorbidities, age, and laboratory tests. Pre-endoscopic erythromycin is considered to increase diagnostic yield at the first endoscopy. Pre-endoscopic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) may be considered to decrease the need for endoscopic therapy but does not improve clinical outcomes. Upper endoscopy is generally performed within 24 hours. The endoscopic features of ulcers direct further management.

- **Endoscopic therapy**: Patients with active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessels receive endoscopic therapy (e.g. bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, sclerosant, clips). Patients with an adherent clot may receive endoscopic therapy. These patients then receive intravenous PPI with a bolus followed by a continuous infusion. Patients with flat spots or clean-based ulcers do not require endoscopic therapy or intensive PPI therapy.

- **Rebleeding management**: Rebleeding after endoscopic therapy is treated with a second endoscopic treatment; if bleeding persists or recurs, treatment with surgery or interventional radiology is undertaken.

- **Prevention of rebleeding**: Prevention is based on the etiology of the bleeding ulcer. H. pylori is eradicated, and after cure is documented, anti-ulcer therapy is generally not given. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are stopped. If they must be resumed, a low-dose COX-2-selective NSAID plus PPI is used.

### Diagnosis and management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113LCdCr]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States and has been associated with increasing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. Rapid assessment and resuscitation should precede the diagnostic evaluation in unstable patients with severe bleeding. Risk stratification is based on clinical assessment and endoscopic findings. Early upper endoscopy (within 24 hours of presentation) is recommended in most patients because it confirms the diagnosis and allows for targeted endoscopic treatment, including epinephrine injection, thermocoagulation, application of clips, and banding.

- **Endoscopic therapy**: Results in reduced morbidity, hospital stays, risk of rebleeding, and need for surgery. Although administration of proton pump inhibitors does not decrease mortality, risk of rebleeding, or need for surgery, it reduces stigmata of recent hemorrhage and the need for endoscopic therapy.

Despite successful endoscopic therapy, rebleeding can occur in 10 to 20 percent of patients; a second attempt at endoscopic therapy is recommended in these patients. Arteriography with embolization or surgery may be needed if there is persistent and severe bleeding.

Treatment for peptic ulcer bleeding

A standardized assessment and timely treatment are necessary for patients with bleeding peptic ulcers (Figure 1). The initial step is stabilizing the patient's hemodynamic status and airway patency. The treatment goal of fluid resuscitation is to keep systolic blood pressure over 100 mmHg and pulse lower than 100/min by intravenous crystalloid fluid resuscitation. Packed RBC, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma transfusion are needed to keep the hemoglobin level higher than 7 g/dL, platelet counts over 50,000/mm³, and prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) less than 15 s.

Figure 1.
Management flowchart for peptic ulcer bleeding.

Several risk score assessments have been designed to assist with the risk stratification for peptic ulcer bleeding patients (Figure 2). Glasgow–Blatchford bleeding score aimed to identify the urgency of endoscopic therapy by using the patient's blood test, blood pressure, past history, and clinical presentations. A score > 0 is in need of medication and endoscopic intervention, while a score over 8 points is indicated for ICU admission. The AIMS65 scale has been proven to predict in-hospital mortality and length of hospitalization by using the patient's blood test, blood pressure, and clinical presentations. On the other hand, the pre-endoscopic Rockall score is a useful prognostic indicator to identify mortality risk by using vital signs and past history.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers: 2013 WSES position paper [^1164RRp1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is the most common gastroenterological emergency and has significant morbidity and mortality. Management strategies have changed dramatically over recent decades due to the introduction of acid suppressive therapy, especially proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and endoscopic therapy.

The incidence rates of UGIB demonstrate a large geographic variation, ranging from 48 to 160 cases per 100,000 population. Possible explanations for this variation include differences in the definition of UGIB across studies, population characteristics, prevalence of ulcerogenic medication — particularly aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — and the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).

Some but not all time-trend studies have reported a significant decline in the incidence of acute UGIB, especially peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB), in recent years. This decline is likely due to a combination of factors, including a decreasing prevalence of gastric colonization with H. pylori, the use of eradication therapy in patients with ulcer disease, and the increased use of PPI therapy, particularly in patients using aspirin and NSAIDs.

At the same time, an increasing proportion of patients presenting with UGIB are older, and a significant number of these patients consume NSAIDs and/or antiplatelet therapy to treat other medical comorbidities. Given these factors, UGIB continues to have a considerable impact.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^112ucxnT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Bleeding peptic ulcer disease is a clinical emergency requiring a rapid surgical/medical evaluation to assess the stability of the clinical picture; the approach is similar to the bleeding trauma patient. In this regard, we suggest referring to the latest edition of the European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma. The parameters that should be assessed at ER referral are the same as those reported in the American College of Surgeons Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) classification of blood loss (heart rate, blood pressure, pulse pressure, respiratory rate, urine output, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and base deficit).

Moreover, it is very important to take an accurate medical history, especially regarding:

- **Drugs and diseases that may affect the coagulation status**: For example, antiplatelets, anticoagulants, and hepatic failure.
- **Cardiac and pulmonary diseases**: Conditions such as coronary artery disease, which may make patients more susceptible to adverse effects of anemia.
- **Neurological diseases**: Conditions like dementia that may predispose patients to pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.

### Proton pump inhibitor treatment initiated prior to endoscopic diagnosis in upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^116VrEPo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common reason for emergency hospital admission. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production and are used to manage upper GI bleeding. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of proton pump inhibitors initiated before endoscopy in people with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

- **Objective**: To assess the effects of PPI treatment initiated prior to endoscopy in people with acute upper GI bleeding.

- **Search methods**: We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and major conference proceedings up to October 2008 for the previous versions of this review. Additionally, searches were conducted in April 2018, October 2019, and June 3, 2021, for this update. We also contacted experts in the field and searched trial registries and references of trials for any additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment with a PPI (oral or intravenous) versus control treatment with either placebo, histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), or no treatment, prior to endoscopy in hospitalised people with uninvestigated upper GI bleeding.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted study data, and assessed the risk of bias. Outcomes assessed at 30 days were: mortality (our primary outcome), rebleeding, surgery, high-risk stigmata of recent haemorrhage (active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot) at index endoscopy, endoscopic haemostatic treatment at index endoscopy, and time to discharge.

### Outcome of endoscopic treatment for peptic ulcer bleeding: Is a second look necessary? A meta-analysis [^111QDWPA]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Endoscopic therapy for gastrointestinal bleeding is highly effective. Nevertheless, bleeding recurs in 10% to 25% of cases, irrespective of the method of treatment used. Whether a second-look endoscopy with retreatment after initial hemostasis is of clinical value is controversial. A meta-analysis was performed to assess whether systematic second-look endoscopy with retreatment reduces the risks of rebleeding, salvage surgery, and death in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was performed of randomized controlled studies of the value of second-look endoscopy in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding published between 1990 and 2000. Four studies were selected according to predefined criteria. Two investigators extracted the data independently. Pooled risk estimates and number needed to treat were calculated for each procedure. Heterogeneity of effects was tested.

- **Results**: The absolute risk reduction in clinical rebleeding was 6.2% (p < 0.01). Absolute risk reduction for surgery and mortality were, respectively, 1.7% and 1.0% (not significant). The second look with retreatment significantly reduced the risk of rebleeding compared with control patients (OR 0.64; 95% CI [0.44, 0.95]; p < 0.01), with a number needed to treat of 16. There was no heterogeneity among studies. The risk of surgery as well as the risk of death was not significantly influenced by the second-look endoscopy with retreatment (number needed to treat, respectively, 58 and 97).

- **Conclusions**: Systematic second-look endoscopy with retreatment significantly reduces rebleeding rates, although it does not significantly impact the risk of surgery or mortality.

### Proton pump inhibitor treatment for acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^114UusLy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer (PU) bleeding is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in peptic ulcer bleeding have yielded conflicting results.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy of PPIs in the management of acute bleeding from PU using evidence from RCTs.

- **Search strategy**: We performed a search of CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003), and EMBASE (1980 to February 2003), as well as proceedings of recent major meetings through to February 2003. We searched the reference lists of articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field for additional published or unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs of PPI treatment (oral or intravenous) compared with either placebo or H(2)-receptor antagonist (H(2)RA) in patients with acute bleeding from PU were included if they met pre-defined criteria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers extracted data independently on a purpose-designed data extraction form. The validity of included studies was assessed by the adequacy of the randomization method and other pre-defined criteria. Studies were summarized, and meta-analysis was undertaken. The influence of factors on the outcomes was assessed.

- **Main results**: Twenty-one RCTs with a total of 2,915 participants were included. Statistical heterogeneity was found among trials for rebleeding (P = 0.05) but not for mortality (P = 0.26) or surgery (P = 0.42). There was no significant difference in mortality rates between studies.

### Recommencing aspirin following a peptic ulcer bleed: When is the time right [^111N2NRv]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The results demonstrated a rebleed rate of 10.3% (95% CI 3.4–17.2) in the aspirin group compared with 5.4% (95% CI 0.3–10.5) in the placebo group, a difference of 4.9 percentage points (95% CI -3.6–13.4) at 30 days. The authors therefore concluded that continuing aspirin was not comparable to stopping aspirin therapy in terms of the risk of a reulcer bleed.

Regarding the secondary endpoints of the study, there was no significant difference in the amount of blood transfused or the length of hospital stay between each arm of the study. However, there was a significant difference in mortality between groups at 8 weeks: 1.3% in the aspirin group (1 patient died of congestive cardiac failure) vs. 12.9% in the placebo group (including 5 participants who died of vascular complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke, 2 who died of perforated ulcer, and 1 who died of uncontrolled bleeding); p = 0.005. The difference in mortality remained significant when deaths only due to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and gastrointestinal causes were included.

### Helicobacter pylori-related gastric outlet obstruction: Is there a role for medical treatment [^111kX7zx]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The role of Helicobacter pylori in the pathogenesis of duodenal and gastric ulcer and ulcer recurrence is widely known. Bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction represent the most serious, potentially life-threatening complications of ulcer disease. At present, the effect of H. pylori eradication on complicated ulcer disease has not been fully established. Case reports exist on the resolution of gastric outlet obstruction after the eradication of H. pylori. We report the first case of H. pylori-related gastric outlet obstruction successfully treated with parenteral antibiotics.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: A review of the literature [^115BFPJM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Despite advancements in endoscopic and pharmacological therapies, a minority of patients (8%–15%) still experience refractory peptic ulcer bleeding. Predictors of rebleeding include initial hemodynamic instability, low hemoglobin levels upon presentation, greater blood transfusion requirements, high-risk endoscopic stigmata, large ulcer size, and specific ulcer locations like posterior duodenal or high lesser gastric curvature ulcers. For patients with peptic ulcers who experience rebleeding despite initial endoscopic treatment, a second-look endoscopy has shown long-term bleeding control with reduced complications, no increased mortality risk, and lower costs compared to surgery. Therefore, guidelines recommend a second-look endoscopy in such cases.

Malignancy-related ulcer bleeding is another challenge to manage. Due to local vessel invasion and the friable neovascularization of tumors, malignant ulcers can rebleed even after initial hemostasis is achieved. Although surgery and endoscopic resection can remove the tumor, not all patients are appropriate candidates. Standard combination therapy with injection and thermal or mechanical treatment can achieve 80%–90% initial hemostasis; however, the overall rebleeding rate of malignant ulcers is 40%, and the rebleeding rate within 30 days is 30%. Until now, there is no strongly recommended therapy for malignant bleeding in treatment guidelines.

If bleeding cannot be controlled through endoscopy, options such as transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) or surgical intervention remain viable alternatives.

### Challenges in the management of acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^113UifXL]. Lancet (2013). Low credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency worldwide, with bleeding peptic ulcers being a major cause. Endoscopic treatment and acid suppression with proton-pump inhibitors are the cornerstones in the management of the disease, and both treatments have been shown to reduce mortality. The role of emergency surgery continues to diminish. In specialized centers, radiological intervention is increasingly used in patients with severe and re-bleeding who do not respond to endoscopic treatment. Despite these advances, mortality from the disorder has remained around 10%.

The disease often occurs in elderly patients with frequent comorbidities who use antiplatelet agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticoagulants. The management of such patients, especially those at high cardiothrombotic risk who are on anticoagulants, is a challenge for clinicians. We summarize the published scientific literature about the management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, identify directions for future clinical research, and suggest how mortality can be reduced.

### Asia-Pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^114y8Tt6]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The question remains whether risk stratification with the selection of high-risk patients may lead to a benefit from second-look endoscopy on the next day and repeated treatment in case of persistent stigmata. The Baylor Bleeding Score attempted to select high-risk patients to receive second-look endoscopy versus controls and found a 24% difference in the rate of rebleeding. A study including 699 patients from Korea showed that the use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, large transfusion volume, and failure to perform second-look endoscopy were risk factors for rebleeding after endoscopic therapy. Another study from Taiwan, which enrolled 316 patients receiving a high-dose PPI after endoscopic therapy, attempted to formulate a predictive score using endoscopic monotherapy and serum albumin levels. By this score, the receiver operating characteristic curve to predict the need for second-look endoscopy appeared promising, but outcome data were lacking. At the time of writing, there is still a lack of evidence to suggest that any risk stratification method is effective in selecting patients at high risk who would benefit from second-look endoscopy and pre-emptive treatment.

The working group therefore rejected the statement that a risk stratification score may be useful to identify high-risk bleeding ulcers after endoscopic therapy for second-look endoscopy. Future studies should be conducted to verify the use of a risk stratification system.

For large gastric ulcers suspected of malignancy, consider performing a resection with an operative frozen pathologic examination whenever possible. In cases of large duodenal ulcers, consider performing resections or repair with or without pyloric exclusion or external bile drainage. Repair with duodenostomy should only be considered in extreme circumstances.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers: 2013 WSES position paper [^1156GUyi]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

However, although emergency endoscopy should be considered in patients with severe bleeding, very early endoscopy (< 12 h) has so far not been shown to provide additional benefit in terms of reduction of rebleeding, surgery, and mortality compared with later endoscopy (within 24 h).

The Forrest classification is often used to distinguish endoscopic appearances of bleeding ulcers: Ia spurting active bleeding, Ib oozing active bleeding, IIa visible vessel, IIb adherent clot, IIc flat pigmented spot, and III ulcer with a clean base.

In patients with perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers (PUB), those with active bleeding ulcers or a non-bleeding visible vessel in an ulcer bed are at the highest risk of rebleeding and therefore need prompt endoscopic hemostatic therapy. Patients with low-risk stigmata, such as a clean-based ulcer or a pigmented spot in the ulcer bed, do not require endoscopic therapy.

Two small randomized trials and a meta-analysis suggested that a clot should be removed in search of an artery and, when present, endoscopic treatment should be given. However, the management of peptic ulcers with overlying adherent clots that are resistant to removal by irrigation remains controversial.

Endoscopic treatment can be divided into:

- **Injection**: Methods including the use of epinephrine, sclerosants, and even normal saline solution.
- **Thermal**: Techniques include monopolar or bipolar cautery and argon plasma coagulation.
- **Mechanical methods**: Such as hemoclips.

The choice of which endoscopic therapy to employ is often based on local preference and expertise. Injection of diluted epinephrine alone is now judged to be inadequate.

### Asia-Pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^116YwWDM]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

When endoscopic haemostasis fails to control peptic ulcer bleeding, repeated endoscopy and surgery are considered viable options to control bleeding. There is little evidence to support the use of angiographic embolisation as an alternative to surgery after endoscopic treatment has failed, except for two retrospective studies. A Scandinavian study prospectively randomised 105 patients with peptic ulcer bleeding to arterial embolisation after endoscopic therapy or to standard treatment. The authors used a composite endpoint which included transfusion requirement, development of rebleeding, need for haemostatic intervention, and mortality as the primary endpoint. While there was a trend towards less rebleeding for those who received angiography, the study reported no difference in the outcome of those who received angiography versus standard treatment.

More recently, a prospective randomised trial in Hong Kong tried to examine this by allocating patients with Forrest I/II peptic ulcer bleeding to pre-emptive angiographic embolisation or standard-of-care management without embolisation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no demonstrable difference between the two groups in rebleeding within 30 days, need for further endoscopic or surgical interventions, hospital stay, blood transfusion requirement, and mortality. In the per-protocol analysis of 90 patients who received angiographic embolisation compared with 113 patients who did not, there was a trend favouring angiography, with a significant reduction in mortality.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^114vvUj4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The guidelines are aimed at presenting the state-of-the-art regarding diagnosis and therapeutic options for optimal management of complicated peptic ulcers. These guidelines are intended to improve the knowledge and awareness of physicians around the world on this specific topic, providing an up-to-date tool that can aid in the decision-making process. For this reason, the guidelines are evidence-based, and the grade of recommendation is provided to summarize the evidence present in the literature.

The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. The practice guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care based on the best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management. The method should be determined after considering the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those directly engaged therein, not with the consensus group.

### Endoscopic approach to the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding [^1153HFf7]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy is the primary diagnostic and therapeutic modality in the management of gastrointestinal bleeding. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, small bowel enteroscopy, and colonoscopy are well-established standards for the initial evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding, and have been used effectively for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Although thermal, injection, and mechanical methods have been the mainstay of endoscopic therapy, promising new technologies such as endoscopic ultrasound and wireless capsule endoscopy will further advance our ability to improve morbidity and mortality from severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Herein, we review standards and recent advances in the endoscopic management of upper, lower, and obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^116Lkstz]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency presentation requiring prompt resuscitation and management. Peptic ulcers are the most common cause of the condition. Thorough initial management with a structured approach is vital, including appropriate intravenous fluid resuscitation and use of a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7–8 g/dL. Pre-endoscopic scoring tools enable identification of patients at high risk and at very low risk who might benefit from specific management. Endoscopy should be carried out within 24 hours of presentation for patients admitted to hospital, although the optimal timing for patients at a higher risk within this period is less clear.

- **Endoscopic treatment**: Treatment of high-risk lesions and use of subsequent high-dose proton pump inhibitors is a cornerstone of non-variceal bleeding management.

- **Variceal haemorrhage**: Results in higher mortality than non-variceal haemorrhage and, if suspected, antibiotics and vasopressors should be administered urgently, before endoscopy. Oesophageal variceal bleeding requires endoscopic band ligation, whereas bleeding from gastric varices requires thrombin or tissue glue injection. Rebleeding is managed by repeat endoscopic treatment.

- **Uncontrolled bleeding**: If uncontrolled bleeding occurs, interventional radiological embolisation or surgery is required for non-variceal bleeding, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement for variceal bleeding.

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase using the terms "upper gastrointestinal bleeding", "non-variceal bleeding", and "variceal bleeding" for articles published between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021. We also reviewed reference lists from articles that we deemed to be high quality. Preference was given to randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews that have informed guidelines. We included smaller studies if they were of particular note or if other evidence was unavailable; for example, a large case series in the absence of data from randomized controlled trials. In general, case reports and case series were excluded.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111NBVne]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common and potentially life-threatening condition. Defined as bleeding originating proximal to the ligament of Treitz, bleeding from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum can present as hematemesis, melena, or, in the context of severe bleeding and rapid intestinal transit, hematochezia. Coffee ground vomiting can be due to non-bleeding pathology, including obstruction, but might indicate UGIB. In addition to the externalization of blood, patients can present with symptoms of blood loss such as syncope, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

The cause of bleeding can be classified as variceal or non-variceal, with non-variceal including peptic ulcer bleeding. Peptic ulcer bleeding is the most common cause of UGIB despite Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication treatment and proton pump inhibitor use. While the incidence of UGIB has been reported to be declining due to a combination of drug and endotherapeutic interventions, emergency presentation is common, with mortality between 2% and 10%.

Management of UGIB can be considered in three stages: pre-endoscopic management, endoscopic assessment and treatment, and post-endoscopic management. In this article, we review these stages with particular focus on initial management, including risk stratification, resuscitation, and drug treatment.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^114LyWu5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, non-operative management is recommended as the first line of treatment following endoscopy (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C).

Non-operative management incorporates the principles of ABCDE:

- **Airway control**: Ensuring a clear airway.
- **Breathing**: Ventilation and oxygenation.
- **Circulation**: Fluid resuscitation and control of bleeding.
- **Drugs**: Pharmacotherapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), prokinetics, etc.
- **Endoscopy or embolization**: Endoscopy for diagnosis and therapy; embolization for therapeutic use.

A meta-analysis by Barkun et al, which included forty-one randomized trials, demonstrated that all endoscopic therapies decreased rebleeding compared to pharmacotherapy alone. Endoscopy is indicated to establish a diagnosis and provide treatment for bleeding peptic ulcers. In acutely bleeding ulcers, endoscopy is integral to resuscitation.

Endoscopic treatment is recommended for achieving hemostasis, reducing rebleeding, decreasing the need for surgery, and lowering mortality (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C).

We suggest stratifying patients based on the Blatchford score and adopting a risk-stratified management approach (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D):

- In the very low-risk group, outpatient endoscopy is suggested (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

### Diagnosis and treatment of perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers: 2013 WSES position paper [^114mwzGL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Despite adequate initial endoscopic therapy, rebleeding upper gastrointestinal bleeding (reUGIB) can occur in up to 24% of high-risk patients. Mortality after surgical salvage in the recent UK National Audit was 29%.

Large ulcers located in the posterior bulbar duodenum and lesser curvature of the stomach can erode into the gastroduodenal or left gastric artery, respectively, which are predictive of endoscopic treatment failure. These ulcers often occur in elderly patients who present with a major bleed in shock and low initial hemoglobin concentrations. Patients with massive bleeding who do not respond to endoscopy are often shifted to surgical treatment. Angiographic embolization is an alternative when its expertise is immediately available.

Loffroy et al. summarized outcomes in ten case series of 75 patients treated with embolization. The rate of clinical success, rebleeding, and mortality rate was 75%, 25%, and 25%, respectively. In retrospective comparisons of angiographic embolization versus surgery, in patients with perforated or bleeding ulcers (PUB) who do not respond to endoscopic hemostatic attempts, angiographic embolization was associated with reduced treatment-related complications (20–54% vs. 37–68%). Mortality after either treatment was similar (3–30% vs. 14–30%).

A randomized controlled trial compared surgery with further endoscopic treatment for rebleeding. In 75% of these patients, further endoscopic treatment led to durable hemostasis. Patients randomly allocated to surgery had substantially more postoperative complications. However, a subgroup analysis suggested that…

### Risk assessment and outpatient management in bleeding peptic ulcer [^115DGSXe]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: To review clinical and endoscopic variables in patients hospitalized for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to peptic gastroduodenal lesions over a period of 3 years; to identify factors associated with unfavorable evolution; and to evaluate characteristics of patients discharged immediately after endoscopy.

- **Methods**: A 3-year retrospective analysis of all UGIB episodes was performed. Patients with gastroduodenal ulcer or erosive gastritis/duodenitis at endoscopy were included. The prognostic value of several clinical, endoscopic, and analytical variables was assessed. Persistence or recurrence of bleeding, surgery, and mortality were considered as outcome variables; evolution was classified as "unfavorable" when any of these was observed.

- **Results**: A total of 341 patients were identified, with a mean age of 62 years. Melena was the most frequent UGIB presentation (70%). Forty-five percent had associated diseases, and 45% were taking gastroerosive drugs. Duodenal ulcer was the most frequent cause of UGIB (48%), followed by gastric ulcer (32%). The evolution of UGIB was unfavorable in 7% of cases. Variables associated with unfavorable evolution in the multivariate analysis were: systolic blood pressure or ≥ 100 bpm, and a Forrest endoscopic classification of severe. Only 10% of patients were immediately discharged, with no subsequent complications. However, if predictive variables obtained in the multivariate analysis had been used, hospitalization could have been prevented in 115 patients (34%) without subsequent complications.

Pharmacotherapy plays a secondary major role in the treatment of PUB. PPIs can be administered orally or intravenously depending on the rebleeding risk. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 767 PUB patients treated with endoscopic therapy due to high-risk stigmata, high-dose intravenous PPIs (80 mg esomeprazole bolus plus 8 mg/h continuous infusion for 72 hours) significantly reduced rebleeding (5.9% vs. 10.3%, P = 0.03) and the need for endoscopic retreatment.

Similar results were found by meta-analysis; high-dose intravenous PPIs after endoscopic therapy significantly reduced rebleeding, the need for surgery, and mortality compared with placebo or no therapy. PPIs are recommended for 6–8 weeks following UGIB and/or endoscopic treatment of PUD to allow mucosal healing. Once mucosal healing has been achieved, the duration of PPI use remains controversial. Studies have shown that in patients who have PUD complicated by bleeding, there is a 33% risk of rebleeding within 1–2 years. Furthermore, there is a 40%-50% rebleeding risk over the subsequent 10 years following the initial episode of bleeding.

Randomized prospective trials have demonstrated a benefit to long-term acid-suppression therapy in two settings: chronic NSAID users and H. pylori-infected patients. Testing for H. pylori is recommended in all patients with PUB. This should be followed by eradication therapy for those who are H. pylori-positive, with subsequent assessment of the therapy's effect and renewed treatment for those where eradication fails.
