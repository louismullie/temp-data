## Question

Is it safe to use Prolia in patients with a history of breast cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Prolia (denosumab) is safe to use in patients with a history of breast cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is using adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indications and dosing for denosumab in this setting. Next, I will review efficacy and safety data from pivotal trials, followed by guideline positions from ASCO, NCCN, and ESMO. After that, I need to check key safety issues like osteonecrosis of the jaw, hypocalcemia, atypical femur fractures, and rebound vertebral fractures on discontinuation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation with monitoring and discontinuation planning, and clarify when denosumab is not appropriate, such as in metastatic disease where Xgeva is used instead of Prolia.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. In patients with a history of breast cancer, the relevant scenario for Prolia is treatment of therapy-induced bone loss, particularly in postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy, which accelerates bone loss and increases fracture risk. This is distinct from metastatic disease, where denosumab 120 mg every 4 weeks (Xgeva) is used to prevent skeletal-related events, not Prolia 60 mg every 6 months [^1148zJAA].

> I should confirm the regulatory status and labeled dose. The FDA explicitly approves denosumab (Prolia) to treat bone loss in women at high fracture risk who are receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer, at 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months, with calcium and vitamin D supplementation recommended to mitigate hypocalcemia risk [^113Xfd7s] [^115Srxnv] [^113F1eLF].

> Next, I will examine efficacy data. In ABCSG-18, denosumab 60 mg every 6 months reduced clinical fractures by about 50% versus placebo in postmenopausal women on aromatase inhibitors, with significant improvements in bone mineral density and no excess of serious adverse events. Exploratory disease-free survival signals were observed but were not the primary endpoint and should be interpreted cautiously, while D-CARE, which used a higher monthly dose intended to modify recurrence, did not improve bone metastasis–free survival, underscoring that Prolia's role is skeletal protection, not recurrence prevention [^114w2zY2] [^112XRUWM] [^115EkjEk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cancer outcomes; I should verify guideline positions. ASCO-OH (CCO) does not recommend adjuvant denosumab to prevent breast cancer recurrence because D-CARE was negative and ABCSG-18's DFS signal was exploratory, whereas NCCN and ESMO endorse denosumab 60 mg every 6 months to preserve bone mineral density and prevent fractures in postmenopausal patients on aromatase inhibitors, aligning with the FDA indication and fracture-prevention intent rather than recurrence modification [^113iFS6h] [^112hcBz3] [^112goVTs] [^114aNn1W].

> I need to check the major safety signals. Osteonecrosis of the jaw is rare but real. In the osteoporosis dose and population, ABCSG-18 reported no adjudicated ONJ with denosumab 60 mg every 6 months, whereas metastatic-dose regimens (120 mg every 4 weeks) show exposure-dependent ONJ risk around 1–2% per year, rising with longer therapy and invasive dental procedures. Thus, preventive dentistry and avoidance of invasive oral surgery during therapy are essential, and patients with poor dentition or planned oral surgery should be stabilized first [^114w2zY2] [^113U8U3m] [^115SSyvb].

> Let me consider hypocalcemia next. Denosumab can cause hypocalcemia, especially in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or low baseline calcium. I should confirm that calcium is corrected before initiation, ensure adequate vitamin D, and monitor calcium, magnesium, and phosphate during therapy, with heightened vigilance in eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² where severe hypocalcemia risk is higher and requires close monitoring and supplementation [^113F1eLF] [^1142weUg] [^112dh7Re].

> I should double-check musculoskeletal and dermatologic adverse effects. Common adverse reactions include arthralgia, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, and skin rashes or eczema. Patients should be counseled to report persistent or severe pain or new skin reactions, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical femoral fractures with long-term use, though these remain uncommon and are also described with other antiresorptives [^115A6n2z] [^114Ro5K6].

> But wait, what if we stop denosumab? I need to ensure a discontinuation plan. Rebound bone turnover and multiple vertebral fractures can occur after denosumab cessation, particularly with longer durations; therefore, if stopping, transition to a bisphosphonate (for example, zoledronic acid) is recommended to mitigate rebound, with timing individualized to bone turnover markers and BMD trajectory, and drug holidays are not advised with denosumab given the rapid loss of protection on withdrawal [^116tFCwR] [^113FcK2G] [^112vkq7e].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. For postmenopausal breast cancer patients on aromatase inhibitors at high fracture risk, denosumab 60 mg every 6 months significantly reduces fractures and improves BMD with acceptable safety when standard precautions are followed. The main caveats are rare ONJ, manageable hypocalcemia, and the need for a planned transition if therapy ends, while denosumab should not be used to prevent recurrence and is not a substitute for standard oncologic therapy [^114w2zY2] [^112XRUWM] [^113iFS6h].

> I should confirm practical implementation steps. Before starting, obtain baseline DEXA, correct hypocalcemia, ensure calcium and vitamin D intake, and arrange a dental exam with preventive care. During therapy, monitor calcium periodically and reinforce oral hygiene. If discontinuing, arrange bisphosphonate bridging and reassess BMD and fracture risk to guide ongoing management, aligning with oncology and endocrine guidance for cancer treatment–induced bone loss [^112goVTs] [^111v1tQC] [^114aNn1W].

> In summary, yes — Prolia (denosumab 60 mg every 6 months) is safe and appropriate for patients with a history of breast cancer who are on adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy and at high fracture risk, provided preventive dental care, calcium/vitamin D optimization, and planned discontinuation with bisphosphonate transition are implemented. It is not indicated for metastatic disease, where Xgeva is used, and should not be used with the expectation of reducing breast cancer recurrence [^114w2zY2] [^113iFS6h] [^1148zJAA].

Prolia (denosumab) is **safe and effective** for patients with a history of breast cancer who are at high fracture risk, including those on adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy [^113Xfd7s] [^115Srxnv]. It significantly **reduces fractures** and increases bone mass without increasing new malignancies, including breast cancer [^114w2zY2] [^117SK2Hy] [^111UhHqG]. Key risks include hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and rebound vertebral fractures after discontinuation; these are mitigated by correcting hypocalcemia before treatment, ensuring adequate calcium/vitamin D, maintaining oral hygiene, and planning a bisphosphonate transition if stopping denosumab [^113F1eLF] [^114Ro5K6] [^113FcK2G]. Prolia is not recommended for adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence, but is appropriate for osteoporosis management in breast cancer survivors [^112hcBz3] [^111v1tQC].

## Clinical evidence supporting safety in breast cancer patients

### Efficacy and safety in adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy

- **ABCSG-18 trial**: In postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer on aromatase inhibitors, denosumab 60 mg every 6 months reduced clinical fractures by 50% (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39–0.65, p < 0.0001) and increased bone mineral density without excess adverse events or new malignancies [^114w2zY2] [^112XRUWM].

- **Disease-free survival**: Exploratory analyses suggested a modest DFS benefit (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.98), but this was not the primary endpoint and should be interpreted cautiously [^112XRUWM].

- **D-CARE trial**: In high-risk early breast cancer, adjuvant denosumab 120 mg monthly did not improve bone metastasis-free survival and had higher ONJ rates, so it is not recommended for recurrence prevention [^115EkjEk] [^116yxJLj].

---

### Safety profile and adverse events

- **Hypocalcemia**: More frequent than with zoledronic acid; correct calcium before starting and monitor during therapy [^115DqZ7R] [^113F1eLF].

- **Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)**: Rare but serious; risk rises with duration and invasive dental work; maintain oral hygiene and avoid invasive procedures when possible [^113U8U3m] [^115SSyvb].

- **Rebound vertebral fractures**: Can occur after discontinuation; plan a bisphosphonate transition and avoid abrupt stops [^113FcK2G] [^116tFCwR].

- **Infections**: Serious infections (skin, abdominal, urinary, ear, endocarditis) are a concern, especially in immunosuppressed patients [^114Ro5K6].

## Comparison with other bone-modifying agents

| **Attribute** | **Denosumab (prolia)** | **Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid)** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | RANKL inhibition | Osteoclast inhibition |
| Administration | Subcutaneous every 6 months | Intravenous every 3–6 months |
| Renal function | No dose adjustment | Contraindicated if eGFR < 30 mL/min |
| ONJ risk | Similar to bisphosphonates | Similar to denosumab |
| Hypocalcemia | Higher risk | Lower risk |
| Rebound fractures | Yes | No |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **ASCO guidelines**: Recommend denosumab 60 mg every 6 months to prevent fractures in postmenopausal patients on aromatase inhibitors; do not use denosumab to prevent recurrence [^112hcBz3].

- **NCCN guidelines**: Recommend denosumab or bisphosphonates to maintain BMD and reduce fractures in postmenopausal patients on aromatase inhibitors; perform dental exams and preventive dentistry before therapy [^112goVTs].

- **ESMO guidelines**: Denosumab 60 mg every 6 months is a treatment of choice to prevent fractures in postmenopausal patients on aromatase inhibitors [^114aNn1W].

---

## Patient selection criteria and precautions

- **Indications**: High fracture risk on aromatase inhibitors or with osteoporosis/osteopenia and risk factors (age > 65, low BMI, smoking, glucocorticoids) [^114W2Cv5].

- **Contraindications**: Hypocalcemia; correct before starting [^113F1eLF].

- **Precautions**: Monitor calcium, magnesium, and phosphate; assess renal function; evaluate for CKD-MBD in advanced CKD [^112dh7Re] [^1142weUg].

- **Dental care**: Perform dental exams and preventive dentistry before therapy; avoid invasive procedures when possible [^115SSyvb].

---

## Long-term safety considerations

Long-term denosumab therapy (up to 10 years) has a favorable safety profile with sustained fracture protection, but **rebound vertebral fractures** can occur after discontinuation; plan a bisphosphonate transition to mitigate this risk [^116tFCwR] [^113FcK2G].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Prolia is **safe and effective** for patients with a history of breast cancer who are at high fracture risk, including those on adjuvant aromatase inhibitors. It reduces fractures and increases bone mass without increasing new malignancies. Clinicians should manage hypocalcemia, maintain oral hygiene, and plan for discontinuation to minimize rebound fracture risk. Prolia is not recommended for adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence, but is appropriate for osteoporosis management in breast cancer survivors.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

A detailed description of the study design and participant characteristics have been reported in the primary paper (submitted). In brief, we conducted a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at a single academic hospital in Australia, to assess the efficacy of denosumab in preventing bone loss and microstructural deterioration in premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer initiating ovarian function suppression and aromatase inhibition. Participants were stratified by lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD, < or > 1.09 g/cm 2) and BMI (< or > 27 kg/m 2) and then randomized with equal probability to receive denosumab 60-mg or placebo subcutaneously every 6 months.

Premenopausal women aged 18 to 55 years were eligible for inclusion if they had histologically confirmed early-stage ER-positive breast cancer and were intended for combined ovarian function suppression (use of gonadotropin releasing hormone [GnRH] analogs or bilateral oophorectomy) and aromatase inhibition. Women were defined as being premenopausal if they had a regular menstrual cycle in the 3 months prior to their diagnosis of breast cancer.

The main exclusion criteria were ovarian function suppression for longer than 12 weeks at the time of trial inclusion, any previous use of a selective estrogen receptor modulator or bone targeted therapy, glucocorticoid use for more than 14 days within 6 months of enrollment, a BMD T-score < −2.0 SD at the spine or hip, metabolic bone disease, or a history of minimal trauma fractures. Participants were also excluded if they had 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentration < 12 nmol/L, diabetes mellitus, malignant disease (apart from breast cancer and nonmelanoma skin cancer), history of any solid organ or bone marrow transplant, major systemic disease, pregnancy or breastfeeding, excessive alcohol intake, major psychiatric history, osteonecrosis of the jaw, or atypical femoral fractures.

The study protocol was approved by the Austin Health Research Ethics Committee and preregistered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, identifier ACTRN12616001051437. All study participants provided written informed consent before inclusion in the study.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Bone Metastasis from Solid Tumors

The safety of denosumab was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trials [see Clinical Trials (14.1)] in which a total of 2841 patients with bone metastasis from prostate cancer, breast cancer, or other solid tumors, or lytic bony lesions from multiple myeloma received at least one dose of denosumab. In Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, patients were randomized to receive either 120 mg of denosumab every 4 weeks as a subcutaneous injection or 4 mg (dose adjusted for reduced renal function) of zoledronic acid every 4 weeks by intravenous (IV) infusion. Entry criteria included serum calcium (corrected) from 8 to 11.5 mg/dL (2 to 2.9 mmol/L) and creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or greater. Patients who had received IV bisphosphonates were excluded, as were patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental procedure. During the study, serum chemistries including calcium and phosphorus were monitored every 4 weeks. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was recommended but not required.

Bone Mineral Density in Breast Cancer Survivors

Breast cancer treatments such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, chemotherapy, and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) can contribute to bone loss and increase fracture risk. Clinical trials have shown that women taking anastrozole or exemestane experience greater bone mineral density (BMD) loss compared to those on tamoxifen. Meta-analyses of adjuvant trials further confirm that AIs significantly increase fracture risk relative to tamoxifen or placebo, with extended endocrine therapy duration correlating with higher risk. Given these risks, it is essential to assess BMD via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans at baseline and at regular intervals for women on long-term endocrine therapy [168]. While there are no formal guidelines on DEXA scan frequency, monitoring should be individualized to each patient based on baseline T-scores and additional osteoporosis risk factors. Bone targeted therapies can be instituted in women with BMD T-score ≤ −2.5 or between −1.0 and −2.5 with additional risk factors for fracture, or history of fragility fractures. Bone-targeted therapies, such as IV or oral bisphosphonates, are typically first-line due to their cost-effectiveness and established safety profile. However, denosumab is a suitable alternative for patients who cannot tolerate bisphosphonates or have contraindications. Potential side effects of bisphosphonates include flu-like symptoms, renal impairment, atypical femur fractures, and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Notably, denosumab carries a risk of rebound fractures after discontinuation. The optimal duration of bone-protective therapy remains uncertain but should be tailored based on BMD trends, treatment response, and ongoing fracture risk.

### Postmenopausal osteoporosis: a clinical review [^113fbdn2]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

In postmenopausal women, osteoporotic fractures are more common than stroke, myocardial infarction, and breast cancer combined, and fractures can be costly and result in disability or death. Because there are no signs or symptoms of osteoporosis other than fracture, risk assessment is necessary to identify those at higher risk for clinical events. For women, a clinical fracture risk assessment (FRAX) is appropriate at menopause. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement is recommended for women at age 65, and earlier for those who have risk factors. Adequate calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise are important for bone health at all ages, and those at high risk for fracture based on BMD or FRAX should be offered medical therapy to reduce fracture risk after an appropriate medical evaluation. Bisphosphonates can accumulate in bone, so after a period of treatment, lower risk patients may be offered a period off drug therapy. However, the effects of denosumab are not sustained when treatment is discontinued, so there is no "drug holiday" with denosumab. Anabolic therapy can be offered to those with higher risk for fracture. Although rare safety concerns regarding atypical femoral fracture and osteonecrosis of the jaw have received prominent attention, for patients who are appropriately treated according to National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines, the benefit of hip fracture risk reduction far outweighs the risk of these uncommon side effects. Accurate information for patients and shared decision-making are important for acceptance and persistent with appropriate treatment.

### Response to letter to the editors-safety of long-term denosumab therapy [^111Aj6mS]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In both the primary SRE trial manuscripts, the number of positively adjudicated ONJ cases was reported up to the primary analysis (PA) cutoff date of 06-Mar-2009 for the breast cancer and 30-Oct-2009 for the prostate cancer trials. For the Stopeck et al. safety manuscript, the total number of positively adjudicated ONJ cases (breast and prostate cancer patients) during the blinded treatment phase refers to the data up to the end-of-blinded treatment phase (DBE) cutoff date (20-Jul-2009 for the breast and 26-Feb-10 for the prostate cancer trial), which occurred approximately 4 months after the PA cutoff date. The DBE time period is where the additional, positively adjudicated ONJ cases were accrued for both the denosumab and zoledronic arms when compared to the primary SRE trials. In the breast cancer trial, the numbers of positively adjudicated ONJ cases in denosumab arm vs zoledronic acid arm were 20 (2.0%) vs 14 (1.4%) by PA cutoff and increased to 26 (2.5%) vs 18 (1.8%) by DBE cutoff. In the prostate cancer trial, the numbers were 22 (2.3%) and 12 (1.3%) by PA cutoff and increase to 23 (2.4%) and 13 (1.4%) by DBE cutoff. In both trials, ONJ rates were not statistically higher for denosumab compared with zoledronic acid based on the data up to DBE. This conclusion is consistent with results based on PA data as reported in the original PA for the breast and prostate cancer populations.

We agree that patients on antiresorptive therapies should be diligently monitored for oral complication, encouraged to practice good oral hygiene, and referred to a trained dental health professional for dental symptoms.

### Response to letter to the editors-safety of long-term denosumab therapy [^115nU3rQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The higher reported ONJ rates in the OLE safety manuscript are due to the higher cumulative exposure of the respective antiresorptive treatment. For example, the denosumab/denosumab patient group (n = 318 for breast and n = 147 for prostate cancer) in the OLE analysis was exposed to denosumab during the blinded treatment phase until the completion of the blinded treatment phase, with additional denosumab exposure in the OLE phase for up to 2 years. Therefore, the median cumulative denosumab exposure was 43.0 months for breast cancer (n = 318) and 36.9 months for prostate cancer (n = 147) groups. The resulting ONJ rates are higher for these denosumab/denosumab patients in the OLE phase of these two studies, which are expected and consistent with the observation that ONJ risk increases with longer exposure of denosumab as documented in the XGEVA® prescribing information. The patient-year adjusted incidence of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of denosumab treatment, 3.7% in the second year, and 4.6% per year thereafter. The ONJ rates reported in Table 3 of the OLE safety manuscript are the rates for the OLE phase only. For both primary SRE studies, patients who had positively adjudicated ONJ during the blinded treatment phase were not enrolled in the OLE phase.
3) What were the guidelines used for determining positively adjudicated ONJ at the time of analysis?

### Use of adjuvant bisphosphonates and other bone-modifying agents in breast cancer: ASCO-OH (CCO) guideline update [^116yxJLj]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

D-CARE — early-stage (stage II-III) high-risk patients (N+, T3, or T4) — evaluated denosumab 120 mg subcutaneous once per month for 6 months then once every 3 months for a total of 5 years versus placebo (N = 4,509). After at least 5 years of follow-up there was no significant difference in bone metastasis–free survival (HR = 0.97, (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.14), P = .70); DFS was 80% versus 81% with HR = 1.04 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.19); distant recurrence-free survival showed HR = 1.06, (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.21), P = .41; and overall survival HR = 1.03, (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.25), P = .76. Grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs) included neutropenia 15% versus 15%, febrile neutropenia 5% versus 6%, and leukopenia 3% versus 3%; positively adjudicated ONJ occurred in 122 versus 4 patients (5% versus < 1%) with hypocalcemia 7% versus 4%, and treatment discontinuation occurred in 904 versus 807 patients.

### Denosumab and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women: a population-based cohort study [^1171hwRy]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Despite these limitations, our study had several strengths, in particular, the use of large provincial administrative datasets, allowing for well-powered analyses and matching on relevant confounders. Our exposed and unexposed groups were similar with respect to most demographic characteristics, prior history of bisphosphonate use and other medications that may impact bone health (e.g. estrogen therapy, calcitonin), comorbidities, as well as, health care utilization patterns. Comprehensive ODB drug data permits capture of oral bisphosphonate therapy since 1996, matching on age and calendar time helps control for changes in osteoporosis management and therapy over time.

In conclusion, we found a small inverse relationship between denosumab exposure and breast cancer incidence in this large population-based study of older women residing in Ontario, Canada. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of denosumab use and subsequent breast cancer risk. Further studies with a longer follow-up period, as well as the inclusion of younger women or cohorts of high-risk women, are necessary to delineate the role of RANK-inhibition in the prevention of breast cancer. It is of importance to establish whether denosumab, administered subcutaneously as a semi-annual injection with a safe toxicity profile, has the potential to be used in the primary prevention setting.

3.5 Osteoporosis Therapy in Breast Cancer

To optimise bone health in breast cancer survivors, international guidelines recommend optimisation of lifestyle including a well‐balanced diet and exercise, as previously discussed. Exercise has multiple benefits including improved BMD, quality of life, reduced aromatase inhibitor‐associated arthralgia, and possible improved breast cancer outcomes. Antiresorptive medication initiation with AI is recommended in the setting of: T‐score < ‐2 or where ≥ 2 fracture risk factors are present (age > 65 years, BMI < 20, T score < ‐1.5, family history of hip fracture, personal history of fragility fracture after age 50, current/previous smoking and oral glucocorticoid use > 6 months). Bisphosphonates and denosumab both increase BMD but fracture outcomes for bisphosphonates are lacking. Reduced fracture risk has been reported with denosumab compared with placebo in women treated with AIs, but improved survival has been observed in women receiving bisphosphonates.

Recommended therapies include weekly alendronate and risedronate, monthly ibandronate, and 6 monthly zoledronic acid and denosumab. Concerns about discontinuation of denosumab exist as they do in the general population, with more research needed regarding the optimal transition to bisphosphonates if denosumab is discontinued. Teriparatide is contraindicated in women with a prior history of radiotherapy. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding romosozumab.

3.6 Frail and Older Patients Over 75 Years of Age

Absolute fracture risk rises with age and is highest in the older adult population, largely related to the risk of falls. A multidisciplinary and holistic approach is needed to address fracture prevention in older adults, beyond osteoporosis medications alone.

Consideration should be given to reducing falls risk with review of:
1 Environmental risks (including the need for mobility aids),
2 Risk for sarcopenia and consideration of dedicated, supervised exercise programs for falls risk reduction (particularly focusing on strength and balance),
3 Nutrition, particularly protein and dietary calcium intake, and risk factors for malabsorption,
4 Vitamin D status, sun exposure and supplementation as required,
5 Potential 'falls‐risk increasing drugs', such as psychotropics or sedatives, and the cumulative effect of polypharmacy.

Choice of osteoporosis therapy depends on patient factors, including competing health issues, medication adherence, and life expectancy. Antiresorptives and osteoanabolic agents are effective for vertebral fracture risk reduction in older populations and zoledronic acid and risedronate have shown efficacy in reducing non‐vertebral fractures.

### Bone-modifying agents in early breast cancer: making sense of conflicting data [^116Dwk1B]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of adjuvant bone-modifying agents to reduce risk of recurrence in patients with early-stage breast cancer has not been widely embraced because of conflicting data and small absolute benefits. The clinical practice guideline produced jointly by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and Cancer Care Ontario recommends discussion of risks/benefits with postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer about adjuvant bisphosphonates and does not recommend use of adjuvant denosumab to prevent breast cancer recurrence. 1.

### Adjuvant denosumab in early breast cancer (D-CARE): an international, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^115EkjEk]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to, and inhibits, the receptor activator of RANKL (TNFSF11) and might affect breast cancer biology, as shown by preclinical evidence. We aimed to assess whether denosumab combined with standard-of-care adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic therapy and locoregional treatments would increase bone metastasis-free survival in women with breast cancer.

Method

In this international, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (D-CARE), patients were recruited from 389 centres in 39 countries. We enrolled women (aged ≥ 18 years) with histologically confirmed stage II or III breast cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. On eligibility confirmation, investigators at each site telephoned an interactive voice response system to centrally randomly assign patients (1:1) based on a fixed stratified permuted block randomisation list (block size 4) to receive either denosumab (120 mg) or matching placebo subcutaneously every 3–4 weeks, starting with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, for about 6 months and then every 12 weeks for a total duration of 5 years. Stratification factors were breast cancer therapy, lymph node status, hormone receptor and HER2 status, age, and geographical region. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoint of bone metastasis-free survival. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01077154.

Findings

Between June 2, 2010, and Aug 24, 2012, 4509 women were randomly assigned to receive denosumab (n = 2256) or placebo (n = 2253) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The primary analysis of the study was done when all patients had the opportunity to complete 5 years of follow-up with an analysis data cutoff date of Aug 31, 2017. The primary endpoint of bone metastasis-free survival was not significantly different between the groups (median not reached in either group; hazard ratio 0·97, 95% CI 0·82–1·14; p = 0·70). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events, reported in patients who had at least one dose of the investigational product (2241 patients with denosumab vs 2218 patients with placebo), were neutropenia (340 [15%] vs 328 [15%]), febrile neutropenia (112 [5%] vs 142 [6%]), and leucopenia (62 [3%] vs 61 [3%]). Positively adjudicated osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in 122 (5%) of 2241 patients treated with denosumab versus four (< 1%) of 2218 patients treated with placebo; treatment-emergent hypocalcaemia occurred in 152 (7%) versus 82 (4%). Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the placebo group due to acute myeloid leukaemia and depressed level of consciousness.

Interpretation

Despite preclinical evidence suggesting RANKL inhibition might delay bone metastasis or disease recurrence in patients with early-stage breast cancer, in this study, denosumab did not improve disease-related outcomes for women with high-risk early breast cancer.

### Denosumab and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women: a population-based cohort study [^111UhHqG]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Denosumab inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) pathway and is used to treat osteoporosis. Emerging evidence suggests RANK-blockade may play a role in mammary tumourigenesis. Thus, we undertook a population-based study of denosumab use and breast cancer risk in a large cohort of postmenopausal women.

Methods

We included women 67+ years with prior bisphosphonate use who filled a first prescription for denosumab. They were matched on age, date, cumulative prior use of and time since last use of a bisphosphonate to women with no history of denosumab. Cox proportional hazards was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of breast cancer with denosumab use.

Results

A total of 100,368 women were included in the analysis with 1271 incident breast cancer events. Denosumab use was associated with a 13% decreased breast cancer risk (HR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.76–1.00). There was no relationship between increasing number of denosumab doses and breast cancer risk (P -trend = 0.15).

Conclusion

These findings suggest a potential protective effect of ever denosumab use on breast cancer risk in a cohort of older women previously treated with bisphosphonates.

### Safety of long-term denosumab therapy: results from the open label extension phase of two phase 3 studies in patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancer [^113Ekv3t]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody with a half-life of several weeks and is not eliminated via the kidneys compared with bisphosphonates, which are primarily eliminated renally, bind to hydroxyapatite, and may remain sequestered in bones for many years. Beyond the previously described differences in clinical efficacy, denosumab's mechanism of action and its more rapid reversibility may make the antibody a better option especially for patients susceptible to bisphosphonate-related complications, or those with compromised renal function. As with previous reports for patients who switched from ZA treatment to denosumab treatment, there were no apparent safety issues associated with the change in treatment.

Additionally, the prolonged use of denosumab in these patients for a median 19.1 months of Q4W therapy was associated with no newly identified safety signals, no unexpected toxicity, and no requirement for dose reductions or changes in the dosing schedule. No events of atypical femoral fractures were noted in the three pivotal phase 3 denosumab trials in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. However, this complication has been reported rarely in patients receiving oral or IV bisphosphonates and more recently with denosumab at 60 mg every 6 months (Prolia ®) for osteoporosis, as well as in one case following long-term dosing with denosumab 120 mg Q4W (XGEVA ®) in an unapproved indication. Thus, patients should be informed regarding this potential risk with long-term bone-targeted therapy.

### Safety of long-term denosumab therapy: results from the open label extension phase of two phase 3 studies in patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancer [^112HLvke]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

Adults with breast or castration-resistant prostate cancer and radiographic evidence of at least one bone metastasis were enrolled as previously described. Both studies were conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration and the International Conference on Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Approvals from appropriate research ethics committees were obtained from each study center, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Treatment

In the double-blinded treatment phase, patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous (SC) denosumab (120 mg every 4 week (Q4W)) plus intravenous (IV) placebo or SC placebo plus IV ZA (4 mg Q4W) (Fig. 1). Following the positive results of the primary analysis, the patients were offered continued treatment with denosumab for up to 2 additional years during an open-label extension treatment phase. Patients initially randomized to denosumab during the blinded treatment phase (denosumab/denosumab group) continued to receive denosumab at 120 mg Q4W. Patients initially randomized to ZA during the blinded phase and then switched to denosumab in the open-label phase (ZA/denosumab group) were treated with denosumab at 120 mg Q4W starting 4 weeks from their last ZA dose. Patients who declined further therapy in the open-label extension phase, or who did not complete the blinded treatment phase, continued follow-up for survival every 12 weeks (Q12W) for up to 2 years after their last dose in the blinded treatment phase.

Fig. 1
Study design and treatment schema, SC subcutaneous, IV intravenous, Q4W every 4 weeks

Safety outcomes

Adverse events were monitored and potential osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) events were adjudicated by an independent committee of dentists and oral surgeons. ONJ rates were calculated as a ratio of the total number of adjudicated positive ONJ events and the total patient-years of follow-up, as patients were treated for different lengths of time. Eligible patients who enrolled in the open-label phase of the trials and received at least one dose of open-label denosumab were included in the safety analyses.

6.1 		 	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Bone Metastasis from Solid Tumors

The safety of Xgeva was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trials [see Clinical Trials (14.1)] in which a total of 2841 patients with bone metastasis from prostate cancer, breast cancer, or other solid tumors, or lytic bony lesions from multiple myeloma received at least one dose of Xgeva. In Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, patients were randomized to receive either 120 mg of Xgeva every 4 weeks as a subcutaneous injection or 4 mg (dose adjusted for reduced renal function) of zoledronic acid every 4 weeks by intravenous (IV) infusion. Entry criteria included serum calcium (corrected) from 8 to 11.5 mg/dL (2 to 2.9 mmol/L) and creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or greater. Patients who had received IV bisphosphonates were excluded, as were patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental procedure. During the study, serum chemistries including calcium and phosphorus were monitored every 4 weeks. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was recommended but not required.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of denosumab in the prevention of skeletal-related events among patients with breast cancer with bone metastasis in India [^114txiQo]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women in India, with more than 178,361 incident cases in 2020. Approximately 20%-25% of cases present with upfront metastatic disease, categorized into molecular subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–enriched, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Advanced breast cancer eventually develops bone metastases, increasing the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs). SREs, which include pathologic fracture, hypercalcemia of malignancy, spinal cord compression, orthopedic surgical intervention, and palliative bone radiation, have a deleterious effect on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and higher medical costs.

The introduction of bone-modifying agents (BMAs) has revolutionized the management of SREs in patients suffering from BC with bone metastases. Several studies show that BMAs reduce SREs, fractures, hypercalcemia, pain medication use, prevent osteoporotic fractures, and reduce the need for bone-directed radiation therapy and/or surgery. There are two primary classes of BMAs, namely bisphosphonates, for example, zoledronic acid (ZA), and RANK ligand inhibitor denosumab. The recommended dosage of denosumab is 120 mg given once every 4 weeks via a subcutaneous route, while ZA 4 mg is given once every 4 weeks or 12 weeks via an intravenous route, for a minimum duration of 2 years, which may be extended depending upon the clinical profile of the patient. The BMAs are given along with antineoplastic therapy in patients with BC with bone metastases.

Recently published evidence from large randomized controlled trials suggests that denosumab is clinically superior to ZA for preventing and delaying time to first and subsequent SREs among patients with BC with bone metastases.- In addition, denosumab is administered subcutaneously and is safe for patients with deranged renal function tests. However, lack of significant differences in the pain control, HRQoL, overall survival (OS), and higher cost of denosumab may influence treatment choice in favor of ZA, for resource-limited settings.

Published evidence on cost-effectiveness indicates that denosumab may not be cost-effective compared with ZA without a patient access scheme. Although few studies found denosumab to be more cost-effective than ZA once every 4 weeks in prostate cancer, BC, and other solid tumors, others have reported ZA to be a more cost-effective option than denosumab. -

### Response to letter to the editors-safety of long-term denosumab therapy [^116foK7G]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Dear Editors,

We would like to thank Drs. Fusco, Bedogni, Addeo, and Campisi and Drs. Boissieu and Trenque for their interest and review of our study report.

Our long-term safety study was based on denosumab exposure (Q4W, 120 mg SC dosing) and focused on the identification of any new safety signals as well as known adverse events such as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in patients with either advanced breast or prostate cancer. The data were taken from the primary skeletal-related events (SRE) trials and their respective open-label extension (OLE) phases (up to 2 additional years). Adverse events were monitored and potential ONJ events were adjudicated by an independent committee of oral surgeons and dentists. Patient-year adjusted event rates of adjudicated positive ONJ were summarized.

In the first Letter To The Editor by Fusco et al. the authors comments are as follows:
Provide clarity of median denosumab exposure.

As originally described in Stopeck et al. the median denosumab exposure (range) for the primary and the OLE phases combined was 19.1 months (0.1–59.8 months) for the breast cancer population (n = 1019) and 12.0 (0.1–67.2 months) for the prostate cancer population (n = 942). There was some confusion by Fusco et al. on the length of time for the median denosumab exposure of the OLE phase only, which we originally reported in Stopeck et al. as 17.6 months (0–23.7 months) for the breast cancer population (n = 318) and 12.0 months (0.1–23.3 months) for the prostate cancer population (n = 147).
2) Clarify why the ONJ rates reported in the OLE safety manuscript are higher than what was originally reported for the primary analyses of the primary SRE studies.

D-CARE phase III trial — adjuvant denosumab in stage II/III breast cancer: Women with stage II or III disease were randomly assigned to denosumab 120 mg (n = 2,256) or placebo (n = 2,253) given subcutaneously once about every 4 weeks for approximately 6 months, then once every 12 weeks for a total duration of 5 years, with median follow-up 67.3 months for placebo and 67.2 months for denosumab. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed no difference in bone metastasis-free survival (median not reached in either group; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.14). Safety analyses showed neutropenia 340/2,241 (15%) versus 328/2,218 (15%), febrile neutropenia 5% versus 6%, and leukopenia 3% versus 3% for denosumab versus placebo; positively adjudicated osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in 122/2,241 (5%) versus four/2,218 (< 1%).

Breast cancer — Bone health during adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy — The panel discourages the selective ER modulators to treat osteoporosis or osteopenia in patients with breast cancer, whereas the use of a bisphosphonate (oral/IV) or denosumab is recommended to maintain or to improve bone mineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant AI therapy. Optimal duration of either therapy has not been established and the optimal duration and benefits beyond 3 years is not known; there are case reports of spontaneous fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Patients treated with bisphosphonates or denosumab should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.

### Role of denosumab in breast cancer [^116k8At6]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Recent advances in adjuvant treatment have improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with early stage breast cancer. However, up to one third of women will experience tumour recurrence, with bone being a common metastatic site. Current treatment options for metastases to bone comprise systemic antitumour therapy, irradiation, surgery and biphosphonates. As osteoclast activation is mediated by the receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK)/RANK ligand pathway and inhibited by osteoprotegerin (OPG), it was suggested that inhibition of this system may treat bone metastases. Recombinant Fc-OPG was evaluated in women with osteoporosis and malignant bone disease. The fully human antibody denosumab has demonstrated superior activity in reducing markers of bone turnover; therefore this drug was further developed in clinical settings. In advanced breast cancer, denosumab reduced urinary-N-telopeptide:creatinine ratio with potentially fewer side effects compared with bisphosphonates. Proof of direct antitumor activity is missing. Here we review the development and current status of denosumab in breast cancer. Data were obtained by searching the Medline database and abstracts from the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting, European Cancer organization (ECCO), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, using search terms including bone metastases, bisphosphonates, breast cancer, denosumab, osteoprotegerin, RANK and skeletal-related events.

Severe Mineral/Electrolyte Abnormalities

Severe hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium less than 7 mg/dL or less than 1.75 mmol/L) occurred in 3.1% of patients treated with denosumab and 1.3% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. Of patients who experienced severe hypocalcemia, 33% experienced 2 or more episodes of severe hypocalcemia and 16% experienced 3 or more episodes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus less than 2 mg/dL or less than 0.6 mmol/L) occurred in 15% of patients treated with denosumab and 7% of patients treated with zoledronic acid.

Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)

In the primary treatment phases of Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, ONJ was confirmed in 1.8% of patients in the denosumab group (median exposure of 12.0 months; range: 0.1–41) and 1.3% of patients in the zoledronic acid group. The trials in patients with breast (Study 20050136) or prostate (Study 20050103) cancer included an open-label extension treatment phase where patients were offered denosumab 120 mg once every 4 weeks (median overall exposure of 14.9 months; range: 0.1–67.2). The patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.7% in the second year, and 4.6% per year thereafter. The median time to ONJ was 20.6 months (range: 4–53) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

In a placebo-controlled clinical trial with an extension treatment phase evaluating denosumab for the prevention of bone metastases in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (a patient population for which denosumab is not indicated), with longer treatment exposure of up to 7 years, the patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3% in the second year, and 7% per year thereafter.

### Denosumab and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women: a population-based cohort study [^113rWW6f]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The drug denosumab is an anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody which is used to treat osteoporosis and prevent skeletal damage caused by breast cancer metastases.RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB) and its ligand (RANKL) are known for their involvement in bone metabolism. Binding of RANKL to RANK on osteoclast precursors induces osteoclast maturation and activation, thereby stimulating bone resorption. In contrast, binding of RANKL either pharmacologically or by osteoprotegerin (OPG — the endogenous decoy receptor for RANKL) inhibits the RANKL-mediated signaling pathway, consequently inhibiting bone resorption and maintaining bone density. A large trial of over 7000 older women with osteoporosis demonstrated that denosumab significantly reduced the risk of fractures. Based on those findings, denosumab was added to the Ontario Drug Benefits formulary in 2012 for the treatment of osteoporosis under restricted criteria that requires prior exposure to, or hypersensitivity following oral bisphosphonate use. It is estimated that 1% of older women in Ontario have initiated this drug annually since its addition to the provincial drug formulary. The typical schedule for denosumab is one subcutaneous injection every 6 months.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of denosumab SC (also known as Prolia, Xgeva, Stoboclo, Osenvelt, Ospomyv, Xbryk):
- Cutaneous adverse reactions: maintain a high level of suspicion, as denosumab may cause dermatitis, eczema, and rashes.
- Femoral fracture: maintain a high level of suspicion, as denosumab has been associated with an increased risk of atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures.
- Hypercalcemia: use caution when discontinuing denosumab in patients with giant cell tumor of bone and in patients with growing skeletons. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, measure serum calcium periodically, and re-evaluate the need for calcium and vitamin D supplementation after discontinuation.
- Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: use caution in patients with poor oral hygiene, periodontal and/or other dental diseases, ill-fitting dentures, undergoing invasive dental procedures, having comorbid disorders (such as cancer, anemia, coagulopathy, infection), or receiving chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or angiogenesis inhibitors. Perform a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry before initiating denosumab.
- Musculoskeletal pain: maintain a high level of suspicion, as denosumab may cause bone, joint, and muscle pain.
- Serious infections: use caution in patients with immunosuppression, as denosumab has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, including skin, intra-abdominal, urinary tract, ear infections, and endocarditis.
- Suppression of bone turnover: maintain a high level of suspicion, as denosumab has been associated with a significant suppression of bone turnover and bone remodeling.
- Vertebral fracture: use caution when discontinuing denosumab in patients with osteoporosis, as fracture risk increases after discontinuation. Switch to an alternative antiresorptive therapy when denosumab is being discontinued.

### Denosumab for cancer-related bone loss [^115C9CVQ]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prolonged use of anti-cancer treatments in breast and prostate tumors alters physiological bone turnover leading to adverse skeletal related events, such as osteoporosis, loss of bone mass, and increased risk of fractures. These complications known as cancer treatment-induced bone loss (CTIBL) should be managed with bone targeting agents such as the bisphosphonates and denosumab. The latter is a monoclonal antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL) that suppresses osteoclasts function and survival increasing bone mass.

Areas Covered

This review will focus on the mechanisms associated with bone loss induced by cancer treatments and the most recent evidence about the use of denosumab as preventive and therapeutic strategy to protect bone health. Moreover, we will discuss several key aspects regarding the clinical practical use of denosumab to optimize the management of CTLIB in breast and prostate cancer.

Expert Opinion

Denosumab treatment strongly prevents cancer therapies-related skeletal issues in breast and prostate cancer with a good safety profile. Adjuvant six-monthly denosumab delays the time to first fracture onset in early stage breast cancer patients with normal or altered bone mineral density (BMD). Similarly, denosumab treatment is able to prevent fractures and BMD loss in nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients.

### Denosumab for treatment of breast cancer bone metastases and beyond [^114BxDEP]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bone metastases develop in approximately 70–85% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, are incurable and can result in debilitating skeletal complications. Bone-modifying agents to treat breast cancer bone metastases include bisphosphonates. Denosumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG2 antibody targeting receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and provides an alternative therapy for treatment of breast cancer bone metastases.

Areas Covered

This review provides an overview on denosumab and the RANKL-RANK pathway. Denosumab pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety and tolerability are discussed. Based on the review of clinical studies, denosumab is efficacious in the treatment of breast cancer bone metastases. Adverse events rates of denosumab are similar to those for bisphosphonates. Preclinical studies have indicated a role of the RANKL-RANK pathway in non-bone-related mechanisms such as mammary gland development and tumorigenesis.

Expert Opinion

Clinical use of denosumab remains limited and its place in therapy will continue to be defined. Clinical questions, such as the optimal duration of therapy, remain unanswered and need to be addressed.

### Randomized trial of denosumab in patients receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitors for nonmetastatic breast cancer [^117SK2Hy]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy is well established in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, but such therapy is complicated by accelerated bone loss and increased fracture risk. We investigated the ability of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand, to protect against aromatase inhibitor-induced bone loss.

Patients and Methods

Eligible women with hormone receptor-positive nonmetastatic breast cancer treated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy were stratified by duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy (≤ 6 v > 6 months), received supplemental calcium and vitamin D, and were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 125) or subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg (n = 127) every 6 months. At enrollment, all patients were required to have evidence of low bone mass, excluding osteoporosis. The primary end point was percentage change from baseline at month 12 in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD).

Results

At 12 and 24 months, lumbar spine BMD increased by 5.5% and 7.6%, respectively, in the denosumab group versus placebo (P < .0001 at both time points). Increases were observed as early as 1 month and were not influenced by duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy. Increases in BMD were also observed at the total hip, total body, femoral neck, and the predominantly cortical one-third radius. Bone turnover markers decreased with denosumab treatment. Overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) was similar between treatment groups.

Conclusion

In women with nonmetastatic breast cancer and low bone mass who were receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy, twice-yearly administration of denosumab led to significant increases in BMD over 24 months at trabecular and cortical bone, with overall AE rates similar to those of placebo.

The characteristics of the breast cancer patients are summarized in Table 3 by history of denosumab use. On average, women in the denosumab group had slightly more nodal involvement compared to women in the no denosumab group (mean nodal involvement 1.1 vs. 0.6); however, this was only different for the continuous variable (number of nodes) and not the type of nodal involvement (positive or negative). The two groups were similar with respect to various factors including stage, size, grade, hormone-receptor status or HER2 status of the incident breast cancers.

Breast cancer characteristics of all women and by denosumab use

In a sensitivity analysis, the inclusion cohort was re-matched such that the index date for denosumab users was 6 months following their initial injection to allow for a 6 month lag period between denosumb use and breast cancer risk. The findings did not change considerably. For example, the HR comparing users vs. non-users was 0.86 (95% CI 0.74–0.99; P = 0.04)(data not shown).

### Bone health and denosumab discontinuation in oncology populations [^113FcK2G]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

The literature regarding denosumab cessation specifically in cancer survivors is limited. The only prospective data come from a phase II follow-up study of women with breast cancer. The preliminary results of this study demonstrate that in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, early breast cancer treated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy, those that ceased denosumab after a median of 7 doses had significantly higher risk of developing clinical vertebral fractures over the follow-up period of 36 months compared with those who ceased placebo (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.12–5.32). Risk of MVF was also increased, but this did not reach statistical significance (HR 3.52, 95% CI 0.98–12.64). However, whether the risk of rebound fractures extends to patients with skeletal metastases where denosumab is prescribed at higher doses has not been defined as evidence is currently limited to case reports.

Given the association between denosumab discontinuation and the "rebound phenomenon", the current position from osteoporosis-focused guidelines is that a denosumab drug holiday is not recommended. As there are well-established data demonstrating relatively low rates of adverse effects associated with up to 10 years of denosumab therapy, one option when using denosumab is to continue treatment indefinitely as life-long preventative therapy. Of note, in individuals with cancer where denosumab is administered for the treatment of bone metastases, discontinuation of denosumab is usually only considered in those with good prognostic features (ie, oligometastatic disease, a perceived low risk of bone complications and a durable response to systemic therapy). Therefore, long-term treatment with denosumab may already be implemented in a large proportion of patients with bone metastases. In contrast, among patients where denosumab is prescribed purely to protect against the detrimental impact of cancer therapies on bone loss and fragility fracture risk (ie, ADT, endocrine therapy), the duration of denosumab therapy often corresponds with the duration of the cancer therapy. As the duration of cancer therapy can vary significantly from patient to patient, lifelong denosumab may not always be an appropriate option, and choosing an alternate antiresorptive therapy or plans to support bone health in the setting of discontinuation of denosumab must be considered. Other clinical scenarios where discontinuation of denosumab should be considered include:

### Safety of long-term denosumab therapy: results from the open label extension phase of two phase 3 studies in patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancer [^114kPaee]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

During the blinded treatment phase, the combined incidence, adjusted for years of patient follow-up, of positively adjudicated ONJ for both trials was 49 (1.9%) in the denosumab group and 31 (1.2%) in the ZA group. The patient incidence of ONJ during the open-label extension phase, not adjusted for years of patient follow-up, was 32 (6.9%) in the denosumab/denosumab group and 25 (5.5%) in the ZA/denosumab group. Incidence by study is shown in Table 3. Most of the events of ONJ in the open-label phases were mild or moderate in severity and were treated conservatively. A history of tooth extraction, poor oral hygiene, and/or use of a dental appliance was documented in 53 (93%) patients who developed ONJ; tooth extractions accounted for 26 (49%) of these cases. For patients initially randomized to denosumab, the median (Q1, Q3) time from blinded treatment initiation to the onset of ONJ was 20.6 (14.0, 30.5) months overall for the full study period in both studies combined. In the breast cancer study, 37% received conservative treatment (mouth rinses and antibiotics) and 63% had limited surgical treatment (i.e. sequestrectomy, debridement, and curettage). In the prostate cancer study, 47% of patients had conservative management, and 52% had limited surgical treatments; one patient required a partial maxillary resection.

Among all patients who developed ONJ across blinded and open-label extension phases, 35/83 (42%) patients in the breast cancer study and 15/57 (26%) in the prostate cancer study had resolution of ONJ, defined as complete mucosal coverage of exposed bone. The median (Q1, Q3) time to ONJ resolution was 7.9 (3.4, 13.4) months in the denosumab/denosumab and 9.2 (8.0, 16.7) months in the ZA/denosumab groups for the breast cancer study, and 10.0 (5.3, 14.9) months and 13.0 (6.5, 23.2) months, respectively, for the prostate cancer study. Eleven (13%) and 22 (40%) patients in the breast and prostate cancer studies, respectively, died before ONJ resolution.

### Interpreting results from oncology clinical trials: a comparison of denosumab to zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in cancer patients [^111ib1qs]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Because NNTs and NNHs are presented as single numbers, the variability of treatment benefit may not be fully conveyed. Using confidence intervals (CI) is a way to account for this. From a practical point of view, the 95% CI of the NNT and NNH can be calculated by taking the reciprocal of the 95% CI limits of the difference in event rates between the experimental and control groups. For example, if the new chemotherapy agent reduces breast cancer recurrences by 10% with the 95% CI being between 8 and 12%, the NNT would be 10 with a 95% CI from 9 to 13 (i.e. 1/0.12 = 8.3 and 1/0.08 = 12.5; all NNTs should be rounded up to the nearest whole number).

One must also be aware that a calculated NNT represents the "average" for all patients who were enrolled into the randomized trial. This is helpful from an epidemiological point of view, but does not fully account for the potential differences in baseline disease risk between a clinician's own patient population and those who were enrolled into the trial. Similarly, NNT assumes that a given RRR is identical across patients with different levels of risk. However, most of the benefit may be limited to the intermediate- and high-risk groups.

Subgroup analyses are very common in oncology clinical trials, but some of these analyses are not preplanned. Such unplanned analyses are very tempting to perform following a large trial because investigators are often interested in identifying the patient subgroups where benefit is maximized. However, performing multiple tests on a sample of data increases the risk of identifying statistically significant results by chance alone. What is problematic in the clinical literature is that we have no idea how many statistical tests have been performed relative to the number that are presented in the published paper. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis only uses a portion of the original data and it is often underpowered to detect true differences between selected patient subpopulations. In order to minimize these potential biases, one should only estimate the NNT and NNH on the primary endpoint and in subgroups that were both preplanned and have a logical biological basis.

The final point to consider is that NNT and NNH analyses are often interpreted from a public health standpoint and can be used to guide medical resource allocation. Yet, NNT and NNH ignore the cost to treat each patient. Therefore, they are most useful when considered in a broader context.

### Is twice-yearly denosumab beneficial in postmenopausal women with osteopenia but no history of fracture? [^116b9ZHT]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

This Practice Point commentary discusses the findings and limitations of the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of twice-yearly denosumab to be performed in postmenopausal women with low BMD but no previous fracture. Bone et al. found that treatment with denosumab significantly increased BMD at all sites measured and reduced the levels of bone turnover markers when compared with placebo. Despite these beneficial effects, denosumab was associated with increased rates of sore throat, rash and infections requiring hospitalization. Furthermore, the study was limited by lack of information on antifracture efficacy, although such information will presumably be forthcoming in the near future. Here, I highlight how denosumab therapy differs from other antiresorptive agents with respect to mechanism of action and effects on BMD. The findings of Bone et al. suggest that denosumab might represent a novel anti-osteoporosis agent. Nonetheless, further investigations of efficacy and long-term safety are needed before denosumab can be adopted into routine clinical practice.

14.1 Bone Metastasis from Solid Tumors

The safety and efficacy of denosumab for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors was demonstrated in three international, randomized (1:1), double-blind, active-controlled, noninferiority trials comparing denosumab with zoledronic acid. In all three trials, patients were randomized to receive 120 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks or 4 mg zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks (dose adjusted for reduced renal function). Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min were excluded. In each trial, the main outcome measure was demonstration of noninferiority of time to first skeletal-related event (SRE) as compared to zoledronic acid. Supportive outcome measures were superiority of time to first SRE and superiority of time to first and subsequent SRE; testing for these outcome measures occurred if the main outcome measure was statistically significant. An SRE was defined as any of the following: pathologic fracture, radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression.

Study 20050136 (NCT00321464) enrolled 2046 patients with advanced breast cancer and bone metastasis. Randomization was stratified by a history of prior SRE (yes or no), receipt of chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization (yes or no), prior oral bisphosphonate use (yes or no), and region (Japan or other countries). Forty percent of patients had a previous SRE, 40% received chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization, 5% received prior oral bisphosphonates, and 7% were enrolled from Japan. Median age was 57 years, 80% of patients were White, and 99% of patients were women. The median number of doses administered was 18 for denosumab and 17 for zoledronic acid.

### Harnessing the potential of therapeutic agents to safeguard bone health in prostate cancer [^113HpggH]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Denosumab and bisphosphonates have also been associated with an elevated osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) risk, although it was not recognized as an adverse event of interest at the time of the zoledronic acid initial studies. A small proportion of patients with prostate cancer reported this adverse event in the comparative study (denosumab, 2.3%; zoledronic acid, 1.3%; p = 0.09). The incidence of ONJ increases with time, and is more common in patients with poor oral health or a tooth extraction history. Recent safety findings from the comparative study open-label extension showed an ONJ incidence (unadjusted for exposure) of 8.2% for patients with metastatic prostate cancer who received denosumab (120 mg every 4 weeks); cumulative ONJ incidence was 3.8% when given for up to 5.6 years. For patients who initially received zoledronic acid (4 mg every 4 weeks) and then switched to denosumab, ONJ incidence was 5.9% over 5 years; cumulative incidence was 2.2% over a period of up to 3.4 years. In the overall study analysis (patients with breast or prostate cancers), patient-year adjusted incidence of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first treatment year, 3.7% during the second and 4.6% per year thereafter. To reduce ONJ risk, ESMO guidelines recommend preventative dental measures before starting treatment, and good oral hygiene maintenance and invasive dental procedure avoidance during therapy.

Zoledronic acid is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged via the kidneys. It is not indicated for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min); also, it should be used with caution in mild-to-moderate renal impairment and may require dose adjustment. For denosumab, renal monitoring and dose adjustments are not needed, including in severe renal impairment. However, individuals with severe renal impairment are at risk of hypocalcemia and should be monitored closely.

Radiopharmaceutical agents have historically been associated with a myelosuppression risk. Radium-223, however, offers highly localized tissue destruction with low levels of myelosuppression. The ALSYMPCA trial provided evidence that radium-223 might be better tolerated than older generation radiopharmaceuticals; incidences of grades 3 and 4 anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were minimal (13%, 3.1%, and 6.1%, respectively).

### Randomized active-controlled phase II study of denosumab efficacy and safety in patients with breast cancer-related bone metastases [^117A5z5k]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand, suppresses bone resorption. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of five dosing regimens of denosumab in patients with breast cancer-related bone metastases not previously treated with intravenous bisphosphonates (IV BPs).

Patients and Methods

Eligible women (n = 255) with breast cancer-related bone metastases were stratified by type of antineoplastic therapy received and randomly assigned to one of six cohorts (five denosumab cohorts [blinded to dose and frequency]; one open-label IV BP cohort). Denosumab was administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks (30, 120, or 180 mg) or every 12 weeks (60 or 180 mg). The primary end point was percentage of change in the bone turnover marker urine N-telopeptide corrected for urine creatinine (uNTx/Cr) from baseline to study week 13. The percentage of patients achieving more than 65% uNTx/Cr reduction, time to more than 65% uNTx/Cr reduction, patients experiencing one or more on-study skeletal-related events (SRE), and safety were also evaluated.

Results

At study week 13, the median percent reduction in uNTx/Cr was 71% for the pooled denosumab groups and 79% for the IV BP group. Overall, 74% of denosumab-treated patients (157 of 211) achieved a more than 65% reduction in uNTx/Cr compared with 63% of bisphosphonate-treated patients (27 of 43). On-study SREs were experienced by 9% of denosumab-treated patients (20 of 211) versus 16% of bisphosphonate-treated patients (seven of 43). No serious or fatal adverse events related to denosumab occurred.

Conclusion

Subcutaneous denosumab may be similar to IV BPs in suppressing bone turnover and reducing SRE risk. The safety profile was consistent with an advanced breast cancer population receiving systemic therapy.

During the open-label extension phase of the breast and prostate cancer trials, adverse events of hypocalcemia were observed at similar frequency comparing those who continued with denosumab therapy (20 (4.3%)) versus those who switched from ZA to denosumab treatment (14 (3.1%)). Overall, hypocalcemia rates during the open-label phase were similar to slightly lower compared with those observed in the blinded treatment phase. Six patients in the denosumab/denosumab group and five patients in the ZA/denosumab group had adverse events of hypocalcemia requiring IV calcium therapy; these events were considered serious in four and one patients, respectively (Table 3). Among these, one patient in each group had a baseline creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min; two patients in the ZA/denosumab group and one in the denosumab/denosumab group did not report oral vitamin D or calcium supplementation, respectively. In the breast cancer study, there was 1 (0.3%) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 3) grade 4 hypocalcemia event reported for each group, with no grade 3 events. In the prostate cancer study, there were 3 (2.0%) and 2 (1.7%) CTCAE grade 3 hypocalcemia events reported for the groups initially receiving denosumab and ZA, respectively, and 1 (0.7) grade 4 event reported for the denosumab group. No patients had symptoms associated with severe hypocalcemia, nor were there any fatal adverse events of hypocalcemia. Overall, the incidence of hypocalcemia did not increase with increased exposure to denosumab. The risk of hypocalcemia during the open-label phase was not increased in patients who switched from ZA to denosumab, or in those who had impaired renal function.

### Zoledronate after denosumab discontinuation: is repeated administrations more effective than single infusion? [^116FYqtk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Denosumab (Dmab) is a monoclonal antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand, which suppresses the differentiation from precursors cells and osteomorphs (end-stage nonresorbing cells derived from osteoclasts that can be recycled back into active osteoclasts) to osteoclasts. Dmab is administered subcutaneously at a dosage of 60 mg every 25 weeks to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and to reduce fracture (FX) risk in patients affected by osteoporosis or as primary prevention in patients taking glucocorticoids or hormonal deprivation therapy for prostate or breast cancer.

Although a good safety profile is guaranteed for up to 10 years of treatment, Dmab may be withdrawn earlier in some cases, as in osteoporotic patients if the BMD improves and reaches osteopenic values or in patients without osteoporosis who discontinue hormonal deprivation therapy or glucocorticoids. It is known that, after Dmab withdrawal, bone turnover markers (BTMs) persistently increase, BMD rapidly falls to pretreatment values, and multiple clinical vertebral FX (VFX) may occur with relevant impacts on women's health (rebound phenomenon). In particular, rebound VFXs are more likely if the Dmab therapy duration is longer than 3 years. By blocking the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand, Dmab causes the osteoclasts precursors cells accumulation, so when Dmab is discontinuated, the osteoclastogenesis is enhanced. It has been suggested that the longer the duration of Dmab therapy (and the higher the number of the accumulated cells), the greater the extent of the "rebound", making the occurrence of VFX more probable.

Although the use of a sequential therapy with bisphosphonates (BPs) such as intravenous zoledronate (ZOL) can attenuate the rebound phenomenon, a single ZOL administration may not completely prevent the rebound VFX and BMD loss, in particular if more than 5 injections of Dmab have been administered.

In 2020 a position statement of the European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) recommended a sequential therapy with oral BPs or ZOL for 1 to 2 years depending on BTMs and BMD if the Dmab therapy duration was short (≤ 2.5 years), whereas in patients treated for longer periods (ie, > 2.5 years) ZOL should be administered 6 months after the last injection and possibly repeated 3–6 months later in case of BMTs levels remaining still above the healthy premenopausal women threshold (C-terminal telopeptide, CTX ≥ 280 ng/L or procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide ≥ 35 µg/L).

The trials in patients with breast (Study 20050136) or prostate (Study 20050103) cancer included an open-label extension treatment phase where patients were offered denosumab 120 mg once every 4 weeks (median overall exposure of 14.9 months; range: 0.1–67.2). The patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.7% in the second year, and 4.6% per year thereafter. The median time to ONJ was 20.6 months (range: 4–53) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

In a placebo-controlled clinical trial with an extension treatment phase evaluating denosumab for the prevention of bone metastases in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (a patient population for which denosumab is not indicated), with longer treatment exposure of up to 7 years, the patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.0% in the second year, and 7.1% per year thereafter.

### Denosumab compared with zoledronic acid for the treatment of bone metastases in patients with advanced breast cancer: a randomized, double-blind study [^1143Stuo]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

This randomized study compared denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B (RANK) ligand, with zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with breast cancer with bone metastases.

Patients and Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg and intravenous placebo (n = 1,026) or intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg adjusted for creatinine clearance and subcutaneous placebo (n = 1,020) every 4 weeks. All patients were strongly recommended to take daily calcium and vitamin D supplements. The primary end point was time to first on-study SRE (defined as pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression).

Results

Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying time to first on-study SRE (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.95; p = 0.01 superiority) and time to first and subsequent (multiple) on-study SREs (rate ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.89; p = 0.001). Reduction in bone turnover markers was greater with denosumab. Overall survival, disease progression, and rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were similar between groups. An excess of renal AEs and acute-phase reactions occurred with zoledronic acid; hypocalcemia occurred more frequently with denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred infrequently (2.0%, denosumab; 1.4%, zoledronic acid; p = 0.39).

Conclusion

Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing SREs in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone and was generally well tolerated. With the convenience of a subcutaneous injection and no requirement for renal monitoring, denosumab represents a potential treatment option for patients with bone metastases.

### Safety of long-term denosumab therapy: results from the open label extension phase of two phase 3 studies in patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancer [^113UjT5o]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Adverse events of ONJ and hypocalcemia were also observed in the open-label treatment phase. The majority of ONJ cases were associated with known risk factors involving invasive dental procedures and poor oral hygiene; and the incidence rate increased with the duration of anti-resorptive therapy. However, it should be noted that in the absence of bone-targeted therapy, SRE rates also increase over time and occur at a rate that far exceeds ONJ. Hypocalcemia was similar in incidence between treatment groups, manageable with appropriate therapy, and occurred at rates similar to those reported in the double-blinded phases of the studies. Few clinical trials have assessed the safety of potent anti-resorptive agents in advanced cancer patients beyond 2 years. A retrospective study in women with metastatic breast cancer who had received ZA or pamidronate for at least 24 months found that the rate of ONJ in these patients was 3.8%. This rate is similar to the 2.5% rate reported for breast cancer patients in our study who received denosumab in both the blinded and open label treatment phases. The results presented in this manuscript are important for confirming the need to vigilantly follow patients for these known side effects of bone-targeted therapies, even after prolonged availability and administration of these agents. Patients should continue to be counseled on the importance of dental hygiene and preventive dentistry and adherence to calcium and vitamin D supplements while receiving bone-targeted treatment, particularly those with severe renal impairment. Healthcare providers should also ensure that patients receiving bone-targeted therapy are aware of the symptoms associated with hypocalcemia, including muscle stiffness, twitching, spasms, or cramps, and should monitor these patients, including cardiac monitoring in patients with severe hypocalcemia.

In conclusion, data from the open-label extension phase of two pivotal trials in metastatic breast and prostate cancer, respectively, confirm the known safety profile of denosumab with long-term administration for a median 19.1 months (up to 5 years) in metastatic breast cancer and a median 12.0 months (up to 5.6 years) in metastatic prostate cancer. Additionally, there were no new safety signals among patients who were switched to denosumab therapy after continuous ZA treatment, suggesting that changing from an IV bisphosphonate to denosumab is a valid treatment strategy where clinically indicated for patients with advanced breast and prostate cancers.

### Safety of long-term denosumab therapy: results from the open label extension phase of two phase 3 studies in patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancer [^111e6ryh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Zoledronic acid (ZA) or denosumab treatment reduces skeletal-related events; however, the safety of prolonged therapy has not been adequately studied. Here, we describe safety results of extended denosumab therapy in patients with bone metastases from the open-label extension phase of two phase 3 trials.

Methods

Patients with metastatic breast or prostate cancer received subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg Q4W or intravenous ZA 4 mg Q4W in a double-blinded fashion. Denosumab demonstrated superior efficacy in the blinded treatment phase; thus, patients were offered open-label denosumab for up to an additional 2 years.

Results

Cumulative median (Q1, Q3) denosumab exposure was 19.1 (9.2, 32.2) months in the breast cancer trial (n = 1019) and 12.0 (5.6, 21.3) months in the prostate cancer trial (n = 942); 295 patients received denosumab for > 3 years. No new safety signals were identified during the open-label phase, or among patients who switched from ZA to denosumab. During the blinded treatment phase, exposure-adjusted subject incidences of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) were 49 (1.9%) and 31 (1.2%) in the denosumab and ZA groups, respectively. In total, 32 (6.9%) and 25 (5.5%) new cases of ONJ (not adjusted for exposure) were reported for patients continuing and switching to denosumab, respectively. The incidences of hypocalcemia were 4.3 and 3.1%, in patients continuing and switching to denosumab, respectively.

Conclusion

These results describe the safety profile of denosumab after long-term exposure, or after switching to denosumab from ZA. No new safety signals were identified. Hypocalcemia rates were similar in the blinded treatment and open-label phases. ONJ rates increased with increasing exposure to antiresorptives, consistent with previous reports.

### Denosumab and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women: a population-based cohort study [^116p2oUE]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Study eligibility

Given that eligibility for ODB coverage of denosumab is predominantly restricted to women with a history of oral bisphosphonate use, and breast cancer risk is suggested to be lower among women with osteoporosis and also following bisphosphonate exposure; – we restricted inclusion to women with prior oral bisphosphonate use to isolate effects of denosumab. Three oral bisphosphonates are approved for osteoporosis in Canada (alendronate, etidronate, and risedronate), and have been available through the ODB program since 1996. Bisphosphonate use prior to the date of study entry (i.e. index date as defined below) was obtained for each subject and the cumulative use and time since most recent use was calculated. Women were excluded if they were over the age of 85 at index date, ineligible for OHIP at any point in the two years preceding the index date, had no ODB claims in the two year preceding the index date, had a history of any cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, ICD-10 any C44) at any point prior to the index date, had a history of any conditions that would impact bone quality at any point prior to the index date (e.g. celiac disease, Cushing's syndrome, hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, organ transplant, osteomalacia, osteopetrosis, Paget's disease or renal disease), had a death date preceding/on the index date and had a history of living in a long-term care setting.

Denosumab exposure

We identified all women aged 67 or more years who received a first prescription of denosumab between 29 February 2012 (first date on ODB formulary) and 30 April 2016. The index date was the first date of dispensation of denosumab. The total number of denosumab prescriptions dispensed at least four months from each other (≥ 120 days) were then categorized as 1–2 doses, 3–4 doses, and ≥ 5 doses. All women meeting our inclusion criteria with oral bisphosphonate exposure since 1996 were assigned a random index date based on the distribution of index dates among the eligible exposed subjects.

### Real-world data of efficacy and safety of denosumab on patients with breast cancer with bone metastasis: results from Chinese clinical experience… [^115rQzdq]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e13103 Background: Bone is the most common metastasis site in advanced metastatic breast cancer disease. Denosumab is advocated by various guidelines with high-quality of evidence for the treatment of breast cancer patients with bone metastases to delay or reduce the occurrence of skeletal related events. Data for bone lesion repair after treatment on image is still needed in real world. This retrospective study aims to evaluate the efficacy of denosumab on breast cancer with BM by MD Anderson criteria which is specific to BM and its safety in real world. Methods: Data of patients age ≥ 18 years diagnosed with advanced breast cancer with BM and treated with denosumab from June 1 st2020 to Dec 31. st2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate for bone lesions by MDA criteria in evaluable patients.

Secondary endpoints include disease control rate for bone lesions, risk of SRE occurrence and safety in total population. Subgroup analysis investigated the impact of the time of denosumab treatment initiation post-diagnosis of BM as well as the duration of treatment with denosumab on efficacy. Comparative analysis was performed using Chi-squared test and a p value of < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. The median follow-up time was 25. 2 months. 49 out of the 130 evaluable patients achieved partial response, resulting in an ORR of 37. 69%, and a DCR of 90%. 16 out of 185 patients developed SRE after denosumab treatment with the median time to the first occurrence of SRE not reached. The ORR and DCR for bone lesions of starting denosumab after diagnosis of BM in ≤ 3 months vs. > 3 months were 31. 54% vs.
6. 15% and 68. 46% vs.
21. 54%, respectively.

Conclusions: Denosumab was found to be effective and safe for breast cancer patients with BM in this large retrospective study. Early initiation and longer duration of denosumab treatment may generate better clinical outcomes for bone lesions by MDA criteria.

### Safety of long-term denosumab therapy: results from the open label extension phase of two phase 3 studies in patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancer [^113ebgiH]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Safety

Overall, 652 breast cancer patients (318 and 334 initially randomized to denosumab and ZA, respectively) and 265 prostate cancer patients (147 and 118 initially randomized to denosumab and ZA, respectively) received at least one dose of denosumab during the open-label treatment phase (Table 3). No new safety signals were observed during the open-label extension phase. No neutralizing anti-denosumab antibodies were detected. Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar to those seen during the studies' blinded treatment phases. Adverse events were generally balanced between treatment groups independent of whether patients were initially randomized to denosumab or ZA during the blinded phase of the study (Table 3).

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^112vkq7e]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The effect of delayed denosumab injections rather than discontinuation on fracture risk was reported by Lyu et al. The authors used observational data in a hypothetical trial format, analysing the effect of on-time (within 4 weeks of date due), short delay (4–16 weeks overdue) and long delay > 16 weeks on fracture incidence. The incidence of fracture at any site over the 6 months following the missed dose was 27.3 per 1000 patients for on-time delivery, 32.2 in 1000 for short delay, and 42.4 for long delay. Patients who delayed their dose of denosumab by more than 4 months had a 3.91-fold increased risk of VF.

There is an emerging body of evidence that the duration of denosumab treatment may be an important determinant of the extent of rebound phenomenon, and time to VF following discontinuation. Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al.in 2020 reported a case series of 15 patients who sustained VF following withdrawal of denosumab and aromatase inhibitors for early stage breast cancer finding that VF developed earlier in patients with longer exposure or osteoporosis prior to commencing denosumab. Longer duration of treatment was also identified as being associated with a higher number of VFs in another study. Duration of denosumab exposure may also have an effect on the response to sequential treatment, with shorter duration leading to better preservation of BMD with sequential bisphosphonate therapy, but this is yet to be fully ascertained in large, prospective studies.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^116tFCwR]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — denosumab dosing, efficacy, safety, and discontinuation: For treatment of osteoporosis, the dose is 60 mg by subcutaneous injection every 6 months; denosumab showed "broad-spectrum" antifracture efficacy as early as 12 months after starting therapy, and studies with duration of up to 10 years indicate persistent fracture protection and a good safety profile. Switching from bisphosphonates to denosumab results in additional gains in BMD. Denosumab is contraindicated in patients with hypocalcemia, and intakes of calcium and vitamin D should be adequate upon starting denosumab treatment to minimize the risk of hypocalcemia. In the FREEDOM study, there was an imbalance in some low-frequency events that did not seem causally related to denosumab treatment, did not increase in frequency with long-term therapy, and have not been reported with high-doses denosumab (Xgeva) used to treat patients with advanced cancer. When treatment with denosumab was stopped after 2 or 8 years, BMD decreased rapidly, and BTMs increased to values above baseline by 12 months after discontinuation; protection from vertebral fractures is quickly lost, but the risk does not usually exceed that in untreated patients, and case reports of multiple vertebral fractures upon stopping denosumab therapy have been reported.

### Challenges in preventing bone loss induced by aromatase inhibitors [^112UVAYS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Aromatase inhibitors have become a mainstay in the adjuvant treatment regimen in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. While many of these patients have an excellent long-term prognosis, adverse effects on bone represent an emerging complication of aromatase inhibitor treatment, resulting in substantial bone loss and fragility fractures. Treatment approaches to prevent aromatase inhibitor-induced bone loss typically consist of an antiresorptive approach with bisphosphonates or the RANKL antibody denosumab. However, different guidelines vary with respect to treatment thresholds, duration, and dosing. The choice of antiresorptive regime is further complicated by comorbidities and potential disease-modifying effects of individual agents.

Objective

This review summarizes the evidence of how aromatase inhibitors affect bone health and provides an update of clinical approaches to preserve bone strength in affected women. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab XX: 0–0, 2020).

### Denosumab and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women: a population-based cohort study [^114p5aFP]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

The prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis have historically included the use of bisphosphonates, a class of drugs that inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Intravenous bisphosphonates are also prescribed to breast (and other) cancer patients to prevent treatment-induced skeletal complications including bone loss and bone metastases. Evidence from earlier, epidemiologic studies suggested a possible reduction in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women who used bisphosphonates;, however, a results from a recent prospective cohort of 64,438 French postmenopausal women and 2407 incident cases, reported no significant association between bisphosphonate use and breast cancer risk (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.85–1.12).

There are several limitations to our study. First, the duration of follow-up was short (on average ~2.8 years). This was purely attributed to the fairly recent introduction of denosumab for the treatment of osteoporosis. We wanted to ensure accurate information regarding prescribed denosumab use, and thus, only included women who were 67 years of age or older who had at least 2 prior years of coverage under the ODB program. However, it should be noted that denosumab for the treatment of osteoporosis was not added to the Ontario provincial formulary until February 2012 and is only provided in special circumstances. This may have resulted in some misclassification including under-capturing if patients received drug coverage through other mechanisms (e.g. out-of-pocket, private insurance). Given that more than half of the breast cancers in Canada are diagnosed prior to age 69, we did not capture the full population of interest. The women included in the current analysis were limited to older (on average 76 years of age) women with a history of bisphosphonate use, and likely not representative of the larger number of women at risk of developing breast cancer. Although we did not have information on various breast cancer risk factors including family history, we were able to demonstrate that both groups of women were similar with respect to screening (Table 1) and use of chemopreventive drugs such as raloxifene and tamoxifen (data not shown). Furthermore, reproductive and hormonal risk factors are unlikely to differ based on initiation of denosumab.

### Adjuvant denosumab in breast cancer (ABCSG-18): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114w2zY2]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Adjuvant endocrine therapy compromises bone health in patients with breast cancer, causing osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures. Antiresorptive treatments such as bisphosphonates prevent and counteract these side-effects. In this trial, we aimed to investigate the effects of the anti-RANK ligand antibody denosumab in postmenopausal, aromatase inhibitor-treated patients with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

Methods

In this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, postmenopausal patients with early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer receiving treatment with aromatase inhibitors were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either denosumab 60 mg or placebo administered subcutaneously every 6 months in 58 trial centres in Austria and Sweden. Patients were assigned by an interactive voice response system. The randomisation schedule used a randomly permuted block design with block sizes 2 and 4, stratified by type of hospital regarding Hologic device for DXA scans, previous aromatase inhibitor use, and baseline bone mineral density. Patients, treating physicians, investigators, data managers, and all study personnel were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was time from randomisation to first clinical fracture, analysed by intention to treat. As an additional sensitivity analysis, we also analysed the primary endpoint on the per-protocol population. Patients were treated until the prespecified number of 247 first clinical fractures was reached. This trial is ongoing (patients are in follow-up) and is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2005–005275–15, and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00556374.

Findings

Between Dec 18, 2006, and July 22, 2013, 3425 eligible patients were enrolled into the trial, of whom 3420 were randomly assigned to receive denosumab 60 mg (n = 1711) or placebo (n = 1709) subcutaneously every 6 months. Compared with the placebo group, patients in the denosumab group had a significantly delayed time to first clinical fracture (hazard ratio [HR] 0·50 [95% CI 0·39–0·65], p < 0·0001). The overall lower number of fractures in the denosumab group (92) than in the placebo group (176) was similar in all patient subgroups, including in patients with a bone mineral density T-score of -1 or higher at baseline (n = 1872, HR 0·44 [95% CI 0·31–0·64], p < 0·0001) and in those with a bone mineral density T-score of less than -1 already at baseline (n = 1548, HR 0·57 [95% CI 0·40–0·82], p = 0·002). The patient incidence of adverse events in the safety analysis set (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug) did not differ between the denosumab group (1366 events, 80%) and the placebo group (1334 events, 79%), nor did the numbers of serious adverse events (521 vs 511 [30% in each group]). The main adverse events were arthralgia and other aromatase-inhibitor related symptoms; no additional toxicity from the study drug was reported. Despite proactive adjudication of every potential osteonecrosis of the jaw by an international expert panel, no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw were reported. 93 patients (3% of the full analysis set) died during the study, of which one death (in the denosumab group) was thought to be related to the study drug.

Interpretation

Adjuvant denosumab 60 mg twice per year reduces the risk of clinical fractures in postmenopausal women with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitors, and can be administered without added toxicity. Since a main side-effect of adjuvant breast cancer treatment can be substantially reduced by the addition of denosumab, this treatment should be considered for clinical practice.

Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)

In the primary treatment phases of Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, ONJ was confirmed in 1.8% of patients in the denosumab group (median exposure of 12.0 months; range: 0.1–40.5) and 1.3% of patients in the zoledronic acid group. The trials in patients with breast (Study 20050136) or prostate (Study 20050103) cancer included an open-label extension treatment phase where patients were offered denosumab 120 mg once every 4 weeks (median overall exposure of 14.9 months; range: 0.1–67.2). The patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.7% in the second year, and 4.6% per year thereafter. The median time to ONJ was 20.6 months (range: 4–53) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

In a placebo-controlled clinical trial with an extension treatment phase evaluating denosumab for the prevention of bone metastases in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (a patient population for which denosumab is not indicated), with longer treatment exposure of up to 7 years, the patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.0% in the second year, and 7.1% per year thereafter.

Statistical analysis

Baseline descriptive characteristics of the two groups were compared using standardized differences. A standardized difference of < 0.10 was used to determine comparability between the groups for each covariate of interest. Cox proportional hazards models, stratified on matched pairs was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for denosumab exposure, as well as increasing dose and time since last bisphosphonate use, and the risk of breast cancer. Women were followed from their index date to either: (1) an incident breast cancer diagnosis, (2) other cancer diagnosis (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), (3) death, or (4) end of follow-up (31 August 2017), whichever occurred first. Unexposed subjects who eventually received denosumab in the follow-up were also censored (n = 2,201).

All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.3.

### Interpreting results from oncology clinical trials: a comparison of denosumab to zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in cancer patients [^112aWKk2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Number needed to harm

A closely related concept to the NNT is the NNH, which can be used to compare the safety profile of two treatments studied in a clinical trial. As with the NNT, the NNH is treatment-specific and must always be relative to a comparator over a predefined time period. As an illustration, using the previous hypothetical example where the NNT with the new chemotherapy was 10, suppose that the absolute difference in the development of deep vein thrombosis was 10% lower in the control group. For every 10 patients that we treat with the new agent, we avoid one patient with a disease recurrence (i.e. NNT = 10). However, we would also expect the development of one additional patient developing a deep vein thrombosis with the 10 treatments with the new therapy (i.e. NNH = 10). Clinicians must, therefore, consider both the NNT and NNH when interpreting the results of randomized trials and deciding on therapy for their patients.

Limitations of NNT and NNH

NNT and NNH are both very useful for understanding the findings from randomized trials, but there are some caveats that must be taken into consideration. If the formulas are not used with sufficient rigor, the conclusions will be misleading. Here are some major pitfalls one may encounter when calculating and interpreting such analyses. NNT and NNH are disease-specific and comparisons across clinical conditions should not be performed. As an illustration, an NNT of 10 for preventing a breast cancer relapse is not comparable to an NNT of 5 for preventing febrile neutropenia with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). It would be erroneous to conclude that G-CSF is preferred to the new chemotherapy that reduces breast cancer recurrences. The only situation where NNTs could be compared across studies is when the same disease condition is being investigated, when an identical control is used, and when the inclusion/exclusion criteria are comparable between trials. In addition, estimates should only be measured over the same time period. For example, it would be inappropriate to compare acute control of bone pain after a single fraction of radiation therapy to an oral bisphosphonate administered for 1 month because the time periods are not identical. Health care decision-makers should be wary of analyses that use unconventional measurements of time; NNT and NNH are very straightforward equations so results that are not reasonably intuitive should be viewed with caution.

Bone metastases in breast cancer — therapy includes managing complications such as skeletal-related events (SREs); the NCCN Panel recommends treatment with a bone-modifying agent such as zoledronic acid, pamidronate, or denosumab (category 1) in addition to chemotherapy or endocrine therapy if bone metastasis is present; expected survival is ≥ 3 months. Patients should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to initiation of this therapy; a dental examination with preventive dentistry intervention is recommended prior to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate or denosumab, and dental procedures invasive of gum or bone during treatment should be avoided if at all possible. The bisphosphonates and denosumab are associated with a risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), with risk factors including poor baseline dental health or dental procedures during treatment, and additional risk factors including administration of chemotherapy or corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene with periodontal disease and dental abscess.

### Denosumab in osteoporosis and oncology [^1111Bvp9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, efficacy, and use of denosumab in osteoporosis, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma.

Data Sources

Studies and abstracts were identified through MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1966-July 2009). Key search terms include denosumab, AMG-162, and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand system. Information available in abstract form was retrieved from major oncology and bone metabolism meetings. Additional data were obtained from the manufacturer.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All available studies in humans were included except for studies in rheumatoid arthritis and giant cell tumor of the bone.

Data Synthesis

In patients with osteoporosis, denosumab significantly reduces bone resorption and fractures. Studies of denosumab in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis have demonstrated significantly increased bone mineral density and reduced bone turnover markers. Studies of denosumab versus placebo in the treatment of osteoporosis have demonstrated reductions in vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fractures. In oncology, positive results from clinical trials in patients receiving endocrine therapy for breast and prostate cancer demonstrated decreases in bone loss and skeletal-related events. Denosumab seems to be at least as effective in reducing bone turnover markers as intravenous bisphosphonates in the oncology setting. The most common adverse effects in patients with osteoporosis were arthralgia, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and headache. The most common adverse effects in patients with cancer were infection, pain in the extremities, arthralgia, bone pain, fatigue, and pain. Serious adverse effects include infections requiring hospitalization.

Conclusions

Denosumab has documented efficacy and safety in patients with osteoporosis, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Additional clinical trial data are needed to more completely establish the effectiveness of denosumab in the treatment of osteoporosis and neoplastic disease as well as its cost-effectiveness and long-term safety.

### Fractures after denosumab discontinuation: a retrospective study of 797 cases [^114MW24e]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

The questionnaires were collected from January 17 to November 15, 2019, when the number of patients exceeded 800 and the return became slow. Of the 861 returned questionnaires, 64 had to be excluded because of incomplete data. Thus, 797 female patients were included: Their mean age was 65.3 years (SD = 9.2), mean weight 60.2 kg (SD = 10.7), and mean BMI 23.1 kg/m 2 (SD = 4.0); 134 had breast cancer.

The BMD was below −2.5 T ‐score at the lumbar spine in 63% and at the femoral neck in 31%.

The average number of denosumab injections given was 5.9 (range 2 to 20) per patient, the average duration of the treatment was 35 months (5 to 120), and the average follow‐up after denosumab discontinuation was 27.5 months (SD = 15.5).

### Use of adjuvant bisphosphonates and other bone-modifying agents in breast cancer: ASCO-OH (CCO) guideline update [^113gGKkj]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To update recommendations of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)-Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario [CCO]) adjuvant bone-modifying agents in breast cancer guideline.

Methods

An Expert Panel conducted a systematic review to identify new, potentially practice-changing data.

Results

Four articles met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for revision of the previous recommendations.

Recommendations

Adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy should be discussed with all postmenopausal patients (natural or therapy-induced) with primary breast cancer, irrespective of hormone receptor status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status, who are candidates to receive adjuvant systemic therapy. Adjuvant bisphosphonates, if used, are not substitutes for standard anticancer modalities. The benefit of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy will vary depending on the underlying risk of recurrence and is associated with a modest improvement in overall survival. The NHS PREDICT tool provides estimates of the benefit of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy and may aid in decision making. Factors influencing the decision to recommend adjuvant bisphosphonate use should include patients' risk of recurrence, risk of side effects, financial toxicity, drug availability, patient preferences, comorbidities, and life expectancy. When an adjuvant bisphosphonate is used to prevent breast cancer recurrence, the therapeutic options recommended by the Panel include oral clodronate, oral ibandronate, and intravenous zoledronic acid. The Panel supports starting bisphosphonate therapy early, consistent with the points outlined in the parent CCO-ASCO guideline; this is a consensus recommendation. The Panel does not recommend adjuvant denosumab to prevent breast cancer recurrence, because studies did not show a consistent reduction of breast cancer recurrence in any subset of those with early-stage breast cancer.

### Adjuvant denosumab in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (ABCSG-18): disease-free survival results from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^112XRUWM]. The Lancet: Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Background

In postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer, treatment with adjuvant aromatase inhibitors is the standard of care, but it increases risk for osteoporosis and fractures. Results from the ABCSG-18 trial showed that use of denosumab as an adjuvant to aromatase inhibitor therapy significantly reduced clinical fractures. Disease-free survival outcomes from ABCSG-18 have not yet been reported.

Methods

Postmenopausal patients with early, hormone receptor-positive, non-metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast, who had completed their initial adjuvant treatment pathway (surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, or a combination) and were receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitors, were enrolled at 58 trial centres in Austria and Sweden into this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. With permuted block randomisation (block sizes 2 and 4, stratified by previous aromatase inhibitor use, total lumbar spine bone mineral density score at baseline, and type of centre), patients were assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous denosumab (60 mg) or matching placebo every 6 months during aromatase inhibitor therapy. The primary endpoint (previously reported) was the time to first clinical fracture after randomisation. The secondary endpoint reported here is disease-free survival (defined as time from randomisation to first evidence of local or distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer, secondary carcinoma, or death from any cause) in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with EudraCT (number 2005–005275–15) and ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00556374), and is ongoing for long-term follow-up.

Findings

Between Dec 18, 2006, and July 22, 2013, 3425 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned; 1711 to the denosumab group and 1709 to the placebo group (with five others withdrawing consent). After a median follow-up of 73 months (IQR 58–95), 240 (14·0%) patients in the denosumab and 287 (16·8%) in the placebo group had disease-free survival events. Disease-free survival was significantly improved in the denosumab group versus the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·82, 95% CI 0·69–0·98, Cox p = 0·0260; descriptive analysis, without controlling for multiplicity). In the denosumab group, disease-free survival was 89·2% (95% CI 87·6–90·8) at 5 years and 80·6% (78·1–83·1) at 8 years of follow-up, compared with 87·3% (85·7–89·0) at 5 years and 77·5% (74·8–80·2) and 8 years in the placebo group. No independently adjudicated cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw or confirmed atypical femoral fractures were recorded. The total number of adverse events was similar in the denosumab group (1367 [including 521 serious] adverse events) and the placebo group (1339 [515 serious]). The most common serious adverse events were osteoarthritis (62 [3·6%] of 1709 in the denosumab group vs 58 [3·4%] of 1690 in the placebo group), meniscus injury (23 [1·3%] vs 24 [1·4%]), and cataract (16 [0·9%] vs 28 [1·7%]). One (< 0·1%) treatment-related death (due to pneumonia, septic kidney failure, and cardiac decompensation) occurred in the denosumab group.

Interpretation

Denosumab constitutes an effective and safe adjuvant treatment for patients with postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — initial pharmacologic therapy selection: Agents with "broad-spectrum" antifracture efficacy should, in the absence of contraindications, be considered as initial options for most candidates; those with "high fracture risk" can be started on oral agents, while injectable agents (abaloparatide, denosumab, romosozumab, teriparatide, or zoledronate) can be considered for very high fracture risk or for patients with gastrointestinal (GI) problems or adherence challenges. Patients taking anabolic agents or denosumab are advised to transition to an oral bisphosphonate when therapy is complete, and anabolic/dual-action agents may be preferable for very high risk; raloxifene may be appropriate for high spine fracture risk and has a "side benefit" of reducing breast cancer risk.

### Denosumab and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women: a population-based cohort study [^112Edy3p]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 100,368 women with a history of bisphosphonate use were included in the final analysis. Of these, 25,092 women were denosumab users and 75,276 were matched non-users. Prior to matching, users and non-users of denosumab differed with respect to age, residential location, bisphosphonate use, history of fall-related injuries, fractures, primary care visits, emergency department visits and acute care hospitalizations in the past year, as well as, total aggregated diagnosis groups. However, following matching for age, index date, bisphosphonate use and propensity score, the two groups of women were similar with respect to all the baseline characteristics (Table 1). The mean number of denosumab doses in the exposed group was 4.8 (standard deviation = 2.9; range 1–12).

Table 1
Characteristics of propensity score matched cohort, among all women and by denosumab use

a Note: censoring not included in these outcomes. Outcomes are based on experiencing the event at any point in follow-up.

A total of 1271 women were diagnosed with breast cancer over the follow-up period with 285 (1.1%) cases diagnosed among the denosumab users and 986 (1.3%) cases among the non-users (Table 1). Women were followed for an average of 2.8 years, reflecting an overall protective effect with denosumab exposure (HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.76–1.00) (Table 2). The 5-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer was 1.9% in denosumab users and 2.4% among the non-users (P – log rank = 0.04), Figure 1. The relationship did not vary by increasing cumulative dose (P – trend = 0.15) or time since last use of bisphosphonates (P – interaction = 0.52) (Table 2).

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^1141Li92]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Bone health management during endocrine therapy — fracture risk thresholds, dosing, and safety — lists FRAX 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk of ≥ 20% or FRAX 10-year hip fracture risk ≥ 3% as criteria. Drugs of choice to protect bone health include bisphosphonates and denosumab with Denosumab dosage is 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months. In oncology settings, ZA dosage is 4 mg IV every 6 months for 3 years or 4 mg every 3 months for 2 years; osteoporosis dosing is 5 mg IV annually. While bisphosphonates protect bone density, more robust data support denosumab for fracture prevention in postmenopausal women. Adverse effects and precautions include ZA may cause a flu-like reaction; both ZA and denosumab can cause osteonecrosis of the jaw and patients with poor dentition or oral hygiene may be poor candidates for these therapies. ZA has been associated with rare, atypical femur fractures, while cessation of denosumab leads to increased bone turnover and vertebral fracture risk; patients should be transitioned to a bisphosphonate when stopping denosumab. As a cancer-recurrence strategy, bisphosphonates should be offered to all postmenopausal women with invasive breast cancer, independent of bone density, based on a reduced risk of cancer recurrence.

### Denosumab and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women: a population-based cohort study [^113d6v5p]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large, population-based study of older women with a history of oral bisphosphonate exposure we observed that use of denosumab was associated with a modestly significant 13% decreased risk of subsequent breast cancer. After 5 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of breast cancer was significantly lower in the denosumab users vs. the non-users (1.9% vs. 2.4%). There was no dose-response relationship and the association did not vary by time since last bisphosphonate use. Except for nodal involvement, pathologic, and histologic characteristics of the breast tumors did not vary by history of denosumab exposure. Although these findings suggest a protective effect of denosumab exposure, they should be interpreted with caution given the relatively short duration of follow-up in this analysis as well as the median age of the population (~76 years). It is of interest to confirm our findings in other studies and to further evaluate the relationship between denosumab and breast cancer in younger patients and with additional years of follow-up.

Our cohort consisted of women from the general population with a history of bisphosphonate use, and thus, are not representative of women in the general population. Although we found little evidence of a dose-response association between denosumab exposure and subsequent breast cancer risk, our findings with any denosumab use do not preclude a potential chemoprevention role of this drug among women without a history of osteoporosis including those under the age of 67. Indeed, our results suggests that a short-course of denosumab has the potential to offer long-term protection against breast cancer which is analogous to the cancer protective effects conferred by a later age at menarche and breastfeeding, intrinsic, and transient exposures that significantly reduce the risk of breast cancer. On the other hand, we cannot rule-out some residual confounding related to denosumab initiation. For example, women treated with denosumab (a new drug to market) may be healthier in terms of diet, alcohol consumption and exercise – aware of the new pharmacological option and broaching the discussion with their physician, or treated by attentive physicians encouraging preventive health behaviors.

Severe Mineral/Electrolyte Abnormalities

Severe hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium less than 7 mg/dL or less than 1.75 mmol/L) occurred in 3.1% of patients treated with denosumab and 1.3% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. Of patients who experienced severe hypocalcemia, 33% experienced 2 or more episodes of severe hypocalcemia and 16% experienced 3 or more episodes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus less than 2 mg/dL or less than 0.6 mmol/L) occurred in 15% of patients treated with denosumab and 7% of patients treated with zoledronic acid.

Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)

In the primary treatment phases of Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, ONJ was confirmed in 1.8% of patients in the denosumab group (median exposure of 12.0 months; range: 0.1–41) and 1.3% of patients in the zoledronic acid group. The trials in patients with breast (Study 20050136) or prostate (Study 20050103) cancer included a denosumab open-label extension treatment phase where patients were offered denosumab 120 mg once every 4 weeks (median overall exposure of 14.9 months; range: 0.1–67.2). The patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.7% in the second year, and 4.6% per year thereafter. The median time to ONJ was 20.6 months (range: 4–53) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

In a placebo-controlled clinical trial with an extension treatment phase evaluating denosumab for the prevention of bone metastases in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (a patient population for which denosumab is not indicated), with longer treatment exposure of up to 7 years, the patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3% in the second year, and 7% per year thereafter.

Clinical interpretation — denosumab in the adjuvant setting: In postmenopausal patients receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitors, denosumab 60 mg dosed once every 6 months reduced bone fractures and improved disease-free survival with acceptable toxicity and no increase in osteonecrosis of the jaw, but the larger D-CARE study, which used a higher dose and greater frequency, showed no improvement in bone metastasis-free survival and an unacceptably high risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw; given these findings, the Panel did not recommend the use of denosumab to reduce breast cancer recurrence.

### Extended efficacy and safety of denosumab in breast cancer patients with bone metastases not receiving prior bisphosphonate therapy [^115bCoHc]. Clinical Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL, suppresses bone resorption. This study evaluated the effects of denosumab in i.v. bisphosphonate (IV BP)-naïve patients with breast cancer-related bone metastases.

Experimental Design

Eligible women (n = 255), stratified by type of antineoplastic therapy, were randomized to 1 of 5 blinded denosumab cohorts or an open-label IV BP cohort. Denosumab was administered s.c. every 4 weeks (30, 120, or 180 mg) or every 12 weeks (60 or 180 mg) through 21 weeks. Final efficacy results for up to 25 weeks are reported, including percentage change from baseline in urine N-telopeptide corrected for creatinine (uNTx/Cr) and incidence of skeletal-related events (SRE). Safety results are reported through the end of follow-up (up to 57 weeks).

Results

At week 13 and 25, the median percent changes in uNTx/creatinine (Cr) among patients with measurable uNTx were -73% and -75% for the pooled denosumab groups and -79% and -71% for the IV BP group. Among patients with ≥ 1 postbaseline measurement of uNTx at week 25, 52% (109 of 208) of denosumab-treated patients and 46% (19 of 41) of IV BP-treated patients achieved > 65% uNTx/Cr reduction. On-study SREs occurred in 12% (26 of 211) of denosumab-treated patients and 16% (7 of 43) of IV BP-treated patients. Overall rates of adverse events were 95% in denosumab and IV BP groups. No denosumab-related serious or fatal adverse events occurred.

Conclusions

In IV BP-naïve breast cancer patients with bone metastases, denosumab suppresses bone turnover and seems to reduce SRE risk similarly to IV BPs, with a safety profile consistent with an advanced cancer population receiving systemic therapy.
