## Question

skin assessment on left finger cellulitis symptoms describe

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to assess cellulitis of the left finger, including what to look for, how to distinguish it from mimics, when to image or culture, and how to document severity and risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical features that define cellulitis. Then, I should verify the key differentials for a finger, especially abscess, felon, paronychia, and flexor tenosynovitis. Next, I will review when to use imaging and when to obtain cultures. After that, I need to check how to classify severity and decide on disposition. Finally, I will consider special populations, documentation elements, and follow-up reassessment, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the cardinal signs of cellulitis so I don't miss the basics: erythema, warmth, swelling/edema, and tenderness/pain are the classic local features, and systemic features such as fever, chills, and malaise may accompany more extensive or severe disease, which is consistent with CDC and IDSA summaries and contemporary reviews [^3da0bbaf] [^05eb3c03] [^fc42512e].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic nuances for a finger. I should inspect the dorsal and volar surfaces, the nail folds, and the pulp for asymmetry, ill-defined borders, and peau d'orange change, and I should palpate for warmth, tenderness, and fluctuance suggesting an occult abscess; I also need to check for lymphangitic streaking and regional lymphadenopathy, which can support a spreading infection, and I should remember that finger infections can track proximally to the hand and forearm, so I must examine beyond the finger itself [^3da0bbaf] [^05eb3c03] [^aa41f09e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — several finger-specific mimics can masquerade as cellulitis. I need to consider felon (pulp space abscess), paronychia (perionychial infection), and suppurative flexor tenosynovitis (Kanavel signs: fusiform swelling, pain on passive extension, tenderness along the sheath, and flexed posture), as well as gout, septic arthritis, and even herpetic whitlow; distinguishing these changes management from simple cellulitis to incision and drainage or urgent hand surgery, so I should double-check for focal tenderness, fluctuance, and pain with passive motion before labeling this as uncomplicated cellulitis [^929a5495] [^4d6018b3].

> I should confirm when to image. If there is a history of puncture wound, concern for retained foreign body, or failure to improve, ultrasound can detect occult abscesses and guide drainage; if there is concern for deep space infection, osteomyelitis, or necrotizing infection, MRI or contrast-enhanced CT may be indicated after plain radiography to exclude foreign body or gas, per ACR Appropriateness Criteria; point-of-care ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity for abscess and can change management in about 10% of cases, so I need to keep a low threshold to scan when the exam is equivocal [^d20a845b] [^e5ea9e72] [^1342786a] [^79b1d989].

> Next, I should review when to obtain cultures. Routine blood or skin cultures are not recommended for typical nonpurulent cellulitis without systemic illness, but I should obtain blood cultures and consider aspirate or biopsy cultures in immunocompromised hosts, severe systemic illness, animal bites, immersion injuries, or when there is concern for resistant or atypical pathogens; if I do aspirate, I need to remember the yield is modest, roughly 5–40% for needle aspirates, so a negative culture does not exclude cellulitis [^bc396851] [^31c64220] [^960e717f].

> Let me think about severity classification and disposition. Mild disease lacks SIRS and can be managed outpatient with oral therapy; moderate disease has systemic features or concern for deeper infection and may require observation or admission; severe disease includes SIRS, hemodynamic instability, immunocompromise, or concern for necrotizing infection and warrants hospitalization and broad-spectrum IV therapy; I should double-check vitals and mental status to avoid underestimating severity [^83fdbfec] [^955c5117].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In older adults, fever and classic inflammatory signs may be blunted, so I should maintain a lower threshold to image and admit; in children, paronychia and bites are common, and Staphylococcus aureus predominates, so I should tailor empiric therapy accordingly; in immunocompromised patients, I should broaden the differential to include fungal and viral etiologies and consider early biopsy or aspiration with cultures [^63c2910c] [^aa41f09e] [^bfc83052].

> Next, I should review documentation elements to reduce misdiagnosis. I will record the precise anatomic location, dimensions of erythema, presence of edema, warmth, tenderness, fluctuance, lymphangitic streaking, and any portal of entry such as a hangnail, puncture, or bite; I will also note systemic signs, comorbidities, and immunization status, and I will explicitly document the differential and the rationale for imaging or procedures, because misdiagnosis rates are high and structured documentation improves diagnostic accuracy and follow-up care [^0aa2e977] [^aa1380b9] [^55ec9651].

> But wait, what if this is actually pseudocellulitis. I should double-check for stasis dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, or gout, which are common mimics; if the presentation is atypical or refractory, I should reconsider the diagnosis and, when available, consider adjuncts such as the ALT-70 score or even thermal imaging, which can reduce overdiagnosis, though I must remember these tools were validated for lower extremities and may not directly translate to the finger [^e3b8f532] [^75037ff5] [^2fe44abd].

> I will now examine treatment-linked reassessment. I should confirm that erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain are improving within 48–72 hours; if not, I need to reassess for an occult abscess, resistant organism, or alternative diagnosis and consider imaging or procedural intervention; IDSA supports a 5-day course for uncomplicated cases if improving, but I should extend therapy if response is slow or if there are complicating factors [^d3b916cf] [^955c5117].

> Finally, I should confirm prevention counseling and follow-up. I will advise elevation of the hand, meticulous wound care, and treatment of predisposing factors such as eczema or tinea; for recurrent episodes, I should discuss hygiene measures and, in selected patients with frequent recurrences despite risk-factor modification, consider prophylactic antibiotics per IDSA guidance, while arranging close follow-up to ensure resolution and to catch complications early [^83fdbfec] [^f97f9913] [^54035c6b].

Cellulitis of the left finger presents with **erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness** [^05eb3c03], often with a poorly defined border and rapid progression [^05eb3c03]. The skin may appear shiny, tense, or peau d'orange, and there may be lymphangitic streaking or regional lymphadenopathy [^3da0bbaf]. Systemic features such as fever, chills, or malaise can occur, especially if infection spreads [^3da0bbaf]. Assess for **puncture wounds, bites, or foreign bodies** [^3f56a9f1], and check for abscess or fluctuance that would change management [^79b1d989]. If necrotizing infection is suspected, look for severe pain, crepitus, bullae, or skin necrosis and escalate urgently [^notfound].

---

## Local cutaneous findings

- **Erythema**: Diffuse redness of the affected finger, often extending beyond the area of initial infection [^05eb3c03]. The erythema is typically warm and tender to palpation [^465793bc].

- **Warmth**: The affected area feels notably warmer than surrounding tissue due to increased blood flow and inflammation [^05eb3c03].

- **Swelling**: Non-pitting edema of the finger, often causing tightness of the skin and difficulty with movement or use of the finger [^05eb3c03].

- **Tenderness**: Pain upon palpation or movement of the finger, often disproportionate to visible findings [^05eb3c03].

- **Skin texture changes**: The skin may appear shiny, tense, or have a peau d'orange (orange peel) appearance due to edema and inflammation [^465793bc].

- **Poorly defined borders**: Unlike erysipelas, cellulitis typically has ill-defined margins that blend gradually with normal skin [^46aa3366].

---

## Systemic findings

Systemic features may be present, particularly in more severe infections or in immunocompromised patients [^3da0bbaf]:

- **Fever**: Common systemic manifestation, indicating spread of infection [^3da0bbaf].

- **Chills and malaise**: Generalized symptoms accompanying fever [^3da0bbaf].

- **Leukocytosis**: Elevated white blood cell count may be present, though not specific to cellulitis [^3da0bbaf].

---

## Specific findings in finger cellulitis

Finger cellulitis may present with additional **specific findings**:

- **Lymphangitic streaking**: Red streaks extending proximally from the affected finger, indicating lymphatic spread of infection [^3da0bbaf].

- **Regional lymphadenopathy**: Swelling of lymph nodes in the hand, wrist, or elbow region [^notfound].

- **Abscess formation**: Fluctuance or localized collection of pus may be present, particularly in cases of purulent cellulitis or when complicated by deeper infection [^79b1d989].

- **Necrotizing features**: Severe pain, crepitus, bullae, or skin necrosis may indicate necrotizing infection, requiring urgent surgical intervention [^63d6d45b].

---

## Differentiating cellulitis from other finger infections

It is essential to differentiate cellulitis from other finger infections, such as:

| **Condition** | **Distinguishing features** |
|-|-|
| Paronychia | - Localized to the nail fold <br/> - Often associated with hangnails or nail trauma [^notfound] |
| Felon | - Pulp space infection <br/> - Severe throbbing pain <br/> - Fluctuance in the fingertip pad [^notfound] |
| Flexor tenosynovitis | - Kanavel signs (fusiform swelling, pain on passive extension, tenderness along the sheath, flexed posture) [^notfound] |
| Herpetic whitlow | - Vesicular lesions <br/> - History of HSV exposure [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical assessment and documentation

During assessment, document the following:

- **Extent of erythema**: Measure and document the area of redness and swelling.

- **Presence of systemic symptoms**: Note fever, chills, malaise, or leukocytosis.

- **Risk factors**: Document any breaks in the skin, recent trauma, bites, or immunocompromised status [^3da0bbaf].

- **Progression**: Note the rate of spread of erythema and swelling.

---

## Indications for further diagnostic evaluation

Further diagnostic evaluation may be indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Consider blood cultures, wound cultures, or biopsy [^bc396851].

- **Severe infection**: Obtain blood cultures and consider imaging (ultrasound, MRI) to assess for abscess or deeper infection [^d20a845b].

- **Failure to improve**: If no improvement within 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy, reassess and consider alternative diagnoses or complications [^notfound].

---

Cellulitis of the left finger typically presents with **erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness**, often with rapid progression and ill-defined borders. Systemic symptoms may occur, and specific findings such as lymphangitic streaking or abscess formation may be present. Accurate assessment and documentation are essential for appropriate management and to differentiate cellulitis from other finger infections.

Key points
- Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis.
- Cellulitis typically involves erythema, pain, and warmth locally and can include systemic symptoms.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, cellulitis is treated with antibiotics.
- Prevention focuses on good wound care.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with cellulitis. Risk factors Anyone can get cellulitis, but some factors increase a person's risk. Breaks in the skin Disruption of the cutaneous barrier is a risk factor for developing cellulitis:

- Chickenpox and shingles
- Chronic skin conditions
- Fungal skin infections
- Injection drug use
- Injuries and wounds.

Clinical features Local signs Local signs of inflammation are present in most cellulitis cases:

- Erythema
- Pain
- **Warmth Systemic symptoms Systematic symptoms may be present**:
- Chills
- Fever
- Malaise These symptoms can be accompanied by lymphangitis and, less frequently, bacteremia. An elevated white blood cell count may also be present. Differentiating other skin infections Cellulitis affects structures that are deeper than areas affected by impetigo or erysipelas. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:

- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia.

Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Necrotizing soft tissue infections
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis. Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. Wound care Early identification and management of superficial skin lesions is also key to cellulitis prevention. Patients with recurrent lower-extremity cellulitis should be inspected for tinea pedis and treated if present. Traumatic or bite wounds should be cleaned and managed appropriately to prevent secondary infections.

Recurrent cellulitis — evaluation and prophylaxis: Identify and treat predisposing conditions such as edema, obesity, eczema, venous insufficiency, and toe web abnormalities (strong, moderate), and perform these practices as part of routine patient care and certainly during the acute stage of cellulitis (strong, moderate). Administration of prophylactic antibiotics, such as oral penicillin or erythromycin bid for 4–52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, should be considered in patients who have 3–4 episodes of cellulitis per year despite attempts to treat or control predisposing factors (weak, moderate), and this program should be continued so long as the predisposing factors persist (strong, moderate).

### Cellulitis [^fc42512e]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common and predisposing conditions should be assessed for and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

### Cellulitis: diagnosis and management [^5760abd6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring after a local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in the primary care setting. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. There are many other dermatologic diseases, which can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis. History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can be helpful in confirming the correct diagnosis. Most patients can be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### Cellulitis in children: a retrospective single centre study from Australia [^900cd32b]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

A retrospective chart review was conducted at Perth Children's Hospital (PCH), the only tertiary paediatric centre in Western Australia (WA) with an estimated 60 000 presentations to the emergency department (ED) annually.

Records with a primary diagnosis of cellulitis were identified using the International Classification of Disease (ICD) 10 coding (online supplemental table S1). At PCH, all inpatient records from 1 January to 31 December 2018 were screened for inclusion. Due to the time constraints of the study, ED presentations from 1 July to 31 December 2018 only were reviewed. Exclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 16 years, alternative diagnosis more likely on detailed chart review or where insufficient documentation was available to assess for inclusion. Orbital cellulitis and odontogenic cellulitis were excluded from this review, as their management is considerably different from that of traditional cellulitis.

Cellulitis (ICD10 codes L03.01–L03.11 and H60.1–H60.13) is a bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the skin (epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissues) characterised by erythema, pain, warmth, swelling and rapid progression. Recurrent cellulitis was defined as an additional admission for cellulitis occurring > 30 days from the index diagnosis to exclude the possibility of counting relapses or treatment failure (representation within 30 days of hospital discharge). SSTI includes cellulitis, impetigo, skin abscess, scabies and fungal infections. Extremities are the hands and feet including the finger and toes. Geographical location was ascertained by postcode, grouped according to Australian Statistical Geography Standard Remoteness Structure on the basis of relative access to healthcare services.

The hospital in the home (HITH) service consists of a team of trained clinical nurses. It provides acute care at home for children who are medically stable and require ongoing regular medical care. They conduct daily home visits to provide treatments such as intravenous antibiotics, dressings and clinical assessments. Patients can be referred to HITH directly from ED in order to avoid an admission or from an inpatient unit to facilitate early discharge.

Data collection

Data were extracted from paper and electronic hospital records, including demographics, admission duration, clinical findings, investigations, management and outcomes. The characteristics assessed included age, Aboriginal status, geographical location, presence of common comorbidities and recurrent cellulitis. Data were captured and stored in a standardised purpose-built REDCap database by a medically trained abstractor. Adherence to treatment duration was assessed against the intravenous to oral switch guidelines.

Perceived causes of cellulitis

In both the qualitative interviews and survey, participants expressed diverse beliefs about what had caused their cellulitis, including sustaining damage to the skin from trauma, insect bites or surgery, oedema and fungal foot disease (Table 2). Qualitative interviewees also cited causes that were not included as a response option in the questionnaire, such as 'unhygienic' environments (e.g. woodlands, household lofts or coming into contact with matter such as bird faeces or dead rodents) and stressful life events.

I knocked that little finger against a wing mirror. And that was all and it didn't even draw blood or scratch. There must have been something on the wing mirror, you know? It could have been anything, bird droppings or anything. Just something, obviously

At that time I was under a considerable amount of pressure and what have you. Then the next big hit was 2010 and again work was extremely busy… there was a big amount of stress at the time and just prior to that my father had died in 2009. So 2009, 2010 and it was like… a graze or something like that on my leg and I think I'd been under quite a bit of pressure, being kind of rundown, at a low ebb

Although some interviewees appeared to have a clear idea of the cause of their cellulitis, many were uncertain owing to the lack of visible evidence of a bite mark or cut on the affected area. Similar uncertainty was reflected in the survey data.

But the funny thing was, they couldn't find any reason why; when they were checking my legs for cuts that sort of thing, and mosquito bites; there was nothing. They don't really know what caused it, other than I got it… and they treated it

Well my legs were swollen, especially this left one, but then they have been swollen for some time – I mean I didn't cut myself or scratch myself or anything, you know, to bring on an infection. I just don't know. And the doctor, I don't think knows either

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^593d74bf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence synthesis and risk of bias assessment

All included studies were described in a narrative synthesis. To evaluate the methodological quality, all studies were assessed by two reviewers (M.P. and R.K. A.) using signalling questions in the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 tool, 12 with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (S. I.L. or E.B.‐T.). If the information was not clearly provided in the study, then the reviewers assessed the signalling question as 'unclear'.

For each domain, studies were judged as 'low risk' if all signalling questions were answered 'yes', 'high risk' if the answer to at least one signalling question was 'no', or 'unclear' in all other cases. 12

### Clinical mimics: an emergency medicine-focused review of cellulitis mimics [^929a5495]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is a common clinical condition with low rates of morbidity and mortality if treated appropriately. Mimics of cellulitis presenting with erythema, edema, warmth, and pain can be associated with grave morbidity and mortality if misdiagnosed.

Objective

This review investigates the signs and symptoms of cellulitis, mimics of cellulitis, and an approach to the management of both cellulitis and its mimics.

Discussion

The current emergency medicine definition of cellulitis includes erythema, induration, warmth, and swelling. Given the common pathophysiologic pathways, cellulitis mimics often present in an analogous manner. These conditions include septic bursitis, septic joint, deep vein thrombosis, phlegmasia cerulea dolens, necrotizing fasciitis, flexor tenosynovitis, fight bite (closed fist injury), orbital cellulitis, toxic shock syndrome, erysipelas, abscess, felon, paronychia, and gouty arthritis. Many of these diseases have high morbidity and mortality if missed by the emergency physician. Differentiating these mimics from cellulitis can be difficult in the fast-paced emergency setting. A combination of history, physical examination, and focused diagnostic assessment may assist in correctly identifying the underlying etiology. For many of the high mortality cellulitis mimics, surgical intervention is necessary.

Conclusion

Cellulitis and its mimics present similarly due to the same physiologic responses to skin and soft tissue infections. A combination of history, physical examination, and diagnostic assessment will help the emergency physician differentiate cellulitis from mimics. Surgical intervention is frequently needed for high morbidity and mortality mimics.

### Cellulitis: a review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^42b86d73]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization and is seen by clinicians across various disciplines in the inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings, but it can present as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of present illness and physical examination and lacks a gold standard for diagnosis. Clinical presentation with acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, and tenderness and pain is typical. However, cellulitis can be difficult to diagnose due to a number of infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often unobtainable due to poor sensitivity of culture specimens. The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and appropriate targeted coverage of this pathogen with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

### Misdiagnosis of uncomplicated cellulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0aa2e977]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis with several mimics and no gold standard diagnostic criteria. Misdiagnosis is common. This review aims to quantify the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis in primary or unscheduled care settings based on a second clinical assessment and describe the proportion and types of alternative diagnoses.

Methods

Electronic searches of Medline, Embase and Cochrane library (including CENTRAL) using MeSH and other subject terms identified 887 randomised and non-randomised clinical trials, and cohort studies. Included articles assessed the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis in primary or unscheduled care settings through a second clinical assessment up to 14 days post initial diagnosis of uncomplicated cellulitis. Studies on infants and patients with (peri-)orbital, purulent and severe or complex cellulitis were excluded. Screening and data extraction was conducted independently in pairs. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified risk of bias tool from Hoy et al. Meta-analyses were undertaken where ≥ 3 studies reported the same outcome.

Results

Nine studies conducted in the USA, UK and Canada, including a total of 1600 participants, were eligible for inclusion. Six studies were conducted in the inpatient setting; three were in outpatient clinics. All nine included studies provided estimates of the proportion cellulitis misdiagnosis, with a range from 19 to 83%. The mean proportion misdiagnosed was 41% (95% CI 28 to 56% for random effects model). Heterogeneity between studies was very high both statistically (I² 96%, p-value for heterogeneity < 0.001) and clinically. Of the misdiagnoses, 54% were attributed to three conditions (stasis dermatitis, eczematous dermatitis and edema/lymphedema).

Discussion

The proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis when reviewed within 14 days was substantial though highly variable, with the majority attributable to three diagnoses. This highlights the need for timely clinical reassessment and system initiatives to improve diagnostic accuracy of cellulitis and its most common mimics.

### A 39-year-old man with a skin infection [^d9641861]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

The case of Mr M, a previously healthy 39-year-old man with erythema and swelling of his finger, illustrates the issues involved in treating community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections since the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community. Most community-acquired infections of the skin and soft tissues are caused by S aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Until recently, infections due to such organisms in the United States could safely be treated with an oral antistaphylococcal penicillin or an oral first-generation cephalosporin. However, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci as community-acquired pathogens has changed the picture as far as empirical therapy is concerned. Not only do community-acquired MRSA bacteria cause furunculitis and cellulitis, they have also been involved in a variety of more serious and life-threatening infections. Most of these organisms are susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, doxycycline, and rifampin, and these agents, along with clindamycin, have been used in the therapy of such infections, even though no clinical trials have proven their efficacy. For more serious, life-threatening infections, linezolid or parenteral agents such as vancomycin or daptomycin should be considered.

CLINICAL INTRODUCTION: A right-hand dominant man was transferred to our institution for evaluation by the hand surgery service. He reported that the day prior he had been sliding a sheet of plywood across the ground when he lost his grip, causing the board to slide across his left hand. He presented to an outside hospital where local exploration of the wound did not reveal any foreign body. On arrival, he complained only of mild pain in his hand. Physical examination revealed erythema and swelling over the thenar eminence and a small open area without any drainage. Radiographs (figure 1) and ultrasonography (figures 2 and 3, online supplementary video 1 and 2) were performed.DC1SP110.1136/emermed-2018-207679.supp1Supplementary dataemermed;35/12/731/F1F1F1Figure 1Radiograph of the hand.emermed;35/12/731/F2F2F2Figure 2Long-axis ultrasonography of the hand.emermed;35/12/731/F3F3F3Figure 3Short-axis ultrasonography of the hand.

Serum sickness-like reaction is a rare disease presentation. We describe a case of a man aged 58 years who presented with acute-onset polyarthralgia, intense pruritus of hands and feet, fever to 39.5°C and leucocytosis to 17.2 × 10³/mm³ 5days after completing a 10-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment of finger cellulitis. With history, symptoms, physical examination findings and reported cases in the literature of serum sickness-like reactions to amoxicillin, a clinical diagnosis of serum sickness-like reaction was made. The patient was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories with improvement in symptoms by the time of discharge.

### Outcome assessment in cellulitis clinical trials: is telephone follow up sufficient? [^5accefed]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration has scrutinized clinical trial methodology in cellulitis, partly because the definition and timing of cure are debatable. We analysed the validity of telephone self-report as a proxy for in-person follow up in a cellulitis treatment trial comparing cephalexin alone with cephalexin-plus-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Our results demonstrate poor agreement between these two methods of outcome determination and have implications for future cellulitis clinical trial design and clinical management.

### Bedside ultrasound in the diagnosis of complex hand infections: a case series [^4d6018b3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The red, swollen, infected hand can be a diagnostically challenging presentation in the emergency department (ED). Hand infections are a relatively uncommon ED complaint, and diagnoses may range from simple cellulitis to deep space abscess, and even to suppurative flexor tenosynovitis. The accurate differentiation of these clinical entities is of paramount importance to healing and recovery of function.

Case Series

In this case series, we review 4 patients with similar presenting complaints of a red, swollen hand, but with much different diagnoses and eventual treatment strategies. We describe how ultrasound was used to assist in making the diagnosis and initiating the most appropriate therapy. Finally, we review techniques for sonographic evaluation of the hand and provide imaging tips to improve visualization and accurate diagnosis. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Bedside ultrasound may allow for a more rapid and accurate diagnosis of various hand infections when diagnosis by physical examination is unclear.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^955c5117]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^960e717f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis and erysipelas (evidence summary) — microbiology and diagnostic yields — are described as diffuse, superficial, spreading skin infections and are not the correct term when pus collections are present; culture-based diagnosis often has low yield and streptococci predominate while Staphylococcus aureus is less frequent. Blood cultures are generally positive in < 5% of cases, cultures of needle aspirations yield 5% to approximately 40%, and punch biopsy cultures yield an organism in 20%–30% of cases with the concentration of bacteria in the tissues usually quite low; combined culture, serology, and tissue methods suggest the vast majority arise from streptococci (often group A but also B, C, F, or G), and Staphylococcus aureus cases are typically linked to an open wound or previous penetrating trauma including bites or illicit drug injection; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

### Interventions for cellulitis and erysipelas [^81baebd9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and erysipelas are now usually considered manifestations of the same condition, a skin infection associated with severe pain and systemic symptoms. A range of antibiotic treatments are suggested in guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions for non-surgically-acquired cellulitis.

Search Strategy

In May 2010 we searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the ongoing trials databases.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials comparing two or more different interventions for cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 25 studies with a total of 2488 participants. Our primary outcome 'symptoms rated by participant or medical practitioner or proportion symptom-free' was commonly reported. No two trials examined the same drugs, therefore we grouped similar types of drugs together. Macrolides/streptogramins were found to be more effective than penicillin antibiotics (Risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97). In 3 trials involving 419 people, 2 of these studies used oral macrolide against intravenous (iv) penicillin demonstrating that oral therapies can be more effective than iv therapies (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98). Three studies with a total of 88 people comparing a penicillin with a cephalosporin showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43). Six trials which included 538 people that compared different generations of cephalosporin, showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to1.06). We found only small single studies for duration of antibiotic treatment, intramuscular versus intravenous route, the addition of corticosteroid to antibiotic treatment compared with antibiotic alone, and vibration therapy, so there was insufficient evidence to form conclusions. Only two studies investigated treatments for severe cellulitis and these selected different antibiotics for their comparisons, so we cannot make firm conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We cannot define the best treatment for cellulitis and most recommendations are made on single trials. There is a need for trials to evaluate the efficacy of oral antibiotics against intravenous antibiotics in the community setting as there are service implications for cost and comfort.

### Assessment of antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0f35b49d]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and data are limited on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non-surgically acquired cellulitis.

Data Sources

The following databases were searched to June 28, 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, issue 5), Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) (from 1982). In addition, 5 trials databases and the reference lists of included studies were searched. Further searches of PubMed and Google Scholar were undertaken from June 28, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotics, routes of administration, and treatment durations were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For data collection and analysis, the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio and its 95% CI were calculated. A summary of findings table was created for the primary end points, adopting the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or symptom-free or symptom-reduced at the end of treatment, as reported by the trial. The secondary outcome was any adverse event.

Results

A total of 43 studies with a total of 5999 evaluable participants, whose age ranged from 1 month to 96 years, were included. Cellulitis was the primary diagnosis in only 15 studies (35%), and in other studies the median(interquartile range) proportion of patients with cellulitis was 29.7% (22.9%-50.3%). Overall, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another, and antibiotics with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus did not add an advantage. Use of intravenous antibiotics over oral antibiotics and treatment duration of longer than 5 days were not supported by evidence.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, only low-quality evidence was found for the most appropriate agent, route of administration, and duration of treatment for patients with cellulitis; future trials need to use a standardized set of outcomes, including severity scoring, dosing, and duration of therapy.

### Validation of thermal imaging and the ALT-70 prediction model to differentiate cellulitis from pseudocellulitis [^2fe44abd]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Cellulitis is misdiagnosed in up to 30% of cases due to mimic conditions termed pseudocellulitis. The resulting overuse of antibiotics is a threat to patient safety and public health. Surface thermal imaging and the ALT-70 (asymmetry, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and age ≥ 70 years) prediction model have been proposed as tools to help differentiate cellulitis from pseudocellulitis.

Objectives

To validate differences in skin surface temperatures between patients with cellulitis and patients with pseudocellulitis, assess the optimal temperature measure and cut point for differentiating cellulitis from pseudocellulitis, and compare the performance of skin surface temperature and the ALT-70 prediction model in differentiating cellulitis from pseudocellulitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective diagnostic validation study was conducted among patients who presented to the emergency department with acute dermatologic lower extremity symptoms from October 11, 2018, through March 11, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed from July 2020 to March 2021 with additional work conducted in September 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Temperature measures for affected and unaffected skin were obtained. Cellulitis vs pseudocellulitis was assessed by a 6-physician, independent consensus review. Differences in temperature measures were compared using the t test. Logistic regression was used to identify the temperature measure and associated cut point with the optimal performance for discriminating between cellulitis and pseudocellulitis. Diagnostic performance characteristics for the ALT-70 prediction model, surface skin temperature, and both combined were also assessed.

Results

The final sample included 204 participants (mean [SD] age, 56.6 [16.5] years; 121 men [59.3%]), 92 (45.1%) of whom had a consensus diagnosis of cellulitis. There were statistically significant differences in all skin surface temperature measures (mean temperature, maximum temperature, and gradients) between cellulitis and pseudocellulitis. The maximum temperature of the affected limb for patients with cellulitis was 33.2 °C compared with 31.2 °C for those with pseudocellulitis (difference, 2.0 °C [95% CI, 1.3–2.7 °C]; P < .001). The maximum temperature was the optimal temperature measure with a cut point of 31.2 °C in the affected skin, yielding a mean (SD) negative predictive value of 93.5% (4.7%) and a sensitivity of 96.8% (2.3%). The sensitivity of all 3 measures remained above 90%, while specificity varied considerably (ALT-70, 22.0% [95% CI, 15.8%-28.1%]; maximum temperature of the affected limb, 38.4% [95% CI, 31.7%-45.1%]; combination measure, 53.9% [95% CI, 46.5%-61.2%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this large diagnostic validation study, significant differences in skin surface temperature measures were observed between cases of cellulitis and cases of pseudocellulitis. Thermal imaging and the ALT-70 both demonstrated high sensitivity, but specificity was improved by combining the 2 measures. These findings support the potential of thermal imaging, alone or in combination with the ALT-70 prediction model, as a diagnostic adjunct that may reduce overdiagnosis of cellulitis.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to patients with febrile neutropenia (persistent/recurrent episodes), IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain blood cultures and cultures of skin lesions by culture aspiration, biopsy, or surgical excision in these patients, as their infection may be caused by resistant microbes, yeast, or molds. Recognize that the sensitivity of a single-serum fungal antigen test (1, 3-β-D-glucan or galactomannan tests) is low in patients receiving antifungal agents, and benefits from laboratory tests for fungal antigen or DNA detection remain inconsistent.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of ANZUPGO was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, multicenter, vehicle-controlled clinical trials (TRIAL 1 and TRIAL 2), in which 959 adults with moderate to severe CHE received ANZUPGO or vehicle cream topically twice daily for 16 weeks. A total of 638 subjects were treated with ANZUPGO [see Clinical Studies (14)].

In TRIAL 1 and TRIAL 2, adverse reactions that were reported in ≤ 1% of subjects in the ANZUPGO group were application site pain, paresthesia, pruritus, erythema, and bacterial skin infections including finger cellulitis, paronychia, other skin infections, leukopenia, and neutropenia.

In an open label extension trial (TRIAL 3), 801 subjects were treated for up to an additional 36 weeks after completing TRIAL 1 or TRIAL 2. A total of 198 subjects received continuous treatment with ANZUPGO for 52 weeks. Eczema herpeticum was observed in one subject and herpes zoster was observed in two subjects treated with ANZUPGO.

Fig 1
The patient developed erosions and a nonhealing ulcer on his left second finger that was worsening and concerning for osteomyelitis.

Fig 2
The patient consulted with his amputated finger in a specimen container. The amputation site was through the metacarpal phalangeal joint with a smooth resection margin of subchondral bone. The finger was covered by white-tan skin. 2 ulcers with necrotic borders were present at the level of the tip and ventral aspect of the proximal phalanx. The first ulcer extended to the remaining proximal third of the distal phalanx.

Histopathology of the amputated digit revealed lichen simplex chronicus prurigo nodularis, ulceration, cellulitis, and acute and chronic osteomyelitis (Figs 3 and 4). Periodic acid-Schiff, Grocott methenamine-silver, and Warthin-Starry stains were all negative.

Fig 3
Histology demonstrated a deep skin ulcer with acute and chronic osteomyelitis of the distal phalange (Hematoxylin-eosin stain, original magnification: ×1).

Fig 4
The cutaneous ulceration was deep and showed marked acute and chronic inflammation and osteomyelitis (Hematoxylin-eosin stain, original magnification: ×20).

During the last follow-up, the patient manifested persistence of his symptoms in other body sites with similar characteristics, and suicidal ideation. Pimozide was started with partial improvement of his symptoms.

Accurate diagnosis and recognition of predisposing factors has been shown to be challenging in lower limb cellulitis (LLC). Assessment of 1746 consecutive patients with cellulitis presenting to a UK university hospital showed increasing overdiagnosis, with only 31.9% of patients referred during the period 2015–2018 having the diagnosis of LLC confirmed. Recognition of at least one predisposing factor increased from 61% to 89% following introduction of more specific screening questions. This identified a need for better primary care dermatology education and the benefit of a proforma with specific screening questions for reversible predisposing factors for LLC.

- **Warmth Systemic symptoms Systematic symptoms may be present**:
- Chills
- Fever
- Malaise These symptoms can be accompanied by lymphangitis and, less frequently, bacteremia. An elevated white blood cell count may also be present.

Differentiating other skin infections Cellulitis affects structures that are deeper than areas affected by impetigo or erysipelas.
- Less defined border on affected skin
- Pinkish hue
- Well-demarcated borders
- Bright red color. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:

- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia. Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis. Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.

Wound care Early identification and management of superficial skin lesions is also key to cellulitis prevention. Patients with recurrent lower-extremity cellulitis should be inspected for tinea pedis and it should be treated if present. Traumatic or bite wounds should be cleaned and managed appropriately to prevent secondary infections.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^032a1d98]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Database and searches

The following databases were searched on 25 October 2017: Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process & Non‐Indexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to present), Ovid Embase (1980–2017), the Cochrane Library and Web of Science Core Collection. An updated search on 22 May 2018 was also undertaken in all the databases in order to ensure that the results were up‐to‐date.

Search strategies for these databases were developed with an information specialist (D.G.) and in consultation with a cellulitis expert (N.J.L.). Concepts were developed: 'cellulitis', 'diagnosis' and 'criteria', with controlled vocabulary (Medical Subject Headings terms and Emtree subject headings) and free‐text headings (Table 1). National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Evidence was also searched using the term 'cellulitis'.

Table 1
Search terms used in each database

For grey literature, the first 100 articles (sorted by relevance) on Google Scholar retrieved using the search term 'diagnostic criteria for cellulitis' were included.

The reference lists of all articles selected for critical appraisal were screened for additional studies.

Study selection and data extraction

Following the searches, all citations were uploaded to Covidence (2018) online systematic review management software, 11 with duplicates removed by one reviewer (M.P.). Title and abstract screening, full‐text screening and data extraction were conducted by independent reviewers (M.P. and S.L./R.K. A.) using predefined templates. Any disagreements between reviewers that arose were resolved through discussion, or with another independent reviewer (K.S.T. J.K. or N.J.L.). Data items sought at the data extraction stage included study aim, type, population, criteria, funding, sample size, index test, reference test and key findings.

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^d231a007]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Patients, Bacterial Etiology, and Antibiotic Treatment

Two hundred sixteen patients were included. Clinical characteristics and bacterial etiology have been published elsewhere. In brief, median age was 54.5 years (range, 18–94 years), and 57% had lower extremity infection. Of 203 patients evaluable for assessment of BHS etiology, 72% had confirmed BHS, and an additional 13% had probable BHS infection. No cases with methicillin-resistant S. aureus were detected.

### Cellulitis: a review [^05eb3c03]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cellulitis is primarily caused by β-hemolytic Streptococci and S. aureus.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.
- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin causes the entry of pathogens into the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and other inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, and the risk of treatment failure is highest in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% and 45% cases within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

### Point-of-care ultrasonography for the diagnosis of Skin and soft tissue abscesses: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^79b1d989]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Skin and soft tissue infections are a common chief complaint in the emergency department. Research has shown that clinical examination alone can be unreliable in distinguishing between cellulitis and abscesses, a distinction that is important because they each require different treatments. Point-of-care ultrasonography has been increasingly studied as a tool to improve the diagnostic accuracy for these skin and soft tissue infections. The primary objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography for abscesses. Subgroup analyses are performed for adult versus pediatric patients and high suspicion versus clinically unclear cases. Secondary objectives include the percentage of correct versus incorrect changes in management and reduction in treatment failures because of point-of-care ultrasonography.

Methods

PubMed, Scopus, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were assessed from inception to July 26, 2019, for all prospective studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography for evaluation of skin and soft tissue abscesses. Data were dual extracted into a predefined work sheet and quality analysis was performed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Diagnostic accuracy was reported as sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

We identified 14 studies comprising 2,656 total patients. Point-of-care ultrasonography was 94.6% sensitive (95% CI 89.4% to 97.4%) and 85.4% specific (95% CI 78.9% to 90.2%), with an LR+ of 6.5 (95% CI 4.4 to 9.6) and LR- of 0.06 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.13). Among cases with a high pretest suspicion for abscess or cellulitis, point-of-care ultrasonography was 93.5% sensitive (95% CI 90.4% to 95.7%) and 89.1% specific (95% CI 78.3% to 94.9%), with an LR+ of 8.6 (95% CI 4.1 to 18.1) and LR- of 0.07 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.12). Among cases that were clinically unclear, point-of-care ultrasonography was 91.9% sensitive (95% CI 77.5% to 97.4%) and 76.9% specific (95% CI 65.3% to 85.5%), with an LR+ of 4.0 (95% CI 2.5 to 6.3) and LR- of 0.11 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.32). Among adults, point-of-care ultrasonography was 98.7% sensitive (95% CI 95.3% to 99.8%) and 91.0% specific (95% CI 84.4% to 95.4%), with an LR+ of 10.9 (95% CI 6.2 to 19.2) and LR- of 0.01 (95% CI 0.001 to 0.06). Among pediatric patients, point-of-care ultrasonography was 89.9% sensitive (95% CI 81.8% to 94.6%) and 79.9% specific (95% CI 71.5% to 86.3%), with an LR+ of 4.5 (95% CI 3.1 to 6.4) and LR- of 0.13 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.23). Point-of-care ultrasonography led to a correct change in management in 10.3% of cases (95% CI 8.9% to 11.8%) and led to an incorrect change in management in 0.7% of cases (95% CI 0.3% to 1.1%).

Conclusion

According to the current data, point-of-care ultrasonography has good diagnostic accuracy for differentiating abscesses from cellulitis and led to a correct change in management in 10% of cases. Future studies should determine the ideal training and image acquisition protocols.

### Signs of systemic illness in the hand [^e8a474f4]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Many systemic illnesses have characteristic signs that are apparent in the hand. Although these findings themselves may be subtle or benign, the potential underlying illnesses can have considerable and detrimental effects to the patient involved if left untreated. It is important for hand surgeons to be able recognize these signs, understand the associated conditions, and refer the patients to the appropriate specialty provider for work-up and treatment to manage the consequences of the systemic illness. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on notable clinical signs in the hand that could indicate an untreated systemic condition that all hand surgeons should be cognizant of to ensure early referral for treatment and improve the health of our patients.

### Delusional infestation complicated by gangrene and osteomyelitis requiring finger amputation [^5fbed0c2]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

The patient is a 55-year-old man with a 6-year-history of dysesthesia that he described as sensation of movement underneath his skin accompanied by pruritus, erythema, burning, and pain. The patient noted "flies and worms" coming out of his skin and believed that his symptoms were due to a parasitic infection.

His travel history was notable for camping, which he believed might have put him at risk for an infection. He lived in South Carolina when the symptoms began, and he had traveled to South Florida, Bahamas, Kansas, Louisiana, Texas, New York, Colorado, and Nevada. His medical history was significant for primary immunodeficiency of unknown etiology diagnosed 5 years prior and treated with immunoglobulin. The patient believed his immunodeficiency rendered him susceptible to infection. No history of diabetes or vitamin B12 deficiency was documented.

Over the course of his illness, the patient was afebrile and was treated with antiparasitic (ivermectin, albendazole, permethrin, and praziquantel), antibacterial (doxycycline, ciprofloxacin), and antifungal medications without resolution of symptoms. He developed nodules, erosions, and ulcers on his upper and lower extremities, including a nonhealing ulcer on his left second finger, secondary to scratching and attempting to extract the presumed pathogen (Fig 1). Multiple skin biopsies demonstrated chronic spongiotic dermatitis, acute and chronic folliculitis, and panniculitis. Bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures were negative. Serologic studies failed to provide evidence of infection. Duplex ultrasound of the upper extremities ruled out vascular disease. While many of his wounds healed, the ulcer of the left second digit developed cellulitis and osteomyelitis, requiring surgical amputation. The patient presented to the dermatology clinic with his amputated finger in a glass container, requesting evaluation to identify the organism causing his disease (Fig 2). On physical exam, the patient presented with erythematous, eczematous patches involving the face, chest, abdomen, back, and arms, as well as excoriated papules and generalized xerosis. His left second digit was amputated with a healing stump.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^d3b916cf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Unusual presentation of acute compartment syndrome of the forearm and hand [^82d6fd75]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 49-year-old man was referred to orthopaedics with an acute onset of left forearm and hand swelling, widespread blisters and erythema after lying face down on the floor for an unknown period of time. He also presented with left wrist stiffness due to pain and clawing of the fingers and glove-type loss of sensation in the whole hand. Any attempt to straighten the fingers or extend the wrist exacerbated the pain. Symptoms deteriorated rapidly. Compartment syndrome was diagnosed and surgical fasciotomies of his left forearm and left hand were performed following multidisciplinary urgent discussions between plastic surgeons, microbiologists, anaesthetists and orthopaedic surgeons. The left forearm and left hand underwent extensive decompression and subsequent skin grafting and had good healing despite the initial skin presentation. The patient has made a satisfactory recovery and has required extensive hand physiotherapy and social care.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^fda290f2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis in nondiabetic adults — adjunct anti-inflammatory therapy: Systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 40 mg daily for 7 days) could be considered in nondiabetic adult patients with cellulitis (weak, moderate). Treating the inflammation by combining antimicrobial therapy with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (ibuprofen 400 mg 4 times daily (qid) for 5 days) or systemic corticosteroids significantly hastens clinical improvement compared with antimicrobial therapy alone; in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 108 adult nondiabetic patients, an 8-day course of oral corticosteroids with antimicrobial therapy led to a significantly more rapid clinical resolution of cellulitis, and long-term follow-up showed no difference in relapse or recurrence.

### Comparison of cellulite severity scales and imaging methods [^e36d29b1]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The term cellulite describes dimpled contour alterations of the skin that are present in approximately 85% to 90% of postpubertal females. Although the term was first used in 1873, the first clinical description of cellulite was not published until 1920, when it was described as a noninflammatory mesenchymal disorder attributable to abnormal water metabolism. Despite the high prevalence of cellulite in adult women, controversy persisted for several decades over whether cellulite represented a normal physiologic process or a pathologic condition. This debate was complicated by frequent and inappropriate interchangeable use of the terms "cellulite" and "cellulitis" (a potentially serious skin infection) to describe the same condition. However, in 1978, Nürnberger and Müllerconcluded in a landmark paper that cellulite formation was a natural, gender-linked, physiologic process. This conclusion was based on detailed anatomic studies of the skin in females and males and on epidemiologic data indicating that signs of cellulite are present in women of all racial groups.

Many synonyms have been employed to describe cellulite. In their classic description, Nürnberger and Müllerconcluded that the term dermo-panniculosis was most appropriate from a histopathologic perspective, because the characteristic histologic features of cellulite are confined to the collagen and elastica but occur in the hypodermis and the corium. Other potential synonyms include adiposis edematosa, status protusus cutis (incipient cellulite), nodular liposclerosis, gynoid lipodystrophy, and edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy.

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^f476e55b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study Population

The study population has been described previously. In brief, patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with acute cellulitis admitted to Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway) were prospectively included. Patients with drainable collections of pus or other fluid were excluded.

Clinical Characteristics and Response

Data on underlying factors and clinical findings at admission were obtained by detailed history and clinical examination. Clinical evaluation of response after initiation of intravenous treatment at admission was performed daily until improvement or discharge from hospital; local inflammation intensity and spread of erythema and, in a subset of patients, the area of erythema (length times width) were registered. In addition, blood for measurement of leukocytes and C-reactive protein (CRP) was obtained daily until a reduction of at least 20% in 1 day was observed or the patient was discharged from hospital. A telephone consultation scheduled at approximately 2 weeks after cessation of therapy was used to register residual inflammation and increase in symptoms or new course of antibiotics posttreatment. Criteria for response and failure were defined as follows:
Response at day 1: cessation of lesion spread and overall improvement of local inflammation (intensity of erythema, warmth, and tenderness) at the day 1 assessment compared to admission.
Nonresponse at day 1: criteria for response day 1 not met.
Response at day 3 ("early response"): local response (cessation of lesion spread and overall improvement of local inflammation) plus CRP reduction of ≥ 20% by day 3, that is, at day 1 compared to admission, day 2 compared to day 1, and/or at day 3 compared to day 2.
Nonresponse at day 3: criteria for response day 3 not met.
Indeterminate response at day 1 or day 3: ≥ 1 response variable missing.
Clinical failure posttreatment: increase in symptoms or new course of antibiotics between end of therapy and 2 weeks after EOT, or death or readmission for SSTI within 30 days of discharge.
Clinical cure posttreatment: absence of clinical failure posttreatment.
Indeterminate outcome posttreatment: loss to follow-up or ≥ 1 posttreatment outcome variable missing.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: part I. lower limb cellulitis [^a85e24da]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

An aging population and obesity have both contributed to a rising incidence of lower limb cellulitis; the most important predisposing factors include older age, obesity, venous insufficiency, saphenous venectomy, and edema. Streptococci are the most commonly implicated pathogen, and often reside in the interdigital toes spaces. Any disruption of the skin surface can allow the organism to invade. Effective management requires an appropriate antibiotic and attention to the predisposing factors. This article summarizes the epidemiology and treatment of this common infection.

### WSES / GAIS / WSIS / SIS-E / AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^63d6d45b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis including 23 studies was carried out to establish and compare the accuracy of physical examination, imaging, and LRINEC score in diagnosis of NSTIs. Twenty-three studies were included in the analysis with a total of 5982 patients. Of physical examination signs, pooled sensitivity and specificity for fever was 46.0% and 77.0% respectively, for hemorrhagic bullae 25.2% and 95.8%, and for hypotension 21.0% and 97.7%. CT had sensitivity of 88.5% and specificity of 93.3%, while plain radiography had sensitivity of 48.9% and specificity of 94.0%. Finally, LRINEC ≥ 6 had sensitivity of 68.2% and specificity of 84.8%, while LRINEC ≥ 8 had sensitivity of 40.8% and specificity of 94.9%.

Invasive diagnosis
Fascial biopsy with frozen section
Finger test

Fascial biopsy with frozen section has been suggested to achieve earlier diagnosis of NSTIs. However, a frozen-section biopsy is not very practical and requires the availability and experience of pathologists, and the time taken to carry out and analyze the sample could be used for debridement. The Finger test is another adjunct method described for diagnosing NSTIs. It is performed under local anesthesia. A 2-cm incision is made down to the deep fascia. Minimal tissue resistance to finger dissection (positive Finger test), the absence of bleeding, the presence of necrotic tissue, and/or murky and grayish ("dishwater") fluid following incision all suggests the diagnosis of NSTI.

Treatment
Surgical source control as soon as possible within 6 h after admission. Delay in early surgical increases mortality.
Appropriate and effective debridement techniques. Skin-sparing debridement techniques focusing on tissue directly involved in necrosis.
Re-explorations should be repeated until the time when very little or no debridement is required.
Empiric antibiotic therapy optimizing Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD) targets.
Deep samples collected at the interface between healthy and necrotized tissues during initial debridement and blood cultures allow the identification of causative pathogens in most cases.
De-escalation of antibiotic therapy be based on clinical improvement, cultured pathogens, and results of rapid diagnostic tests where available
(Organ) supportive measures
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy where it is available
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with streptococcal NSTIs

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^c44e7cc7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Quantitative survey

The questionnaire (Appendix S1; see Supporting Information) was developed by the research team based on existing research evidence and input from dermatology research experts, patient collaborators, clinicians and research psychologists. Eligible participants were provided with a paper version of the survey or a URL (included in the study information sheet) to an identical online survey on iSurvey, a survey generation and research tool provided by the University of Southampton. The vast majority of participants (94·6%, n = 227) chose to complete the paper survey rather than the online version, and returned it in the freepost envelope provided. Questionnaire data were entered into an Access database.

Analysis

Qualitative and quantitative data were initially analysed separately. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted to explore the qualitative interview data. 18 One author (E.J.T.) read the transcripts several times to achieve familiarization with the data and codes were applied line by line. Main codes were described and termed according to the language present within the data. Multiple codes were applied to comments that expressed multiple meanings. Codes were derived inductively from the data and grouped together to produce an initial coding frame. Codes were reviewed and compared to identify similarities and differences. A detailed coding manual was created to ensure transparent and systematic coding of the data. Codes and theme/subtheme definitions were discussed with, and iteratively developed by, members of the research team (E.J.T. M.S. P.S. J.C. A.L.) to offer diverse inferences and interpretation of the data. A negative case analysis was carried out to ensure that all data were taken into account rather than just selecting data that fitted with the authors' viewpoint. We finished data collection once data saturation of the main themes was reached. Using NVivo (version 11; QSR International, Melbourne, Australia) enabled a detailed audit trail to be maintained.

We then used SPSS (version 24; IBM, Armonk, NY, U.S. A.) to provide descriptive statistical analysis of the survey data. χ²-tests were used to explore associations between participant characteristics and responses to key questionnaire items. We then integrated the findings of each dataset by comparing the key themes in the qualitative data and trends in the quantitative data to assess whether data agreed (convergence), complemented one another (complementarity) or contradicted each other (dissonance). 15

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^218b291f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found no robustly developed and validated diagnostic tools or criteria for lower‐limb cellulitis. A variety of potential tools have been explored so far, including biochemical tests, imaging, predictive scoring and clinical features. However, in seven of the eight included studies, cellulitis was not the main pathology of interest and was used as a comparator. Three studies compared cellulitis with rare differential diagnoses, such as osteomyelitis, which provide limited clinical applicability. This diversity in the tools explored emphasizes the difficulty in making a correct diagnosis on first presentation.

All eight included studies identified in this review were observational studies. 16, 17, 18, 19 The sample sizes were small, with only two studies including more than 100 patients with cellulitis. 16, 18 No criteria or tools have been subsequently validated in a large prospective study.

Despite cellulitis being a common presentation in community settings, all the tools identified to date have been developed and tested in secondary care, with limited evidence of validity or applicability in community settings. No study stated that the gold standard reference for clinical diagnosis was a board certified dermatologist or other specialist with cellulitis expertise. Only one study clearly stated who made the cellulitis diagnosis. 17

All the tools developed to date can be accessed by secondary care, are already available and, with the exception of CT imaging, are inexpensive. The severity of cellulitis is likely to be worse in secondary care. However, none of these tools can be used until they are validated in higher‐quality studies.

Three studies included rare pathologies that provide very limited clinical relevance as they are not common misdiagnoses of cellulitis. 110 Blood tests need to be interpreted with caution, as ESR, CRP and WBC count are nondiscriminatory markers, but can be used to guide a clinician when the differential diagnoses have been narrowed. High levels of these markers can also help point towards rarer pathologies such as NF. Only one study included paediatric patients, 20 therefore findings cannot be applied to this under‐researched population.

Febrile neutropenia gram-positive pathogens — diagnostic culture patterns and cutaneous presentations are noted: "Gram-positive pathogens are now the most common bacterial organisms isolated from diagnostic cultures obtained from febrile neutropenic patients", and "in order of decreasing prevalence include coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans streptococci, enterococci, S. aureus, Corynebacterium, Clostridium species, and Bacillus species". The associated SSTIs "usually begin as a focal area of tender cutaneous erythema, a macular or maculopapular eruption, or a classic cellulitis".

### The ALT-70 cellulitis model maintains predictive value at 24 and 48 hours after presentation [^75037ff5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "ALT-70 score for cellulitis" for cellulitis, skin abscess and animal bites.

The ALT-70 is a clinical prediction rule for cellulitis. It is used to differentiate cellulitis from pseudocellulitis in adult patients presenting with lower extremity redness. The acronym ALT-70 stands for Age (over 70), Lesion characteristics (asymmetry, well-demarcated border), Temperature (37.9°C or higher), and White blood cell count (more than 10,000 cells/mm³). Each of these four factors is assigned a score, and the total score is used to predict the likelihood of true cellulitis. This calculator is particularly useful in emergency departments and outpatient settings to guide treatment decisions and avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. It should not be used in patients with known skin infections other than cellulitis, or in patients with skin changes due to chronic conditions like venous insufficiency or lymphedema.

The ALT-70 score for cellulitis is a tool designed to assess the likelihood of cellulitis in patients by considering four key clinical factors. Each factor is rated with a specific point value, and the total score informs the probability of cellulitis.

You input four true or false answers related to these clinical factors:

- Presence of asymmetric skin abnormalities
- Age of 70 years or older
- White blood cell count of 10,000/mcL or more
- Heart rate of 90 beats per minute or more

The scoring for these factors is as follows:

- Asymmetric skin abnormalities contribute 3 points
- Age of 70 years or older adds 2 points
- White blood cell count of 10,000/mcL or more adds 1 point
- Heart rate of 90 beats per minute or more also adds 1 point

To compute the ALT-70 score, you sum the points of all true responses, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 7.

Interpreting the score:

- A score of 0 to 2 suggests a low probability of cellulitis. It's advisable to explore other diagnoses.
- A score between 3 and 4 indicates an intermediate probability and suggests consulting a specialist for further evaluation.
- A score from 5 to 7 implies a high probability of cellulitis, for which initiating treatment may be recommended.

### Is lymphangitic streaking associated with different pathogens? [^aa41f09e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Little is known regarding the differences in microbiology associated with cellulitis or abscess with or without lymphangitic streaking. The objective of our study is to assess whether there are differences in the pathogens identified from wound cultures of patients with paronychia with and without associated lymphangitis.

Methods

Retrospective cross-sectional study at a tertiary pediatric emergency department over 25 years. We opted to assess patients with paronychia of the finger, assuming that these cases will have a greater variety of causative pathogens compared to other cases of cellulitis and soft tissue abscess that are associated with nail biting. Case identification was conducted using a computerized text-screening search that was refined by manual chart review. We included patients from 1 month to 20 years of age who underwent an incision and drainage (I&D) of a paronychia and had a culture obtained. The presence or absence of lymphangitis was determined from the clinical narrative in the medical record. We excluded patients treated with antibiotics prior to I&D as well as immune-compromised patients. We used descriptive statistics for prevalence and χ2 tests for categorical variables.

Results

Two hundred sixty-six patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 9.7 years [IQR 4.7, 15.4] and 45.1% were female. Twenty-two patients (8.3%) had lymphangitic streaking associated with their paronychia. Patients with lymphangitis streaking were similar to those without lymphangitis in terms of age and sex (p = 0.52 and p = 0.82, respectively). Overall, the predominant bacteria was MSSA (40%) followed by MRSA (26%). No significant differences were found between the pathogens in the 22 patients with associated lymphangitis compared to the 244 patients without.

Conclusion

Staphylococcus aureus represent the majority of pathogens in paronychia, although streptococcal species and gram-negative bacteria were also common. Among patients with paronychia of the finger, there seems to be no association between pathogen type and presence of lymphangitic streaking.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cultures and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent; Figure 1), systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients as defined in question 13 (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem/meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infections (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high).

### Distinguishing cellulitis from its noninfectious mimics: approach to the red leg [^e3b8f532]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common clinical diagnosis in the outpatient and inpatient setting; studies have demonstrated a surprisingly high misdiagnosis rate: nearly one-third of cases are other conditions (ie, pseudocellulitis). This high rate of misdiagnosis is thought to contribute to nearly $515 million in avoidable health care spending in the United States each year; leading to the delayed or missed diagnosis of pseudocellulitis and to delays in appropriate treatment. There is a broad differential diagnosis for pseudocellulitis, which includes inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions of the skin. Accurate diagnosis of the specific condition causing pseudocellulitis is crucial to management, which varies greatly.

Summary

Background

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

Objectives

We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower‐limb cellulitis.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using Ovidand Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower‐limb cellulitis, and we assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 tool. We included all types of study that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

Results

Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data was low and results could not be pooled owing to the heterogeneity of the findings.

Conclusions

There is a lack of high‐quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower‐limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed.

What's already known about this topic?

Diagnosing lower‐limb cellulitis on first presentation is challenging.
Approximately one in three patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis do not have cellulitis and are given another diagnosis on discharge. Consequently, this results in potentially avoidable hospital admissions and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.
There are no diagnostic criteria available for lower‐limb cellulitis in the U.K.

What does this study add?

This systematic review has identified a key research gap in the diagnosis of lower‐limb cellulitis.
There is a current lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: part II. conditions that simulate lower limb cellulitis [^15cdf1ee]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Several common conditions can mimic cellulitis, creating a potential for misdiagnosis and incorrect management. The most common disorders mistaken for lower limb cellulitis include venous eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, irritant dermatitis, and lymphedema. The dermatologist is often consulted when a patient has failed to respond to therapy, and a thorough knowledge of the differential diagnosis is essential. This article focuses on entities that can mimic cellulitis, with an emphasis of elements of the history and physical examination that can help to distinguish between lower limb cellulitis and its simulators.

### Limited evidence for diagnosing bacterial skin infections in older adults in primary care: systematic review [^63c2910c]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Life expectancy is increasing, resulting in a growing population of older people. People aged over 65 years make up approximately one sixth of the population, but account for one in three outpatient attendances. Due to a combination of factors including immunosenescence, that is age-related immune dysfunction and inability to mount an adequate response to pathogenic insults and age-related thinning of the skin, the skin of older adults is more susceptible to bacterial infections. Soft tissue and skin infections such as cellulitis are common in older adults. If these conditions are not treated promptly, sepsis may ensue. Each year in the United Kingdom (UK), there are 150,000 cases of sepsis in the population, causing 44,000 deaths.

Cellulitis is the fourth leading cause of emergency hospital admissions in the UK for acute ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs); that is, conditions that could effectively be managed in the community. Emergency hospital admissions for patients over the age of 65 years with ACSCs is on the rise. The reasons for the escalation in hospital admissions of older patients with these conditions are not clear, however, bacterial infections frequently present in an atypical fashion in older adults, which can create a diagnostic conundrum for clinicians. Symptoms and signs that are typically associated with bacterial infections in younger adults, such as fever, might be absent in older people. Poor vascular supply, more common in old age, can reduce the signs and symptoms of erythema, warmth and tenderness that are typically associated with cellulitis. Much of the research that has been performed in this area has been conducted in secondary care rather than in primary care.

There is a paucity of official guidance to aid clinicians in illuminating these non-classical presentations. There are no specific NICE or SIGN guidelines relating to the clinical features of bacterial skin infections in older adults.

In order to effectively diagnose and treat bacterial skin infections in older adults in the primary care setting, a clearer understanding of the clinical features that are predictors of infection in this age group is required. Once established, further appropriate management can be initiated, with the goal of reversal of morbidity, and avoidance of premature mortality. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the clinical features that help to diagnose bacterial skin infections (referred to as 'skin infections' from here onwards) in older adults in the community.

### Cellulitis… [^465793bc]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Cellulitis is a common bacterial infection of the deeper layers of the skin.
- It causes redness, swelling, and pain in the infected area.
- If untreated, cellulitis can spread and cause serious health problems.
- Healthcare providers diagnose cellulitis by how it looks and treat it with antibiotics.
- Speak to a healthcare provider if you have concerns about cellulitis. What it is Different bacteria can cause cellulitis, which is an infection of the deeper layers of the skin. This page focuses on one of the most common causes of cellulitis: group A Streptococcus. Symptoms Generally, skin affected by cellulitis is
- Painful
- Red
- Swollen
- Tender to the touch
- Warm The skin may look pitted, like the peel of an orange. Blisters may appear on the affected skin. Other symptoms: Some people may also develop fever and chills. Cellulitis can appear anywhere on the body, but it's most common on the feet and legs.

Risk factors Anyone can get cellulitis, but some factors can increase the risk of getting this infection. Infections or injuries that break skin The following risk factors allow bacteria to get through the skin:

- Chickenpox and shingles
- Chronic skin conditions
- Injection drug use
- Injuries that break the skin Injuries that break the skin can include cuts, ulcers, bites, puncture wounds, tattoos, and piercings. For many people who get cellulitis, experts don't know how the bacteria get into the body. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers typically diagnose cellulitis by looking at the affected skin during a physical examination. Blood or other lab tests aren't usually needed. Treatment and recovery Healthcare providers treat cellulitis with antibiotics. They can be oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics.

Healthcare providers use oral antibiotics to treat most cellulitis infections. IV antibiotics can be used to treat more serious infections. Keeping the affected limb elevated can help decrease swelling and speed up recovery.

Methodological quality

Risk of bias

The risk of bias for patient selection was high for all eight studies; six used a case–control method 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 and the exclusion criteria were not deemed appropriate in two studies as they excluded patients who were more difficult to diagnose (Table 3 and Fig. 2). 17, 18 The study by Shin et al. had a low risk of bias for the index test, as it included a prespecified threshold, 20 whereas the other seven studies did not. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 The reference standard used in the study by Rabuka et al. was considered high risk as some patients received the reference test after the index test, 17 thereby increasing the risk of observer bias. The risk was unclear in the remaining seven studies as it was not possible to determine whether the diagnosis of cellulitis was accurate. The flow of timing was unclear in seven studies, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 as it was not stated whether all the patients received the same reference standard test. The flow of timing described in the study by Fleischer et al. was considered high risk as not all the patients were analysed. 13

Concerns regarding applicability

With regard to patient selection and reference standard applicability, all eight studies included patients who had already been diagnosed with cellulitis and we cannot definitively state that the correct diagnosis had been made. However, five studies were high risk for patient selection bias as they included either a rare differential diagnosis for cellulitis, i.e. osteomyelitis and NF, 13, 14, 15 or included only patients with initially suspected DVT. 17, 20 The index test in four studies was judged to be high risk; two studies included only investigations for diabetic foot ulcers 13, 15 and two studies included imaging for suspected DVT. 17, 20

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^54035c6b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Erysipelas and cellulitis (hereafter referred to as 'cellulitis') are common bacterial skin infections usually affecting the lower extremities. Despite their burden of morbidity, the evidence for different prevention strategies is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registry databases, and checked reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched two sets of dermatology conference proceedings, and BIOSIS Previews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risks of bias, and analyses. Our primary prespecified outcome was recurrence of cellulitis when on treatment and after treatment. Our secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalisation, quality of life, development of resistance to antibiotics, adverse reactions and mortality.

Main Results

We included six trials, with a total of 573 evaluable participants, who were aged on average between 50 and 70. There were few previous episodes of cellulitis in those recruited to the trials, ranging between one and four episodes per study. Five of the six included trials assessed prevention with antibiotics in participants with cellulitis of the legs, and one assessed selenium in participants with cellulitis of the arms. Among the studies assessing antibiotics, one study evaluated oral erythromycin (n = 32) and four studies assessed penicillin (n = 481). Treatment duration varied from six to 18 months, and two studies continued to follow up participants after discontinuation of prophylaxis, with a follow-up period of up to one and a half to two years. Four studies were single-centre, and two were multicentre; they were conducted in five countries: the UK, Sweden, Tunisia, Israel, and Austria. Based on five trials, antibiotic prophylaxis (at the end of the treatment phase ('on prophylaxis')) decreased the risk of cellulitis recurrence by 69%, compared to no treatment or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.72; n = 513; P = 0.007), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) six, (95% CI 5 to 15), and we rated the certainty of evidence for this outcome as moderate. Under prophylactic treatment and compared to no treatment or placebo, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence rate of cellulitis by 56% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89; four studies; n = 473; P value = 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence) and significantly decreased the rate until the next episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.78; three studies; n = 437; P = 0.002; moderate-certainty evidence). The protective effects of antibiotic did not last after prophylaxis had been stopped ('post-prophylaxis') for risk of cellulitis recurrence (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.31; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.52), incidence rate of cellulitis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.36; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.74), and rate until next episode of cellulitis (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.56; two studies; n = 287). Evidence was of low certainty. Effects are relevant mainly for people after at least two episodes of leg cellulitis occurring within a period up to three years. We found no significant differences in adverse effects or hospitalisation between antibiotic and no treatment or placebo; for adverse effects: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.30; four studies; n = 469; P = 0.48; for hospitalisation: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.57; three studies; n = 429; P = 0.47, with certainty of evidence rated low for these outcomes. The existing data did not allow us to fully explore its impact on length of hospital stay. The common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea and diarrhoea; rash (severe cutaneous adverse reactions were not reported); and thrush. Three studies reported adverse effects that led to discontinuation of the assigned therapy. In one study (erythromycin), three participants reported abdominal pain and nausea, so their treatment was changed to penicillin. In another study, two participants treated with penicillin withdrew from treatment due to diarrhoea or nausea. In one study, around 10% of participants stopped treatment due to pain at the injection site (the active treatment group was given intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin). None of the included studies assessed the development of antimicrobial resistance or quality-of-life measures. With regard to the risks of bias, two included studies were at low risk of bias and we judged three others as being at high risk of bias, mainly due to lack of blinding.

Authors' Conclusions

In terms of recurrence, incidence, and time to next episode, antibiotic is probably an effective preventive treatment for recurrent cellulitis of the lower limbs in those under prophylactic treatment, compared with placebo or no treatment (moderate-certainty evidence). However, these preventive effects of antibiotics appear to diminish after they are discontinued (low-certainty evidence). Treatment with antibiotic does not trigger any serious adverse events, and those associated are minor, such as nausea and rash (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is limited to people with at least two past episodes of leg cellulitis within a time frame of up to three years, and none of the studies investigated other common interventions such as lymphoedema reduction methods or proper skin care. Larger, high-quality studies are warranted, including long-term follow-up and other prophylactic measures.

### Necrotising fasciitis of the thumb [^7360d9df]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Necrotising fasciitis is a rare condition that should be diagnosed early and managed aggressively in order to avoid death. We present a case of necrotising fasciitis of the thumb and discuss the assessment and management of this serious condition. A 44-year-old woman presented with a painful and erythematous right thumb and progressive swelling of her hand following a minor injury to the tip of her thumb 3 days previously. A diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis was made and the patient underwent urgent debridement of non-viable tissue. She required 1 week of supportive therapy in intensive treatment unit and was discharged from hospital after 3 weeks. Necrotising fasciitis is a rapidly progressing life-threatening infection, usually caused by streptococcal organisms. Immediate resuscitation, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and early surgical debridement are necessary in order to avoid significant morbidity and mortality.

### If it is not healing, do worry about it! [^696dd163]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 44-year-old patient who crushed her ring finger in a door 4 months earlier. She was treated in the community for her chronic fingertip wound/pyogenic granuloma. As the lesion was not healing with regular wound management she was eventually referred to secondary care for an opinion. She underwent immediate excisional biopsy with safe margins for tissue diagnosis and had histological confirmation of an advanced malignant melanoma. The staging head, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvic CT showed lymph node enlargement and widespread metastatic lesions. Our case shows how if hand lesions are not resolved following trauma, the patient needs to be assessed for unusual pathologies and, if necessary, or in doubt, referred to the specialists.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^5a606791]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This is the first systematic review that aimed to identify diagnostic criteria or tools developed for lower‐limb cellulitis. The key strength of this review is the comprehensive search strategy used, which was supported by an experienced information specialist. The focus of this review was lower‐limb cellulitis and therefore, if the site of cellulitis was not specified or a study did not present the results of lower‐limb cellulitis separately, then the study was excluded.

The limitations of this review stem from the number and quality of the studies included. Data could not be pooled as the index tests were not comparable. Also, 28 papers were excluded as the site of cellulitis was not specified or the results for lower‐limb cellulitis were not separated. These papers did include diagnostic criteria or tools that need to be further evaluated. Owing to time constraints, only the first 100 results on Google Scholar were included.

In conclusion, this systematic review has identified an important research gap in the diagnosis of lower‐limb cellulitis. There is currently insufficient evidence available to support the validity of any diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower‐limb cellulitis. As such, their utility for clinical practice or research remains unclear. Future studies should employ prospective designs, using diagnosis by board certified specialists with cellulitis expertise as the reference diagnostic standard and should be validated in both primary and secondary care settings. To gain a better understanding of what ought to be included in diagnostic criteria or tools, qualitative research that includes input from a range of healthcare professionals and patients with experience of managing lower‐limb cellulitis should be carried out.

### Prevalence of misdiagnosis of cellulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^aa1380b9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no gold standard test to accurately identify patients with cellulitis and therefore misdiagnosis is common. Using the clinical impression of a dermatology or an infectious disease specialist as a reference standard, we sought to determine the prevalence of misdiagnosis of cellulitis among nonspecialist physicians.

Methods

A systemic search was performed using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases for studies reporting diagnostic accuracy of cellulitis. Inclusion criteria required dermatology or infectious disease consultation for all patients diagnosed with cellulitis by generalist physicians. We used random effects modeling to estimate the prevalence of misdiagnosis using consultant diagnosis as a reference standard.

Results

Eight studies contributed to the analysis. For the seven studies involving inpatients, the results were sufficiently homogeneous to justify pooling data. Of 858 inpatients initially diagnosed with cellulitis, 335 (39%, 95% confidence interval: 31–47) received an alternative diagnosis from the specialist. Heterogeneity was large (I² = 74%) and the greatest contributor to between-study variance was the year of publication. Alternative diagnoses were mostly noninfectious (68%, 221/327), with stasis dermatitis (18%, 60/327) being the most common. An abscess was the most common alternative infectious diagnosis (10%, 32/327).

Discussion

Cellulitis is commonly misdiagnosed among inpatients, leading to unnecessary hospital admissions and antibiotic overuse. Most alternative diagnoses are noninfectious. Continuing medical education among general practitioners and urgent care providers will likely reduce cellulitis misdiagnoses.

Characteristics of the eight included studies

Six studies were case–control studies, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 one study was a cohort study 17 and there was one cross‐sectional study. 18 The most common setting was the ED (three studies). 17, 18, 19, 20 The studies were conducted in six different countries. Kato et al. did not include exclusion criteria. 14

Reference tests

The reference test for cellulitis was a clinical diagnosis in seven studies, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 with a bone scan used by Fleischer et al. 13 However, only Rabuka et al. clearly stated the specialty of the physician who made the cellulitis diagnosis. 17 Two studies followed up patients for up to 30 days in order to determine the final diagnosis. 18, 19

Predictive score

In a study to compare cellulitis with pseudocellulitis, Raff et al. developed an ALT‐70 score (7 points) that assessed the following: asymmetry (unilateral involvement, 3 points); leucocytosis (white blood cell count ≥ 10 000 μL⁻¹, 1 point); tachycardia (heart rate ≥ 90 beats per minute, 1 point); and age ≥ 70 years (2 points). 18 An ALT‐70 score below 3 had a > 83·3% likelihood of pseudocellulitis – an alternative diagnosis to cellulitis, and a score above 4 had a > 82·2% likelihood of cellulitis. 18

### Inflammatory breast cancer, best practice in the community setting [^1345d990]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The search terms "Inflammatory breast cancer", "breast cancer", "neoadjuvant", "clinical trial", "Breast cancer-related lymphedema", and "ctDNA" were used to retrieve relevant publications from PubMed, as well as presentations from major conferences and congresses, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, the Breast Cancer Symposium, and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. We also searched the Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and clinical trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov. We then assessed all collective information for their relevance to inflammatory breast cancer. Finally, we described the results based on answering the common essential questions about IBC management posed by the community clinical setting.

Essential questions related to IBC

How do we recognize IBC?

The first step of the clinical practice of IBC is to make an accurate diagnosis. Due to its rarity and ambiguous presentation, inaccurate diagnoses and misdiagnoses are common. Prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment are crucial due to the aggressive nature of the disease. IBC symptoms can vary significantly between individuals. In addition to the rapid onset (≤ 6 months) of breast erythema, symptoms may include peau d'orange edema, swelling or enlargement of the breast, warmth to the touch, a flattened or retracted nipple, and swelling of lymph nodes in the axilla or around the collarbone. It is important to note that experiencing these symptoms does not necessarily indicate IBC, nor does their absence rule it out. These symptoms may occur with or without an underlying palpable mass. IBC is typically diagnosed through a clinical exam and, like non-IBC breast cancer, confirmed with a breast biopsy. This distinct clinical syndrome, characterized by diffuse erythema and edema (peau d'orange) covering a third or more of the breast skin, poses diagnostic challenges that often overlap with cellulitis or mastitis. The 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual continues to define IBC based on the presence of diffuse erythema and edema involving a third or more of the breast after confirmation of invasive breast cancer. IBC uses the same staging system as non-IBC, and the disease is considered at least a stage IIIB cancer. The diagnosis of IBC is categorized as clinical stage T4d.

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^c3009c22]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Lower limb cellulitis involves infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting as expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness and swelling. Despite being a frequently encountered condition in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, there is a lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice, with no definitive diagnostic algorithm nor a clear biomarker. Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. Radiography is not required unless there is clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis, history of trauma to the affected extremity or the presence of a chronic wound. The performance of unnecessary investigations leads to patient risks and wastes resources by potentially confusing the diagnosis and prolonging inpatient lengths of stays. Clinical decision support and evidence-based guidelines are hence key in empowering appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis.

Recent observation of involvement of the skin and the vasculature in subgroups of SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected patients illustrates the need for a precise stratification and differential diagnostic evaluation of those patients in order to gain more insight into mechanisms of this novel virus. So far, pathophysiologic mechanisms behind the skin lesions occurring in the context of COVID‐19 are speculative, could be related to the virus, drugs, and other co‐factors. Knowledge from other viral infections and drug‐induced lesions of the skin and vascular system might be transferred, and observations on SARS‐CoV‐2 patients systematically evaluated to rapidly increase our knowledge on this issue. For mild cases of COVID‐19, skin lesions can be a diagnostic hint; for severe cases, due to multiorganic involvement interdisciplinary approach is of outmost importance.

### Questionnaire use depends on the study goal, target group and phase of the condition [^2455b38f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

In the end, there is no one‐size‐fits‐all solution to the assessment of the various dimensions that are impacted by the effects of skin diseases. It all depends on the particular perspective of the given study. Further research will benefit from a more detailed and systematic description of the exact purpose and added value of specific questionnaires in particular fields where they would be most useful, along with an overview of which questionnaires might work for whom, in which conditions, and during which phase of the disease.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^7be7804d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. 1 Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation. 2

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. 3 Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. 4 This results in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. 5 Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also improve the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. 6 However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. 7 A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research. 8

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower‐limb cellulitis.

We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower‐limb cellulitis only. Lower‐limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically indistinguishable from cellulitis.

A preliminary search found no previous systematic reviews that investigated the development or validation of diagnostic criteria or tools for cellulitis.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Skin signs of systemic diseases [^f8b0f1a8]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The skin should not be considered as an isolated organ but rather as a definite functioning system that communicates with the internal environment. Skin signs of systemic diseases occur frequently and sometimes feature the first symptoms of an internal disease; furthermore, these manifestations may be the sole expressions of otherwise asymptomatic systemic disorders. A number of dermatologic signs, symptoms, and disorders can be invaluable as markers of systemic disease. Although a plethora of specialized modern diagnostic tests are available, the skin still remains the only organ of the body that is immediately and completely accessible to direct clinical examination. This contribution reviews the skin signs of systemic diseases. The description of the clinical features of skin lesions observed in several internal diseases will be useful to general physicians, internists, and dermatologists in the diagnosis of a systemic disease.

### Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis: an unusual cause of carpal tunnel syndrome [^8a913dc3]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 65-year-old man presented with generalised erythematous pustular rash following an insect bite. He was initially treated with antibiotics for presumed cellulitis. He subsequently developed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Skin biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, which resolved with oral prednisolone. He also had steroid injections for his bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and this recovered uneventfully. Clinical presentation, histological assessment and EuroSCAR criteria were key to the diagnosis and management of this case.

### Common community-acquired bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections in children: an intersociety consensus on impetigo, abscess, and cellulitis treatment [^cc707232]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The main objective of this article was to offer practical suggestions, given the existing evidence, for identifying and managing bacterial impetigo, abscess, and cellulitis in ambulatory and hospital settings.

Methods

Five Italian pediatric societies appointed a core working group. In selected conditions, specially trained personnel evaluated quality assessment of treatment strategies according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies were included for quality assessment according to the GRADE methodology. MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched with a strategy combining MeSH and free text terms.

Findings

The literature review included 364 articles focusing on impetigo, skin abscess, and cellulitis/orbital cellulitis. The articles included for quality assessment according to the GRADE methodology for impetigo comprised 5 RCTs and 1 observational study; for skin abscess, 10 RCTs and 3 observational studies were included; for cellulitis and erysipelas, 5 RCTs and 5 observational studies were included; and for orbital cellulitis, 8 observational studies were included. Recommendations were formulated according to 4 grades of strength for each specific topic (impetigo, skin abscesses, cellulitis, and orbital cellulitis). Where controversies arose and expert opinion was considered fundamental due to lack of evidence, agreement according to Delphi consensus recommendations was included.

Implications

Based on a literature review and on local epidemiology, this article offers practical suggestions for use in both ambulatory and hospital settings for managing the most common bacterial SSTIs.

Table 17 — summary of physical examination outlines that inspection should examine for erythema, swelling, gangrene, and change of size of aneurysms over time; palpation should feel for intravascular pressure along the veins, examine for segmental differences in quality, assess skin temperature and pulsation along arteries and veins, and check for pain caused by finger pressure; auscultation should check for the presence of typical low-frequency bruit with systolic and diastolic components and examine for abnormal high-frequency bruit produced by turbulence due to a stenosis.
