## Question

Can an ectopic kidney be mistaken for a tumor on CT scans?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an ectopic kidney can be mistaken for a tumor on CT scans. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why ectopic kidneys create diagnostic uncertainty. Then, I should verify the imaging features that distinguish ectopic kidneys from tumors on CT. Next, I will examine real-world case evidence where misdiagnosis occurred and how it was resolved. After that, I should review the differential diagnoses and common pitfalls that lead to error. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and state the bottom line with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. Ectopic kidneys are congenital anomalies that lie outside the normal renal fossa, most often in the pelvis, but rarely in the thorax, and they are frequently discovered incidentally on cross-sectional imaging; their atypical location and variable enhancement can mimic a neoplasm, especially when the interpreter is unaware of the anomaly or when prior studies are unavailable [^42a24380] [^5e0b67f7] [^4204946d].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging features that should clinch the diagnosis on CT. A well-performed contrast-enhanced CT with multiphasic imaging typically shows an ectopic kidney to have the same enhancement pattern as normal renal parenchyma, with identifiable renal cortex and medulla, a collecting system, and a ureter coursing to the bladder; these are key discriminators from tumors, which generally lack a normal collecting system and ureteral course and enhance differently from normal renal tissue [^7877bfea] [^00f9add3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review concrete examples where misdiagnosis happened. In a 57-year-old woman with breast cancer, a pelvic ectopic kidney with hydronephrosis was initially interpreted as sacral metastasis on bone scan, but correlation with CT and recognition of absent left flank renal activity led to the correct diagnosis, preventing unnecessary oncologic therapy [^ebedc196]. In another case, a thoracic kidney was mistaken for a posterior mediastinal mass until MRI clarified its renal morphology and function, averting biopsy or surgery [^8a3d9fba]. These cases underscore that misclassification occurs when the ectopic kidney is not considered in the differential and when prior imaging is not available for comparison [^ebedc196] [^8a3d9fba].

> I need to check the differential and common pitfalls that drive error. Ectopic kidneys can be confused with retroperitoneal or mediastinal tumors, adrenal masses, cystic lesions, or even metastatic disease; conversely, true renal tumors can arise within ectopic kidneys, which adds complexity and mandates careful enhancement analysis and correlation with the collecting system and ureteral anatomy [^1ac79359] [^70aeede8] [^f4e4f8f4].

> Let me consider the role of adjunct modalities when CT is indeterminate. MRI helps confirm renal morphology and vascular anatomy without radiation, and functional imaging with DMSA scintigraphy can demonstrate uptake consistent with functioning renal tissue, which is particularly useful in children or when distinguishing a pseudotumor from malignancy in scarred or dysplastic kidneys; in select cases, PET/CT may even incidentally reveal ectopic renal location during other evaluations, prompting correct attribution of a mass-like density [^7877bfea] [^9ce3ca6e] [^25e98988].

> I should double-check the practical diagnostic approach to avoid missteps. First, review the entire imaging study for a missing kidney in the expected renal fossa and trace any abnormal soft-tissue mass for a ureteral course to the bladder; second, compare with prior imaging when available, as stability over time supports a congenital anomaly; third, use multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to confirm enhancement patterns matching renal parenchyma and to delineate the collecting system; fourth, if uncertainty persists, obtain a DMSA scan to document function or consider MRI to clarify anatomy before contemplating biopsy or surgery [^00f9add3] [^7877bfea] [^9ce3ca6e].

> But wait, what if the ectopic kidney itself harbors a tumor; I should confirm that this does happen, albeit rarely. Case reports document renal cell carcinoma arising in solitary crossed ectopic kidneys, so a solid enhancing mass within an ectopic kidney still requires standard renal mass characterization and, if indeterminate, biopsy or surgical management per oncologic principles, even though the baseline anatomy is congenital [^1ac79359] [^00f9add3].

> In summary, yes, an ectopic kidney can be mistaken for a tumor on CT, particularly when its location is unexpected, prior imaging is unavailable, or the interpreter fails to evaluate for renal morphology, collecting system, and ureteral course; however, with multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging, careful anatomic correlation, and selective use of MRI or DMSA scintigraphy, misdiagnosis is preventable, and unnecessary intervention can be avoided [^ebedc196] [^8a3d9fba] [^00f9add3] [^9ce3ca6e].

Yes, an ectopic kidney can be mistaken for a tumor on CT because it often appears as an **unexpected mass** in an atypical location (pelvis, thorax, or contralateral side) and may lack the familiar renal contour or hilum [^42a24380] [^5e0b67f7]. Key CT features that help distinguish an ectopic kidney include **renal morphology** (cortex, medulla, collecting system), a visible ureter, and enhancement matching normal renal parenchyma; however, these can be subtle or obscured by artifacts, prior surgery, or limited field of view [^7877bfea]. Misdiagnosis is more likely when prior imaging is unavailable or when the interpreter does not consider congenital anomalies, leading to unnecessary biopsy or surgery [^ebedc196]. Confirming the diagnosis with multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT, MRI, or functional imaging (DMSA) can prevent errors and avoid invasive procedures [^7877bfea] [^9ce3ca6e].

## Anatomical variants and imaging challenges

Ectopic kidneys arise from **failure of normal cephalic migration** during embryogenesis, resulting in abnormal positioning — most often pelvic, but also thoracic or crossed to the contralateral side [^4204946d]. These kidneys often have altered axes, distorted contours, and atypical vascular supply, which complicate CT interpretation [^c8812b5c].

On CT, an ectopic kidney may appear as a **soft-tissue mass** in an unexpected location, such as the pelvis, thorax, or contralateral retroperitoneum [^5e0b67f7]. Classic renal landmarks (hilum, renal pelvis, ureter) may be absent or obscured, especially if the kidney is dysplastic or has a complex collecting system [^20dd8b4c]. These features can mimic solid tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, or metastatic disease [^70aeede8].

---

## CT imaging features differentiating ectopic kidney from tumor

Several **CT findings** help distinguish an ectopic kidney from a tumor:

| **Feature** | **Ectopic kidney** | **Tumor** |
|-|-|-|
| Location | - Atypical (pelvis, thorax, contralateral side) <br/> - Often contiguous with normal renal structures | - More common renal fossa <br/> - But can occur anywhere |
| Morphology | - Reniform shape <br/> - Cortex and medulla identifiable <br/> - Collecting system may be visible | - Irregular or spherical <br/> - No identifiable renal architecture |
| Enhancement | Enhancement pattern matches normal renal parenchyma (cortical nephrographic phases) | Heterogeneous enhancement, often hypervascular |
| Ureter | Visible ureter coursing to bladder | Absent or atypical ureter |
| Fat plane | Preserved fat plane with adjacent structures | Often obliterated or infiltrative |
| Growth | Stable over time | Progressive enlargement |

---

Despite these features, **overlap exists**: dysplastic ectopic kidneys may lack a clear renal contour, and tumors can occasionally mimic renal morphology, especially in the setting of complex anatomy or prior surgery [^f4e4f8f4].

---

## Clinical scenarios of misdiagnosis

Misdiagnosis typically occurs in the following scenarios:

- **Incidental discovery**: An ectopic kidney found on CT for unrelated symptoms may be reported as an indeterminate mass, prompting biopsy or surgical exploration [^ebedc196].
- **Lack of prior imaging**: Without prior studies, an ectopic kidney may be interpreted as a new lesion.
- **Complex anatomy**: Crossed fused ectopia or horseshoe kidney variants can obscure normal renal landmarks, increasing misinterpretation risk [^20dd8b4c].
- **Limited field of view**: Focused CT studies may not capture the full anatomy, masking the renal origin of the mass [^b0aa793c].

---

## Consequences of misdiagnosis

Misclassifying an ectopic kidney as a tumor can lead to **unnecessary interventions**, including biopsy, partial or total nephrectomy, or oncologic treatment, with attendant morbidity and psychological distress [^7a56ab04]. Conversely, failing to recognize a tumor arising in an ectopic kidney can delay definitive management [^1ac79359].

---

## Strategies to avoid misdiagnosis

To minimize errors, **radiologists and clinicians should**:

- **Review prior imaging**: Comparison with prior studies can confirm chronicity and renal morphology [^1d3007d9].
- **Use multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT**: Assess for renal cortex, medulla, collecting system, and ureteral course [^1d3007d9].
- **Consider MRI**: MRI can better define renal architecture and vascular anatomy when CT is inconclusive [^da617296].
- **Functional imaging**: DMSA scintigraphy can confirm functioning renal tissue and prevent unnecessary surgery [^9ce3ca6e].
- **Maintain a high index of suspicion**: Always consider ectopic kidney in the differential of atypical retroperitoneal or pelvic masses [^42a24380].

---

## Conclusion

An ectopic kidney can be mistaken for a tumor on CT because of its atypical location and altered morphology. Careful analysis of **renal morphology**, enhancement, and ureteral course, along with correlation with prior imaging and adjunct modalities, can prevent misdiagnosis and avoid unnecessary interventions [^00f9add3].

Presentation, differential diagnosis, and resolution

Patients with CITK typically present with either vague symptoms such as slight respiratory discomfort or poor findings on abdominal or CT scans. There is frequently a misdiagnosis between CITK and other thoracic anomalies, so comprehensive scanning is recommended. CITK management is largely dependent on the patient’s symptoms and the likelihood of adverse outcomes. Surgery ought to be considered in severe symptomatic cases only. Emerging data suggest better patient selection and development of management strategies may improve outcomes in CITK to preserve renal function and reduce morbidity. This case underscores the often-incidental nature of such findings and supports the notion that CITK can remain asymptomatic and stable over time, as earlier imaging had shown a similar mass.

Intravenous pyelography (IVP) and excretory urography are outdated imaging modalities and no longer have a role in evaluating mediastinal masses or ectopic kidneys in modern practice. Instead, CT with intravenous contrast is critical for diagnosing this rare condition, as it provides detailed imaging at appropriate phases for differential diagnosis. Static renal scintigraphy (DMSA) is also important to assess the functional capacity of the ectopic kidney and aids in treatment planning.

An ectopic kidney is often found inadvertently during CT, ultrasonography, MRI, or urologic physical examination. Ectopic kidneys usually occur in the pelvis. A pelvic ectopic kidney may be misinterpreted for a pelvic tumor by less experienced physicians and surgeons. We present an extremely rare case of ectopic kidney in the deep subcutaneous region of the abdominal wall and associated with the additional abnormality of spina bifida. MRI found an ectopic kidney but failed to identify ureteropelvic drainage. Diuretic renography with 99m Tc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid showed normal functioning and identified nonobstructive ureteropelvic drainage of the ectopic subcutaneous kidney.

A computed tomography scan of a 30-year-old male patient with hematuria incidentally revealed a left pelvic kidney and a lobulated mass in the left adrenal gland concerning for neoplasm. Although laparoscopic adrenalectomy was considered, serial imaging revealed the mass to be the pancreatic tail within the vacant renal fossa. This case demonstrates that ectopia of the kidney can lead to anatomic distortions that may confound the interpretation of radiologic examinations.

### Prolonged CT urography in duplex kidney [^2f000c38]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Ureteral duplication is often associated with vesicoureteral reflux, ureterocele, or ectopic ureter opening. In most cases, the duplex kidney is divided into two parts—the upper and inferior poles—each with its separate collecting systems. In some cases, however, the kidney is entirely separated into two independent parts, each with its own renal pelvis and ureter. The diagnosis of duplicated ureters was previously based on excretory urography and retrograde ureteropyelography, and now has been replaced by CTU. Ultrasonography, CT and MRI have certain value in the evaluation of duplex kidney. Ultrasonography can display the nonfunctioning upper pole and would be useful to differentiate renal cyst from renal pelvic diverticulum. CTU and MRU can delineate essentially all abnormalities of the collecting systems, ectopic ureter, and ureterocele that benefit the diagnosis of duplicated and ectopic ureter. However, these protocols are mainly useful in evaluating duplex kidney with approximately normal function and simple anomaly. However, in some cases, because of poor function and obstruction, a lack of or delayed excretory opacification limits the complete diagnostic features. Duplex kidney can be misdiagnosed as a renal or perirenal neoplasm, a renal cyst, a kidney tumor, or, occasionally, adrenal gland neoplasms. When presented with various complicated complications, duplicated ureters can be misdiagnosed as a cyst, an ectopic ureter, a ureterocele or ureteral obstruction. The opening of duplicated ureters may be outside the bladder or even extracorporal. It is difficult to show an ectopic opening from cystoscopy. Additionally, ultrasonography, CT or MRU can not effectively display the tortuous ureter and ectopic ureter openings, particularly in duplex kidney with prolonged dilatation.

Differential diagnosis and functional considerations

Accurately differentiating CITK from other posterior mediastinal masses is essential for appropriate management. Conditions such as congenital diaphragmatic hernias, neurogenic tumors, and other mediastinal anomalies must be considered in the differential. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scan, urography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have developed as an indispensable means of correct localization and characterization of CITK. These help distinguish the mediastinal or diaphragmatic abnormalities from those of other diseases.

The diagnosis of CITK requires a comprehensive approach. The following imaging modalities further help to confirm its presence and evaluate anatomic and functional status:

Radiography and ultrasound

Initial chest radiography may frequently reveal a smooth cylindrical mass with obvious suggestions of CITK. Ultrasound, on the other hand, may have to be secondarily confirmed with more definitive imaging modalities due to the limited penetration of the lung by the ultrasound.

Computed tomography (CT)

CT imaging provides much detail about renal size, shape, and volume and thus allows differentiation of CITK from all other pulmonary structures and with thickened, soft flesh, characteristic of renal tissue.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Because MRI has high resolution, it is useful for observing mediastinal or diaphragmatic abnormalities of CITK. It complements CT and ultrasonography, especially in situations where these may be limited in the information.

Static renal scintigraphy (DMSA)

Static renal scintigraphy with technetium-99 m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) plays a vital role in assessing the functional capacity of the ectopic kidney. This modality details differential renal function, helping to determine whether the ectopic kidney is contributing effectively to overall renal activity. This especially is valuable for planning treatment strategies. Functional compromise in the ectopic kidney may require surgical intervention or other targeted management approaches.

Integration of these diagnostic tools enables health care providers to make informed patient management decisions. The following sections now will delve deeper into strategies tailored for CITK based on documented case studies and clinical outcomes.

### Mimics and pitfalls in renal imaging [^f4e4f8f4]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several potential pitfalls that radiologists face when interpreting images of the kidneys. Some result from image acquisition and can arise from the imaging equipment or imaging technique, whereas others are patient related. Another category of pitfalls relates to image interpretation. Some difficulties stem from methods to detect enhancement after contrast administration, whereas others are benign entities that can mimic a renal tumor. Finally, interpretation and diagnosis of fat-containing renal masses may be tricky due to the complexities discerning the pattern of fat within a mass and how that translates to an accurate diagnosis.

Abstract

A 60-year-old man was referred for staging of prostate cancer. Initial CT scan demonstrated soft tissue lesions in bilateral renal hila, which demonstrated mild 68 Ga-PSMA avidity and moderate FDG avidity on sequential PET scans suspicious for malignancy. Biopsy confirmed adrenal cortical tissue. This case highlights an exceedingly rare occurrence of ectopic adrenocortical tissue in both renal hila.

Case presentation

Clinical information

A 64-year-old male presented with left upper quadrant pain of 1 week duration. The pain was worse when standing and relieved on lying down. On physical examination, no palpable abdominal mass was found. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a 6.7 × 4.4 × 3.3 cm, heterogeneously enhancing circular mass in the left retroperitoneum (Fig. 1 A). The enhanced scan showed uneven enhancement. The fat space around the mass was blurred and the left perirenal fascia was thickened. No lesion was seen in either of the kidneys. Moreover, there were no congenital renal abnormalities such as horseshoe kidney or ectopic kidney. The patient has a 2-year history of hypertension with the highest recorded blood pressure of 160/130mmHg and the patient reports taking regular medications. Based on clinical examination and radiological assessment, a clinical diagnosis of ectopic pheochromocytoma was made. Subsequently, tumor resection was performed through transperitoneal approach. After resecting the tumor, the resected specimens were immediately fixed in 10% formalin.

### A review of literature of a functional, congenital intrathoracic kidney [^8a3d9fba]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Case description

The patient is a 52-year-old male with an incidentally discovered thoracic kidney during a gastrointestinal bleed evaluation, reporting melena and fatigue. On admission, laboratory workup revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL (normal: 13.5–17.5 g/dL) and a hematocrit of 28% (normal: 41–50%), indicating mild anemia. A stool guaiac test was positive for occult blood. Initial resuscitation with intravenous fluids stabilized the patient, and he did not require blood transfusion. Upper endoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed but did not identify a clear source of bleeding. Given the resolution of symptoms and stable laboratory values during hospitalization, the bleeding resolved spontaneously. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis incidentally showed a 4 × 4 cm soft tissue attenuation in the right paraspinous fat in the lower thoracic spine adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm (see Fig. 1). A follow-up MRI measured the mass to be 3 cm × 7.5 cm × 7.6 cm and showed the mass to resemble a kidney (Fig. 2). The MRI also demonstrated two anatomically normal kidneys, as well (Fig. 3).

MRI of the chest and abdomen with and without contrast demonstrating an ectopic kidney in the thoracic cavity

A previous CT angiogram of the chest and lower back 2 years prior showed a similar finding that measured 37 mm × 60 mm × 70 mm, and is presumed to be the same mass. According to the radiology report, the findings were consistent with an ectopic thoracic kidney that was unchanged in size. Both Urology and Cardiothoracic Surgery were consulted. Due to the pathology being asymptomatic, both services agreed to forego biopsy and to monitor the patient in the outpatient setting. The decision to monitor rather than intervene surgically aligned with current management strategies that prioritize patient safety and quality of life over aggressive treatment modalities. This case exemplifies the multidisciplinary, non-invasive approach recommended for CITK.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 Kidney Cancer—initial evaluation and staging describe typical and less common presentations and specify recommended assessments. Patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) typically present with “a suspicious mass involving the kidney that has been visualized using a radiographic study, often a CT scan,” and with wider imaging use “the frequency of incidental detection of RCC has increased … and fewer patients present with the typical triad symptoms (hematuria, flank mass, and flank pain).” Less frequent presentations include “signs or symptoms resulting from metastatic disease, including bone pain, adenopathy, and pulmonary symptoms …” and “fever, weight loss, anemia, or a varicocele.” “RCC in younger patients (≤46 years) may indicate an inheritable disorder … and these patients should be referred to a hereditary cancer clinic for further evaluation.” For workup, “A thorough physical examination should be performed … Laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),” and the metabolic panel “may include serum corrected calcium, serum creatinine, liver function studies, and urinalysis.” For imaging, “CT of the abdomen with or without pelvic CT and CT chest (preferred) or chest x-ray are essential studies in the initial workup”; “Abdominal MRI is used to evaluate the inferior vena cava if tumor involvement is suspected, or it can be used instead of CT … when contrast material cannot be administered because of allergy or moderate renal insufficiency,” and “All imaging studies should be performed with and without contrast, such as renal protocol.”

### Ectopic insulin secreting neuroendocrine tumor of kidney with recurrent hypoglycemia: a diagnostic dilemma [^f651718e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Both multi-phase CT abdomen (Figure 1) and contrast enhanced MRI abdomen demonstrated a mass lesion arising from upper- mid pole of right kidney (Figure 1 a, 1 b, 1 c). No lesion was identified in the pancreas (Figure 1 d). Endoscopic ultrasound also did not demonstrate any pancreatic lesion. 68Gallium DOTANOC scan (Figure 2 a-c) and 99mTc-HYNICTOC (Figure 2 d,e) did not demonstrate any uptake in the pancreas but both demonstrated intense uptake in the mass lesion indicating a NET. She underwent abdominal exploration and right nephrectomy. Post-operative period was uneventful and she became euglycemic without need for dextrose infusion. Her glucose values were maintained between 120 – 160 mg/dl thus confirming the right sided mass near renal hilum to be the source of ectopic insulin secretion.

### A review of literature of a functional, congenital intrathoracic kidney [^4204946d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The rarest form of renal ectopia, the thoracic kidney, has been documented in only about 200 cases worldwide. There are four recognized causes of congenital thoracic renal ectopia: renal ectopia with an intact diaphragm, diaphragmatic eventration, diaphragmatic hernia, and traumatic diaphragmatic rupture. This condition often presents as an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients. The following is a report of mediastinal renal ectopia in a 52-year-old male patient.

Case description

The patient is a 52-year-old male who presented on admission with gastrointestinal bleeding, reporting melena and fatigue. On admission, laboratory workup revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL (normal: 13.5–17.5 g/dL) and a hematocrit of 28% (normal: 41–50%), indicating mild anemia. A stool guaiac test was positive for occult blood. Initial resuscitation with intravenous fluids stabilized the patient, and he did not require blood transfusion. Upper endoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed but did not identify a clear source of bleeding. Given the resolution of symptoms and stable laboratory values during hospitalization, the bleeding resolved spontaneously. However, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis incidentally showed a 4 × 4 cm soft tissue attenuation in the right paraspinous fat in the lower thoracic spine adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm. A follow-up MRI measured the mass to be 3 cm × 7.5 cm × 7.6 cm and showed the mass to resemble a kidney. The MRI also demonstrated two anatomically normal kidneys, as well. A previous CT angiogram of the chest and lower back 2 years prior showed a similar finding that measured 37 mm × 60 mm × 70 mm and is presumed to be the same mass. According to the radiology report, the findings are consistent with an ectopic thoracic kidney that is unchanged in size. Both Urology and Cardiothoracic Surgery were consulted. Due to the pathology being asymptomatic, both services have agreed to forego biopsy and to monitor the patient in the outpatient setting.

Discussion

A congenital ectopic thoracic kidney is the rarest form of kidney ectopia. IV urography used to be the diagnostic modality of choice; however, it has recently been replaced by less invasive imaging methods, such as ultrasonography or computed tomography. In normal urogenital development, the embryonic folds begin to form the urinary tract and urogenital ridge in week four. The urogenital ridge subsequently divides into the nephrogenic ridge and gonadal cord. The nephrogenic ridge then begins to form three kidneys: pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros. Out of these three structures, only the metanephros progresses to fully developed human kidneys. The embryologic kidneys originally lie close together in the sacral region. But as the abdomen expands during weeks six through nine, the kidneys ascend and are drawn apart to their final location in the lumbar region. In some cases, the kidney may herniate into the hemithorax via a diaphragmatic defect known as a Bochdalek hernia. However, in our patient, the kidney metanephric cells migrated past the diaphragm prior to diaphragmatic closure, which resulted in a functional kidney located in the thorax without any associated diaphragmatic defect. Due to the patient’s asymptomatic nature, Cardiothoracic Surgery and Urology collectively decided not to proceed with surgical exploration and possible nephrectomy of the ectopic kidney due to the overwhelming risks, and have elected to observe and monitor the patient’s clinical course.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we have presented a rare case of a congenital renal ectopia that was incidentally discovered in 52-year-old male who presented with a gastrointestinal bleed, which was later confirmed with a CT scan and MRI. Given how rarity of this pathology, a multidisciplinary approach, involving medicine, urology, and cardiovascular surgery was needed. Given the pathologies asymptomatic nature, the decision to continue close observation and follow-up was chosen, especially considering the risk of invasive surgical intervention. Further research and documentation is essential not only to provide optimal care in this patient, but to better understand the pathophysiology and management of renal ectopia for future patients.

### Beyond ultrasound: CT and MRI of ectopic pregnancy [^dc043fec]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Although ultrasound is the primary modality used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, various forms of this condition and their complications may occasionally be further evaluated with MRI or may be incidentally detected on CT or MRI when an alternative diagnosis is suspected.

Conclusion

Various types of ectopic pregnancy have characteristic imaging features. Radiologists should be familiar with these features and should always consider the possibility of ectopic pregnancy in the setting of hemoperitoneum or a pelvic mass in a woman of child-bearing age. Familiarity with the typical CT and MRI appearances of various forms of ectopic pregnancy facilitates prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### Ectopic insulin secreting neuroendocrine tumor of kidney with recurrent hypoglycemia: a diagnostic dilemma [^ac49b34e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Ectopic insulin secreting extra-pancreatic tumours are rare. Confirmation of the source of hyperinsulinemia is often difficult. To our knowledge, this is the first case of extra-pancreatic insulin secreting neuroendocrine tumour fully characterised by biochemical, radiological & functional imaging, histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Our patient had successful post-operative outcome and maintained euglycaemia after three months of follow-up.

### Liver, spleen, pancreas and kidney involvement by human fascioliasis: imaging findings [^60493a7b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Discussion

While fascioliasis is a well-known human parasite, it sometimes produces unusual characteristics that may influence a clinician to misdiagnose the condition.

In the vast majority of cases, the diagnosis is difficult in both acute and chronic phases and some important conditions such as liver abscesses and metastasis cannot be easily differentiated from fascioliasis. Interestingly, the larvae is able to migrate to a number of ectopic locations such as subcutaneous areas, intestines, pleura, lungs, abdominal wall, brain, cecum, epididymis, stomach, pericardial, or cerebral sites, producing very unique clinical manifestations. Serologic testing, when performed by an enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies specific to the parasite is nearly one hundred percent sensitive and specific. Thus ELISA may be used to confirm the diagnosis in acute and chronic phases [-].

Among imaging tools, ultrasonography is of little diagnostic value during the acute phase, while a contrast-enhanced CT scan can be very useful for diagnosis. In CT images one can find two distinct kinds of lesions: single or multiple hypodense nodular areas caused by deposition of the parasite (abscess-like lesions) and tunnel-like branching or tortuous hypodensity which is created as the result of parasite migration through the liver and is highly suggestive of the disease. If peripheral tortuous lesions are present, hepatic fascioliasis should be the primary diagnostic consideration.

As clinical and laboratory findings of fascioliasis may easily be confused with many other conditions, a high index of suspicion is required to establish a correct diagnosis. Both CT scan and ultrasonography can be helpful in evaluating the response to treatment.

### A rare case of ectopic intrathoracic kidney in a 1-year-old child [^797d48e4]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Congenital thoracic ectopic kidney is a rare developmental anomaly, with the thorax being the rarest and higher location of ectopic kidneys. This anomaly is usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on routine chest radiography. At least 200 cases of thoracic kidney have been described, with the vast majority of cases documented in adults. To our knowledge, this is only the sixth case of congenital ectopic thoracic kidney described in a child. Herein, we report a rare case of a 1-year-old child exhibiting ectopic intrathoracic kidney. We further discuss the embryonic background and the current management of this pathology.

### What are the risks of CT scans (...) [^76917104]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

CT has many uses in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of cancer, including
- screening for cancer
- helping diagnose the presence of a tumor
- providing information about the stage of a cancer
- determining exactly where to perform a biopsy procedure
- guiding certain local treatments, such as cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and the implantation of radioactive seeds for brachytherapy
- helping plan external-beam radiation therapy or surgery
- determining whether a cancer is responding to treatment
- detecting recurrence of a tumor. How is CT used in cancer screening. CT is used in both colorectal cancer screening and lung cancer screening. Colorectal cancer. A procedure called CT colonography can be used to screen for both large colorectal polyps and colorectal tumors.

Virtual colonoscopy is the use of CT to produce a series of pictures of the colon and the rectum from outside the body instead of using a colonoscope to view the inside of the colon and rectum. Although CT colonography is effective for visualizing tumors and adenomas, it has potential downsides. One is that if polyps or other abnormal growths are found during a virtual colonoscopy, a standard colonoscopy is needed to remove them. Also, CT colonography can lead to the unintentional discovery of medical findings in areas outside the colon and rectum that require additional follow-up procedures to rule out the unlikely possibility that these findings indicate real problems. Overdiagnosis—finding and treating a cancer that would not have caused problems during someone’s lifetime—is also a possibility, although there is little, if any, evidence of overdiagnosis after extended follow-up of the NLST.

Also, because low-dose lung CT can produce images of organs and tissues outside the lung, it is possible that abnormalities outside of the lungs, such as renal or thyroid masses, may be found. However, whole-body CT has not been shown to be an effective screening method for healthy people. Most abnormal findings from this procedure do not indicate a serious health problem, but the tests that must be done to follow up and rule out a problem can be expensive, inconvenient, and uncomfortable. Also, they may expose the patient to extra risks, such as from an invasive procedure like a biopsy that may be needed to evaluate the findings.

### Liver, spleen, pancreas and kidney involvement by human fascioliasis: imaging findings [^47a5b5e4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Human fascioliasis, a commonplace infection caused by a leaf-shaped Trematode Fasciolahepatica affects a human host by chance [-]. It seems that the rate of infection is increasing in many countries worldwide. Human fascioliasis has to be differentially diagnosed from such hepatic and biliary diseases as acute hepatitis, neoplasm, visceral toxocariasis, biliary tract diseases, hepatic amebiasis, and infection with other liver flukes like schistosomiasis. Diagnosis of the disease is achieved by locating the ova either in feces or duodendal drainage or by [-]. Imaging techniques proved to be the most useful method for confirming the diagnosis and also the follow-up of fascioliasis. Small, often peripheral, nonenhancing, hypo dense nodules with tortuous, linear, branching tracts in CT scans, which decrease in size after successful therapy, are highly suggestive of the disease [-]. Immature flukes can produce ectopic masses or abscesses in various locations and during the acute phase of the disease, other structures such as subcutaneous tissue, heart, lungs, pleura, abdominal wall, brain, cecum, epididymis, and stomach can be involved. In a particularly unusual report, direct peritoneal involvement with granuloma formation has been reported. Eosinophilic reactions can be exhibited in the body as pleuritis and pericarditis. Here, we present an extremely unusual radiologic incident of fascioliasis involving multiple organs.

### Supernumerary kidneys: a clinical and radiological analysis of nine cases [^b0aa793c]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

While it was possible to make the diagnosis retrospectively in all of the CT scans, no supernumerary kidney was clearly identified by ultrasound, although the SKs were sonographically visualized in cases 6 and 9 and abdominal ultrasounds were available for 55% of the patients. Sonography thus appears to be not suitable for the reliable detection of SKs. In two cases in which MRI had been performed, the SK was not completely within the field of view. When fully scanned, it was possible to make the correct diagnosis. Only the PET-CT scan appears to allow the diagnosis to be made as reliably as CT imaging. It appears, that the main reason for an initially incorrect diagnosis in 78% of the cases is the relatively unknown nature of a SK which is not even considered as a differential diagnosis and that patients with unclear retroperitoneal masses are generally rarely referred to urology.

It can therefore be argued that there is currently no universally established diagnostic approach to reliably diagnose supernumerary kidneys. Performing an intravenous pyelogram or CT urography (CTU) assumes an intention to diagnose, something that has been missing in most, if not all, cases presented in this work. Furthermore, such a radiological approach would still most likely not solely be expedient to secure a definitive diagnosis, as no urinary excretion was observed from most of the SKs. A MRI scan of the kidneys acquired on an up-to-date system and utilizing a heavily T 2 -weighted sequence would allow for a higher detection rate and a more precise diagnosis. However, a justified suspicion before referring a patient to MRI is nevertheless both from a clinical and economic perspective advantageous. Additionally, the appropriate area of interest in which the kidney is suspected should be carefully selected, as even in modern scanners the field of view (FOV) is often highly focused.

### Rare case of atrophic ectopic kidney with giant hydronephrosis in a 7-year-old girl [^061375f4]. Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Ectopic kidney is a rare condition. Giant hydronephrosis is also an uncommon lesion in children and is usually due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction. We report a case of 7-year-old girl presenting with abdominal fullness. The imaging characteristics of magnetic resonance urography of the lesions are reported. The findings from the radiologic investigations were suggestive of a dysplastic ectopic pelvic kidney with giant hydronephrosis. Subsequent surgery confirmed the diagnosis. An ectopic kidney with giant hydronehrosis is an extremely rare condition in children and can present as an asymptomatic abdominal mass. A careful survey for other structural anomalies is mandatory in such cases.

### Nephrogenic rests mimicking wilms' tumor on CT [^99234df2]. Pediatric Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic rests (NR) are persistent benign remnants of embryonic renal tissue. A small percentage of these may develop into Wilms' tumor (WT). Radiologic imaging is relied upon to differentiate between these entities, with the hallmark of malignant transformation being growth on serial imaging studies. There is, however, considerable overlap in their imaging characteristics. The authors present a case of two biopsy-proven NR in a 2-year-old girl with sporadic aniridia that were indistinguishable from WT on initial radiologic studies. One of the NR grew on serial imaging studies mimicking a WT, but after resection was confirmed to be a benign hyperplastic NR on pathologic examination.

### Renal mass within a horseshoe kidney: preoperative evaluation with three-dimensional helical computed tomography [^11c3f1a9]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Tumors arising within a horseshoe kidney are uncommon and may be difficult to characterize. We report a case of transitional cell carcinoma in a horseshoe kidney. Although several conventional imaging techniques were used to define the mass, each provided limited information. Recent advances in computer technology permit radiologic imaging to provide detailed examination of the horseshoe kidney with a single study. We describe the use of three-dimensional multislice helical computed tomography as the preferred modality to clarify the suspected neoplasm, vasculature, and collecting system of a horseshoe kidney. High-quality anatomic characterization will certainly enhance the opportunity for nephron-sparing surgery within this population.

### Urologic imaging of the kidneys: cancers and mimics [^29a32d3f]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a growing problem in global oncology, with a steadily increasing incidence, especially in developed regions. Its different histologic subtypes present different challenges in diagnosis and management. Advanced imaging techniques have a crucial role in distinguishing between these subtypes by highlighting unique radiographic features such as exophytic growth patterns, cystic components, and enhancement patterns. Practical suggestions discussed in this review include using chemical shift MRI to differentiate fat-poor angiomyolipomas from RCC, recognizing specific imaging markers such as pseudo-capsule in papillary RCC, and understanding the implications of negative pixel count in computed tomography scans.

### Dynamic renal ptosis demonstrated on 18F-FDG PET / CT [^14927463]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal ptosis, otherwise known as nephroptosis or "floating kidney," is a condition of abnormal descent of the kidney, often asymptomatic with controversy over its clinical and therapeutic significance. The aberrant location of renal and renal collecting system activity associated with this condition may serve as a diagnostic pitfall in PET/CT interpretation. We report a case of dynamic renal ptosis demonstrated on F-FDG PET/CT, identified as right kidney migration from an ectopic location on attenuation correction CT images, obtained immediately after upright positioning, to the right renal fossa on subsequent PET images, obtained after approximately 10 min of supine positioning.

### Imaging features, follow-up, and management of incidentally detected renal lesions [^890c5dd6]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Incidental renal masses are common findings on cross-sectional imaging. Most will be readily identified as simple cysts, but with an inexorable rise in abdominal imaging, [particularly computed tomography (CT)], coupled with a rise in the incidence of renal cancer, the likelihood of detecting a malignant mass is increasing. This review informs the radiologist which lesions can be safely ignored, which will require further imaging for accurate categorization, and which require referral for consideration of treatment. For the small proportion of lesions that are indeterminate, careful attention to imaging technique, and the use of unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in all but a few specific instances will accurately characterize such lesions. The figures have been chosen to illustrate specific imaging features of common renal lesions. Management options for malignant, or presumed malignant, renal masses include active surveillance, percutaneous ablation, laparoscopic or open, partial or total nephrectomy. Biopsy has a role in determining the nature of masses that remain indeterminate on cross-sectional imaging, prior to definitive treatment. Common pitfalls in assessing incidental renal lesions are emphasized; some of these are due to sub-optimal imaging techniques and others to errors in interpretation.

Based on SPECT/CT findings, the patient underwent laparoscopic surgery, using Tc-DMSA scan to help the surgeon to detect the small ectopic kidney.

### Pitfalls in renal mass evaluation and how to avoid them [^1d3007d9]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Characterization of renal masses with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is usually clear-cut and accurate. However, potential pitfalls exist in diagnosis of renal masses, and it is necessary to understand these pitfalls to avoid misdiagnosis and possibly unnecessary surgery. Although some of the pitfalls are related to technical factors of the CT and MR imaging equipment, others are related to errors in image interpretation. To maximize detection and characterization of renal masses, the study should include images obtained before and after administration of intravenous contrast material, including images obtained during the nephrographic phase of enhancement. One should be aware of the potential unreliability of absolute Hounsfield unit measurements and of the existence of possible CT pseudoenhancement. When CT results are indeterminate, MR imaging may be helpful in demonstrating enhancement in renal masses. Before diagnosing a renal mass as a malignant neoplasm or suggesting surgery for a renal mass, one should consider alternative benign diagnoses; when appropriate, previous images or a supporting history should be obtained.

### Successful management of ectopic kidney stones in a patient with situs inversus totalis: a rare case report [^5e5d2873]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 56-year-old male was admitted to the Department of Urology Surgery with left iliac pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and irritative lower urinary symptoms. The pain was colicky in nature, responding well to analgesics, and had been occurring intermittently over the previous few years. The patient had a medical history of recurrent lower urinary infections that were diagnosed and successfully treated without the need for hospitalization. The patient’s family history is significant for SIT, with his daughter and his brother both diagnosed with this anatomical variation. The patient’s parents were not consanguineous, while the patient and his wife are consanguineous. A chest X-ray showed dextrocardia (Fig. 1). Ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated SIT of all the abdominal organs, with an ectopic pelvic kidney on the left. The left Kidney was located in the pelvis alongside the vertebrae L3–L5, with one large pelvic stone (1*2 cm) and 3 smaller stones (≤ 1 cm) in the lower pole calyx shown on CT KUB (Fig. 2). This led to a distended left renal pelvis, along with thickening (4 mm) of its wall, indicating chronic inflammation. Ultrasound of the urinary tract showed distension following an obstruction at the left ureteropelvic junction. A renal scan using Tc-99 m diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate revealed that the relative function of the left kidney is 15.5% of the total function of both kidneys, with a glomerular filtration rate of 14 ml/min. There were no associated comorbidities or other congenital anomalies. A left nephrectomy via open surgery was planned due to extensive renal damage and limited access to laparoscopic tools. During the surgery, the pelvic ectopic kidney was found to be anteriorly rotated with the anterior renal pelvis and several abnormally located blood vessels. A Gibson surgical incision was made, retroperitoneal access was obtained, left ureter and renal vessels were isolated and clamped, the left kidney was dissected and removed successfully. Left kidney’s pathological studies reported chronic interstitial nephritis and hemorrhage, along with Florid Von Brunn’s nests and squamous metaplasia in the pelvis and calyces, without evidence of neoplasm. The patient’s condition was very good on the 3-monthly follow-up visits, with significant improvement in renal function and no serious complications.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: kidney cancer, version 2.2024 [^2bb74b10]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Kidney cancer initial evaluation and staging—patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) typically present with a suspicious renal mass seen on imaging, and with widespread imaging use, incidental detection has increased and fewer patients present with the typical triad symptoms (hematuria, flank mass, and flank pain); less frequently, presentations reflect metastatic disease with bone pain, adenopathy, and pulmonary symptoms attributable to lung parenchyma or mediastinal metastases, and other presentations include fever, weight loss, anemia, or a varicocele. RCC in younger patients (≤46 years) may indicate an inheritable disorder, and these patients should be referred to a hereditary cancer clinic for further evaluation. A thorough physical examination should be performed along with obtaining a complete medical history; laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the metabolic panel may include serum corrected calcium, serum creatinine, liver function studies, and urinalysis. CT of the abdomen with or without pelvic CT and CT chest (preferred) or chest x-ray are essential studies in the initial workup; abdominal MRI is used to evaluate the inferior vena cava if tumor involvement is suspected, or it can be used instead of CT for detecting renal masses or for staging when contrast material cannot be administered because of allergy or moderate renal insufficiency; all imaging studies should be performed with and without contrast, such as renal protocol.

### Pelvic ectopic kidney with acute pyelonephritis: wolf in sheep's clothing [^b46c5e8d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of right lower quadrate pain at the emergency department is quite perplexing. We describe a 38-year-old woman presenting with characteristic clinical and laboratory features of ruptured appendicitis with severe sepsis. However, contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen established the diagnosis of pelvic ectopic kidney with acute pyelonephritis. Antibiotic treatment eventually achieved satisfactory resolution without compromise of renal function. It is should be addressed that, even with the advent of modern imaging modalities, there can be a diagnostic pitfall in general practice when managing right lower quadrate pain in patients with typical presentations of acute appendicitis without sonographic evidence, as illustrated in this case. In conclusion, early recognition using exquisite imaging studies with raised awareness in the clinical setting and prompt antibiotic treatment can avoid unnecessary intervention, preserve renal function, and prevent a life-threatening catastrophe.

### Pitfalls in the detection of insulinomas with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor imaging [^ca2cab13]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Physiological pancreaticoduodenal uptake of radiolabeled exendin-4 in Brunner glands of the proximal duodenum is the most common pitfall for false interpretation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) imaging. The aim of this study was to analyze the pancreaticoduodenal uptake in GLP-1R PET/CT and SPECT/CT images and to identify additional potential reading pitfalls in patients with suspected insulinoma.

Methods

A post hoc analysis of a prospective study, including 52 consecutive patients, was performed. All patients underwent 1 Ga-exendin-4 PET/CT and 2 In-exendin-4 SPECT/CT scans (4 and 72 hours postinjection) in a randomized crossover order. Three board-certified nuclear medicine physicians read all scans independently. They were unaware of other results. Reference standard was surgery with histopathological confirmation of an insulinoma/nesidioblastosis and normalization of blood glucose levels after surgery.

Results

There were no false-positive readings. However, there were a number of false-negative PET/CT and SPECT/CT readings, respectively: (1) due to false interpretation of uptake in the pancreaticoduodenal region (falsely interpreted as physiological uptake in Brunner glands instead of an insulinoma in 0.6% vs 9.0%), (2) due to ectopic insulinoma (0% vs 2.6%), (3) due to small insulinoma (1.9% vs 5.1%), (4) due to insulinoma overlap with kidneys (1.9% vs 4.5%), and (5) due to nesidioblastosis (0.6% and 1.9%). Pitfalls were identified in all GLP-1R PET/CT and SPECT/CT scans.

Conclusions

Peripancreatic uptake, small size of an insulinoma, insulinoma overlap with kidneys, and presence of nesidioblastosis are potential pitfalls in GLP-1R imaging, which can lead to false reading results.

### Imaging of renal pseudotumors in children: a comprehensive review [^618ce42a]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dromedary hump

The contour of the kidney can be altered by adjacent organs, with the spleen most commonly affecting the shape of the left kidney. In this case, a focal mass appearance may develop on the lateral edge of the left kidney, which is known as dromedary hump. Due to its typical location along with echogenicity and vascularity similar to renal parenchyma, the diagnosis can often be established using US, and further imaging is generally not required.

Splenorenal fusion

Splenorenal fusion occurs as a developmental anomaly secondary to the fusion of nephrogenic mesoderm and splenic primordium in the second month of gestation. In the majority of cases, patients present with an asymptomatic abdominal mass; however, clinical manifestations of hypersplenism can occasionally be observed.

Splenorenal fusion can mimic Wilms’ tumor and renal cell carcinoma. Due to the lack of specific imaging findings, differentiation is mostly not feasible using US, MRI, or CT. Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) with 99mTc-heat-damaged red blood cells or 99mTc-colloid (sulfur or albumin colloid) is a specific method for detecting splenic tissue. In suspicious cases, fine-needle aspiration may also be performed to confirm the presence of a heterotopic spleen.

A 34-year-old woman with a history of renal transplantation and cervical cancer underwent lymphoscintigraphy using 99m Tc-phytate before surgery. Initial planar images revealed multiple foci of uptake, which were later precisely localized using SPECT/CT imaging. Notably, uptakes in the right lower quadrant were attributed to the pyelocalyceal system of the transplanted kidney, highlighting a potential pitfall in patients with ectopic or transplanted kidneys. This case report emphasizes the importance of recognizing the limitations of lymphoscintigraphy in patients with complex anatomy and the value of hybrid imaging in ensuring accurate sentinel lymph node localization.

Crossed fused renal ectopia

Crossed fused renal ectopia is the second most common renal fusion anomaly after horseshoe kidney. Ectopic kidney is located on the opposite side of the ureteral insertion to the urinary bladder, and its ureter crosses the midline, unlike horseshoe and pancake kidneys. Left-to-right ectopia is more common than right to left, with a ratio of 3:1.

The diagnosis is often made using US in cases of non-involuted cross fused kidney. However, involution of ectopic kidney may mimic inferior polar solid mass on US. Sometimes, severe dilatation of the collecting system with parenchymal involution may appear as a cystic polar lesion. MRI is helpful for suspicious cases, especially in the presence of parenchymal involution. Discrimination of renal medulla and cortex is important for diagnosis, and signal intensity of non-involuted ectopic kidney is similar to normal kidney. MR urography can demonstrate the collecting system of an involuted ectopic kidney and aid in distinguishing it from a true cystic or solid mass (Fig. 2).

### Stumbling onto cancer: avoiding overdiagnosis of renal (...) [^7a56ab04]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

That would have been the end of the story, except someone along the way had ordered chest radiography. The chest radiograph image was interpreted as abnormal, possibly showing a widened mediastinum. The recommended course of action was computed tomography of the chest. The chest CT scan revealed a normal mediastinum, a normal chest, and a 5-cm renal mass compatible with renal cell carcinoma. 1 and the question of whether the benefits of CT screening outweigh its harms is still the subject of considerable debate. 2, 3 So, Mr. Baker called complaining of hoarseness and was given a diagnosis of kidney cancer. One had absolutely nothing to do with the other; it was just dumb luck. But was it good luck or bad luck. American Family Physician, 4 some version of this story is now responsible for more than one-half of kidney cancer diagnoses. You can see the effect in our national cancer statistics.

Since the advent of cross-sectional imaging in the 1970s, the incidence of kidney cancer has more than doubled in the United States. This is not an epidemic of disease, this is an epidemic of diagnosis. It is not the result of a purposeful screening effort, it is the result of unintended incidental detection—a side effect of the increasing use of cross-sectional imaging. Some doctors order more CT scans than others. Similarly, the chance of being scanned is higher in some geographic regions than others. My colleagues and I found that Medicare beneficiaries residing in high scanning regions faced a higher risk of nephrectomy—undoubtedly reflecting increased incidental detection of kidney masses. 10 In other words, as we find more disease, the typical patient appears to do better. Mr. Baker and I made a shared decision not to pursue surgery; however, he did undergo more CT scans. Sometimes the mass seemed to grow a bit, sometimes it seemed to shrink.

About a decade later, he died of pneumonia. An autopsy showed that he had renal cell carcinoma even though he had never developed symptoms of kidney cancer, and the cancer never spread beyond his kidney. He was overdiagnosed. I learned a great deal from Mr. Baker. Not all cancers invariably progress. Survival statistics can be very misleading, and comparisons across time and place are more reflective of diagnostic practice than the benefit of therapy. Imaging—and testing in general—has real downsides, such as stumbling onto things you wish you had not. That is why we all need to test wisely and weigh the risks and benefits of diagnostic imaging.

### A rare case of a combination of ectopic kidney and medial arcuate ligament syndrome: a case report [^c8812b5c]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ectopic kidney and median arcuate ligament (MAL) syndrome are both rare conditions. The incidence of pelvic kidney is about 3-4.5% in previous report.Most ectopic kidneys are found incidentally on radiographic examination for atypical abdominal symptoms. The possible problems after ectopic kidney include structural and architectural anomalies in the kidney itself, abnormal pelvic vascular pattern, and the relationship with other pelvic organs. Following the anatomical abnormality, conditions such as ureter obstruction, infection, and urolithiasis may occur. Patients should have regular clinic follow-ups and be alert to any abdominal or pelvic symptoms.

MAL syndrome, also called celiac artery compression syndrome, is a rare condition resulting from anatomical compression of the celiac axis or celiac ganglion by the MAL and diaphragmatic crura. The incidence of MAL syndrome in the general population is not well understood. It is more commonly reported in women aged 30 to 50 years or with a thin body habitus. The clinical symptoms are often non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, postprandial abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, weight loss, and bloating. For such a rare disease, it is commonly a diagnosis of exclusion or an incidental finding during image analysis for other reasons. We report the case of a young woman presenting with both these rare conditions. This report follows the CARE checklists for case reporting.

Renal cell cancer is one of the few tumors in which well-documented cases of spontaneous tumor regression in the absence of therapy exist, but this regression occurs rarely and may not lead to long-term survival. Treatment Modalities Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment of this disease. Even in patients with disseminated tumor, locoregional forms of therapy may play an important role in palliating symptoms of the primary tumor or of ectopic hormone production. Systemic therapy has demonstrated only limited effectiveness. Some investigators have found that granular cell tumors have a worse prognosis, but this finding is not universal. Distinguishing between well-differentiated renal adenocarcinomas and renal adenomas can be difficult. The diagnosis is usually made arbitrarily based on the size of the mass, but size alone should not influence the treatment approach because metastases can occur with lesions as small as 0. 5 cm.
- OS will be assessed when the study has longer follow-up. Questions have been raised about confounding issues that may have resulted in the significant improvement in DFS in the KEYNOTE-564 trial. An uneven number of patients dropped out in the early follow-up period, which led to a lack of information about recurrence in the control group for the censored patients. Only 36% of the 166 patients in the control group received immunotherapy at relapse, despite conclusive evidence for an OS advantage when immunotherapy is given to patients with metastatic disease. Surgery is extended to remove the entire renal vein and caval thrombus and a portion of the vena cava as necessary. EBRT has been given before or after nephrectomy, without conclusive evidence that it improves survival compared with the results of surgery alone. However, it may benefit selected patients with more extensive tumors.

This stage of renal cell cancer is curable with surgery in a small minority of patients. A radical nephrectomy and lymph node dissection is necessary. The value of preoperative and postoperative EBRT has not been demonstrated, but EBRT may be used for palliation in patients who are not candidates for surgery. Arterial embolization of the tumor with Gelfoam or other materials may be used preoperatively to reduce blood loss at nephrectomy or for palliation in patients with inoperable disease. deathwas 0. 63.

### Laparoscopy for definite localization and simultaneous treatment of ectopic ureter draining a dysplastic kidney in children [^3b77c9c7]. Journal of Endourology (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Single-system ectopic ureter draining a dysplastic kidney is a rare urologic abnormality. In this study, we evaluated our own experience using laparoscopy for the simultaneous identification and removal of such ureterorenal units.

Patients and Methods

Between February 1999 and August 2001, four girls with a mean age of 11 years presented with urinary incontinence. After imaging studies including CT scan, MRI, or both were done, all the patients underwent laparoscopy for definitive localization and simultaneous treatment.

Results

In all cases, ultrasonography and intravenous urography combined to reveal a single normal kidney. Even the CT scan could not identify the dysplastic kidney or ectopic ureter in three children. Laparoscopy was performed transperitoneally in all four patients, and a small dysplastic kidney was identified. Discovery of the kidney was not difficult because we initially identified the ureter crossing over the iliac vessels. Laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was successful in all patients with a mean operative time of 102 minutes. There was no significant intraoperative or postoperative complication, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 2.5 days. All patients have remained completely dry without any problems after surgery.

Conclusions

For patients having a clinical suspicion of ectopic ureter draining a dysplastic kidney, laparoscopy may represent an alternative modality for simultaneous diagnosis and treatment.

### CT imaging of mass-like renal lesions in children [^12120039]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Mass-like renal lesions in children occur in a diverse spectrum of conditions including benign and malignant neoplasm, infection, infarction, lymphatic malformation, and traumatic injury. Although mass-like renal lesions can sometimes be suspected on plain radiographs and evaluated with US in children, subsequent CT is usually performed for the confirmation of diagnosis and further characterization. The purpose of this pictorial essay was to review the CT imaging findings of both common and uncommon mass-like renal lesions in pediatric patients. Understanding the characteristic CT appearance of mass-like renal lesions in children enables an accurate diagnosis and optimizes patient management.

### Characterization of small solid renal lesions: can benign and malignant tumors be differentiated with CT? [^c2e47961]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CT in determining whether a small solid renal enhancing mass is benign or malignant.

Materials and Methods

Ninety-nine biopsies of enhancing solid renal masses 4 cm or smaller without fat on CT scans were performed under CT fluoroscopic guidance. The growth pattern, interface with parenchyma, presence of a scar and segmental inversion enhancement, unenhanced CT histogram, and pattern and degree of enhancement on triphasic MDCT images were independently evaluated by two radiologists. Biopsy and pathology reports were used as the reference standard, and imaging follow-up of benign lesions was performed for at least 1 year. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the significance of CT criteria in differentiating malignant from benign lesions.

Results

Of the 99 lesions, 74 (75%) were malignant at biopsy, and 25 (25%) were benign. Lesions with gradual enhancement were more likely to be benign. No significant correlation was found between other CT features and a malignant or benign diagnosis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of progressive enhancement for a diagnosis of benignity were 60%, 73%, 43%, and 84%.

Conclusion

In the evaluation of enhancing small solid renal lesions without fat, no CT criteria were of substantial help in differentiating malignant from benign lesions.

### Imaging for renal tumors [^2d4186b8]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review summarizes current developments in the imaging of renal tumors.

Recent Findings

Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound are used for diagnosing, characterizing, and staging renal tumors. Recent advances have been made in many areas, but the most significant changes have occurred in helical CT. The traditional roles for CT and magnetic resonance imaging have been expanded to include the use of three-dimensional CT and magnetic resonance imaging as surgical planning tools. Three-phase CT scans are commonly performed for detection, characterization, and staging of renal lesions, but pelvic CT is probably not needed for preoperative staging. Three-phase CT scans are more sensitive for characterization and for identifying the renal vasculature. Enhancement characteristics on these scans can help to distinguish between different tumor types. Finally, CT urography is a promising alternative to conventional excretory urography, with the potential to simplify the imaging evaluation of patients with hematuria.

Summary

Although ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging have many indications for imaging renal tumors, CT, with new uses and improved diagnostic capabilities, remains the gold standard in renal imaging.

### Detection of ectopic ureteral insertion to vagina with hypoplastic ectopic kidney by three-dimensional computed tomography [^b42cb44f]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

A 3-year-old girl presented with constant urinary dribbling. 3D-CT imaging clearly demonstrated the left hypoplastic ectopic kidney and vaginal insertion of a single ureter. Left kidney contributed 1.6% of total renal function. She was diagnosed as having a left hypoplastic ectopic kidney with ectopic ureter draining into the vagina, and laparoscopic nephrouretectomy was performed. Although some imaging modalities rarely show ectopic insertion of the ureter, 3D-CT imaging can accurately depict both hypoplastic ectopic kidney and ectopic ureteral insertion, and improve the visualization of these structures as well as delineating the relationship among the ureter, bladder and vagina.

### Open partial nephrectomy for wilms' tumor in a cross-fused pelvic ectopic kidney [^fd25e74b]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Wilms' tumor is the most common pediatric solid renal tumor. Cross-fused renal ectopia is a rare congenital anomaly in which the left and right kidneys become fused and fail to ascend from the pelvis and abdomen. We report a case of a 5-year-old girl that underwent open partial nephrectomy on a cross-fused ectopic kidney, "pancake kidney," after incidental discovery of a solid renal mass found to be a Wilms' tumor. Thorough review of the literature shows that this combination of Wilms' tumor in the setting of cross-fused renal ectopia has only been reported twice previously.

Methods

Subjects

The institutional review board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for patient informed consent. Between January 2005 and October 2010, seventeen patients (9 males and 8 females; age range: 2.5 ~ 56 y; mean age: 40.4 y) with duplex kidney were included in this study. These patients demonstrated a renal mass on sonography, MRI or CT. Two blinded abdominal radiologists (Honghan Gong with 40 years of experiences and one of three others, each with up to five years of experiences) independently reviewed the images for the systemic evaluation and diagnosis. Of the seventeen patients with duplex kidney in our study, 15 presented with urinary tract infection and 2 with ectopic ureteral orifice for hospital visits.

### Wilms tumor, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^b40a69ca]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Wilms tumor (WT) imaging and metastatic evaluation—Abdominal and pelvic CT with contrast or MRI with and without contrast is then often used to evaluate the extent and involvement of the kidney mass identified on US, and CT should include standard coronal and sagittal reconstructions. When bilateral disease is suspected, MRI is the preferred modality because it may help to distinguish between nephrogenic rests and WT. If a diagnosis of WT or any malignant kidney tumor is suspected, further imaging assessments for metastatic disease should be performed; chest CT with and without contrast should be conducted for the evaluation of pulmonary nodules, which are the most common site of metastatic disease, and the chest CT should be performed without sedation as sedation increases dependent atelectasis that can obscure lung nodules.

### Rare presentation of May-Thurner syndrome in childhood with lower abdominal ectopic kidney [^ddaa73a0]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We report a case of a child who presented clinically with features of nephrotic syndrome and May-Thurner syndrome consecutively in the first decade of life. Initially, the nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed and treated. May-Thurner syndrome was suspected clinically in later childhood when there was remission of nephrotic syndrome with persistent left lower leg swelling. The specific imaging modalities are used to document the mechanical compression of the left common iliac vein by the lower abdominal ectopic left kidney before definite management. Our discussion highlights the role of various imaging modalities in the diagnosis of May-Thurner syndrome.

### 2009 EANM parathyroid guidelines [^7292c0d9]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

The present guidelines were issued by the Parathyroid Task Group of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine. The main focus was imaging of primary hyperparathyroidism. Dual-tracer and single-tracer parathyroid scintigraphy protocols were discussed as well as the various modalities of image acquisition. Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder with high prevalence, typically caused by a solitary parathyroid adenoma, less frequently (about 15%) by multiple parathyroid gland disease (MGD) and rarely (1%) by parathyroid carcinoma. Patients with MGD may have a double adenoma or hyperplasia of three or all four parathyroid glands. Conventional surgery has consisted in routine bilateral neck exploration. The current trend is toward minimally invasive surgery. In this new era, the success of targeted parathyroid surgery depends not only on an experienced surgeon, but also on a sensitive and accurate imaging technique. Recognizing MGD is the major challenge for pre-operative imaging, in order to not direct a patient towards inappropriate minimal surgery. Scintigraphy should also report on thyroid nodules that may cause confusion with a parathyroid adenoma or require concurrent surgical resection. The two main reasons for failed surgery are ectopic glands and undetected MGD. Imaging is mandatory before re-operation, and scintigraphy results should be confirmed with a second imaging technique (usually US for a neck focus, CT or MRI for a mediastinal focus). Hybrid SPECT/CT instruments should be most helpful in this setting. SPECT/CT has a major role for obtaining anatomical details on ectopic foci. However, its use as a routine procedure before target surgery is still investigational. Preliminary data suggest that SPECT/CT has lower sensitivity in the neck area compared to pinhole imaging. Additional radiation to the patient should also be considered. The guidelines also discuss aspects related to radio-guided surgery of hyperparathyroidism and imaging of chronic kidney disease patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### A review of literature of a functional, congenital intrathoracic kidney [^1484d0ff]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Management strategies

The management of congenital intrathoracic kidney (CITK) is nuanced, often influenced by the asymptomatic nature of the condition and the functional normalcy of the ectopic kidney.

Because of embryologic comorbidities, understanding the development of CITK is pivotal for accurate diagnosis and the formulation of appropriate management plans (Shah et al. 2012). Our understanding of CITK has evolved over time. Generally, the treatment paradigm has shifted from an interventional to a monitoring-focused, non-invasive approach.

The conservative strategy is supported by the understanding that CITK, despite its unusual location, typically retains normal functionality and does not inherently carry a higher risk of renal complications such as infections or nephrolithiasis.

In the case above, we observe a practical application of this conservative strategy, where the asymptomatic nature and stable imaging findings led to a decision against invasive procedures. The team’s approach exemplifies a patient-centered strategy that minimizes potential surgical risks while maintaining patient quality of life.

### Common and less-common renal masses and masslike conditions [^70aeede8]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

As an increasing number of imaging examinations are performed, a greater number of incidental renal lesions are detected. Apart from the usual cysts and solid renal cell carcinomas, a variety of unusual benign and malignant renal lesions exist. Imaging is invaluable in characterizing these lesions and is confirmatory in some benign lesions. Renal cell carcinoma remains the diagnosis of exclusion; however, assessment of the imaging pattern in the appropriate clinical context can improve diagnostic accuracy. The objective of this article is to familiarize the radiologist with the imaging appearance of unusual non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions and correlate with histopathologic studies when available.

### Renal lobar dysmorphism: a potential mimic of renal malignancy [^95cce435]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A renal pseudotumour is any apparent renal mass that simulates a tumour on radiological imaging but is composed of normal tissue. Renal pseudotumours may be inflammatory, vascular, postsurgical or congenital. We report a case of renal lobar dysmorphism (RLD) of the kidney, a congenital renal pseudotumour. A 45-year-old man presented with scrotal swelling. Testicular ultrasound showed an epididymal cyst. Renal ultrasound showed a right solid renal apparent mass of 2.4cm in diameter. Triphasic renal CT showed this was consistent with RLD. Intravenous urography confirmed a central calyx within the dysmorphic lobe. RLD is a rare congenital normal anatomical variant, which can appear as a renal pseudotumour. No further investigation or intervention is necessary. We present the radiological findings of RLD and review the literature.

### A review of literature of a functional, congenital intrathoracic kidney [^a622c4c0]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The congenital intrathoracic kidney (CITK) is a rare anomaly in the already unique research realm of renal ectopia. Characterized by its atypical location within the thoracic cavity, CITK challenges conventional medical understanding and management approaches. This condition often emerges unexpectedly, discovered incidentally during evaluations for unrelated health concerns such as gastrointestinal issues. The rarity of CITK, coupled with its typically asymptomatic nature, underscores the importance of informed diagnostic and management strategies, particularly when surgical intervention may or may not be the most prudent course of action for asymptomatic individuals.

### Supernumerary kidneys: a clinical and radiological analysis of nine cases [^5e643515]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Most CT scans in patients with supernumerary kidneys were acquired after the intravenous application of iodinated contrast medium during a parenchymatous phase in 5 mm slice-thickness, while a urographic phase was almost always missing. All MRI examinations in which a supernumerary kidney was identified consisted of at least a T 2 -weighted sequence.

A significant part of the abdominal CT and MRI examinations was evaluated in the context of daily clinical routine. Additionally, the radiological reports of all included modalities were systematically screened for incidental findings of the urogenital tract, and the respectively identified imaging material carefully assessed. In a second step, every detected anomaly was independently re-evaluated and classified by both a senior board-certified radiologist (BG) and urologist (PR), resulting in nine cases of a SK beeing identified based on the inclusion criteria described (an organ with an asymmetric renal collecting system with an arising ureter, own capsule and blood supply and without fusion with the other kidney). A histopathological examination of the SK was available for four cases.

The renal anatomy of each identified SK has been comprehensively illustrated based on the imaging material available (Fig. 1), and additional coronal and sagittal CT and MRI reconstructions are presented for some patients in Fig. 2 a-c, as these planes are considered particularly well suited to demonstrate supernumerary kidneys.

Gastric duplications are rare anomalies and usually occur along the greater curvature of the stomach. The authors herein describe an uncommon case of a retroperitoneal gastric duplication, which was not found during previous emergency laparotomy for suspected peritonitis at another institution. On subsequent computed tomography scan, the lesion was misinterpreted as a simple exophytic renal cyst. Laparoscopy was undertaken because of unresolved symptoms, and a retroperitoneal duplication cyst was successfully excised. It was lined with gastric mucosa and islands of pancreatic tissue on pathologic examination.

### Renal angiomyolipoma with contrast-enhancing elements mimicking renal malignancy: radiographic and pathologic evaluation [^2b8d0864]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of angiomyolipoma can typically be made on the basis of characteristic computed tomography findings. Varying tissue compositions within an angiomyolipoma can create difficulty in pathologically differentiating benign from malignant lesions. Epithelioid angiomyolipoma is a variant of angiomyolipoma characterized by the presence of epithelioid cells. We report a case of two discrete contrast-enhancing lesions within an enlarging angiomyolipoma that radiographically mimicked malignant elements. This finding presented a diagnostic challenge in terms of selecting medical versus surgical intervention. Surgical excision of the lesions was performed and the pathologic examination revealed a benign angiomyolipoma with epithelioid features.

### A rare association of crossed fused renal ectopia [^03ae9e51]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Most of the renal anomalies are incidental findings and the ectopic kidneys have a high incidence of stone formation. Although most of the patients with crossed fused renal ectopia are usually asymptomatic, they do present with increased susceptibility to develop complications like urinary infections, urolithiasis, and abdominal mass. There are reported cases of renal cell carcinoma and Wilm's tumor associated with crossed fused renal ectopia. There is a reported case of TAR syndrome with renal anomaly that developed Wilm's tumor. Finding of crossed fused renal ectopia warrants complete urologic investigation to rule out surgically correctable pathology in the urinary tract.

In summary, this report describes the new finding of a crossed fused renal ectopia associated with TAR syndrome. This association has not been reported before in the literature.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^00f9add3]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Imaging techniques—contrast-enhanced axial imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferred for diagnosing and staging localized renal masses, confirmation is advised after ultrasound (US) or intravenous pyelography, and a notable fraction of localized masses are benign; contrast-enhanced imaging also characterizes morphology and spread. Pre and post contrast-enhanced axial imaging, either CT or MRI, is the ideal imaging technique for the diagnosis and staging of clinically localized renal masses. Masses initially diagnosed by US or intravenous pyelography should be confirmed with pre/post contrast-enhanced imaging. Depending on tumor size, 20 to 30 percent of clinically localized renal masses may be benign. Contrast-enhanced abdominal imaging (CT or MRI) best characterizes the mass, provides information regarding renal morphology (of the affected and contralateral kidney), assesses extrarenal tumor spread (venous invasion or regional lymphadenopathy) and evaluates the adrenal glands and the abdominal organs for visceral metastases.

### The diagnostic value of DMSA scan in differentiating functional pseudo-tumors from malignancies in scarred kidneys: case series and literature review [^be787b67]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

In this work, we report our experience with five pediatric CKD cases in whom tumor-like lesions were radiologically identified in severely scarred distorted kidneys. The main objective of this work is to highlight the role of DMSA scans with single planar and SPECT images in suggesting the diagnosis FPT and ruling out malignancy. This should facilitate the clinician’s management of these patients. We additionally review the available literature to discuss the possible pathophysiology of developing these FPT in the scarred kidneys.

### A rare case of a combination of ectopic kidney and medial arcuate ligament syndrome: a case report [^1f29da94]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ectopic kidney and median arcuate ligament syndrome are both rare conditions. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of these conditions are not well studied. There are no reports on the combination of these two rare conditions.

Case presentation

We report a 24-year-old woman with fever, dysuria, urinary frequency and left flank pain for two days. The primary diagnoses in the clinic were left acute pyelonephritis and left hydronephrosis due to throbbing pain in the left costovertebral angle and pyuria. However, further computed tomography showed right ectopic pelvic kidney, left renal pelvis dilatation without definite ureteral lesion, good bilateral renal contrast enhancement, and compression of the celiac axis due to obstruction by the median arcuate ligament. Chronic abdominal symptoms were reported by the patient after repeat history taking. The patient’s condition was fully explained and discussed with her and her family, but they refused further therapy. After the acute pyelonephritis began improving, the patient was discharged for follow-up at our outpatient clinic.

Conclusion

We present an extremely rare case of a combination of two rare conditions: ectopic kidney and median arcuate ligament syndrome. No study to date has reported on the relationship between the two diseases. Given the rarity of the two conditions, no evidence or even a hypothesis exists to explain the possible etiology of their combination. More reports are required to enhance the understanding of these rare conditions.

### Calyceal diverticulum-a mimic of different pathologies on multiple imaging modalities [^042fbd13]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Calyceal diverticula are outpouchings of a renal calyx. Often found incidentally on radiological imaging, they are generally benign and usually asymptomatic, although complications include infection and stone formation. More importantly, calyceal diverticula may mimic other potentially more serious pathology on imaging, such as renal tumour or abscess on ultrasound or computed tomography and even rib metastasis on bone scintigraphy. We present a case of a patient with a calyceal diverticulum found incidentally on imaging, in which the diverticulum is demonstrated on ultrasound, computed tomography, intravenous urogram and bone scintigraphy, and discuss the potential differential diagnoses that need to be excluded in this condition.

### Mimics of renal colic: alternative diagnoses at unenhanced helical CT [^e12d7f2b]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

During the past decade, unenhanced computed tomography (CT) has become the standard of reference in the detection of urinary calculi owing to its high sensitivity (>95%) and specificity (>98%) in this setting. Numerous diseases may manifest as acute flank pain and mimic urolithiasis. Up to one-third of unenhanced CT examinations performed because of flank pain may reveal unsuspected findings unrelated to stone disease, many of which can help explain the patient's condition. Alternative diagnoses are most commonly related to gynecologic conditions (especially adnexal masses) and nonstone genitourinary disease (eg, pyelonephritis, renal neoplasm), closely followed by gastrointestinal disease (especially appendicitis and diverticulitis). Hepatobiliary, vascular, and musculoskeletal conditions may also be encountered. Vascular causes of acute flank pain must always be considered, since these constitute life-threatening emergencies that may require the intravenous administration of contrast material for diagnosis. Radiologists must be familiar with the typical findings of urinary stone disease at unenhanced CT, as well as the spectrum of alternative diagnoses that may be detected with this modality, to accurately diagnose the source of flank pain.

### Whose side are you on? The diagnostic conundrum of solitary crossed renal ectopia [^bb946dac]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2010). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man presents with haematuria and through extensive investigation is found to have solitary crossed renal ectopia. This congenital abnormality occurs as a result of a combination of unilateral renal agenesis and renal ectopia. With only 34 cases reported in the worldwide literature, the rarity of solitary crossed renal ectopia makes its diagnosis a challenge. We review the embryological theories behind this congenital anomaly and highlight some of the typical features demonstrated in our case that would lead one to consider a diagnosis of solitary crossed renal ectopia. We also describe features which have not previously been noted in case reports.

### A rare case of a combination of ectopic kidney and medial arcuate ligament syndrome: a case report [^ad1cf19f]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ectopic kidney and median arcuate ligament syndrome are both rare conditions. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of these conditions are not well studied. There are no reports on the combination of these two rare conditions.

Case Presentation

We report a 24-year-old woman with fever, dysuria, urinary frequency and left flank pain for two days. The primary diagnoses in the clinic were left acute pyelonephritis and left hydronephrosis due to throbbing pain in the left costovertebral angle and pyuria. However, further computed tomography showed right ectopic pelvic kidney, left renal pelvis dilatation without definite ureteral lesion, good bilateral renal contrast enhancement, and compression of the celiac axis due to obstruction by the median arcuate ligament. Chronic abdominal symptoms were reported by the patient after repeat history taking. The patient's condition was fully explained and discussed with her and her family, but they refused further therapy. After the acute pyelonephritis began improving, the patient was discharged for follow-up at our outpatient clinic.

Conclusion

We present an extremely rare case of a combination of two rare conditions: ectopic kidney and median arcuate ligament syndrome. No study to date has reported on the relationship between the two diseases. Given the rarity of the two conditions, no evidence or even a hypothesis exists to explain the possible etiology of their combination. More reports are required to enhance the understanding of these rare conditions.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^58a6c62e]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)—atypical presentation and diagnostic considerations for RCC—Healthcare providers should be aware of atypical presentation of RCC in people with ADPKD, including more frequent fever (32% vs. 7%), bilateral disease (12% vs. 1%–5%), multicentric disease (28% vs. 6%), and sarcomatoid features (33% vs. 1%–5%); common ADPKD findings may confound diagnosis, but systemic signs or symptoms without another explanation or a rapidly growing complex cystic kidney lesion should raise the suspicion of RCC, and contrast computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often able to distinguish malignancy from complex cysts due to hemorrhage, while percutaneous aspiration and cytologic examination may help establish the diagnosis.

### The diagnostic value of DMSA scan in differentiating functional pseudo-tumors from malignancies in scarred kidneys: case series and literature review [^9ce3ca6e]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children can be severe enough to cause renal scarring and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Classically, the mature kidney is considered to have limited cellular regenerative capacity. However, this concept has been challenged by many studies in which biological evidence was introduced suggesting the ability of the kidneys to endogenously regenerate [,–]. There are a few reports describing the development of parenchymal functioning tumor-like masses in scarred kidneys.. Although some reports describe these functioning pseudo-tumors (FPT) as “regenerating nodules”, their nature and whether they are newly regenerated renal tissue or an entity of focal compensatory parenchymal hypertrophy is a matter of scientific debate.

In the literature, the terms “renal regeneration nodule” and “nodular compensatory hypertrophy” are used to describe functioning or histologically normal renal masses that develop in the setting of scarred kidneys. For simplicity and to avoid confusing terminology, we elect to call these functioning tumor-like lesions “FPT” throughout the manuscript.

The radiologic characterization of these FPT poses a clinical dilemma and a diagnostic challenge. Conducting further clinical investigations to rule out malignancies in these lesions might subject patients to radiation exposure, complications of tissue sampling and possible surgical interventions in addition to the imposed psycho-economic factors such as anxiety and high costs. Moreover, the underlying CKD necessitates avoiding contrast studies which limits the radiologic options needed to evaluate these masses. In patients with CKD, ultrasound (US), non-contrast computed tomography (CT), and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are frequently inconclusive in differentiating malignancies from FPT. On the other hand, Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan uses a non-nephrotoxic radiotracer that is picked up by functioning renal nephrons, thus offers a plausible methodology to diagnose FPTs which have a relatively normal to increased radiopharmaceutical uptake, while neoplasms will display an area of decreased or absent uptake. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides 3D reconstructions of the imaged kidney, leading to definite localization of the suspected mass and especially useful when multiple small FPT’s are present in a complex scarred kidney architecture. SPECT images can be fused with images obtained from the patient’s corresponding CT or MRI study and hence add specificity. Compared to planar DMSA, SPECT DMSA increases the sensitivity in regard to picking up more abnormalities that might be less detectable on 2D planar images that represent multiple planes superimposed on each other and displayed as a 2D image.

### Tertiary lymphoid tissue in early-stage IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis incidentally detected with a tumor lesion of the ureteropelvic junction: a case report [^5635a701]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

IgG4-related kidney disease (IgG4-RKD) is the kidney lesion of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) and its typical manifestation is plasma cell (PC)-rich tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN). IgG4-RKD is usually suspected through kidney dysfunction with typical clinical features of IgG4-RD or characteristic radiological abnormalities of IgG4-related TIN (IgG4-TIN). Although IgG4-RKD responds well to glucocorticoids possibly through its immunosuppressive effect or its direct effect to resident fibroblasts, irreversible renal atrophic lesions often persist and progress to permanent renal damage.

Differing from other TIN, a distinctive characteristic of IgG4-TIN is its spatial distribution. Multiple low-density lesions on enhanced computed tomography (CT) are characteristic, and in histology, the border between involved and non-involved areas is sharply defined consistent with the radiological picture. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration often extends beyond the renal capsule, reflecting inflammation of extra-renal adipose tissue with IgG4-positive PCs (IgG4 + PCs) and the “rim-like lesion” seen on enhanced CT. Analyses of autopsy specimens revealed lymphoplasmacytic infiltration distributed along medium-sized vessels in addition to subcapsular regions. The factors underlying this characteristic distribution of IgG4-TIN, however, are unknown.

Ectopic germinal center (GC) formation is a major characteristic finding especially in the lacrimal and submandibular glands in IgG4-RD while the lesion is relatively rare in IgG4-TIN. Ectopic GCs are a component of tertiary lymphoid tissue (TLT) which is an accumulation of T cells, B cells, follicular dendritic cells and stromal cells accompanied by high endothelial venules and lymphatic vessels and develops in response to inflammation in organs outside the secondary lymphoid tissues. TLT forms in various chronic inflammatory conditions such as autoimmune diseases, persistent infection, cancer, IgA glomerulonephritis, chronic graft rejection, and aging kidney. In IgG4-TIN, however, report on ectopic GC in kidney parenchyma have been few.

We report here a patient with IgG4-related ureteritis whose resected kidney showed a very early stage of IgG4-TIN with TLT formation. TLT was distributed within the IgG4-TIN lesions which were located around medium-sized vessels and subcapsular regions. Hints obtained from these findings may help to elucidate the developmental mechanisms of IgG4-TIN.

### The role of computed tomography in modern paediatric uroradiology [^2d0deac7]. European Journal of Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) has developed a well-recognised role within paediatric uroradiology, especially in imaging of trauma, malignancy (in particular Wilms' tumour), atypical infection, and congenital urogenital abnormalities. CT can also be used for problem solving in nephrolithiasis and renal transplant assessment. These applications are illustrated and discussed, with an emphasis on particular information that can be gained from the CT study.

### Horseshoe kidney with teratoid type of wilms tumor: a rare case report [^327be87c]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Although the identification of horseshoe kidneys in pediatrics is common, the chance of Wilms tumor occurrence in these patients is sparse. Furthermore, horseshoe kidneys would increase the likelihood of developing urological abnormalities such as pelvic-ureteric junction obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux (10–80% and 25% respectively) and Wilms tumor two times higher than the average population. There are speculations about the etiology of Wilms tumor in patients diagnosed with horseshoe kidneys. Some suggest the Wilms tumor is a consequence of sequestered metanephric tissues blastemas in the isthmus. In contrast, others believe the embryonic lesion that leads to horseshoe kidney would make the kidney prone to other abnormalities such as Wilms tumor. It is now clear that several Wilms tumor-related genes play a crucial role in the development of the kidney, and this tumor can emerge from deviant fetal nephrogenesis. One study demonstrated that Wilms tumors are linked to the presence of nephrogenic rests. These metanephric tissues may undergo hyperplasia or neoplasia, which may lead to the development of the Wilms tumor. Research on children with WAGR syndrome showed deletions in chromosome 11p13, leading to the discovery of WT1 and PAX6. In our case, excluding the tumor, the only anomaly was the presence of a horseshoe kidney with no previous history of hospitalization. This indicates that congenital abnormalities (in this case, horseshoe kidney) would increase the chance of developing urological anomalies. Because Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma are the most common retroperitoneal tumors in pediatrics, our first differentiated diagnoses were between those two. Teratoid Wilms tumors are associated with calcified densities and are recognizable for their heterotopic organ formation. The presence of calcification foci in the CT scan and the absence of heterotopic organ formation in the biopsy were the primary sources of our uncertainty for a definite pre-operative diagnosis. Microscopic evaluations of the resected tumor resolved these concerns because of cartilage and bone formations that led to the generation of calcified densities. Also, another helping factor in distinguishing teratoid Wilms tumor is the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 11, which the patient’s family could not afford the procedure. There are several treatment protocols to manage pediatrics with Wilms Tumors, and the two significant advocates of these protocols are National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS) and International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP). Regarding histopathological findings, NWTS favors upfront nephrectomy with the addition of a thoracic CT scan for possible metastasis, while SIOP prefers pre-operative chemotherapy to reduce the size of a tumor in combination with x-rays to detect metastasis. Also the presence of the tumor in a horseshoe kidney as well as the lung lesions, both are additional factors that necessitate the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Researchers have believed teratoid Wilms tumors are resistant to chemotherapy, and upfront resection is preferred. Because most of our patient’s tumor was blastemal, they responded considerably well to chemotherapy and regressed. However, as studies had suggested, the teratoid part of the tumor did not respond to chemotherapy at all.

### Horseshoe kidney with teratoid type of wilms tumor: a rare case report [^8c8f81f6]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The occurrence of renal anomalies associated with a malignancy might be more frequent in the clinical environment. There are numerous differential diagnoses for renal tumors and masses, but the possibility of exceptional anomalies should not be denied, and clinicians should be prepared for these occasions. The report of rare cases like this may encourage practitioners to detect renal tumors at an early stage in children diagnosed antenatally with horseshoe kidney. Although studies propose that chemotherapy has a trivial effect on teratoid Wilms tumors, it is essential to evaluate the tumor for any possibility of regression in non-teratoid regions before proceeding to upfront tumoral resection.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: kidney cancer, version 2.2024 [^5bcbfeaa]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 Kidney Cancer—follow-up during active surveillance for stage I: For follow-up during active surveillance, the Panel recommends an annual history and physical (H&P) examination and annual laboratory tests as clinically indicated. In order to study the growth rate of the tumor, the Panel recommends abdominal imaging (CT or MRI with and without IV contrast) within 6 months from initiation of active surveillance; subsequent imaging (with CT, MRI, or ultrasound [US]) may be performed annually thereafter. All three modalities (US, CT, and MRI) have been found to accurately predict pathologic tumor size in a retrospective analysis; therefore, best clinical judgment should be used in choosing the imaging modality. The Panel recommends chest x-ray or chest CT at baseline and annually as clinically indicated to assess pulmonary metastases, and repeat chest imaging can be considered if intervention is being contemplated. The Panel notes that follow-up may be individualized based on surgical status, treatment schedules, side effects, comorbidities, and symptoms.
