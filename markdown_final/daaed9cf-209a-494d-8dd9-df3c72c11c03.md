Treatment dosing for htn

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hypertension treatment dosing strategy, including when to start therapy, what to start, how to dose and titrate, how to escalate, and how to monitor and adjust over time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and risk stratification. Then, I should verify treatment thresholds and initial strategy by guideline. Next, I will examine first-line drug choices and dosing principles, including single-pill combinations and low-dose combinations. After that, I need to check titration and escalation timelines, including when to add versus uptitrate. Then, I should review special populations and comorbidity-driven choices. I will also consider resistant hypertension pathways and the role of adherence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical dosing algorithm and monitoring plan, while double-checking areas of controversy like bedtime dosing and very low BP targets.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation and risk framing, because I need to ensure we are treating true hypertension and not white-coat or measurement artifact. Accurate office measurement with validated devices and, when indicated, out-of-office BP with home or ambulatory monitoring are essential to confirm the diagnosis and phenotype, and to guide intensity of therapy and targets, especially in older adults and those with comorbidities [^112WfqhF] [^113wtwkq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about thresholds; I should verify initiation criteria across major guidelines. For most adults, pharmacotherapy is indicated when office BP is at least 140/90 mmHg, with earlier initiation at 130/80 mmHg for those with clinical CVD or high ASCVD risk, while the European approach emphasizes starting with drug therapy for grade 2 hypertension and considering treatment in grade 1 if lifestyle fails or risk is high, with frail older adults requiring gentler, individualized targets [^111cisfQ] [^115syZP7] [^114VgvVL].

> I will now examine initial therapy selection, and I need to ensure I align with contemporary evidence favoring combination therapy for most. For adults with BP 140/90 mmHg or higher, starting with two complementary first-line agents in a single-pill combination is preferred, typically an ACE inhibitor or ARB combined with a dihydropyridine CCB or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, as this achieves faster control, improves adherence, and is better tolerated than maximizing monotherapy; in stage 1 hypertension, monotherapy may be reasonable with subsequent addition as needed, particularly if BP elevation is modest or the patient is frail [^116nKqcH] [^111rJjTU] [^114xvW8W].

> Wait, let me verify dosing principles before recommending specific combinations. The modern approach favors low-dose combinations that exploit additive BP effects while minimizing dose-dependent adverse effects; low-dose triple and quadruple polypills achieve larger BP reductions than monotherapy and often match or exceed usual-care intensification, with acceptable tolerability, though data are early and heterogeneous; when available, use chlorthalidone rather than hydrochlorothiazide when a thiazide-type diuretic is chosen due to greater potency and duration [^112ghtZJ] [^112Vk2cT] [^111hGaq5] [^1124e2kh].

> Let me think about concrete dosing examples to ground this. A common and evidence-based starting dual SPC would be an ARB such as valsartan 80–160 mg with a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB like amlodipine 5 mg, both once daily, with room to titrate. Alternatively, an ACE inhibitor or ARB paired with a thiazide-like diuretic such as chlorthalidone 12.5–25 mg can be used, while metoprolol succinate 25–100 mg daily is reserved for compelling indications or as an add-on when needed [^113b9pwA] [^114yMY2E] [^114tU4gP].

> I should double-check the timing of intensification because treatment inertia is common and harmful. Most guidelines advise reassessment within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose change, escalating either by uptitrating the dose of an existing agent or by adding a complementary class, with the goal of achieving at least a 20/10 mmHg reduction when baseline is 160/100 mmHg or higher; dual therapy reduces time to control versus sequential monotherapy, and early control is associated with better outcomes [^113yhsam] [^115ez243] [^111NJokU].

> Next, I should review when to move to triple therapy and beyond, and I need to ensure we do not conflate apparent resistance with true resistance. If BP remains above goal on maximally tolerated dual therapy, a triple combination with ACEi/ARB, CCB, and a diuretic is recommended, and if still uncontrolled on optimized triple therapy, consider mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism, evaluation for secondary causes, and confirm true adherence before labeling resistant hypertension [^113HhyUr] [^117BqjS3] [^111RPBUT].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD, diabetes, heart failure, or is Black? I should confirm class-specific considerations. In CKD with albuminuria, an ACE inhibitor or ARB is preferred; in Black patients, guidelines often favor including a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB in the initial regimen; in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, a beta-blocker and ACEi/ARB/MRA are indicated, with ARB used cautiously if ACEi is not tolerated; in pregnancy, avoid ACEi/ARB and consider labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa [^1124e2kh] [^114yMY2E] [^111PxTLV].

> I need to check special dosing scenarios, including severe hypertension and acute care. For hypertensive emergencies, IV agents with rapid titration and short half-lives are preferred, such as clevidipine starting at 1–2 mg/hour and titrated every 1–2 minutes initially, or enalaprilat 1.25 mg IV every 6 hours, with careful transition to oral therapy and avoidance of overly rapid BP drops. In pregnancy-related severe hypertension, immediate-release oral nifedipine is a preferred option [^114SJUHe] [^1177Tgdi] [^111PxTLV].

> Let me reconsider the controversy around bedtime dosing, because I should not overstate it. Although some analyses suggest potential benefits in nocturnal hypertension or nondippers, high-quality randomized evidence has not shown improved hard outcomes with bedtime versus morning dosing, and major society positions caution against routine bedtime dosing; therefore, I should individualize timing only in select phenotypes and otherwise prioritize 24-hour control with long-acting agents given consistently [^111C46y9] [^116NwUQf] [^116x8jti].

> I should confirm BP targets and monitoring cadence, since these guide dosing intensity. Most contemporary guidelines target less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, with 130–139/70–79 mmHg acceptable in older adults and careful attention to dizziness, renal function, and electrolytes; follow-up every 2–4 weeks during active titration is prudent, then every 3–6 months once stable, with earlier checks if symptomatic or if intercurrent illness or new drugs are introduced [^115syZP7].

> Next, I should review adherence and shared decision-making, because nonadherence is a leading cause of apparent treatment resistance. Using single-pill combinations when feasible, simplifying regimens, addressing cost and side effects, and employing adherence tools such as the Morisky scale can materially improve control; where available, structured treatment protocols and pharmacist-led programs can operationalize dosing choices and follow-up [^113SEyug] [^112YM6UM] [^111xhpHY].

> Let me synthesize a practical dosing algorithm, and I will verify it aligns with the evidence. Start with risk-appropriate therapy: for most with BP 140/90 mmHg or higher, initiate a dual SPC of an ACEi/ARB plus CCB or thiazide at low-to-standard doses; for stage 1 hypertension, consider monotherapy with planned addition; reassess in 2–4 weeks and either uptitrate components or add a third class if above goal; for resistant cases after optimized triple therapy, add spironolactone and evaluate for secondary causes; throughout, favor chlorthalidone when a thiazide is used, avoid ACEi/ARB dual blockade, and tailor to comorbidities and tolerability [^116nKqcH] [^113HhyUr] [^111rJjTU].

> Finally, I should double-check the key principles that anchor safe and effective dosing. Use long-acting agents for once-daily dosing and 24-hour control, begin low and titrate to effect, combine different mechanistic classes for additive benefit, escalate promptly to avoid inertia, and continuously verify adherence and out-of-office BP to distinguish true resistance from pseudo-resistance, adjusting the plan accordingly [^111xhpHY] [^113yhsam] [^117BqjS3].

Initial therapy for hypertension should start with **low-dose monotherapy** or **low-dose combination therapy** [^116wAucT] using a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB, selected based on comorbidities and patient characteristics [^1124e2kh]. Dose should be **titrated every 2–4 weeks** to effect or tolerance, with a typical maximum of 2–4 times the starting dose [^notfound]. If the target BP is not achieved, add a second agent from a different class; avoid combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs. For resistant hypertension, add a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone 12.5–25 mg daily) [^111RPBUT] or a beta-blocker. Monitor for adverse effects, drug interactions, and adherence at each visit; adjust therapy accordingly [^113SEyug].

---

## Initial pharmacologic therapy

- **First-line agents**: thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), ACE inhibitors (ACEis), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) [^1124e2kh].

- **Selection**: base on comorbidities, age, race, and patient preference [^1124e2kh] [^115syZP7].

- **Initial dosing**: start low and titrate to effect or tolerance [^112Den2y].

---

## Dose titration and adjustment

Titrate the dose **every 2–4 weeks** to achieve target BP or until adverse effects occur [^notfound]. Typical maximum is **2–4 times the starting dose**, individualized to patient response and tolerance [^notfound].

---

## Combination therapy

Add a second agent from a different class if the **target BP is not achieved with monotherapy** [^113PQ4sc]. Preferred combinations include ACEi/ARB + CCB or thiazide diuretic [^111rJjTU]; avoid ACEi + ARB [^1124e2kh].

---

## Resistant hypertension

Defined as uncontrolled BP despite optimal doses of **three agents**, including a diuretic [^117DujWZ]. Add a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (**spironolactone 12.5–25 mg daily**) or a beta-blocker [^111RPBUT].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess **every 2–4 weeks** initially, then every 3–6 months once stable [^114wb2mJ]. At each visit, monitor for adverse effects, drug interactions, and adherence, and adjust therapy as needed [^113SEyug].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly**: start low, titrate slowly, and monitor closely for orthostatic hypotension [^notfound].

- **Chronic kidney disease**: prefer ACEi/ARB; monitor renal function and potassium [^114yMY2E].

- **Pregnancy**: methyldopa, labetalol, or nifedipine are preferred [^notfound].

---

## Dosing strategy

| **Step** | **Action** | **Details** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Initial therapy | - Low-dose monotherapy or combination <br/> - Select based on comorbidities |
| 2 | Dose titration | - Every 2–4 weeks <br/> - Max 2–4× starting dose |
| 3 | Combination therapy | Add second agent if BP uncontrolled |
| 4 | Resistant HTN | Add spironolactone or beta-blocker |
| 5 | Monitoring | - Every 2–4 weeks initially <br/> - Then every 3–6 months |

---

Effective HTN management requires **individualized dosing**, **regular monitoring**, and **adherence to guidelines** to achieve BP targets and reduce cardiovascular risk [^115V4yM2].

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

FOR INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION ONLY

The dose in hypertension is 1.25 mg every six hours administered intravenously over a five minute period. A clinical response is usually seen within 15 minutes. Peak effects after the first dose may not occur for up to four hours after dosing. The peak effects of the second and subsequent doses may exceed those of the first.

No dosage regimen for enalaprilat injection has been clearly demonstrated to be more effective in treating hypertension than 1.25 mg every six hours. However, in controlled clinical studies in hypertension, doses as high as 5 mg every six hours were well tolerated for up to 36 hours. There has been inadequate experience with doses greater than 20 mg per day.

In studies of patients with hypertension, enalaprilat has not been administered for periods longer than 48 hours. In other studies, patients have received enalaprilat for as long as seven days.

The dose for patients being converted to enalaprilat injection from oral therapy for hypertension with enalapril maleate is 1.25 mg every six hours. For conversion from intravenous to oral therapy, the recommended initial dose of oral enalapril maleate, is 5 mg once a day with subsequent dosage adjustments as necessary.

Patients On Diuretic Therapy

For patients on diuretic therapy the recommended starting dose for hypertension is 0.625 mg administered intravenously over a five minute period; also see below, Patients at Risk of Excessive Hypotension. A clinical response is usually seen within 15 minutes. Peak effects after the first dose may not occur for up to four hours after dosing, although most of the effect is usually apparent within the first hour. If after one hour there is an inadequate clinical response, the 0.625 mg dose may be repeated. Additional doses of 1.25 mg may be administered at six hour intervals.

For conversion from intravenous to oral therapy, the recommended initial dose of oral enalapril maleate for patients who have responded to 0.625 mg of enalaprilat every six hours is 2.5 mg once a day with subsequent dosage adjustment as necessary.

### Evening versus morning dosing regimen drug therapy for hypertension [^111C46y9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Variation in blood pressure levels display circadian rhythms. Complete 24-hour blood pressure control is the primary goal of antihypertensive treatment and reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes is the ultimate aim. This is an update of the review first published in 2011.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of administration-time-related effects of once-daily evening versus conventional morning dosing antihypertensive drug therapy regimens on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, total adverse events, withdrawals from treatment due to adverse effects, and reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register via Cochrane Register of Studies (17 June 2022), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 6, 2022); MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print (1 June 2022); Embase (1 June 2022); ClinicalTrials.gov (2 June 2022); Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBLD) (1978 to 2009); Chinese VIP (2009 to 7 August 2022); Chinese WANFANG DATA (2009 to 4 August 2022); China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database (CAJD) (2009 to 6 August 2022); Epistemonikos (3 September 2022) and the reference lists of relevant articles. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration-time-related effects of evening with morning dosing monotherapy regimens in people with primary hypertension. We excluded people with known secondary hypertension, shift workers or people with white coat hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two to four review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We resolved disagreements by discussion or with another review author. We performed data synthesis and analyses using Review Manager Web for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, serious adverse events, overall adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, change in 24-hour blood pressure and change in morning blood pressure. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis, fixed-effect meta-analysis, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis.

Main Results

We included 27 RCTs in this updated review, of which two RCTs were excluded from the meta-analyses for lack of data and number of groups not reported. The quantitative analysis included 25 RCTs with 3016 participants with primary hypertension. RCTs used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (six trials), calcium channel blockers (nine trials), angiotensin II receptor blockers (seven trials), diuretics (two trials), α-blockers (one trial), and β-blockers (one trial). Fifteen trials were parallel designed, and 10 trials were cross-over designed. Most participants were white, and only two RCTs were conducted in Asia (China) and one in Africa (South Africa). All trials excluded people with risk factors of myocardial infarction and strokes. Most trials had high risk or unclear risk of bias in at least two of several key criteria, which was most prominent in allocation concealment (selection bias) and selective reporting (reporting bias). Meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity across trials. No RCTs reported on cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. There may be little to no differences in all-cause mortality (after 26 weeks of active treatment: RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.42; RD 0, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; very low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (after 8 to 26 weeks of active treatment: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.57; RD 0, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; very low-certainty evidence), overall adverse events (after 6 to 26 weeks of active treatment: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.20; I² = 37%; RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.02; I² = 38%; very low-certainty evidence) and withdrawals due to adverse events (after 6 to 26 weeks active treatment: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.23; I² = 0%; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence was very uncertain.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the very limited data and the defects of the trials' designs, this systematic review did not find adequate evidence to determine which time dosing drug therapy regimen has more beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes or adverse events. We have very little confidence in the evidence showing that evening dosing of antihypertensive drugs is no more or less effective than morning administration to lower 24-hour blood pressure. The conclusions should not be assumed to apply to people receiving multiple antihypertensive drug regimens.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111EyfB8]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies — acute management and follow-up — are guided by identifying affected target organs and any precipitating cause, defining the recommended timescale and magnitude of blood pressure (BP) lowering, and selecting the type of BP-lowering treatment; in a hypertensive emergency, intravenous (i.v.) treatment with a drug with a short half-life is ideal with facilities for continuous haemodynamic monitoring. Rapid uncontrolled BP lowering is not recommended as this can lead to complications. Intravenous drug administration is recommended for most hypertension emergencies, but oral therapy with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers is sometimes very effective in malignant hypertension; low initial doses should be used and treatment should take place in hospital. For prognosis and follow-up, we recommend frequent, at least monthly, visits in a specialized setting until the optimal target BP is achieved and long-term specialist follow-up thereafter.

### A method to quantify mean hypertension treatment daily dose intensity using health care system data [^116fvBqa]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The current approach to assess the quality of hypertension treatment in health care systems remains limited to dichotomous measures of blood pressure (BP) (ie, percentage of patients with a BP controlled below target) regardless of the recommended number and doses of medications. However, there is increasing evidence that intensifying treatment is associated with clinical benefit for older adults, either by increasing doses and starting new agents, or by prescribing specific medication classes for their noncardiovascular benefits (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for kidney protection). As our health care system responds by developing new guidelines and measures to promote lower BP goals, we need more refined tools to guide safe approaches to treatment intensification for older adults.

National public health efforts track hypertension treatment by surveying whether patients are receiving pharmacologic treatment or not, while hypertension trials demonstrate effectiveness as the increment in the number of BP medications. However, neither of these approaches captures dose intensity, a component of medical treatment that is of particular interest to older adults, who are prone to dose-related adverse effects as a result of frailty, total medication burden, or comorbid conditions and who often prefer lower medication intensity.

Being able to estimate a standardized hypertension daily dose (HDD) across medications of differing potency may enable health care systems to develop approaches to intensifying treatment in addition to monitoring the BP level achieved. Moreover, a decrease in dose intensity may be an older patient's only indicator of improved adherence to nonpharmacologic hypertension treatment (eg, diet)because patients might be able to reduce their medication doses while maintaining appropriate BP control. Last, such a tool would also more precisely identify which older patients might be appropriate candidates for deintensification of treatment.

An algorithm was previously developed and validated to assess treatment intensity measured as the number of medications based only on reliable administrative pharmacy fill data within a complex electronic medical record and health care data system. The goal of the present study was to (1) extend the method to capture daily dose, defined as moderate HDD, for each BP-lowering medication; (2) validate that the total HDDs calculated from pharmacy data across multiple medications reflect the intensity of patients' overall antihypertension medication regimens; and (3) describe the association between the new HDD measure and the traditional medication count.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111cisfQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension treatment thresholds and use of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk — In all adults with hypertension, initiation of medications to lower blood pressure (BP) is recommended when average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg, and initiation of medications to lower BP is recommended when average DBP is ≥ 90 mm Hg. In adults with hypertension and clinical CVD, initiation of medications to lower BP is recommended when average SBP is ≥ 130 mm Hg, and when average DBP is ≥ 80 mm Hg, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and total mortality.

However, RCTs cannot answer every question and, in these situations, the new AHA/ACC committee may need to rely more on other high‐quality, prospective observational data and meta‐analyses to help determine better BP targets or to integrate a treatment approach that incorporates CVD risk factor estimation.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^1168APub]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^116Zo9hx]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — targets in older adults states that treatment decisions are influenced in older (≥ 65 years) and very old (> 80 years) patients, and the desired SBP target range for all patients aged > 65 years is 130–139 mmHg, with benefit likely as BP is lowered towards that range if treatment is well tolerated.

### JNC 8 guidelines for the management of hypertension in… [^113PQ4sc]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age.
- Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population.
- If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added.

In the general population of adults 60 years and older, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. Patients should be treated to a target systolic pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Treatment does not need to be adjusted if it results in a systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg, as long as it is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life. There is no evidence that treating patients with CKD to a lower blood pressure goal slows the progression of the disease. Similarly, there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials showing that treatment to a systolic pressure of less than 140 mm Hg improves health outcomes in adults with diabetes and hypertension.

Pharmacologic Treatment In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial anti-hypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker. If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a second medication should be added. Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regimen adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached.

### Controversies in hypertension therapy: bedtime dosing or daytime dosing? [^116x8jti]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

We defined 'no relevant studies' as those that did not provide direct or indirect insights into the timing of antihypertensive medication in relation to circadian BP rhythms, target organ damage, or comorbidities. Therefore, we included studies that examined BP rhythm characteristics, investigated the relationship between BP rhythms and target organ damage, or evaluated the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in the general hypertensive population.

To maintain focus on our study objectives while ensuring scientific rigor, we excluded studies that did not analyze BP rhythm patterns, target organ damage, or antihypertensive medication timing in any capacity. Non-English studies, studies published before 1995, as well as case reports, letters, editorials, and studies with insufficient methodological details were not considered.

A total of 63 studies met our inclusion criteria, comprising 14 RCTs, 43 observational studies, and 6 meta-analyses or systematic reviews. These studies were conducted across multiple regions, including North America, Europe, and Asia, providing a diverse geographic representation. The sample sizes varied significantly, ranging from small-scale crossover studies with fewer than 50 participants to large-scale cohort studies with tens of thousands of participants. The heterogeneity in study design and population characteristics underscores the complexity of determining the optimal timing of antihypertensive medication in different patient subgroups. Details of these studies and their findings are discussed in subsequent sections.

Bedtime antihypertensive dosage: potential advantages

Intrinsic factors within the body, such as genetic and neuroendocrine factors, not only influence 24-h fluctuations in BP but also impact the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medications. The pharmacokinetics and efficacy of antihypertensive drugs could theoretically differ depending on the time of day they are administered. A 2022 consensus on managing morning hypertension highlighted its strong association with cardiovascular risk, with better predictive power for stroke compared to nocturnal BP. This consensus recommends considering bedtime dosing based on individual circumstances. Furthermore, several studies have shown that nocturnal hypertension is linked to asymptomatic organ damage in hypertensive patients and independently predicts cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the hypertensive population. Consequently, administering antihypertensive medication before bedtime to control nighttime hypertension, restore the circadian BP pattern, and prevent morning spikes appears to offer a theoretical survival advantage.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension guidelines — initial therapy selection: Monotherapy is usually inadequate therapy for most people with hypertension, and initial therapy for the majority of patients with hypertension should be with a combination of two drugs, not a single drug, with the only exception in a limited number of patients with a lower baseline BP close to their recommended target or in some frailer old or very old patients in whom more gentle reduction of BP may be desirable.

### Efficacy and safety of dual combination therapy of blood pressure-lowering drugs as initial treatment for hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114cPNrM]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of dual combination of blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs as initial treatment for hypertension.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL were searched until August 2017 for randomized, double-blind trials of dual combination therapy vs. monotherapy in adults with hypertension who were either treatment naïve or untreated for at least 4 weeks. Regimens were classified with reference to usual daily 'standard-dose'; for example, < 1+ < 1 for a combination of two drugs both at less than one standard-dose. Random-effects models were used for meta-analysis.

Results

Thirty-three trials (13095 participants) with mean baseline mean BP 155/100mmHg were included. Compared with standard-dose monotherapy, dual combinations of < 1+ < 1, 1+ < 1 and 1+1 (i.e. low-to-standard dose), showed a dose-response relationship in reducing SBP [mean differences (95% confidence interval) of 2.8 (1.6–4.0), 4.6 (3.4–5.7) and 7.5 (5.4–9.5)mmHg, respectively], and in improving BP control [risk ratio (RR) (95% confidence interval) 1.11 (0.92–1.34), 1.25 (1.16–1.35) and 1.42 (1.27–1.58), respectively]. Withdrawals due to adverse events were uncommon with low-to-standard dose dual combinations, with no significant difference compared with standard-dose monotherapy [2.9 vs. 2.2%; RR 1.28 (0.85 to 1.92)]. There were fewer data for higher dose dual combinations, which did not appear to produce substantial additional efficacy and could potentially be less tolerable.

Conclusion

Compared with standard-dose monotherapy, initiating treatment with low-to-standard dose dual combination therapy is more efficacious without increasing withdrawals due to adverse events.

The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for hypertension management has recently been updated. This review article summaries the main recommendations in NICE guidelines, and compares them with the American and European guidelines. NICE and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend diagnosing hypertension at a higher level than the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA). NICE treats to less stringent targets than both the ACC/AHA and the ESC, while using similar, although non-combination pill based, treatment regimens.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^115tJF58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^115eWtok]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mm Hg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115xdVCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^113yhsam]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension — initial combination therapy considerations: Combination therapy for treating HTN is common, and the ACCOMPLISH study confirmed that combination therapy is safe and effective. In ALLHAT, only 26% of participants reached goal blood pressure (< 140/90 mm Hg) with monotherapy, and larger reductions of blood pressure (e.g., 20/10 mm Hg or more) often require at least two medications; initiating therapy with two drugs is effective and well tolerated, apart from a slight increase in dizziness incidence for some combination dosing. The systematic evidence review conducted for this CPG update did not identify any studies that met inclusion criteria comparing one-drug initiation with sequential titration versus two-drug initiation, but providers and patients may wish to consider combination therapy when selecting initial therapy. Initial combination therapy may reduce the number of titrations and visits to achieve blood pressure goal, patients with a compelling indication for more than one class of antihypertensive agent may benefit from initial combination therapy, and combination pills, when available, may reduce medication co-payments. Whether using sequential or initial combination therapy, providers should attempt to achieve dosing ranges that have been found to impact important clinical outcomes, recognizing that fixed-dose combination therapy may not always be available or prescribed.

### Low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 blood pressure-lowering medications for the treatment of hypertension [^1122bqNn]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Limitations

First, we pooled together trials with different combinations of antihypertensives, which may have partly contributed to the heterogeneity between trials. However, the total standard dose of each LDC did not explain underlying heterogeneity in BP reduction. Some analyses may be underpowered to detect a difference in adverse events and there were differences in follow-up duration between studies. Further studies of LDCs in different patient populations would be important to determine if differences in tolerability exist. This study was not powered to investigate for clinical event reduction, although the relationship between BP reduction and reduction in major cardiovascular events and death is well established. Finally, this analysis was pooled using study-level data, and more precise estimates of the relationship between pretreatment BP and expected treatment efficacy may be obtained with individual patient meta-analyses.

In conclusion, LDCs in the form of 3 or 4 antihypertensives at less than standard dose are an effective and well-tolerated option for the initial management of hypertension. LDCs offer a "single step" solution that reliably achieves BP target in two-thirds of patients at first follow-up visit and remain superior to usual care that involve clinician-guided uptitration of therapy. Finally, BP reduction with LDCs was associated with trial level pretreatment BP, with greater BP reductions observed in higher grades of hypertension compared to lower or mildly elevated BP.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL SKILLS: In patients with hypertension, low-dose combinations consisting of 3 or 4 antihypertensives each at low dose are well tolerated and associated with significantly greater reductions in BP compared to an initial monotherapy and usual care. The BP reduction of low-dose combinations are highly dependent on their pretreatment BP, with smaller reductions in BP observed in individuals with only mildly elevated BP.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies should evaluate the efficacy and safety of other combinations of antihypertensives and the use of low-dose combinations as an initial treatment option in different patient populations.

### Strategies for combination therapy in hypertension [^111QLRRq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To achieve the target blood pressure (BP) mandated by current guidelines, a large majority of patients require simultaneous administration of multiple antihypertensive agents. The purpose of this review is to focus attention on the rational selection of effective drug combinations, and upon ways to use them efficiently to achieve therapeutic objectives. The topic is widely relevant given that more than 46 million ambulatory care visits are conducted in the United States annually for hypertension management.

Recent Findings

Recommended drug combinations exhibit complimentary pharmacology and additive BP reduction, are well tolerated, and include components with demonstrated endpoint reduction in long-term clinical trials. Recently, the choice of diuretics has emerged as a controversial issue with some evidence favoring the long-acting agent, chlorthalidone, in preference to hydrochlorothiazide. For resistant hypertension, mineralocorticoid antagonists are increasingly used as preferred add-on agents. Practical strategies for the optimal use of combination therapy continue to evolve from the older stepped-care approach to the use of low-dose combinations, and to initiation of combination therapy in a broader range of hypertensive patients.

Summary

Thoughtful use of drug combinations is critical for achieving therapeutic objectives in hypertensive individuals and populations - more rapid BP control and more effective endpoint reduction. Practical strategies for the optimal use of combination therapy continue to evolve from the older stepped-care approach to more recent recommendations favoring the use of low-dose combinations, and initiation therapy of combination treatment, particularly in patients with Stage 2 hypertension.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114yMY2E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 6 to 9

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add‐on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If goal BP is not reached within 1 month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug, and if goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained.

Basis of Recommendations

In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories (Table 1). For the nonblack population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first‐line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP‐lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of > 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of 6 different thiazide diuretics. 46 Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose‐dependent BP reduction. Compared with placebo, the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on BP ranged from 6.25 mg/d, leading to a 4–mm Hg (95% CI 2 to 6)/2–mm Hg (95% CI 1 to 4) reduction, to 50 mg/d, resulting in a 11–mm Hg (95% CI 6 to 15)/5–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 7) reduction. Chlorthalidone, regardless of dose ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg/d, led to a 12–mm Hg (95% CI 10 to 14)/4–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 5) reduction in BP. While the maximal effects were judged to be similar between the different thiazides, attention to dosing is important given the wide range of effect with hydrochlorothiazide.

### Metoprolol succinate (Toprol xl) [^115wrbBH]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

2.1	Hypertension

Adults: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied.

Pediatric Hypertensive Patients ≥ 6 Years of age: The recommended starting dose of TOPROL-XL is 1 mg/kg once daily, but the maximum initial dose should not exceed 50 mg once daily. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure response.

Doses above 2 mg/kg (or in excess of 200 mg) once daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

TOPROL-XL has not been studied in pediatric patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

2.2	Angina Pectoris

Individualize the dosage of TOPROL-XL. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in a single dose. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1–2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

2.3	Heart Failure

Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of TOPROL-XL, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of TOPROL-XL is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of TOPROL-XL. Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce TOPROL-XL. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of TOPROL-XL. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of TOPROL-XL, or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of TOPROL-XL should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.

2.4	Administration

TOPROL-XL tablets are scored and can be divided; however, do not crush or chew the whole or half tablet.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate combination BP-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed HTN (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. Prefer combining a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine CCB or diuretic. Avoid initiating combination treatment in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Resistant hypertension: a review of diagnosis and management [^111RPBUT]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Resistant hypertension-uncontrolled hypertension with 3 or more antihypertensive agents-is increasingly common in clinical practice. Clinicians should exclude pseudoresistant hypertension, which results from nonadherence to medications or from elevated blood pressure related to the white coat syndrome. In patients with truly resistant hypertension, thiazide diuretics, particularly chlorthalidone, should be considered as one of the initial agents. The other 2 agents should include calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for cardiovascular protection. An increasing body of evidence has suggested benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as eplerenone and spironolactone, in improving blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension, regardless of circulating aldosterone levels. Thus, this class of drugs should be considered for patients whose blood pressure remains elevated after treatment with a 3-drug regimen to maximal or near maximal doses. Resistant hypertension may be associated with secondary causes of hypertension including obstructive sleep apnea or primary aldosteronism. Treating these disorders can significantly improve blood pressure beyond medical therapy alone. The role of device therapy for treating the typical patient with resistant hypertension remains unclear.

Pharmacotherapy for hypertension — combination antihypertensive therapy may allow for use of lower doses of individual agents and, therefore, minimize adverse drug effects, but clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether specific combinations and doses are more effective than a maximum-level dose of a single agent for blood pressure control and medication adherence; trials should also focus on comparative effectiveness of equivalent doses of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide and newer antihypertensive agents, such as vasodilatory beta-blockers in essential HTN, and in RHT, future studies with long-term follow-up that would allow evaluation of clinical outcomes are needed to establish optimal fourth-line antihypertensive agents in RHT and whether variations in patient characteristics may necessitate differential approaches to a fourth-line agents for RHT.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111NJokU]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — rationale for initial two‑drug therapy for most patients: With the emphasis on achieving a BP target in most patients of < 130/80 mmHg, the majority of patients will require combination therapy, and initial combination therapy is invariably more effective at BP lowering than monotherapy, with even low‑dose combination therapy usually more effective than maximal dose monotherapy. Two‑drug combinations as initial therapy have been shown to be safe and well tolerated, with no or only a small increase in the risk of hypotensive episodes. Although no RCT has compared major cardiovascular (CV) outcomes between initial combination therapy and monotherapy, observational evidence indicates that shorter time to achieve BP control is associated with lower risk, and compared with initial monotherapy, starting with a two‑drug combination exhibits more frequent BP control after 1 year. Previous Guidelines acknowledged initial combination therapy for patients with grade 2 or 3 hypertension or patients at high or very high risk, and initial monotherapy was only recommended for grade 1 hypertension and low‑ or moderate‑risk patients. Some low‑ or moderate‑risk patients with grade 1 hypertension may achieve their BP target with monotherapy, but this is unlikely in those with initial SBP > 150 mmHg who would require a BP reduction of > 20 mmHg; however, in patients with high–normal BP and a high CV risk or in frail older patients, treatment initiation with monotherapy may be appropriate because only a small BP reduction may be required to achieve the BP target.

### A method to quantify mean hypertension treatment daily dose intensity using health care system data [^112kyzyE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

We have developed and validated an algorithm to identify the degree of hypertension treatment intensity that is a more precise measure of intensity than number of BP medications or BP alone. Our results may pave the way for further studies of dose intensity and health outcomes, including programs to increase or decrease hypertension treatment intensity or to compare treatment intensity between clinicians, clinics, and health care systems.

### Treatment of children with pulmonary hypertension. expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric pulmonary hypertension. the European paediatric pulmonary vascular disease network, endorsed by ISHLT and DGPK [^113gSHP9]. Heart (2016). Medium credibility.

Epoprostenol — intravenous prostacyclin analogue for pulmonary hypertension: approved by the EMA and the FDA for adult PH Group 1. Dosing is by intravenous infusion with a starting dose of 1–2 ng/kg/min intravenous without a known maximum; in paediatric patients a stable dose is usually between 50 and 80 ng/kg/min intravenous at 1 year after start of treatment, and doses > 150 ng/kg/min intravenous have been used. Adverse effects include flushing, jaw, foot and bone pain, headaches and diarrhoea; systemic hypotension is possible; the half-life is short (2–5 min); pulmonary hypertension crises occur rapidly if the infusion is stopped; ice pack cooling and remixing every 24 h are needed; and central line complications occur. COR I, LOE B, with standard therapy for severe PH (WHC FC class IV) and a 'temperature stable' formulation now available.

### Bedtime dosing of antihypertensive medications: systematic review and consensus statement: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^116NwUQf]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive drug therapy is one of the most efficient medical interventions for preventing disability and death globally. Most of the evidence supporting its benefits has been derived from outcome trials with morning dosing of medications. Accumulating evidence suggests an adverse prognosis associated with night-time hypertension, nondipping blood pressure (BP) profile and morning BP surge, with increased incidence of cardiovascular events during the first few morning hours. These observations provide justification for complete 24-h BP control as being the primary goal of antihypertensive treatment. Bedtime administration of antihypertensive drugs has also been proposed as a potentially more effective treatment strategy than morning administration. This Position Paper by the International Society of Hypertension reviewed the published evidence on the clinical relevance of the diurnal variation in BP and the timing of antihypertensive drug treatment, aiming to provide consensus recommendations for clinical practice. Eight published outcome hypertension studies involved bedtime dosing of antihypertensive drugs, and all had major methodological and/or other flaws and a high risk of bias in testing the impact of bedtime compared to morning treatment. Three ongoing, well designed, prospective, randomized controlled outcome trials are expected to provide high-quality data on the efficacy and safety of evening or bedtime versus morning drug dosing. Until that information is available, preferred use of bedtime drug dosing of antihypertensive drugs should not be routinely recommended in clinical practice. Complete 24-h control of BP should be targeted using readily available, long-acting antihypertensive medications as monotherapy or combinations administered in a single morning dose.

### Optimal systolic blood pressure target, time to intensification, and time to follow-up in treatment of hypertension: population based retrospective cohort study [^115ez243]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the single most common risk factor for both cardiovascular and overall disease burden and mortality worldwide, and the medical treatment of hypertension mitigates this risk. Management of hypertension is also among the most common reasons for ambulatory visits to physicians' clinics among non-pregnant adults worldwide. However, many key aspects of optimal medical management for hypertension remain unclear.

The evidence that medically treating patients with stage 1 (140–159 mm Hg) systolic hypertension improves outcomes is limited, and current guidelines differ substantially in their recommendations for management. In addition, for all patients little evidence is available to guide the optimal time interval between measurement of elevated blood pressure and addition or dose escalation of antihypertensive medications ("medication intensification") or between medication intensification and follow-up measurement of blood pressure. Routine clinical practice differs from clinical trials in that substantial delays may exist between the observation of an elevated blood pressure and medication intensification, or between medication intensification and follow-up measurement of blood pressure, but the effect of such delays on patients' outcomes is not understood.

We therefore did a retrospective cohort study to investigate the systolic intensification threshold, time to intensification, and time to follow-up that are associated with the lowest risk of cardiovascular events or death.

ESC/ESH 2018 — definition of resistant hypertension: It is recommended that hypertension be defined as resistant to treatment when optimal doses (or best-tolerated doses) of an appropriate therapeutic strategy that should include a diuretic (typically an ACE inhibitor or an ARB with a CCB and a thiazide/thiazide-type diuretic) fail to lower clinic SBP and DBP values to < 140 mmHg and/or < 90 mmHg, respectively; the inadequate control of blood pressure has been confirmed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM); and causes of pseudo-resistant hypertension (especially poor medication adherence) and secondary hypertension are excluded.

### Abstract… [^115qwZwT]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Choice of Agents Figure 1 is an algorithm that can guide combination therapy in patients with hypertension. 1, 6 JNC8, ESC, and ACC/AHA guidelines agree that for most patients, combination therapy should include a thiazide diuretic, a CCB, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. They further agree that a patient should not take an ACEI and ARB simultaneously. 4–6 Therapy should be escalated at one-month intervals using any of the three accepted strategies.
6. The ACC/AHA recommends chlortha lidone as the preferred thiazide diuretic and recommends that central-acting alpha agonists be avoided. 4 JNC8 recommends that for black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or CCB. 6 Other drug classes may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate blood pressure control on maximal triple therapy, or for those with comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease with proteinuria.

4–6 Table 4 lists fixed-dose combination medications that are currently available. 1, 5. 31 The JNC8 found insufficient evidence to recommend preferential use of ACEIs or ARBs in patients with heart failure and hypertension 6; however, the JNC8 recommendations were published before the PARADIGM-HF results. The beta blockers carvedilol, extended-release metoprolol, and bisoprolol have shown improvements in morbidity and mortality. One of these agents should be initiated in patients with HFrEF unless they have contraindications. 32–34 Beta blockers are usually added once the patient no longer has symptoms of volume overload. ACEIs and ARBs reduce proteinuria and decrease progression to end-stage renal disease in patients with proteinuria.

DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^114HUXbU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

High-value care in hypertension for adults aged 60 years or older — most patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150 mm Hg or greater who receive antihypertensive medications will benefit, with acceptable harms and costs, from treatment to a blood pressure (BP) target of less than 150/90 mm Hg. When prescribing drug therapy, clinicians should select generic formulations over brand-name drugs, which have similar efficacy, reduced cost, and therefore better adherence, and clinicians should consider the patient's treatment burden. Because some patients may have falsely elevated readings in clinical settings ("white-coat hypertension"), it is important to ensure accurate BP measurement before initiating or changing treatment of hypertension, and the most accurate measurements come from multiple BP measurements made over time.

### Low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 blood pressure-lowering medications for the treatment of hypertension [^111hGaq5]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of single pill LDCs as an initial or early treatment strategy for high BP. LDCs were superior to placebo, monotherapy, and usual care in reducing BP and improving BP control (Central Illustration). Comparisons with placebo revealed that the degree of BP reduction increased substantially with the extent of BP elevation at baseline, that is, the same initial LDC among people with high baseline SBP will confer a much larger BP reduction than among those with only mildly elevated BP — a form of "autotitration". LDCs were also well tolerated, with only a small excess of dizziness compared to monotherapy and placebo but no increase in treatment withdrawals due to adverse events.

Central Illustration
Comparisons of Low-Dose Combinations Vs Placebo, Monotherapy, and Usual Care

Abbreviation as in Figure 1.

Current guidelines recommend monotherapy or, increasingly, dual combination therapy as the initial treatment option for most people with hypertension and reserve the addition of more drug classes if patients remain uncontrolled on treatment. LDCs with 3 or 4 different drug classes have the theoretical advantage of increased BP-lowering efficacy with minimal increase in adverse events. The BP-lowering effects of different antihypertensive classes are additive and most of the BP-lowering effects occur at low dosage, while the adverse effects are proportional to the dosage of the individual drug components. The present study expands the evidence basis for the use of LDC for initial or early treatment of hypertension. These results suggest that starting with LDC compared to an initial monotherapy strategy will achieve BP targets in 1.5 times more people at first follow-up visit. LDC remained superior to usual care strategy involving clinician-guided treatment intensification, with 80% of patients achieving BP control at final follow-up compared to 65% of patients in the usual care arm. These findings highlight that standard protocols and treatment approaches with initial monotherapy do not "catch up" to upfront LDC use. Therefore, upfront use of LDCs can simplify treatment and reduce time patients remain with uncontrolled BP, which increases time in target BP and reduces cumulative BP exposure, all metrics strongly associated with less risk of cardiovascular adverse events.

Reflections

Although differences in guidelines are invariably highlighted, it is notable that the core advice in the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines is remarkably similar in most important areas of practice (Table 9). Even for the area of greatest difference, the definition of hypertension, there is still considerable overlap. In both guidelines, adults with an average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg are designated as having hypertension and treatment with a combination of lifestyle counseling and antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended. Those with an average SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg are designated as having stage 1 hypertension in the ACC/AHA and high normal BP in the ESC/ESH. However, both guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for most adults in this BP category, the addition of antihypertensive drugs only being recommended for the ≈30% of US adults with CVD or a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% in the ACC/AHA guideline and only to be considered in very-high-risk patients, especially those with coronary artery disease, in the ESC/ESH CPG. For many other treatment differences, the 2 guidelines provide overall advice that is similar but sometimes discrepant in the specifics. For example, both guidelines recommend combination antihypertensive drug therapy but the specific application for this advice is somewhat different. The ESC/ESH places great emphasis on single-pill combination drug therapy, whereas the ACC/AHA encourages single-pill combinations when possible but notes that many of the combination pills available in the United States use hydrochlorothiazide rather than chlorthalidone and often use a diuretic dose that is lower than what has been used in the landmark treatment trials. Likewise, both guidelines recommend a lower BP target during treatment compared with what was advised in previous guidelines, including in older adults. Overall, the difference lies in the ESC/ESH taking a more stepped approach, first recommending achievement of an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg before targeting a lower BP, if tolerated, and identifying SBP 120 mm Hg and DBP 70 mm Hg as the lower safety boundary for BP reduction in adults 18 to 65 years of age (130 mm Hg in those with CKD). The ACC/AHA recommends a single SBP/DBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in most adults but SBP < 130 mm Hg in older well adults, if tolerated.

### Clevidipine (Cleviprex) [^114SJUHe]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2 Recommended Dosing

Cleviprex is intended for intravenous use. Titrate drug to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient.

Initial dose: Initiate the intravenous infusion of Cleviprex at 1–2 mg/hour.

Dose titration: The dose may be doubled at short (90 second) intervals initially. As the blood pressure approaches goal, the increase in doses should be less than doubling and the time between dose adjustments should be lengthened to every 5–10 minutes. An approximately 1–2 mg/hour increase will generally produce an additional 2–4 mmHg decrease in systolic pressure.

Maintenance dose: The desired therapeutic response for most patients occurs at doses of 4–6 mg/hour. Patients with severe hypertension may require doses up to 32 mg/hour, but there is limited experience at this dose rate.

Maximum dose: Most patients were treated with maximum doses of 16 mg/hour or less. There is limited short-term experience with doses up to 32 mg/hour. Because of lipid load restrictions, no more than 1000 mL or an average of 21 mg/hour of Cleviprex infusion is recommended per 24 hour period. In clinical trials, 55 hypertensive patients were treated with > 500mL of Cleviprex infusion per 24 hour period. There is little experience with infusion durations beyond 72 hours at any dose.

Transition to an oral antihypertensive agent: Discontinue Cleviprex or titrate downward while appropriate oral therapy is established. When an oral antihypertensive agent is being instituted, consider the lag time of onset of the oral agent's effect. Continue blood pressure monitoring until desired effect is achieved.

Special populations: Special populations were not specifically studied. In clinical trials, 78 patients with abnormal hepatic function (one or more of the following: elevated serum bilirubin, AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT) and 121 patients with moderate to severe renal impairment were treated with Cleviprex. An initial Cleviprex infusion rate of 1–2 mg/hour is appropriate in these patients.

Table 1 is a guideline for dosing conversion from mg/hour to mL/hour.

### Evening dosing versus morning dosing of antihypertensive medications for nocturnal hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 107 randomized controlled trials [^112x6CBp]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Our results highlight the lack of low-risk-of-bias RCTs (n = 1) and emphasize the need for such studies to evaluate the efficacy of evening dosing of anti-HT medications as a standard treatment for patients with nocturnal HT across diverse populations. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of an evening dose of anti-HT medications in reducing nocturnal BP is neutral in studies with low risk of bias, but numerous studies with unclear to high risk of bias suggest an additional hypotensive effect when compared to morning dosing. (ranked as very low to low strength of evidence by GRADE) Further research should also examine the long-term cardiovascular effects and mortality associated with the normalization of nocturnal HT through evening doses of anti-HT medications.

### Single pill combination therapy for hypertension: new evidence and new challenges: combination therapy for hypertension [^116DkB2F]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) continues to be one of the most important risk factors for major cardiovascular events and mortality. The global prevalence of hypertension is approximately 30% among adults over 20 years old. Cardiovascular risk stratification is crucial to determine the most appropriate pharmacological therapeutic strategy for hypertensive patients. Despite the many scales to stratify risk, none is perfect and represents weighted mathematical models to determine risk at 10 years. Reports have identified numerous limitations, and the challenge persists. A practical way to determine CV risk is the clinical approach based on 1) the number of risk factors, 2) the degree of elevation of blood pressure, 3) the presence of target organ damage/DM/CKD, and 4) a history of major cardiovascular events. Currently, it is recommended to start with dual therapy in a single pill (either ACE inhibitors or ARB2 + dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic); however, many patients could need to start with triple therapy (low or standard doses) if they belong to the high- or very high-risk group with elevation grade 2 or 3 of blood pressure. This article discusses this topic and establishes some practical recommendations for the physician of first contact.

### Metoprolol succinate (Toprol) [^114tU4gP]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1 Hypertension

Adults: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied.

Pediatric Hypertensive Patients ≥ 6 Years of age: The recommended starting dose of TOPROL-XL is 1 mg/kg once daily, but the maximum initial dose should not exceed 50 mg once daily. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure response. Doses above 2 mg/kg (or in excess of 200 mg) once daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

TOPROL-XL has not been studied in pediatric patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

2.2 Angina Pectoris

Individualize the dosage of TOPROL-XL. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in a single dose. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1–2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

2.3 Heart Failure

Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of TOPROL-XL, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of TOPROL-XL is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of TOPROL-XL. Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce TOPROL-XL. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of TOPROL-XL. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of TOPROL-XL, or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of TOPROL-XL should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.

2.4 Administration

TOPROL-XL tablets are scored and can be divided; however, do not crush or chew the whole or half tablet.

### Low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 blood pressure-lowering medications for the treatment of hypertension [^111pnWQf]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Two independent reviewers (N.W. and P.R.) performed an updated systematic literature search in PubMed and Medline from the date of the last systematic review in September 2022 until September 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials of hypertension polypills vs placebo, monotherapy, or usual care. Trials were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: 1) randomized clinical trial; 2) compared LDC to placebo, monotherapy, or usual care; and 3) reported data to calculate BP differences between the treatment groups. Abstracts without accompanying full-text publications and trials of combination antihypertensives that did not meet our definition of a hypertension polypill were excluded. We defined a LDC as: 1) 3 or more antihypertensive drugs from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 2017 hypertension guideline recommendations for antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor II blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and diuretics); 2) all included antihypertensives at less than 1 standard dose; and 3) contained in a single pill. Standard doses were defined using methods from Bennett et al. Two reviewers (N.W. and P.R.) independently reviewed the articles and extracted data on study details and study outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved by review and discussion. Missing SDs of BP were imputed using a stepwise approach as per the Cochrane handbook. Authors of the original manuscripts were contacted for key missing data.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome was the between-group difference in mean change in clinic SBP. Secondary outcomes were between-group difference in mean change in clinic diastolic BP (DBP), proportion of participants achieving the SBP/DBP target < 140/90 mm Hg, and proportion of participants experiencing adverse events, including withdrawals due to adverse effects. We assessed the outcomes at first follow-up visit (between 4 and 12 weeks) between LDC and placebo/monotherapy to obtain the best estimate of the true treatment effect before any treatment escalation or de-escalation occurred. If a trial included a comparator arm with usual care and all patients were on monotherapy at first follow-up, then we included this trial in the comparison of LDC vs monotherapy. We also separately compared the efficacy of LDC vs usual care with physician-directed intensification at the final follow-up visit to confirm whether usual care eventually catches up to an initial LDC strategy in terms of hypertension control.

Uptitration of treatment to three-drug combination therapy — two-drug combination therapy will control blood pressure (BP) in approximately two-thirds of patients; for patients whose BP is not controlled by two-drug therapy, the logical option is escalation to three-drug therapy, usually a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker, a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic. Studies suggest that a three-drug combination should control BP in ≥ 80% of patients. The guideline states, We do not recommend three-drug combinations as initial therapy.

AACE ASCVD risk reduction — hypertension algorithm outlines treatment targets and sequencing. Goal: < 130 systolic/ < 80 diastolic mmHg. For initial blood pressure > 150/100 mmHg, consider starting DUAL THERAPY combined with another agent below, and titrate medication dose or add on therapy every 2–3 months to reach goal. Lifestyle intervention includes decreasing sodium intake, diet (DASH or Mediterranean), physical activity, and achieving optimal weight. Initial pharmacologic choices emphasize ARB or ACEi with add-on options such as thiazide or a calcium channel blocker, with additional antihypertensive agents including central α2 agonist, peripheral α1-blocker, and hydralazine as needed to reach goal.

### Diagnosis and treatment of arterial hypertension 2021 [^112WfqhF]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

In the last 4 years, several evidence-based, national, and international guidelines on the management of arterial hypertension have been published, mostly with concordant recommendations, but in some aspects with discordant opinions. This in-depth review takes these guidelines into account but also addresses several new data of interest. Although being somewhat obvious and simple, accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement with validated devices is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of hypertension, but out-of-office BP measurements are of crucial importance as well. Simplified antihypertensive drug treatment such as single-pill combinations enhances the adherence to medication and speeds up the process of getting into the BP target range, a goal not so far adequately respected. Recommended (single-pill) combination therapy includes diuretics as part of the first step of antihypertensive therapy, and updated analysis does not provide evidence to exclude diuretics from this first step because of the recently discussed potential risk of increasing cancer incidence. Target BP goals need to be individualized, according to comorbidities, hypertension-mediated organ damage, coexistence of cardiovascular risk factors (including age), frailty in older patients, and individual tolerability. There are also concordant recommendations in the guidelines that an office BP between 120 and 140 mm Hg systolic and between 70 and 80 mm Hg diastolic should be achieved. The BP target of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes for hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease are not applicable for clinical practice because they heavily rely on 1 study that used a study-specific, nontransferable BP measurement technique and excluded the most common cause of chronic kidney disease, namely, diabetic nephropathy. Actual data even from a prospective trial on chronotherapy have to be disregarded, and antihypertensive medication should not be routinely dosed at bedtime. Rigorously conducted trials justify the revival of renal denervation for treatment of (at least, but not only) uncontrolled and treatment-resistant hypertension.

Initial combination therapy versus monotherapy — In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dose titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control.

### Initial treatment with a single capsule containing half-dose quadruple therapy vs standard-dose dual therapy in hypertensive patients (QUADUAL): a randomized, blinded, crossover trial [^114FXsFy]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the most common cardio-cerebrovascular disease worldwide and often coexists with other cardiovascular risk factors, causing damage to important organs. Globally, hypertension is the leading risk factor for deaths, accounting for 10.8 million deaths in 2019, and it also places a significant economic burden on China. However, despite its prevalence and impact, the awareness, treatment, and control rates of hypertension remain suboptimal, with some data showing corresponding metrics to be as low as 50.0%, 38.1%, and 11.1%, respectively.

Current hypertension guidelines recognized the efficacy of dual combination therapy as an initial antihypertensive treatment. However, hypertension involves multiple mechanisms, and the goal of blood pressure control has become more stringent. Dual combination therapy may not be sufficient to meet the needs of patients. Several studies have investigated the use of low-dose three-drug or four-drug combinations in initial treatment, which showed promising results in terms of antihypertensive effects and safety profiles compared to monotherapy. However, these studies employed monotherapy or placebo or usual care as controls, which are not consistent with current guidelines for initial hypertension treatment or not a fixed comparison. These studies did not demonstrate whether low-dose multidrug (≥ 3) combinations were more effective than the current recommended dual combinations, and studies conducted in a predominantly Asian/Chinese population are still lacking.

Therefore, the QUADUAL trial aimed to address these gaps in research by evaluating the efficacy and safety of half-dose quadruple therapy compared to standard-dose dual therapy.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^113wtwkq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Other Limitations

There are several limitations to consider in the JNC 8 committee's approach to BP treatment (Table 2). Unlike the other professional societies' guidelines, the JNC 8 panel did not address topics outside of their chosen critical questions, specifically given the paucity of randomized trial evidence addressing such questions. While they endorsed the AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk, 50 the JNC 8 does not address lifestyle modifications or a timeline for attempting them. Another limitation is that ambulatory BP monitoring, including cut‐off values for diagnosing hypertension based on home BP readings, is not addressed.

Table 2
Recommendations for the AHA/ACC Committee

One suggestion is to confirm elevated BP with ambulatory BP monitoring, such as that recently recommended by the US Preventive Service Task Force. 51 There is in general a lack of guidance on the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation for secondary causes. Although the JNC 8 committee offers a titration schedule for treating hypertension, the recommendations are somewhat vague, and there is no guidance for resistant hypertension beyond referral to a hypertension specialist.

We also recommend that the AHA/ACC guideline committee focus on the benefits of the various drug classes and the situations that call for monodrug versus multidrug therapy. Another important area of focus will be the benefit of more‐intensive BP treatment, especially in the elderly and those with diabetes, and the addition of a risk‐based approach to initiating treatment (described earlier). These are all areas that can be targeted by the new AHA/ACC guideline committee.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^113geTEx]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, with most deaths attributed to hypertension resulting from coronary heart disease or stroke and more than three quarters of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The level of high blood pressure (BP) is directly related to many adverse outcomes, including CVD and kidney disease. Conversely, clinical trials have repeatedly demonstrated that lowering BP in adults with high baseline BP level provides an effective means for preventing CVD. Definitions of hypertension are useful for clinical decision-making and are typically based on CVD risk and level of BP at which antihypertensive medication is effective for preventing CVD. A common definition of hypertension is based on an average systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, or self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. Using this definition, it has been estimated that ≈1.4 billion adults have hypertension, worldwide, but < 14% have their BP controlled with antihypertensive drug therapy to an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg (< 8% in low- and middle-income countries). Even more disturbing is the recent trend in a high-income country (the United States), where rate of hypertension control to an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg reached a high of close to 54% in 2013 to 2014, but dramatically eroded to < 44% in 2017 to 2018. Given this decrease, the Surgeon General of the United States issued a report for a "Call to Action to Control Hypertension" making the control of hypertension a national priority.

### Efficacy and safety of nebivolol and valsartan as fixed-dose combination in hypertension: a randomised, multicentre study [^114U7DAQ]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

The fixed-dose combination of any two antihypertensive drugs from different drug classes is typically more effective in reducing blood pressure than a dose increase of component monotherapy. We assessed the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of a vasodilating β blocker (nebivolol) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan) in adults with hypertension.

Methods

We did an 8-week, phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial at 401 US sites. Participants (age ≥ 18 years) with hypertension but with blood pressure less than 180/110 mm Hg were randomly assigned (2:2:2:2:2:2:2:1) by a 24-h interactive web response system in blocks of 15 to 4 weeks of double-blind treatment with nebivolol and valsartan fixed-dose combination (5 and 80 mg/day, 5 and 160 mg/day, or 10 and 160 mg/day), nebivolol (5 mg/day or 20 mg/day), valsartan (80 mg/day or 160 mg/day), or placebo. Doses were doubled in weeks 5–8; results are reported according to the final dose. Participants and research staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary and key secondary endpoints were changes from baseline to week 8 in diastolic and systolic blood pressure, respectively. The primary statistical comparison was between the highest fixed-dose combination dose and the highest monotherapy doses; lower doses were then compared if this comparison was positive (Hochberg method for multiple testing). Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat. Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events. Continuous efficacy parameters were analysed using an ANCOVA model; binary outcomes were analysed using a logistic regression model. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01508026.

Findings

Between Jan 6, 2012, and March 15, 2013, 4161 patients were randomly assigned (277 to placebo and 554–555 to each active comparator group), 4118 of whom were included in the primary analysis. At week 8, the fixed-dose combination 20 and 320 mg/day group had significantly greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure from baseline than both nebivolol 40 mg/day (least-squares mean difference -1.2 mm Hg, 95% CI -2.3 to -0.1; p = 0.030) and valsartan 320 mg/day (-4.4 mm Hg, -5.4 to -3.3; p < 0.0001); all other comparisons were also significant, favouring the fixed-dose combinations (all p < 0.0001). All systolic blood pressure comparisons were also significant (all p < 0.01). At least one treatment-emergent adverse event was experienced by 30–36% of participants in each group.

Interpretation

Nebivolol and valsartan fixed-dose combination is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with hypertension.

### Time in therapeutic range: timely in hypertension therapeutics? [^114aBys8]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure ranks among the most important modifiable risk factors for premature death, and disability from hypertension mediated organ damage in the world. Many studies attest to the value of lifestyle adjustments and pharmacologic therapy in improving outcomes in patients with hypertension. Since blood pressure is a dynamic vitals sign, variability in visit-to-visit measurements is expected. While guidelines recommend a goal blood pressure, increasing attention is centered on how often a patient's blood pressure is found to be not only below the recommended goal value, but also how much of the time the blood pressure is below what is considered a safe lower goal threshold for blood pressure. In this Perspective we review a relatively new technique in addressing adequacy of blood pressure treatment, the time in therapeutic range, and provide examples supporting the clinical relevance of this novel metric.

BP-lowering efficacy of low-dose combinations vs monotherapy

Among 6 trials of LDC vs initial monotherapy, the between-group difference in mean change in SBP was −7.4 (−4.8, −10.1) mm Hg greater at first follow-up visit between 4 and 6 weeks, with significant heterogeneity I² = 72% (Figure 3). A total of 5 trials reported effects on DBP and LDC conferred a −5.7 (−4.0, −7.4) mm Hg lower DBP compared to monotherapy (Figure 3). Compared to monotherapy, LDC was associated with a 1.5-fold increase in achieving target BP < 140/90 mm Hg at first follow-up visit between 4 and 6 weeks (67% vs 46%; RR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.34–1.56) (Supplemental Figure 3).

### The use of single-pill combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension: translating guidelines into clinical practice [^115XyoWN]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2008 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend the first-line prescription of two antihypertensive drugs in single-pill combinations (SPCs), also known as fixed-dose combinations, for the treatment of most patients with hypertension. This recommendation is based on a large amount of data, which shows that first-line treatment with SPCs supports reaching blood pressure targets rapidly and reducing cardiovascular outcome risk while keeping the therapeutic strategies as simple as possible and fostering adherence and persistence. As this approach constitutes a big shift from the stepped-care approaches that have been dominant for many years, practicing physicians have expressed concerns about using SPCs as first-line agents. In this review, we will discuss the barriers to the uptake of this recommendation. We will also offer suggestions to reduce the impact of these barriers and address specific concerns that have been raised.

### Evaluation and management of resistant hypertension: core curriculum 2024 [^117BqjS3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite confirmed adherence to 3 first-line antihypertensive agents or when blood pressure is controlled with 4 or more medications at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. In addition to meeting these criteria, identifying patients with true resistant hypertension requires both accurate in-office blood pressure measurement as well as excluding white coat effects through out-of-office blood pressure measurements. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events and are more likely to have a potentially treatable secondary cause contributing to their hypertension. Effective treatment of resistant hypertension includes ongoing lifestyle modifications and collaboration with patients to detect and address barriers to optimal medication adherence. Pharmacologic treatment should prioritize optimizing first-line, once daily, longer acting medications followed by the stepwise addition of second-, third-, and fourth-line agents as tolerated. Physicians should systematically evaluate for and address any underlying secondary causes. A coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach including clinicians with experience in treating resistant hypertension is essential. New treatment options, including both pharmacologic and device-based therapies, have recently been approved, and more are in the pipeline; their optimal role in the management of resistant hypertension is an area of ongoing research.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115mfqqb]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Drug treatment strategy for hypertension — contributors to poor blood pressure (BP) control and proposed approach: Only ~40% of patients with hypertension are treated and, of these, only ~35% are controlled to a BP of < 140/ 90 mmHg; evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) shows BP control can be achieved in most recruited patients and that no more than 5–10% exhibit resistance to the selected regimen; treatment inertia contributes to suboptimal BP control with many patients remaining on monotherapy and/or suboptimal doses; adherence is a much more important factor than previously recognised; almost all patients in RCTs have required combinations of drugs, and non‑adherence rises with pill burden, being usually < 10% with a single pill, ~20% with two pills, and ~40% with three pills, with very high rates in those receiving four or more pills; consequently, the most effective evidence‑based strategy is one that encourages combination treatment in most patients, enables the use of SPC therapy for most patients, encourages adherence, and follows a simple, pragmatic algorithm with SPC therapy as initial therapy in most patients except those with BP in the high–normal range and in frail older patients.

### Valsartan [^113b9pwA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Adult Hypertension

The recommended starting dose of valsartan tablets is 80 mg or 160 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-depleted. Patients requiring greater reductions may be started at the higher dose. Valsartan tablets may be used over a dose range of 80 mg to 320 mg daily, administered once a day.

The antihypertensive effect is substantially present within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. If additional antihypertensive effect is required over the starting dose range, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 320 mg or a diuretic may be added. Addition of a diuretic has a greater effect than dose increases beyond 80 mg.

Valsartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.3 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to 16 Years of Age

The usual recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg once daily (up to 40 mg total). A higher starting dose of 2 mg/kg may be considered in selected cases when a greater reduction of blood pressure is needed. The dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response and tolerability, up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/kg once daily (maximum daily dose 160 mg).

No data are available in pediatric patients either undergoing dialysis or with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Use of valsartan tablets is not recommended in children less than 1 year of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Pediatric Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

2.4 Heart Failure

The recommended starting dose of valsartan tablets is 40 mg twice daily. Uptitrate to 80 mg and 160 mg twice daily or to the highest dose tolerated by the patient. Consider reducing the dose of concomitant diuretics. The maximum daily dose administered in clinical trials is 320 mg in divided doses.

### Candesartan cilexetil [^114Ye3Zn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Adult Hypertension

Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil.

Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with or without food.

If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to < 17 Years of Age

Candesartan cilexetil may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Children 1 to < 6 years of age:

The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.20 mg/kg (oral suspension).

Children 6 to < 17 years of age:

For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg.

For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg.

Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to < 6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to < 17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 blood pressure-lowering medications for the treatment of hypertension [^112ghtZJ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) remains the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease globally. Despite this, only 1 in 3 people with hypertension achieve BP targets < 140/90 mm Hg in high-income countries, and < 1 in 10 in middle- and low-income countries. Therefore, there remains a pressing need for better BP-lowering strategies. Emerging evidence indicates that single pill low-dose combinations (LDCs) of 3 or 4 BP-lowering therapies ("hypertension polypills") could be used as an early treatment strategy for hypertension. This concept is based on the rationale that most of the BP-lowering efficacy from an antihypertensive is achieved at a fraction of the full dose and that the BP reductions are additive when using different drug classes. Meanwhile, adverse drug effects from antihypertensives appear to be more dose dependent, meaning that the use of multiple low doses to achieve BP control is less likely to induce side effects compared to the common practice of increasing the dose when BP targets are not met. The increase in efficacy from adding another low-dose BP-lowering drug makes LDCs a particularly attractive treatment option that maximizes efficacy while minimizing adverse events.

A prior systematic review and meta-analysis including 7 trials demonstrated that LDCs are associated with an average of 18 mm Hg reduction in systolic BP (SBP) compared to placebo and 7 mm Hg reduction in SBP compared to usual care, with a slight increase in dizziness. Since then, several new trials of LDCs have been published, allowing more detailed comparisons to address unanswered questions. For example, whether the effects of LDC vary by pretreatment BP is unclear, which is important given recent recommendations to initiate or intensify treatment at lower BP levels in many patients. There is also uncertainty about how much additional BP lowering is achieved with LDC compared to monotherapy, which remains the most common treatment strategy globally. Finally, there is debate regarding the timing for use of LDCs in management of hypertension. Specifically, should LDC be used in already treated patients with uncontrolled BP or in the initial stages of treatment, or in both settings? Therefore, we aimed to assess the BP-lowering efficacy and safety of LDC BP-lowering drugs that contain 3 or 4 drug classes compared to placebo, monotherapy, and usual care in randomized clinical trials.

### Controversies in hypertension therapy: bedtime dosing or daytime dosing? [^1145xVDZ]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension management strategies have evolved from solely controlling office blood pressure (BP) to comprehensive 24-h BP regulation. This review synthesizes current evidence on the timing of antihypertensive medication, with a focus on circadian BP rhythms and patients with specific BP patterns or comorbidities. Bedtime dosing may benefit individuals with nocturnal hypertension and nondipper BP patterns, but large trials, such as the TIME study, have shown no significant cardiovascular outcome differences between morning and bedtime dosing. However, the optimal timing of antihypertensive medication for patients with distinct BP rhythms or comorbidities remains uncertain. Future research should investigate the potential benefits of personalized medication timing tailored to BP patterns and clinical conditions. Additionally, treatment strategies should consider BP rhythms, comorbidities, and adherence to optimize outcomes, paving the way for more effective management of hypertensive patients with complex clinical profiles.

### Low-dose combination therapy: the rationalization for an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker in higher risk patients [^116nxBY7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

As more high-risk hypertensives are treated and the need for more intensive antihypertensive therapy is recognized, combination therapies are increasingly used. For initial therapy, particularly for relatively low-risk patients, low-dose combinations are often appropriate. For those who require additional therapy, higher doses of combinations may provide further efficacy while minimizing dose-dependent side effects of monotherapy, thereby improving adherence to therapy. Those combination agents should provide 24-h control with one daily dose, thereby ensuring protection in the early morning hours. Combining an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker is a rational approach to treating hypertension. Not only does it provide significantly better blood pressure control than individual components used as monotherapy, it also minimizes dose-dependent side effects. Also, combining agents from different classes results in complementary mechanisms of action that provide other cardiovascular protective benefits.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^115YwveD]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment initiation and titration in pediatric hypertension — Children who remain hypertensive after lifestyle changes or who have symptomatic HTN, stage 2 HTN without a clearly modifiable factor, or any stage of HTN with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or diabetes mellitus should be initiated with a single medication at the low end of the dosing range, with the dose increased every 2 to 4 weeks until BP is controlled (eg, < 90th percentile), the maximum dose is reached, or adverse effects occur, and patients should be seen every 4 to 6 weeks until BP has normalized; if BP is not controlled with a single agent, add a second agent and titrate similarly, with a thiazide diuretic often the preferred second agent due to salt and water retention with many antihypertensives; lifestyle modifications should be continued, emphasizing a healthy, plant-strong diet rich in fruits and vegetables, reduced sodium intake, and increased exercise to improve medication effectiveness; routine use of combination products to initiate therapy cannot be recommended (studied only for bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide), but after BP control is achieved a combination product can be considered to improve adherence and reduce cost when dose and formulation are appropriate.

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: controversies in hypertension-con side of the argument [^114iinKP]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

The 2018 European guidelinewent on proposing that the combination of medications targeting multiple mechanisms, such as blocking the renin-angiotensin system and inducing vasodilatation and diuresis, reduces the heterogeneity of the BP responses to initial treatment and provides a steeper dose response than is observed with escalating doses of monotherapy. Whereas this might be true during first 6 months after starting BP-lowering treatment, this certainly does not apply to the long-term life course treatment of hypertension (Figure 1). A post hoc analysis of the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation Trial did not confirm the widely promoted notion in SPC publications that earlier short-term differences in BP lowering over the long run would reduce cardiovascular end points. Furthermore, the Europeanand InternationalSocieties of Hypertension instructions ignored that the association of multiple drugs in a single pharmaceutical formulation may have effects on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of each and every individual component and may lead to undesired interactions between components. The trials,– and observational studies – reviewed in this debate article were generally not powered or had a duration not long enough to highlight serious adverse effects. As demonstrated by an observational study of patients aged 50 years or more and reflecting a real-world setting, use of SPCs was associated with a greater risk of hypotension than titrated SD free combinations. Moreover, abstraction made of commonly attributable adverse effects, for example, leg edema or cough respectively on treatment with CCBs or ACE inhibitors, many drug-induced complaints are vaguer and more difficult to be picked up, such as for instance fatigue or dizziness and in theory require rechallenge with the SD components of an SPC to identify the culprit drug. Fewer pills to be taken daily is a central concept in the promotion of SPCs, but a literature review with as search terms "preference" AND "patient" AND "pills" or "SPC", ran on October 20, 2020, with no limitations, did not yield any article among the 46 hits that directly translated patient convenience into preference for SPCs in primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention. As a corollary, treatment-experienced persons living with HIV valued minimizing side-effects and long-term toxicities over dosing and administration characteristics. Preferences varied widely, highlighting the need to elicit individual patient preferences, when decisions about dosing schemes of medications are made, certainly in the light of the potential adverse events of SPCs as mentioned before. Finally, the advice to initiate antihypertensive drug therapy with SPCs also goes against pathophysiological principles supporting the use of TDs in low-renin hypertension, Blacks and older patients and the use vasodilators (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or CCBs) in high-renin patients or younger individuals (Figure 3).

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^113QhbJd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2019: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensives to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. Other issues such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined were also considered to downgrade the quality evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 2 studies, 690 participants; very low-quality evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.90 mmHg, 95% CI -13.24 to -4.56; 6 studies, 8546 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.24; 6 studies, 8588 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Treatment intensification for hypertension in US ambulatory medical care [^113mFmYq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Last, it should be noted that clinical inaction may reflect appropriate care in certain circumstances 40; these include prior visits with satisfactory blood pressure readings, side effects from previously prescribed hypertensive drugs that preclude new options, patients' informed preference against intensified treatment, and the initiation of lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise, particularly given low adherence to guidelines. 41 Interestingly, our results showed that even among visits where lifestyle interventions were not attempted, the prevalence of treatment intensification was not appreciably different from that among all visits. Nonetheless, lifestyle modifications and patient engagement, as with organizational interventions and health system improvement, are crucial for improving and maintaining hypertension control 35, 36, 37, 42 in addition to timely and appropriate treatment intensification with new medication.

Our study has important strengths but also limitations. The lack of data on medication dose contributes to underestimation of true treatment intensification, which would include dose escalation, but this does not affect estimates of medication initiation, which have been consistently low and declining over time. Furthermore, medication addition may have benefits over dose escalation including higher efficacy and fewer side effects, 43, 44 and, in one cohort study of patients with diabetes mellitus, addition was ~3 times more common than dose escalation. 45 Indeed, an average of 1 additional medication is needed to achieve an SBP target of 120 mm Hg, 15 and multiple additions are typically necessary for people with common chronic conditions like diabetes mellitus 30, 31, 32 and chronic kidney disease. 46, 47

NAMCS and NHAMCS collected single blood pressure measurements; repeated blood pressure measures at multiple visits would have allowed us to estimate clinical inertia across groups of visits rather than single visits, where clinical uncertainty may be greater. 48, 49 Nonetheless, the very low rates of intensification observed here suggest that 5 or more visits with elevated blood pressure occur before 1 results in intensification. Furthermore, limited information on clinical history and cardiovascular risk profile precluded us from extensive considerations of the clinical context in each visit, but we deliberately only included patients with diagnosed hypertension, who would likely warrant treatment, and not those with an isolated blood pressure elevation. Because we did not include subjects with undiagnosed hypertension, the true burden of undertreated hypertension is undoubtedly much larger than estimated here. Last, our results may be influenced by a change in the 2012 NAMCS that emphasized automated data collection by trained Census personnel, although formal evaluation by the NCHS suggests that this introduced little or no bias into its estimates. 50

### Low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 blood pressure-lowering medications for the treatment of hypertension [^112Vk2cT]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Low-dose combinations (LDCs) of 3 or 4 blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs as a single pill show promise for initial treatment of hypertension.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of single pill LDC therapies compared to placebo, monotherapy, or usual care.

Methods

A systematic search for randomized trials comparing LDC consisting of 3 or 4 BP-lowering drugs all at ≤ 0.5 standard dose, compared to placebo, monotherapy, or usual care. Mean BP reductions, proportions achieving BP < 140/90 mm Hg, and risk of adverse events were summarized using random effects meta-analyses.

Results

Twelve trials (N = 2,581) were included which contributed to 12 comparisons of LDCs vs placebo, 6 for LDCs vs monotherapy, and 4 for LDCs vs usual care. LDC reduced BP by 14/6 mm Hg vs placebo at 4 to 12 weeks, with larger systolic BP reductions at higher pretreatment systolic BP. Compared to monotherapy, LDC reduced BP by 7/6 mm Hg and increased the proportion achieving BP < 140/90 mm Hg at first follow-up (67% vs 46%). Compared to usual care, LDC-based care was superior for BP reduction (7/4 mm Hg) and BP control (80% vs 65%) over an average 29 weeks; and results were similar whether patients were initially untreated or on monotherapy. LDC was not associated with significant increase in withdrawals due to adverse events compared to placebo (3% vs 2%), monotherapy (1% vs 0%), or usual care (3% vs 4%).

Conclusions

Single pill LDCs are effective and safe as an initial treatment option for hypertension. The degree of BP reduction depends strongly on pretreatment BP level.

### Standardized treatment protocols for hypertension: global availability, characteristics, and alignment with the hypertension guideline recommendations [^112YM6UM]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension control is suboptimal globally. Implementing evidence-based, simple, standardized treatment protocols (STPs) has been instrumental in effectively and efficiently improving treatment and control of hypertension. We aimed to identify, characterize, and critically appraise hypertension STPs.

Methods

We defined STP as a series of steps for the pharmacological treatment of primary hypertension, with information on target population, BP threshold for treatment initiation, target BP, specific drugs/classes/doses, and follow-up frequency. STPs for adult patients were identified from the websites of relevant health organizations, Google search, and through expert consultations (until July 2023). STPs for secondary, gestational, or malignant hypertension or those that were templates/samples were excluded. Included STPs were critically appraised using HEARTS in the Americas Checklist for hypertension management in primary care and compared with the 2021 WHO hypertension management guideline recommendations.

Results

Fifty STPs were identified. All STPs had a stepwise treatment approach, involved guideline-recommended first-line drugs, and 98% consisted of at least four steps. Majority (54%) recommended monotherapy with calcium channel blockers as first-line treatment. Only 44% STPs recommended treatment initiation with combination therapy, and 16% recommended single-pill combinations. Most (62%) had dose-intensification as the second step. Most (74%) STPs did not provide complete dosing information. Only one STP mentioned a target time for achieving BP control. On average, STPs scored a performance of 68% on the HEARTS Checklist.

Conclusion

Several STPs are available globally; however, most of them have enormous scope for improvement through interventions aimed at alignment with the latest evidence-based guidelines and multistakeholder engagement.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension… [^116UsXhy]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To review the evidence and provide clinical recommendations for appropriate blood pressure treatment targets for adults with hypertension. The most common pharmacologic treatments for reducing blood pressure include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers. Selection of medications should include cost, ease of use, adverse effect profile, and comorbid conditions. Accurate measurement of blood pressure is essential to the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Ambulatory and home blood pressure measurements can be useful in diagnosis and monitoring. Although the optimal method for blood pressure measurement remains unclear and under investigation, diagnosis requires two or more blood pressure readings on two or more occasions that meet the criteria for hypertension.

Recommendations RECOMMENDATION 1 The AAFP strongly recommends clinicians treat adults who have hypertension to a standard blood pressure target to reduce the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Treating to a lower blood pressure target does not provide additional benefit at preventing mortality; however, a lower blood pressure target could be considered based on patient preferences and values. Additional use of medication is also a potential harm. In Arguedas, et al., individuals in the lower target group required an average of one additional medication. 18 Increased medication burden can increase cost, medication adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions. These results are consistent with data from the two largest trials, ACCORD and SPRINT. 28 The SPRINT trial also demonstrated increased adverse events in the lower blood pressure target groups and a number needed to harm of 46 every 3. 3 years. 29 This included a 1. 2% absolute increase in acute kidney injury caused by medication.
29. Additional post-intervention data from the SPRINT trial were published after completion of the Arguedas, et al., review. Although additional events in the composite outcome were observed, there were no differences in mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction between the treatment groups. 39 The STEP trial also found a reduction in stroke when treating to a lower systolic blood pressure target of 110 to 130 mm Hg.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^115syZP7]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Office BP Treatment Targets

Both the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH recommend lower BP treatment targets compared with the goals advised in previous guidelines. The ACC/AHA recommends SBP/DBP < 130/80 mm Hg as a general treatment target, if tolerated (Tables 6–8). For older adults (≥ 65 years), who are noninstitutionalized, ambulatory, and community dwelling, the target is SBP < 130 mm Hg, if tolerated. For older adults with a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based assessment of risk/benefit. The ESC/ESH recommends target ranges but recognizes that the optimal and tolerated targets for individuals will differ. The initial SBP/DBP target is < 140/90 mm Hg for all adults with hypertension. Provided the treatment is well tolerated, targeting to 130/80 mm Hg is recommended, with subsequent efforts to achieve a lower BP in those 18 to 65 years of age. An exception to the general rule is that the SBP target in adults with hypertension and CKD should be < 140 to 130 mm Hg. The ESC/ESH advises against specifically targeting SBP to < 120 mm Hg for adults, but acknowledges that this may be achieved in some treated patients without adverse effects. A key emphasis, especially in older and frailer patients, is to tailor the treatment to achieve the best BP possible within the target range, while monitoring for adverse effects. The optimal DBP target is defined as 70 to 79 mm Hg for all patients, but the emphasis is on controlling SBP, even when DBP is below these levels, provided the treatment is tolerated.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^1124e2kh]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114eZ6aq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

4.3 Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacological treatment of HTN plays a central role in its management. Several drugs have been developed and proven effective in the treatment of HTN. However, the use of antihypertensive medication differs widely by world region. Overall, the use of antihypertensive medication is more common in high‐income versus middle‐ or low‐income regions (56% vs. 29%). The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study showed that overall control was worst in low‐income and lower‐middle‐income countries (11%), compared with 19% in high‐income countries and 16% in upper‐middle‐income countries. Some reasons for the low frequency of treatment and control of HTN included insufficient therapy and poor access to the healthcare system.

HTN guidelines support low‐dose pharmacological therapy initially and subsequent up‐titration and/or addition of new drugs based on the achieved BP and tolerability, as low‐dose combinations of antihypertensive agents are more effective in BP‐lowering and well‐tolerated than high‐dose monotherapies. A single‐pill combination of drugs at lower doses is recommended as it may provide improvements in adherence, efficacy, and tolerability of therapy, and most of the patients will require two or more drugs to achieve de BP targets. In 2019, single‐pill antihypertensive drug combinations were listed on the WHO Essential Medicine list. Nowadays single‐pill combinations exist with two or three antihypertensive agents.

Clinician therapeutic inertia is a contributing factor for failure to achieve BP targets. Prescription of a fixed‐dose combination when initiating antihypertensive treatment may overcome therapeutic inertia as it can reduce the number of follow‐up visits needed and has been demonstrated to achieve a higher rate of BP control.

Inadequate supplies of essential antihypertensive drugs are a major barrier to the delivery of optimal care for the management of HTN in low‐resource settings. Relying on simple treatment protocols with specific drugs and doses at each step is recommended to facilitate the procurement of large volumes of medicines of choice, which simplifies the supply chain and lower prices.

Another important aspect relates to low adherence to anti‐hypertensive medication, which remains a major contributing factor to uncontrolled BP. Barriers to achieve high medical adherence are multifactorial and include complex medication regimens, convenience factors (e.g. dosing and frequency), forgetfulness, issues with treatment of asymptomatic disease (including fear of possible or experienced adverse events and perceived lack of treatment benefit), cost of treatment and limited access to care.

In patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite the prescription of several antihypertensive medications, we need to determine if true TRH is present or merely apparent TRH. As the latter comprises a wide spectrum of causes for uncontrolled BP, these patients require thorough assessment from the alert clinician. Furthermore, the pharmacological therapy must be tailored to each patient, in order to maximize adherence to treatment and minimize adverse effects; this approach may be effective to achieve target BP always remembering that "one size does not fit all" (Table 4). The development of newer agents may also expand the antihypertensive arsenal, and medication used in other conditions, such as heart failure or chronic kidney disease, may have useful BP lowering effects. Nevertheless, drug adherence remains the most challenging problem to investigate and to manage in patients with TRH. Medication adherence issues are so common in resistant hypertensionthat they should be investigated before performing any costly investigations looking for secondary causes of hypertension. However, the topic of adherence and persistence clearly warrants further research including high-quality prospective interventional trials using interventions that have been studied and found to be effective at improving patient adherence.

### Delphi panel study of current hypertension treatment patterns [^114wb2mJ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess whether, and to what extent, usual practice in the management of patients with mild to moderate hypertension differs from that recommended in the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI). The results were used as input for a clinical decision analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of a new treatment for hypertension.

Methods

A Delphi panel survey of general practitioners and cardiologists in the United States was conducted to determine current strategies for the treatment of mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension. The purpose of the panel survey was to reach consensus on 3 key facets of the JNC-VI guidelines and how they relate to the respondents' clinical practices: (1) the definition of mild to moderate hypertension, (2) the treatment that adult patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension should receive, and (3) the management of patient follow-up.

Results

Of the 20 physicians contacted for the survey, 10 responded to both rounds of the questionnaire. There was considerable variation in the responses for defining the ranges of healthy, acceptable, unacceptable, and serious blood pressure. In general, the Delphi panel respondents cited higher limits than stated in the JNC-VI guidelines. Physicians followed the guidelines approximately 60% of the time. Primary determinants of initial drug choice among the panelists were comorbid conditions and the severity of hypertension; patients' age, race, and sex were secondary determinants. Follow-up typically occurred 1 month after therapy initiation. Panelists reported titrating the dose of new therapies upward once or twice before discontinuing the drug for lack of efficacy. Once adequate blood pressure control was achieved, patient follow-up was reported to occur every 3 to 4 months.

Conclusions

This Delphi panel study highlights the differences between clinical practice and the JNC-VI guidelines in the treatment of hypertension. The results were used as a basis for defining a structure for a cost-effectiveness model and provided the management practice and prescribing practice patterns required by the model.

### Pediatric pulmonary hypertension: guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society [^115Pf7fV]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — prostacyclin (PGI2) therapies: Intravenous epoprostenol dosing typically begins at 2 ng·kg−1·min−1, with effective dosing in children reported from 40 to > 150 ng·kg−1·min−1 and an average of ≈80 ng·kg−1·min−1; it is infused 24 hours a day and has a half-life of 2 to 5 minutes, creating risk for rebound pulmonary hypertension (PH) if interrupted. The PGI2 analog treprostinil received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals in adults in 2002 (subcutaneous), 2004 (intravenous), 2009 (inhaled), and 2013 (oral); it has a longer half-life with elimination half-life 4.5 hours and distribution half-life 40 minutes, and intravenous treprostinil has a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Inhaled iloprost is administered by nebulization 6 to 9 times a day with treatment lasting 10 to 15 minutes. Beraprost is orally active with a half-life of 35 to 40 minutes, and data in children are scarce; beraprost is not available in the United States or Europe.
