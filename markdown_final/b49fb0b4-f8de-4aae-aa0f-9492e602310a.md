Dietary recommendations for diabetes management

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for dietary recommendations for diabetes management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of individualized, patient-centered nutrition therapy. Then, I should verify the core goals and targets for glycemic control, weight, and cardiometabolic risk. Next, I will examine macronutrient flexibility and the quality-over-quantity principle. After that, I should review evidence-based dietary patterns, followed by practical implementation strategies and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic clinical approach and highlight uncertainties and controversies that require shared decision-making and monitoring [^113SDboG] [^112Jjwng].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: there is no single optimal diet for all people with diabetes, and individualized medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is the cornerstone of care, tailored to personal and cultural preferences, metabolic goals, and readiness to change; I need to ensure I anchor this to current standards and emphasize that multiple eating patterns can be effective when sustained [^114ftzgo] [^112U4mYL] [^113PWbLu].

> I should double-check the clinical goals next: for type 2 diabetes, weight management is central, with a modest weight loss of 3–7% conferring meaningful improvements in A1c, blood pressure, and lipids, and greater losses (often ≥ 15 kg) enabling remission in some; for type 1 diabetes, the priority is optimizing insulin-to-carb matching and time-in-range while avoiding hypoglycemia; for both, emphasize cardiometabolic risk reduction via improved lipids and blood pressure using diet quality and energy balance [^1128APuC] [^113xKMLP] [^115stnSf] [^1122FRxE] [^113k81At] [^114VWEVz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about macronutrient ratios; I need to verify the shift from fixed percentages to flexible ranges and quality-first guidance. Contemporary guidance rejects a universal macronutrient distribution and supports a broad carbohydrate range (about 13–50% of total energy) individualized to glycemic targets, with emphasis on fiber-rich, minimally processed carbohydrates and avoidance of refined starches and added sugars; protein and fat distributions should likewise be personalized, with attention to satiety, renal function, and cardiovascular risk [^111ZP8z5] [^115eLhBk] [^112HHa1y] [^112Jjwng].

> Wait, let me verify the quality-over-quantity principle: the type of carbohydrate and fat matters more than the amount. Emphasize nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, intact whole grains, nuts and seeds, and dairy such as yogurt; limit refined grains, added sugars, sugar-sweetened beverages including juice, processed meats, and foods high in sodium; prioritize unsaturated fats (MUFA/PUFA, omega-3s) and minimize saturated and trans fats; this pattern improves glycemia, lipids, and blood pressure and is consistently endorsed across high-quality guidelines [^1169vog3] [^115voWN6] [^115stnSf] [^114fU1Bz].

> Next, I should review evidence-based dietary patterns; let me consider Mediterranean, plant-predominant, low-carbohydrate, and DASH, and I need to check the strength of evidence for each. Mediterranean-style eating shows consistent benefits for A1c, weight, lipids, and cardiovascular outcomes and is recommended by multiple guidelines; plant-predominant patterns (vegetarian/vegan, DASH) improve glycemia and cardiometabolic risk, with VA/DoD suggesting vegetarian patterns for glycemic control and weight loss; low-carbohydrate diets (generally < 26% of energy) can improve A1c and allow medication de-intensification, but long-term adherence is challenging and they require careful monitoring; ketogenic diets can lower A1c but are highly restrictive and evidence for long-term safety and sustainability remains limited [^111Gboox] [^113CxMYu] [^116qDGVS] [^112HHa1y] [^113g69px] [^117WUyPP].

> I will now examine practical implementation; I need to ensure advice is actionable and culturally acceptable. Use structured education, behavior change strategies, and frequent follow-up; incorporate portion control, the plate method, carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, and meal timing aligned with insulin or oral agents; pair nutrition with at least 150–200 minutes per week of physical activity and weight management programming; address barriers such as cost, access, and food environments, and consider harm-reduction approaches when perfection is unattainable [^1122FRxE] [^115cD3Re] [^1128dnM2] [^1164Pbhm].

> But wait, what about special populations; I should confirm adjustments for type 1 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, older adults, and pregnancy. For type 1 diabetes, emphasize insulin-to-carb matching, consistent meal timing, and exercise-specific carb strategies to maintain time-in-range; for CKD stages 1–4, target protein at ~0.8 g/kg/day and avoid high-protein diets; for older adults, avoid overly restrictive diets and prioritize nutrition risk screening; for pregnancy, refer to gestational diabetes protocols and ensure adequate, balanced intake with close monitoring [^115iLELD] [^113jvskj] [^116RcBnG] [^112Pezt6].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic clinical approach while I double-check alignment with guidelines: start with individualized MNT delivered by a registered dietitian when possible; set weight and A1c goals collaboratively; choose an eating pattern the patient can adhere to long term, favoring Mediterranean or plant-predominant patterns when acceptable, or a monitored low-carbohydrate approach if aligned with preferences and metabolic needs; emphasize whole foods, fiber, and unsaturated fats; reduce added sugars and refined starches; integrate physical activity and behavior support; monitor glycemia, weight, lipids, and blood pressure, and adjust the plan iteratively based on response and life changes [^111pH7dy] [^114ftzgo] [^1128APuC] [^115stnSf].

> Hold on, I should verify uncertainties and controversies so we counsel transparently: macronutrient composition debates persist, with some guidelines endorsing flexibility while others historically favored higher-carb, lower-fat models; low-carb and ketogenic diets show short-term A1c benefits but face questions on long-term adherence and cardiovascular effects; non-sugar sweeteners have minimal impact on glycemia but uncertain effects on weight and long-term outcomes; guideline rigor and bias vary across organizations, underscoring the need for shared decision-making and critical appraisal of evidence [^112Jjwng] [^117WUyPP] [^117PKG8s] [^114wKmbM].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and actionable: there is no single best diet for diabetes; multiple eating patterns can improve glycemia, weight, and cardiovascular risk when they emphasize whole, minimally processed foods, adequate fiber, and unsaturated fats, and when they are sustained; personalize the plan, monitor closely, and iterate based on metabolic response and patient preferences to achieve durable benefits [^114ftzgo] [^1169vog3] [^111Gboox].

Dietary recommendations for diabetes management emphasize **individualized, nutrient-dense eating patterns** [^114ftzgo] and **weight loss for those with overweight/obesity** [^1128APuC] to improve glycemic control and reduce cardiovascular risk [^115stnSf]. Key elements include:

- **Individualized nutrition**: Tailor meal plans to preferences, culture, and metabolic goals; no single macronutrient ratio fits all [^114ftzgo] [^112U4mYL].
- **Weight loss**: Aim for 3–7% weight loss in overweight/obesity; greater loss improves glycemia and cardiometabolic outcomes [^1128APuC] [^1134vbqP].
- **Mediterranean or DASH patterns**: Emphasize vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and unsaturated fats; limit refined grains, added sugars, and processed meats [^1169vog3] [^115stnSf].
- **Carbohydrate quality**: Prioritize fiber-rich, low-GI carbs; consider reducing total carbs to 13–50% of calories if it improves glycemia [^111ZP8z5] [^115eLhBk].
- **Protein**: Use plant-based sources (nuts, seeds, legumes) and include fatty fish; limit red/processed meats [^115gtNii] [^114Fuxkg].
- **Alcohol**: Limit to ≤ 1 drink/day (women) or ≤ 2 drinks/day (men) with food [^1169vog3].
- **Sodium**: Keep < 2,300 mg/day to support blood pressure control [^115xEyAn].
- **Sweeteners**: Use non-nutritive sweeteners in moderation; evidence on long-term effects is limited [^117PKG8s].

These recommendations should be **implemented with ongoing support** [^113xKMLP] and monitoring to sustain adherence and optimize outcomes [^115cD3Re].

Evidence for current dietary guidelines

In some, mostly developed, countries, dietary guidelines for the management of diabetes have evolved from a focus on a low fat diet to the recognition that more important considerations are macronutrient quality (that is, the type versus the quantity of macronutrient), avoidance of processed foods (particularly processed starches and sugars), and overall dietary patterns. Many systematic reviews and national dietary guidelines have evaluated the evidence for optimal dietary advice, and we will not repeat the evidence review. We focus instead in the following sections on some important principles where broad consensus exists in the scientific and clinical community and highlight areas of uncertainty, but we begin by outlining three underpinning features.

Firstly, an understanding of healthy eating for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes has largely been derived from long term prospective studies and limited evidence from randomised controlled trials in general populations, supplemented by evidence from people with type 2 diabetes. Many published guidelines and reviews have applied grading criteria and this evidence is often of moderate quality in the hierarchy of evidence that places randomised controlled trials at the top. Elsewhere, it is argued that different forms of evidence evaluating consistency across multiple study designs including large population based prospective studies of clinical endpoints, controlled trials of intermediate pathways, and where feasible randomised trials of clinical endpoints should be used collectively for evidence based nutritional guidance.

### Dietary and nutritional approaches for prevention and management of type 2 diabetes [^114Y8vAQ]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Dietary factors are of paramount importance in the management and prevention of type 2 diabetes. Despite progress in formulating evidence based dietary guidance, controversy and confusion remain. In this article, we examine the evidence for areas of consensus as well as ongoing uncertainty or controversy about dietary guidelines for type 2 diabetes. What is the best dietary approach? Is it possible to achieve remission of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle behaviour changes or is it inevitably a condition causing progressive health decline? We also examine the influence of nutrition transition and population specific factors in the global context and discuss future directions for effective dietary and nutritional approaches to manage type 2 diabetes and their implementation.

### A practical guide to delivering nutritional advice to people with diabetes [^1122FRxE]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Dietary advice is fundamental to the management of diabetes. Although ideally such advice should be delivered by a state-registered dietitian, it is more usually delivered by other health professionals. The primary focus for those with type 1 diabetes is carbohydrate counting and insulin adjustment and for the majority of people with type 2 diabetes, weight management is key. Patient-centred care is emphasised for the delivery of dietary advice. It is widely recognised that knowledge alone is not sufficient to induce behaviour change and practical approaches to a variety of behavioural interventions are discussed.

### Diabetes UK evidence-based nutrition guidelines for the prevention and management of diabetes [^114bHHbj]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This article summarizes the Diabetes UK evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of Type 2 diabetes and nutritional management of diabetes. It describes the development of the recommendations and highlights the key changes from previous guidelines. The nutrition guidelines include a series of recommendations for the prevention of Type 2 diabetes, nutritional management of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, weight management, management of microvascular and macrovascular disease, hypoglycaemia management, and additional considerations such as nutrition support, end-of-life care, disorders of the pancreas, care of the older person with diabetes, nutrition provided by external agencies and fasting. The evidence-based recommendations were graded using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology and, in a small number of topic areas, where strong evidence was lacking, the recommendations were reached by consensus. The Diabetes UK 2011 guidelines place an emphasis on carbohydrate management and a more flexible approach to weight loss, unlike previous guidelines which were expressed in terms of recommendations for individual nutrient intakes. Additionally, the guidelines for alcohol have been aligned to national recommendations.

Difficulties in setting guidelines

Where dietary guidelines exist (in many settings there are none, or they are adapted from those in developed countries and therefore may not be applicable to the local situation), they vary substantially in whether they are evidence based or opinion pieces, and updated in line with scientific progress or outdated. Their accessibility — both physical availability (eg, through a website or clinic) and comprehensibility — for patients and healthcare professionals varies. They vary also in scope, content, detail, and emphasis on the importance of individualised dietary advice, areas of controversy, and further research needs. The quality of research that informs dietary guidelines also needs greater investment from the scientific community and funders. Moreover, lack of transparency in the development of guidelines and bias in the primary nutritional studies can undermine the development of reliable dietary guidelines; recommendations for their improvement must be heeded.

### Diabetes UK evidence-based nutrition guidelines for the prevention and management of diabetes [^116UUofR]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A summary of the latest evidence-based nutrition guidelines for the prevention and management of diabetes is presented. These guidelines are based on existing recommendations last published in 2011, and were formulated by an expert panel of specialist dietitians after a literature review of recent evidence. Recommendations have been made in terms of foods rather than nutrients wherever possible. Guidelines for education and care delivery, prevention of Type 2 diabetes, glycaemic control for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease risk management, management of diabetes-related complications, other considerations including comorbidities, nutrition support, pregnancy and lactation, eating disorders, micronutrients, food supplements, functional foods, commercial diabetic foods and nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners are included. The sections on pregnancy and prevention of Type 2 diabetes have been enlarged and the weight management section modified to include considerations of remission of Type 2 diabetes. A section evaluating detailed considerations in ethnic minorities has been included as a new topic. The guidelines were graded using adapted 'GRADE' methodology and, where strong evidence was lacking, grading was not allocated. These 2018 guidelines emphasize a flexible, individualized approach to diabetes management and weight loss and highlight the emerging evidence for remission of Type 2 diabetes. The full guideline document is available at www.diabetes.org.uk/nutrition-guidelines.

### The harry keen rank nutrition lecture 2022. nutritional guidelines for diabetes management: where do they come from and do they work? [^111Vxewg]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Nutritional guidelines for diabetes are designed to support those living with diabetes in achieving optimal glycaemic control, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and maintaining quality of life. Historically, guidelines reflected current opinion and clinical practice and only relatively recently have evidence-based recommendations been published. Current nutritional guidelines for type 1 and type 2 diabetes are based on high-quality evidence including data from randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies and are graded by the strength of evidence. There is no evidence to support one specific dietary strategy for people with diabetes, and this is particularly true for weight reduction in those with type 2 diabetes living with overweight or obesity, where the evidence suggests that different strategies are equally successful. As a result, the emphasis of modern guidelines is on individualised, person-centred approaches. Some barriers to successful implementation include lack of dietary education and knowledge in health professionals supporting people with diabetes, and a so-called obesogenic environment that impedes dietary change. Initiatives such as education and training programmes for health professionals, and population-based interventions that promote both structural and policy change are recommended to enable those with diabetes to support dietary change and improve health.

### Effects of different dietary patterns on glucose management in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114VWEVz]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 1 diabetes is becoming increasingly common worldwide, with an estimated annual incidence rise of 3%. The condition is marked by insulin deficiency, requiring exogenous insulin treatment for survival. Additionally, frequent hyperglycemia raises the risk of vascular complications, making intensive glucose management crucial. However, only about 16% of individuals with type 1 diabetes achieve the recommended HbA1c target of 7% (53 mmol/mol), highlighting the need for improved care strategies.

Nutrition therapy is fundamental for managing type 1 diabetes, with current dietary guidelines recommending healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, to reach glycemic targets. However, these guidelines are primarily based on evidence from individuals with type 2 diabetes, who generally exhibit greater insulin resistance, and less insulin deficiency compared to those with type 1 diabetes. Insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes may also influence nutritional intervention responses. The impact of dietary patterns on type 1 diabetes management is unclear, with scattered evidence often from mixed populations of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggested carbohydrate-restricted diets might improve glycemic control in type 1 diabetes, though the evidence was weak. Since then, several RCTs have been published, potentially strengthening the evidence base.,

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to identify and synthesize existing evidence from RCTs on the impact of dietary patterns on glucose management in type 1 diabetes. By focusing exclusively on type 1 diabetes and incorporating multiple metrics, including HbA1c, hypoglycemia, coefficient of variation (CV), time in range (TIR), insulin dose, and body measurements, this review seeks to inform dietary guidelines for type 1 diabetes.

### Improving the scientific rigour of nutritional recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes: a comprehensive review of the American diabetes association guideline-recommended eating patterns [^114wKmbM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

The global rate of type 2 diabetes (T2D) continues to rise. Guidelines that influence the worldwide treatment of this disease are central to changing this trajectory. We sought in this review to evaluate the appropriateness of sources cited in the American Diabetes Association's (ADA) guidelines on eating patterns for T2D management, identify additional relevant sources, and evaluate the evidence.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the evidence behind the ADA's recommendations on eating patterns in the 2018 and 2019 ADA Standards of Care and the 2014 ADA Nutrition Therapy Recommendations for Adults with Diabetes. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive search to identify any additional studies not included in the cited evidence. To determine appropriateness of inclusion in the guidelines, the following criteria were applied: 1) it was a clinical trial or systematic review/meta-analysis of clinical trials; 2) it involved persons with T2D; 3) one of the study arms followed one of the eating patterns currently recommended; 4) its reported outcomes included glycaemic control; 5) outcomes were reported separately for persons with T2D.

Results

We found a wide variation in the evidence for each eating pattern. Issues that have hampered the guideline process include: lack of a rigorous literature review, resulting in the omission of pertinent studies; an overreliance on prospective cohort studies; inconsistent standards for evidence; inclusion of studies not on persons with T2D; and bias.

Conclusions

The ADA Guidelines recommended eating patterns fall short of rigorous standards of scientific review according to state-of-the-art systematic review and guideline creation practices.

### Does a ketogenic diet have a place within diabetes clinical practice? Review of current evidence and controversies [^117WUyPP]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Carbohydrate restriction has gained increasing popularity as an adjunctive nutritional therapy for diabetes management. However, controversy remains regarding the long-term suitability, safety, efficacy and potential superiority of a very low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet compared to current recommended nutritional approaches for diabetes management. Recommendations with respect to a ketogenic diet in clinical practice are often hindered by the lack of established definition, which prevents its capacity to be most appropriately prescribed as a therapeutic option for diabetes. Furthermore, with conflicted evidence, this has led to uncertainty amongst clinicians on how best to support and advise their patients. This review will explore whether a ketogenic diet has a place within clinical practice by reviewing current evidence and controversies.

### Diet in the management of type 2 diabetes: umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^111Gboox]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this umbrella review, we identified the dietary factors with robust evidence of health benefits, expressed as surrogate disease and health markers in people with type 2 diabetes. An energy restricted diet can reduce body weight and improve cardiometabolic health. In addition to energy restriction, dietary approaches, such as a plant based, Mediterranean, low carbohydrate (< 26% total energy), or high protein diet, are beneficial for cardiometabolic health in individuals with type 2 diabetes. For evidence based recommendations of the effectiveness of other dietary factors in the management of type 2 diabetes, more randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews with meta-analyses focusing on long term interventions are needed.

### Diet in the management of type 2 diabetes: umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^111Zp1Bf]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a major global health problem. In 2021, the International Diabetes Federation estimated that a total of 536.6 million individuals worldwide lived with diabetes, and this number is expected to increase. Type 2 diabetes carries a huge financial burden on health systems and people with diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is typically associated with obesity, abnormalities of lipid metabolism, and an increased risk of numerous complications and comorbidities. These include cardiovascular and liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes related eye disease, and lower limb amputations. Also, people with type 2 diabetes have about a 2.5 times higher risk of all cause mortality than people without diabetes.

Lifestyle factors, such as diet, form the basis of the management of type 2 diabetes, and over the past decades, the effects of different diets on managing type 2 diabetes have been studied. Meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials showed that Mediterranean, vegetarian, and ketogenic dietslowered levels of haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c), whereas a higher intake of dietary fibreand soy isoflavones, and magnesium supplementationimproved concentrations of blood lipids. These findings suggest that changes in diet might be important for preventing further complications and progression of disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes. To provide evidence based dietary recommendations, however, the existing evidence needs to be systematically summarised and evaluated based on state-of-the-art approaches.

So far, several umbrella reviews have been conducted summarising the evidence on selected dietary factors and specific outcomes in diabetes. None of the previous umbrella reviews, however, included meta-analyses with randomised controlled trials lasting at least 12 weeks, not all focused exclusively on people with type 2 diabetes, and not all assessed the certainty of evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. There is an urgent need to summarise all available evidence on this topic and, most importantly, to assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Our aim in this umbrella review was to systematically summarise the most recent evidence on dietary interventions, including dietary patterns, food groups, and dietary supplements, on health outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. The evidence was derived from systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials that lasted at least 12 weeks. We also evaluated the certainty of evidence of these effects.

### Does a ketogenic diet have a place within diabetes clinical practice? Review of current evidence and controversies [^113k81At]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is a complex chronic disease characterised by inadequate glucoregulatory control resulting in hyperglycaemia. The global prevalence of diabetes has quadrupled from 108 million in 1980 to an estimated 462 million in 2017 with many more currently undiagnosed, making diabetes one of the most widespread chronic diseases. The ultimate goal of type 2 diabetes management is managing a person's glycaemia within target range of a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) as recommended by clinical guidelines or even to support the achievement of drug-free remission, and in doing so reduce the risk of diabetes associated micro- and macrovascular complications.

From a dietary and nutrition management perspective it is key that people living with diabetes are supported to make healthier food choices using an individualised approach, appreciating that no one size fits all. Advice has to consider the person's cultural, ethnic, social, and economic factors. Evidence-based guidance for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) management surrounding nutrition and lifestyle changes globally are similar; Diabetes UK recommends an individualised approach taking personal and cultural preferences into consideration. A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, fish, nuts and pulses is recommended simultaneous with reduced consumption of processed meat, refined carbohydrates and artificially sweetened beverages. The American Diabetes Association endorse a balance of macronutrients including nutrient-dense fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains.

More recently the target goal of remission has been introduced for people with T2D following the publication of the DiRECT trial and along with other research and analyses. These programmes used either a formula low energy diet or a low carbohydrate diet. However, not everyone wishes to follow such a plan and therefore alternative dietary options need to be offered.

For people living with T2D, intensive lifestyle management, including increased physical activity and a hypocaloric diet alongside behaviour change, is the cornerstone of diabetes management, with the ultimate aim being to induce weight reduction of at least 15 kg which correlates to improved glucoregulatory control. However, lifestyle intervention typically results only in short-term and modest weight reduction, of around 5% of body weight which is usually insufficient to induce a significant improvement in glycaemic control, particularly with respect to achieving diabetes remission.

Areas of uncertainty in guidelines

Optimal macronutrient composition

One of the most contentious issues about the management of type 2 diabetes has been on the best macronutrient composition of the diet. Some guidelines continue to advise macronutrient quantity goals, such as the European or Canadian recommendation of 45–60% of total energy as carbohydrate, 10–20% as protein, and less than 35% as fat, or the Indian guidelines that recommend 50–60% energy from carbohydrates, 10–15% from protein, and less than 30% from fat. In contrast, the most recent nutritional guideline from the American Diabetes Association concluded that there is no ideal mix of macronutrients for all people with diabetes and recommended individually tailored goals. Alternatively, a low carbohydrate diet for weight and glycaemic control has gained popularity among some experts, clinicians, and the public (reviewed in a later section). Others conclude that a low carbohydrate diet combined with low saturated fat intake is best.

For weight loss, three points are noteworthy when comparing dietary macronutrient composition. Firstly, evidence from trials points to potentially greater benefits from a low carbohydrate than a low fat diet but the difference in weight loss between diets is modest. Secondly, a comparison of named diet programmes with different macronutrient composition highlighted that the critical factor in effectiveness for weight loss was the level of adherence to the diet over time. Thirdly, the quality of the diet in low carbohydrate or low fat diets is important.

Research to date on weight or metabolic outcomes in diabetes is complicated by the use of different definitions for the different macronutrient approaches. For instance, the definition of a low carbohydrate diet has ranged from 4% of daily energy intake from carbohydrates (promoting nutritional ketosis) to 40%. Similarly, low fat diets have been defined as fat intake less than 30% of daily energy intake or substantially lower. Given these limitations, the best current approach may be an emphasis on the use of individual assessment for dietary advice and a focus on the pattern of eating that most readily allows the individual to limit calorie intake and improve macronutrient quality (such as avoiding refined carbohydrates).

Areas of consensus in guidelines

Weight management

Type 2 diabetes is most commonly associated with overweight or obesity and insulin resistance. Therefore, reducing weight and maintaining a healthy weight is a core part of clinical management. Weight loss is also linked to improvements in glycaemia, blood pressure, and lipids and hence can delay or prevent complications, particularly cardiovascular events.

Energy balance

Most guidelines recommend promoting weight loss among overweight or obese individuals by reducing energy intake. Portion control is one strategy to limit energy intake together with a healthy eating pattern that focuses on a diet composed of whole or unprocessed foods combined with physical activity and ongoing support.

Dietary patterns

The evidence points to promoting patterns of food intake that are high in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and dairy products such as yoghurt but with some cautions. Firstly, some dietary approaches (eg, low carbohydrate diets) recommend restricting the intake of fruits, whole grains, and legumes because of their sugar or starch content. For fruit intake, particularly among those with diabetes, opinion is divided among scientists and clinicians (see appendix on bmj.com). Many guidelines continue to recommend fruit, however, on the basis that fructose intake from fruits is preferable to isocaloric intake of sucrose or starch because of the additional micronutrient, phytochemical, and fibre content of fruit. Secondly, despite evidence from randomised controlled trials and prospective studiesthat nuts may help prevent type 2 diabetes, some (potentially misplaced) concern exists about their high energy content. Further research in people with type 2 diabetes should help to clarify this.

There is also consensus on the benefits of certain named dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet for prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Expert guidelines also support other healthy eating patterns that take account of local sociocultural factors and personal preferences.

### Dietary strategies for adult type 1 diabetes in light of outcome evidence [^115iLELD]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals who have type 1 diabetes need individualised medical nutrition therapies whose goals are to improve overall health and metabolic outcomes. However, interventions in the field of nutrition are challenging, as diet-related correlations with disease remain difficult to detect and the certainty of outcome in this area is elusive. Currently, patients are not meeting recommended dietary guidelines. Several alternative approaches for teaching meal planning to people with diabetes have been proposed: basic nutrition guidelines, basic diabetes guidelines, menu approaches to meal planning, exchange lists for meal planning and carbohydrate counting. The review provides an overview of suggested strategies for achieving the proposed goals and summarises evidence of outcomes.

### Improving the scientific rigour of nutritional recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes: a comprehensive review of the American diabetes association guideline-recommended eating patterns [^116zsgLg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Clinical practice guidelines are not new, but they are growing in number. A modern definition of clinical practice guidelines was set forth in 1992 by the Institute of Medicine and updated in 2011: "Clinical practice guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options". 1 Rising alongside the number of clinical practice guidelines are concerns about the process behind their creation. To ensure that guidelines affecting clinical care are created using the most rigorous and unbiased methods possible, multiple organizations have issued standards for evaluating scientific evidence when creating guidelines (Table S1). Despite the availability of standards to improve the development of clinical practice guidelines, there is still wide concern among the scientific community that even the most well‐respected guidelines lack sufficient rigour. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Over half of adults in the United States now have type 2 diabetes (T2D) or prediabetes, 7 and worse, this multifactorial epidemic is now worldwide and shows no signs of slowing, with rates of both T2D and T2D‐related health complications rising. 8 When advising people with T2D on food choices, many healthcare providers rely on nutrition guidelines provided by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and these guidelines influence standard recommendations made around the globe. 9, 10, 11 Given these alarming trends, it is of paramount importance to review the treatment guidelines to ensure they are based on rigorous, accepted scientific methods.

The ADA's approach to the evidence in developing its guidelines has been to employ a grading system to rate the strength of evidence. An "A" rating is given to well‐conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are adequately powered, as well as to meta‐analyses that incorporate quality ratings. "B" ratings are given to well‐conducted cohort studies, "C" ratings are for poorly controlled trials or uncontrolled studies, and a score of "E" is for expert consensus or clinical experience. This approach does not follow any of the widely accepted standards or "guidelines for guidelines" such as Agree II, GRADE, or those from the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (Table S1).

### Does a ketogenic diet have a place within diabetes clinical practice? Review of current evidence and controversies [^1163Nhpq]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Current Guidance for Diabetes Management

Multiple dietary approaches have been suggested to help people with diabetes to manage their glucose control. At present, UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines promote (which have not been updated since 2009) 'general healthy eating' for T2D management, encouraging high fibre, low-glycaemic index sources of carbohydrates and to limit saturated fat intake; the same advice as for the general population. Until recently, both Diabetes UK and American Diabetes Association (ADA) issued broad advice for diabetes management in individuals with T2D with the overarching aim to induce weight loss due to the lack of evidence-based dietary guidelines for diabetes management. Interestingly, this advice was also applicable to the 10% of individuals with T2D who are considered to be a healthy weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m²), in people with T1D and gestational diabetes as weight loss in these cohorts improves glycaemic control. This ambiguity has led to uncertainty amongst healthcare professionals with 'prescribing' a specific dietary type or pattern as a therapeutic approach for diabetes as a consensus has yet to be reached for the ideal dietary distribution for people with diabetes.

It can be argued that urgent revision of existing conventional dietary strategies to prevent and improve diabetes management is required, especially considering the continued increasing global prevalence of diabetes. Carbohydrate restriction is increasingly gaining acceptance for diabetes management within the UK and advocacy started to emerge with Diabetes UK in 2011 for individuals with T2D and websites such as Diabetes.co.uk, which established the Low Carb Programme, an evidence-based digital health intervention app launched in 2015 and supported by the UK National Health Service (NHS). This has driven the recognition of a low carbohydrate diet as a therapeutic approach in general practice for T2D management and remission. People with T2D completing the programme reported greater HbA1c improvements (− 9.1 mmol/mol versus 1.7 mmol/mol, P < 0.001) and a third of patients reduced usage of anti-diabetic medications. It is important to note, however, that this is a short-term (15-week) intervention and does not aim to induce nutritional ketosis.

Progress has been made in understanding the best dietary advice for diabetes but broader problems exist. For instance, increasing vegetable and fruit intake is recommended by most dietary guidelines but their cost is prohibitively high in many settings: the cost of two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables a day per individual (to fulfil the "5-a-day" guidance) accounted for 52%, 18%, 16%, and 2% of household income in low, low to middle, upper to middle, and high income countries, respectively. An expensive market of foods labelled for use by people with diabetes also exists, with products often being no healthier, and sometimes less healthy, than regular foods. After new European Union legislation, food regulations in some countries, including the UK, were updated as recently as July 2016 to ban such misleading labels. This is not the case elsewhere, however, and what will happen to such regulation after the UK leaves the European Union is unclear, which highlights the importance of the political environment.

### Commonalities among dietary recommendations from 2010 to 2021 clinical practice guidelines: a meta-epidemiological study from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^113fEop8]. Advances in Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Dietary recommendations across clinical practice guidelines — this meta-epidemiology study compared dietary and nutrition recommendations from CPGs published by global professional organizations for the promotion of health and the reduction of chronic diseases in patient populations, including the inclusion of 35 guidelines for CVD and related conditions in addition to > 10 guidelines for populations with diabetes and digestive conditions, with nearly all eligible CPGs from high-income and upper middle–income countries, limiting implications for low-income and lower middle–income countries. Most guidelines had strong methodology and reporting, but some lacked clarity on management of component intakes, funding, and supporting evidence for dietary recommendations, and a major limitation was the lack of detailed dietary recommendations, as serving sizes and proportion by weight were rarely outlined, so the study categorized intake as positive (include/increase) or negative (exclude/decrease/limit). The reviewed guidelines were closely aligned in their dietary recommendations for daily intake of plant sources of food (especially fruit, vegetables, and whole grains), with limited consumption of alcohol and salt or sodium, and based on the current evidence, clinicians should feel confident making these recommendations in accordance with their respective practice guidelines; to improve rigor and trustworthiness, future guideline developers should follow published standards for methodology and reporting.

### Improving the scientific rigour of nutritional recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes: a comprehensive review of the American diabetes association guideline-recommended eating patterns [^113g69px]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Several concerns prompted our review of the evidence cited by the ADA in support of its recommendations for eating patterns in the management of T2D: (a) a strong reliance by the ADA on sources that they rate as B, C and E 12, 13; (b) the failure to conduct a systematic review to inform source selection; (c) the exclusion of studies that could have been considered; (d) the lack of explanation of how the ADA selected and reviewed cited studies or how the experts weighed various endpoints in forming their opinion; and (e) the possibility of bias.

We conducted a review of the sources cited for currently recommended eating patterns in the ADA's Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (Table 1) (2018 and 2019 standards), 12, 14 and the ADA's Nutrition Therapy Recommendations for Adults with Diabetes (2014 recommendations), 13 which helped inform the 2018 standards. In addition, a comprehensive search was conducted to identify any studies that would have been appropriate to include in a rigorous review. The review considers the strength of the evidence but does not assign a grade to each study.

After this review was initially conducted, the ADA published their 2019 standards. 14 In this new document, low‐carbohydrate diet was endorsed as a recommended eating pattern (new in 2019), with specific acknowledgment of the evidence for antiglycaemic medication reduction in people with T2D who adhere to a low‐carbohydrate diet. The present updated review includes all new citations from the 2019 ADA standards.

One aspect of weight management that is often overlooked is that of personal choice and despite recommendations that dietary advice should be culturally acceptable, affordable and tailored to the individual, the personal view of the health professionals commonly underpins advice. This can be illustrated by the recent controversy about low carbohydrate diets, where academics and health professionals alike have opposing views; some are recommending healthy eating and others are proposing that low carbohydrate diets should be the default strategy for those with type 2 diabetes. In these debates, the views of the person with diabetes are rarely heard, despite calls for patient-centred care (PCC).

Why dietary management matters but is difficult to implement

Diabetes is one of the biggest global public health problems: the prevalence is estimated to increase from 425 million people in 2017 to 629 million by 2045, with linked health, social, and economic costs. Urgent solutions for slowing, or even reversing, this trend are needed, especially from investment in modifiable factors including diet, physical activity, and weight. Diet is a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide according to the Global Burden of Disease Study carried out in 188 countries. The importance of nutrition in the management and prevention of type 2 diabetes through its effect on weight and metabolic control is clear. However, nutrition is also one of the most controversial and difficult aspects of the management of type 2 diabetes.

The idea of being on a "diet" for a chronic lifelong condition like diabetes is enough to put many people off as knowing what to eat and maintaining an optimal eating pattern are challenging. Medical nutrition therapy was introduced to guide a systematic and evidence based approach to the management of diabetes through diet, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated, but difficulties remain. Although most diabetes guidelines recommend starting pharmacotherapy only after first making nutritional and physical activity lifestyle changes, this is not always followed in practice globally. Most physicians are not trained in nutrition interventions and this is a barrier to counselling patients. Moreover, talking to patients about nutrition is time consuming. In many settings, outside of specialised diabetes centres where trained nutritionists/educators are available, advice on nutrition for diabetes is, at best, a printed menu given to the patient. In resource poor settings, when type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, often the patient leaves the clinic with a list of new medications and little else. There is wide variation in the use of dietary modification alone to manage type 2 diabetes: for instance, estimates of fewer than 5–10% of patients with type 2 diabetes in Indiaand 31% in the UK are reported, although patients treated by lifestyle measures may be less closely managed than patients on medication for type 2 diabetes. Although systems are usually in place to record and monitor process measures for diabetes care in medical records, dietary information is often neglected, even though at least modest attention to diet is needed to achieve adequate glycaemic control. Family doctors and hospital clinics should collect this information routinely but how to do this is a challenge.

Introduction

There is a wealth of evidence demonstrating that dietary interventions are effective for the management of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, for the prevention of type 2 diabetes, and there is now emerging evidence for the remission of type 2 diabetes. Traditionally, it is recommended that nutritional advice is delivered by registered dietitians, and although there is evidence that dietitian-led interventions are more effective than those without input from dietitians, both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and Diabetes UK recognise that other health professionals have a role in delivering dietary advice, ideally guided by a registered dietitian. However, access to registered dietitians is limited, and a survey in the UK in 2002 reported that the level of dietetic support for those with diabetes was dramatically lower than recommendations, and had not increased since a survey conducted 5 years previously.

The current recommended gold standard of care is to deliver dietary advice as part of intensive multicomponent lifestyle programmes, and this is endorsed by both international and national bodies. However, in the UK for example, despite the fact that structured education was offered to 50% of those with type 1 diabetes and 90% of those with type 2 diabetes in 2015–2016, only 5–10% attended education programmes. In many areas of the world, there are no dietitians or education programmes available, and where there are, limited uptake and restricted access to these facilities mean that people with diabetes rely on their primary healthcare provider for dietary advice. Unfortunately, primary healthcare professionals have little training in delivering dietary advice to people with diabetes. Nutrition and lifestyle education for physicians is insufficient and more than 75% report that they are inadequately trained to counsel their patients on diet and physical activity. Nurses are often required to deliver dietary advice, but there is evidence that they have inadequate knowledge and skills to improve outcomes. This lack of professional support for people with diabetes is illustrated by data from the Helpline at Diabetes UK, where approximately 70% of the 20,000 calls received annually are diet-related queries.

This article aims to offer a practical guide for health professionals who deliver dietary information to people with diabetes.

### Personalized versus non-personalized nutritional recommendations / interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus remission: a narrative review [^1133GrAS]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

It is a well-evidenced fact that diet significantly impacts type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevention and management. However, dietary responses vary among different populations, necessitating personalized recommendations. Substantial evidence supports the role of diet in T2DM remission, particularly low-energy or low-carbohydrate diets that facilitate weight loss, enhance glycemic control, and achieve remission. This review aims to comprehensively analyze and compare personalized nutritional interventions with non-personalized approaches in T2DM remission. We conducted a literature search using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics guidelines, focusing on clinical and observational trials published within the past decade. We present the strengths and drawbacks of incorporating personalized nutrition into practice, along with the areas for research in implementing personalized interventions, such as cost-effectiveness and accessibility. The findings reveal consistently higher diabetes remission rates in personalized nutrition studies compared to non-personalized interventions.

4 SUMMARY

Treatment guidelines must be based on rigorous scientific standards that are consistently applied in order to ensure that guidelines are both reliable and credible. In reviewing the evidence cited in support of the ADA recommendations on eating patterns for T2D management, we found multiple reasons for concern. Although the ADA does provide a rubric for grading studies to include in its evidence review, not apparent in the 2018 or 2019 standards or the 2014 recommendations is a description of the process used to guide final selection decisions. Perhaps that is the source of the issues we find concerning; for example, studies were cited as evidence that by the ADA's own rubric were not A‐rated sources or that were not conducted in people with T2D, were not clinical trials, or were not based on a systematic review of the evidence.

Our literature searches added considerably to the body of credible evidence worthy of consideration for a thorough review of the ADA recommendations on eating patterns. We found two additional studies to include on the DASH diet, 12 studies on the Mediterranean diet, nine on plant‐based diets, and 27 on low‐carbohydrate diets. Almost all of these additional studies were published prior to the documents reviewed in the present paper.

We would like to note several things in the ADA documents that could be interpreted as evidence of bias, one of which is the inclusion of opinion pieces or reviews favouring the DASH, plant‐based and Mediterranean eating patterns that were not based on a systematic approach to the literature. 22, 47, 48 Further, there seemed to be inconsistency in the ADA's determination of what constitutes sufficiently ample and rigorous evidence for its recommendations. For example, regarding glycaemic control, the ADA recommends the DASH diet on the basis of a single trial in T2D. For plant‐based diets, the ADA recommends on the basis of three trials and one follow‐up study, none of which showed superiority of the test diet over the control diet in HbA1c reduction 49, 51, 53, 54 and despite its conclusion that vegetarian and low‐fat vegan studies "did not consistently improve glycaemic control or CVD risk factors except when energy intake was restricted, and weight was lost". In contrast, the 2014 recommendations and both the 2018 and 2019 standards raise concerns about lack of sustainability with a low‐carbohydrate diet over the long term. While adherence is a common behaviour change problem, it is not unique to low‐carbohydrate diets, and the long‐term data on this approach are supportive.

5 CONCLUSION

In order to change the current global trajectory of T2D, it is imperative that health organizations be willing to invest resources in creating objective guidelines based on rigorous and unbiased scientific review. Guidance from the ADA is valuable on many fronts; however, the present review of the current standards and recommendations, specifically on recommended eating patterns, finds significant shortcomings regarding scientific review methodologies, which are likely to translate to suboptimal clinical care decisions for people with T2D.

### Precision nutrition for prevention and management of type 2 diabetes [^113uhigm]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Precision nutrition aims to prevent and manage chronic diseases by tailoring dietary interventions or recommendations to one or a combination of an individual's genetic background, metabolic profile, and environmental exposures. Recent advances in genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome technologies have offered opportunities as well as challenges in the use of precision nutrition to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes. Nutrigenomics studies have identified genetic variants that influence intake and metabolism of specific nutrients and predict individuals' variability in response to dietary interventions. Metabolomics has revealed metabolomic fingerprints of food and nutrient consumption and uncovered new metabolic pathways that are potentially modified by diet. Dietary interventions have been successful in altering abundance, composition, and activity of gut microbiota that are relevant for food metabolism and glycaemic control. In addition, mobile apps and wearable devices facilitate real-time assessment of dietary intake and provide feedback which can improve glycaemic control and diabetes management. By integrating these technologies with big data analytics, precision nutrition has the potential to provide personalised nutrition guidance for more effective prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Despite these technological advances, much research is needed before precision nutrition can be widely used in clinical and public health settings. Currently, the field of precision nutrition faces challenges including a lack of robust and reproducible results, the high cost of omics technologies, and methodological issues in study design as well as high-dimensional data analyses and interpretation. Evidence is needed to support the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and additional benefits of precision nutrition beyond traditional nutrition intervention approaches. Therefore, we should manage unrealistically high expectations and balance the emerging field of precision nutrition with public health nutrition strategies to improve diet quality and prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications.

### Macronutrients, food groups, and eating patterns in the management of diabetes: a systematic review of the literature, 2010 [^117JWeuS]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) in the management of diabetes has been well established. Previous reviews have provided comprehensive recommendations for MNT in the management of diabetes. The goals of MNT are to 1) attain and maintain optimal blood glucose levels, a lipid and lipoprotein profile that reduces the risk of macrovascular disease, and blood pressure levels that reduce the risk for vascular disease; 2) prevent and treat the chronic complications of diabetes by modifying nutrient intake and lifestyle; 3) address individual nutrition needs, taking into account personal and cultural preferences and willingness to change; and 4) maintain the pleasure of eating by only limiting food choices when indicated by scientific evidence.

The literature on nutrition as it relates to diabetes management is vast. We undertook the specific topic of the role of macronutrients, eating patterns, and individual foods in response to continued controversy over independent contributions of specific foods and macronutrients, independent of weight loss, in the management of diabetes. The position of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) on MNT is that each person with diabetes should receive an individualized eating plan. ADA has received numerous criticisms because it does not recommend one specific mix of macronutrients for everyone with diabetes. The previous literature review conducted by ADA in 2001 supported the idea that there was not one ideal macronutrient distribution for all people with diabetes. This review focuses on literature that has been published since that 2001 date. This systematic review will be one source of information considered when updating the current ADA Nutrition Position Statement. Other systematic reviews and key research studies that may not be included in this review will also be considered.

When attempting to tease out the role of macronutrients from other dietary and lifestyle factors, two critical components of MNT — energy balance and a healthful eating pattern — are not addressed. While both are critical components in the management of diabetes as well as the secondary prevention of complications and promotion of health, these topics are beyond the scope of this particular review. The following questions are addressed in this review:

What aspects of macronutrient quantity and quality impact glycemic control and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in people with diabetes?
How do macronutrients combine in whole foods and eating patterns to affect health in people with diabetes?
Is there an optimal macronutrient ratio for glycemic management and CVD risk reduction in people with diabetes?
What findings and needs should direct future research?

### Prevention and management of type 2 diabetes: dietary components and nutritional strategies [^1169vog3]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

In the past couple of decades, evidence from prospective observational studies and clinical trials has converged to support the importance of individual nutrients, foods, and dietary patterns in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. The quality of dietary fats and carbohydrates consumed is more crucial than is the quantity of these macronutrients. Diets rich in wholegrains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts; moderate in alcohol consumption; and lower in refined grains, red or processed meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages have been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes and improve glycaemic control and blood lipids in patients with diabetes. With an emphasis on overall diet quality, several dietary patterns such as Mediterranean, low glycaemic index, moderately low carbohydrate, and vegetarian diets can be tailored to personal and cultural food preferences and appropriate calorie needs for weight control and diabetes prevention and management. Although much progress has been made in development and implementation of evidence-based nutrition recommendations in developed countries, concerted worldwide efforts and policies are warranted to alleviate regional disparities.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present review includes studies newly cited in the 2019 standards (Tables S2–S5), as well as sources cited in the 2014 recommendations and the 2018 standards (Table S7).

First, we sought to determine if each ADA‐cited study was appropriate for inclusion in the guidelines. Studies were deemed appropriate if: (a) they were a clinical trial, a systematic review, or a systematic review with meta‐analysis of clinical trials; (b) they involved people with T2D; (c) they had a study arm that followed one of the three eating patterns recommended by the 2018 standards or a low‐carbohydrate diet (low‐carbohydrate studies should specifically address quantity of carbohydrates); (d) their reported outcomes included glycaemic control; (e) their outcomes were reported separately for people with T2D if there was a T2D subgroup within a larger trial. Adherence to these criteria helps ensure that each included study belongs in the evidence base supporting the "cornerstone" of T2D management, which the ADA defines as metabolic control. The exclusion of prospective studies from our criteria was based on the judgement that such studies, while perhaps appropriate for T2D prevention guidelines, are not appropriate as a basis for treatment guidelines because they do not test a specific therapeutic intervention. In our review, we considered glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) to be the primary biomarker for glycaemic control; fasting blood glucose (FBG) was considered if HbA1c data were not available. We also reported outcome data on lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure and body weight, as these biomarkers are relevant for assessing overall cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk status, a critical component of T2D management.

### Nutrition therapy recommendations for the management of adults with diabetes [^112UxW6C]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

There is no standard meal plan or eating pattern that works universally for all people with diabetes. In order to be effective, nutrition therapy should be individualized for each patient/client based on his or her individual health goals; personal and cultural preferences; health literacy and numeracy; access to healthful choices; and readiness, willingness, and ability to change. Nutrition interventions should emphasize a variety of minimally processed nutrient dense foods in appropriate portion sizes as part of a healthful eating pattern and provide the individual with diabetes with practical tools for day-to-day food plan and behavior change that can be maintained over the long term.

### The effects of popular diets on type 2 diabetes management [^113LBFLJ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes can be managed with the use of diabetes self-management skills. Diet and exercise are essential segments of the lifestyle changes necessary for diabetes management. However, diet recommendations can be complicated in a world full of different diets. This review aims to evaluate the evidence on the effects of three popular diets geared towards diabetes management: low-carbohydrate and ketogenic diet, vegan diet, and the Mediterranean diet. While all three diets have been shown to assist in improving glycaemic control and weight loss, patient adherence, acceptability, and long-term manageability play essential roles in the efficacy of each diet.

### The implementation of nutritional advice for people with diabetes [^111yph5M]. Diabetic Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

These consensus-based recommendations emphasize the practical implementation of nutritional advice for people with diabetes, and describe the provision of services required to provide the information. Important changes from previous recommendations include greater flexibility in the proportions of energy derived from carbohydrate and monounsaturated fat, further liberalization in the consumption of sucrose, more active promotion of foods with a low glycaemic index, and greater emphasis on the provision of nutritional advice in the context of wider lifestyle changes, particularly physical activity. Monounsaturated fats are now promoted as the main source of dietary fat because of their lower susceptibility to lipid peroxidation and consequent lower atherogenic potential. Consumption of sucrose for patients who are not overweight can be increased up to 10% of daily energy provided that this is eaten in the context of a healthy diet and distributed throughout the day. Evidence is presented for the effectiveness of advice provided by trained dieticians. The increasing evidence for the importance of good metabolic control and the growing requirement for measures to prevent Type 2 diabetes in an increasingly obese population will require major expansion of dietetic services if the standards in National Service Frameworks are to be successfully implemented.

### Dietary interventions to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with a goal of remission: an expert consensus statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^114FL8dV]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes remission — expert panel conclusions and limitations: A diverse panel agreed upon substantial aspects of using a WFPB dietary intervention to achieve remission and generated a robust list of 130 consensus statement topics, many of which achieved full consensus during the iterative Delphi process; these statements should help clinicians who manage adults with T2D in reaching shared decisions, but the consensus statements are not intended as "recommendations" for action. The panel acknowledged that guidance on how to promote and sustain remission using diet as a primary intervention was beyond the scope. Potential bias was noted because panelists self-reported that their diets, on average, consisted of 89% plant-based foods, ranging from 50% to 100%, with most food choices whole or minimally processed. Identified research needs include assessing whether remission can be obtained with ad libitum food intake during a WFPB diet and the ongoing need for additional randomized controlled trials to assess sustainable plant-based dietary interventions with whole or minimally processed foods.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114t7CKq]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Dietary interventions and programs — High levels of physical activity (200–300 min/week) are emphasized for weight management. Some commercial and proprietary weight loss programs have shown promising weight loss results; however, results vary across programs, most lack evidence of effectiveness, many do not satisfy guideline recommendations, and some promote unscientific and possibly dangerous practices. Structured, very-low-calorie eating patterns, typically 800–1,000 kcal/day, may increase the pace and/or magnitude of initial weight loss and glycemic improvement compared with standard behavioral interventions, but such intensive nutritional interventions should be provided only by trained and experienced professionals in medical settings with close ongoing monitoring and integration with behavioral support and counseling, and only for a short term (generally up to 3 months). Due to the high risk of complications, such intensive interventions should be prescribed only to carefully selected individuals.

### Dietary advice for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults [^1172gpCX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

While initial dietary management immediately after formal diagnosis is an 'accepted' cornerstone of treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a formal and systematic overview of its efficacy and method of delivery is not currently available.

Objectives

To assess the effect of type and frequency of different types of dietary advice to all adults with type 2 diabetes on weight, measures of diabetic control, morbidity, total mortality and quality of life.

Search Strategy

We carried out a comprehensive search of The Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to October Week 1, 2003), EMBASE (1980 to Week 40, 2003), CINAHL (1982 to October Week 1, 2003), AMED (1985 to October 2003), bibliographies and contacted relevant experts.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials, of six months or longer, in which dietary advice was the main intervention in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Data Collection and Analysis

The lead investigator performed all data extraction and quality scoring with duplication being carried out by one of the other six investigators independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion and consensus. Authors were contacted for missing data. For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred to change data.

Main Results

Thirty-six articles reporting a total of eighteen trials following 1467 participants were included. Dietary approaches assessed in this review were low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, high-fat/low-carbohydrate diets, low-calorie (1000 kcal per day) and very-low-calorie (500 kcal per day) diets and modified fat diets. Two trials compared the American Diabetes Association exchange diet with a standard reduced fat diet and five studies assessed low-fat diets versus moderate fat or low-carbohydrate diets. Two studies assessed the effect of a very-low-calorie diet versus a low-calorie diet. Six studies compared dietary advice with dietary advice plus exercise and three other studies assessed dietary advice versus dietary advice plus behavioural approaches. The studies all measured weight and measures of glycaemic control although not all studies reported these in the articles published. Other outcomes which were measured in these studies included mortality, blood pressure, serum cholesterol (including LDL and HDL cholesterol), serum triglycerides, maximal exercise capacity and compliance. The results suggest that adoption of regular exercise is a good way to promote better glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients, however all of these studies were at high risk of bias.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There are no high quality data on the efficacy of the dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes, however the data available indicate that the adoption of exercise appears to improve glycated haemoglobin at six and twelve months in people with type 2 diabetes. There is an urgent need for well-designed studies which examine a range of interventions, at various points during follow-up, although there is a promising study currently underway.

3.2.3 Summary of evidence

The ADA‐cited sources combined with additional ones identified through our search resulted in a total of seven RCTs, two follow‐up RCT studies, and seven systematic reviews (including five with meta‐analysis) that are appropriate for consideration in developing nutrition guidelines for T2D. Among the included trials are several large‐scale studies, one with 3614 participants 26, 27 and one with more than 200 participants. 25, 33, 34 Longer‐term studies include one lasting 12 months, 28 one lasting 24 months, 36 and two lasting longer than 4 years. 25, 26, 27, 33, 34

As recommended by the ADA guidelines, we found that the Mediterranean eating pattern has demonstrated effectiveness in improving glycaemic control 25, 28, 32, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 as well as CVD risk factors and even in reducing CVD events. 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, 30, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 This diet appears to be appropriately considered helpful for T2D management; its inclusion in the recommended eating patterns is warranted. However, questions remain about which components of the Mediterranean diet contribute to its effectiveness on all of these outcomes. Some studies suggest that it is the diet's more moderate carbohydrate content (< 50% total energy intake) that accounts for reductions in weight and CVD risk, 44 while others suggest that the high monounsaturated fat content in the diet plays an important role in improving insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control, and inflammation. 45, 46 Research in these areas will strengthen future nutritional recommendations and provide more in‐depth guidance on how the Mediterranean diet can be used for T2D management.

Clinical priorities for nutrition management for all people with diabetes

A wide range of diabetes meal planning approaches or eating patterns have been shown to be clinically effective, with many including a reduced energy intake component. There is not one ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrates, protein, or fat that is optimal for all people with diabetes. Nutrition therapy goals should be developed collaboratively with the individual with diabetes and be based on an assessment of the individual's current eating patterns, preferences, and metabolic goals. Once a thorough assessment is completed, the health care professional's role is to facilitate behavior change and achievement of metabolic goals while meeting the patient's preferences, which may include allowing the patient to continue following his/her current eating pattern. If the individual would like to try a different eating pattern, this should also be supported by the health care team. Various behavior change theories and strategies can be used to tailor nutrition interventions to help the client achieve specific health and quality-of-life outcomes.

Multiple meal planning approaches and eating patterns can be effective for achieving metabolic goals. Examples include: carbohydrate counting, healthful food choices/simplified meal plans (i.e. the Plate Method), individualized meal planning methods based on percentages of macronutrients, exchange list for meal planning, glycemic index, and eating patterns including Mediterranean style, DASH, vegetarian or vegan, low carbohydrate, and low fat. The meal planning approach or eating pattern should be selected based on the individual's personal and cultural preferences; literacy and numeracy; and readiness, willingness, and ability to change. This may need to be adjusted over time based on changes in life circumstances, preferences, and disease course.

### "Once I take that one bite": the consideration of harm reduction as a strategy to support dietary change for patients with diabetes [^1164Pbhm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2020, the Centers for Disease Control reported 34.2 million Americans, 10.5% of the population, have diabetes mellitus and 88 million (34.5%) have prediabetes. The American Diabetes Association reported that the total cost to treat diabetes was $327 billion, a 26% increase from 2012 to 2017. Despite existence of evidence-based treatments for diabetes, many people continue to struggle with diabetes management, with diet-related issues reported as one of the most prevalent difficulties related to diabetes management.

Recommendations for people with diabetes to adopt healthier lifestyles, particularly around diet, are predicated on the assumption that people have the ability and freedom to make "healthier" choices. Furthermore, these recommendations often assume that everyone is in the same state of readiness to make substantial sustained lifestyle changes. Literature suggests many reasons that patients with diabetes have difficulty adhering to treatment plans regarding their diet including self-discipline, deficit of knowledge (i.e. understanding what they should eat, why, and how), coping with everyday stress, negotiating with family members, and managing the social significance of food. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials conducted from 1975 to 2015 that looked at interventions used to change diet and physical behaviors of people with type 2 diabetes concluded clinically significant changes could be attained for up to 6 months, but they were not sustained at 12 and 24 months. While underlying biological causes of obesity and appetite regulation certainly impact individuals' diabetes outcomes, this review identified other important factors that influence participants' ability to improve or sustain hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels including attempts to change multiple behaviors simultaneously versus changing behaviors individually, the sequential order interventions were attempted, and a consideration of which interventions were uniquely best suited for an individual. These studies suggest that further work is needed to develop patient-centered approaches to enable more sustained dietary change.

### Dietary fat and diabetes: a consensus view [^113vz268]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There may be no area in nutrition more controversial or subject to more changes in policy than dietary fat recommendations for individuals with diabetes. At one extreme, diets very low in carbohydrates with very high levels of fat were advocated in the early days of diabetes therapy. At the other extreme, the literature in the late 1980s and early 1990s emphasized diets very low in fat and high in carbohydrates. This conference has shown that too much information is missing for a definitive recommendation to be made concerning diet composition for diabetic individuals, but it also has led to the realization that we may now have considerable flexibility in our dietary recommendations for individuals with diabetes.

Introduction

Improved nutrition is critical to preventing and managing type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) notes that, while diet alone may not be sufficient to manage type 2 diabetes, it is an 'important component' of care. The current dietary recommendations for those with diabetes are similar to the general population, emphasizing nutrient-dense foods and healthful dietary patterns. The 2020 ADA recommendations encourage consuming non-starchy vegetables, minimizing refined grains and added sugars, and consuming whole foods rather than highly processed ones. While there is no ideal target for macronutrient ratios among those with diabetes, reducing total carbohydrate intake may improve glycemia.

It has been well established that US adults (regardless of diabetes status) do not meet US dietary guidelines (including the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Heart Association targets). It remains unclear, however, whether dietary intakes differ by diabetes status, and whether there are differences in intake by hemoglobin A1c. An analysis of cross-sectional data from China found some small but statistically significant differences in the diets of those with and without type 1 diabetes, but did not examine those with type 2 diabetes. Further understanding of the differences, or lack thereof, in the dietary intake of US adults with and without diabetes could inform dietary recommendations, nutrition interventions, and broader food policies aimed at improving the diet of those with diabetes.

The objective of this paper is to compare dietary intakes of key macronutrients and micronutrients that impact cardiometabolic disease of US adults with and without diabetes and across the spectrum of diabetes. We analyzed both energy-adjusted and absolute intake using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)-What We Eat in America (NHANES-WWEIA) cycles from 2013 to 2016.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to dietary modifications (eating patterns), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to offer individualized meal plans keeping nutrient quality, total calories, and metabolic goals in mind for diabetes prevention and management of patients with prediabetes or diabetes,

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^1132jRiU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: we recommend modifying the dietary habits and adapting the novel proven dietary interventions like medical nutritional therapy for the management of T2DM and CVD (Grade A)

The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial was one of the major trials that evaluated benefits of lifestyle intervention. The study proved no direct benefits of intense lifestyle interventions (dietary restrictions, weight loss, etc.) on the CV mortality. The benefits observed with this study were mostly on glycemic control.

For a strict control of T2DM and its subsequent impact on the CV risk, it is important to look into the glycaemic index (GI = blood glucose response 2 h after intake of 100 g of food ÷ blood glucose response on intake of 100 g glucose) and glycaemic load (GL = carbohydrate content of the item × its GI ÷ 100) of an individual food item. Multiple studies have concluded the beneficial effects of diet with low GI (< 55) on the improvement of T2DM and its complications. Diets with low GL (≤ 10) have also shown benefits in managing T2DM and reducing complications in several studies. Patients with CVDs are advised to reduce the saturated fats intake and improve the mono-unsaturated fat intake to prevent or ameliorate further worsening of the condition.

The novel dietary interventions such as medical nutritional therapy (MNT) mainly target management of blood glucose and CV risk factors by reducing the risk for diabetes-related complications and optimal co-ordination of dietary intake with pharmacological therapies to achieve a favourable outcome. Two basic aspects of MNT include dietary quality and energy restriction. Strategies directed at both dimensions can improve glycaemic control.

MNT not only aims to control blood glucose, but also to improve other co-morbidities such as dyslipidaemia, obesity, and hypertension. MNT can be utilised as a primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention measure in T2DM. Primary prevention measures of MNT are by modifying diets in high-risk individuals (such as pre-diabetes, central obesity etc.) to prolong or prevent the onset of T2DM. Secondary prevention measures aim to achieve tight glycaemic control by dietary modification; in turn, reducing diabetic complications in patients with T2DM. Tertiary prevention measures are to manage diabetes-related complications such as CVDs or renal diseases in those with T2DM. Likewise, patients at risk or history of CVD can also prevent further consequences by modifying diet to one of the four diet patterns that have been evidently proven to be effective in such cases: low fat diet, low carbohydrate diet, Mediterranean diet, and DASH diet (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet).

3.1.3 Summary of evidence

To our knowledge, clinical research on the DASH diet that provides outcomes for people with T2D consists of two RCTs, of 4 and 8 weeks' duration, and a post hoc analysis. 15, 23, 24 Only one of the two trials showed glycaemic improvement that can be attributed to the DASH diet alone. According to our evaluation, the other cited sources provide limited to no support for the DASH diet for people with T2D in improving glycaemic control for the reasons already cited: these studies were not clinical trials or systematic reviews, or did not provide outcomes data for people with T2D. While evidence shows that the DASH diet reduces blood pressure, primarily in people without diabetes, the lack of evidence for glycaemic control does not support a recommendation for DASH as a healthy eating pattern for the management of T2D. Additionally, as can be seen in the other eating pattern sections, a decrease in blood pressure (critical for CVD risk management) can be achieved with other eating patterns with more robust glycaemic control data. To corroborate the current ADA recommendation for the DASH diet in management of T2D, more research is needed to closely evaluate the diet in those with T2D; particularly needed is research on glycaemic control and CVD risk factors as study endpoints.

3.2 Mediterranean diet

3.2.1 Cited evidence

The ADA documents cite six studies, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 including three RCTs of longer duration, 25, 26, 27, 28 to support claims that a Mediterranean diet can improve glycaemic control and CVD risk factors and is therefore a healthy eating pattern for people with T2D (Table S7). Two RCTs found that the Mediterranean diet was superior to comparison diets 25, 28: one found that a low‐carbohydrate Mediterranean diet resulted in a significantly greater HbA1c reduction compared to the control diet, 28 and the other found at 4‐year follow‐up that the Mediterranean diet resulted in significant HbA1c reduction, sustained improvements in triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, and less medication initiation in people with newly diagnosed T2D. 25 A third RCT, 26 for which data were reanalysed with essentially the same results in 2018, 27 reported a significant reduction of major cardiovascular events in both versions of the Mediterranean diet studied, compared with the control. Two systematic reviews 29, 30 found limited evidence that the Mediterranean diet is effective for glycaemic control, but more robust support for CVD risk reduction. Also cited was a commentary favouring the Mediterranean diet that was based on a non‐systematic selection of articles. 31

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^116RcBnG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — dietary protein restriction in diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1 to 4: Management of diabetes and CKD should include nutritional intervention. A dietary protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day (about 10% of total calories), the recommended daily allowance (RDA), has been achieved in intervention studies and in 2 meta-analyses low-protein diets reduced risks of progression of albuminuria/proteinuria and loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The Work Group concluded that limiting dietary protein to the RDA level of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day should stabilize or reduce albuminuria, slow the decrease in GFR, and may prevent CKD stage 5; the current recommendation for dietary protein in diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4 represents an update to the diet recommended by the NKF-KDOQI CPGs for Hypertension and Antihypertensive Agents in CKD. In people with type 1 diabetes and stage 2 CKD, a modest limitation (0.89 versus 1.02 g/kg body weight per day) reduced the risk of CKD stage 5 or death (relative risk [RR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.72; P = 0.04).

### Sugars and starch in the nutritional management of diabetes mellitus [^117XZP3F]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Nutritional recommendations, long recognized as an important aspect of diabetes mellitus treatment, have also been an area of persistent controversy, particularly regarding the proportions and types of carbohydrate and fat. This review addresses the role of sugars within medical nutrition therapy for diabetes mellitus. Nutritional recommendations for diabetes mellitus treatment were revised recently. The new guidelines do not specifically restrict intake of sugars, although general recommendations are made for including fiber, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits within dietary selections containing starches. For carbohydrates, the principle focus is on overall caloric amounts. In type 1 diabetes the most effective approach to the control of postprandial hyperglycemia continues to be adjustment of premeal doses of insulin on the basis of carbohydrate counting. In type 2 diabetes, in addition to a focus on caloric content of carbohydrate, consideration continues to be given to the role of the glycemic index as a determinant of postprandial hyperglycemia and overall metabolic control. Nevertheless, consensus recommendations do not support widespread use of the glycemic index. An area of some change is a more clear endorsement of including monounsaturated fatty acids. Current recommendations are that monounsaturated fatty acids and carbohydrates combined should provide 60–70% of daily energy intake, with individual flexibility in the respective proportions, whereas intake of saturated fats is limited to < 10% of energy intake. This new emphasis reflects greater awareness of the importance of responding to individual and cultural dietary preferences and the need to address treatment of both hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in diabetes mellitus.

### Dietary patterns for weight and glycemic management in persons with type 1 diabetes: a meta-analysis of clinical trials [^111Q8Vvi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of macrovascular disease in youth and adults with type 1 diabetes is markedly elevated relative to individuals without diabetes. Mitigation of this risk is contingent upon the attainment of glycemic targets in tandem with the prevention of excess weight gain and traditional risk factors such as hypertension. Despite considerable advances in the development of diabetes technologies, a small proportion of youth and adults with type 1 diabetes meet glycemic and weight targets. Although medical nutrition therapy is a cornerstone of glycemic and weight management, a dearth of literature investigating dietary patterns in persons with type 1 diabetes poses a barrier to achieving clinical targets. Without robust scientific evidence, clinicians may feel ill-equipped to recommend diet approaches to persons with type 1 diabetes.

Emerging findings from precision medicine highlight the possibility of augmenting treatment success by tailoring therapies to population subgroups, rather than recommending a one-size-fits-all approach. In 2018, the Precision Medicine in Diabetes Initiative was launched by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes, with the first consensus report published in 2020. For the type 1 diabetes treatment group, initial efforts focused on the impact of diabetes technologies; however, several other areas of interest were identified, with medical nutrition therapy being a top priority. This aligned with a recent focus of the National Institutes of Health on precision nutrition, defined as the stratification of dietary recommendations by population subgroups. The most recent systematic review of diet patterns for type 1 and type 2 diabetes management included studies published through the year 2010 and included both observational and experimental evidence. Rapid advances in diabetes technology over the past decade have likely augmented the safety and feasibility of diet patterns for type 1 diabetes management, potentially limiting the generalizability of earlier research to contemporary populations. Accordingly, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize data from clinical trials published between January 2011 and June 2024 that investigated the effects of diet patterns on glycemia and/or weight in youth and adults with type 1 diabetes, with particular attention to subgroup analyses that indicate the need to tailor treatments according to individual characteristics.

3.4.2 Additional evidence

We identified 27 additional studies: 10 RCTs (nine new, one follow‐up), 12 non‐randomized trials (11 new, 1 follow‐up), and five systematic reviews with meta‐analysis. Of these 27 additional evidence sources, 20 were published in time for inclusion in the 2014 recommendations, and 21 were published prior to the 2018 standards (Table S5). All 27 studies reported outcomes data for people with T2D and thus were appropriate for consideration in the development of nutritional recommendations for T2D management. Of the 10 RCTs, all of which reported on glycaemic control, nine found that a low‐carbohydrate diet resulted in a significant change from baseline to end of study 86, 87, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, 96; six also found a superior between‐group reduction favouring the low‐carbohydrate diet. 86, 87, 90, 92, 94, 96 While some studies found that the control diet also improved glycaemic control significantly from baseline, none found the control diet superior to the low‐carbohydrate diet. All 12 single‐arm and non‐randomized trials found that a low‐carbohydrate diet significantly improved glycaemic control from baseline to end of study; the two studies that made between‐group comparisons found the low‐carbohydrate diet superior to the control diet. 99, 101 We identified eight longer‐term studies (1‐3 years' duration), 86, 88, 91, 93, 97, 98, 99, 105 of which five 86, 97, 98, 99, 105 found significant glycaemic benefit sustained with a low‐carbohydrate diet; these include two 2‐year trials 97, 105 and a 3‐year trial. 98 Another longer trial also found sustained improvement in glycaemic control at 44 weeks. 103 All of these studies assessed HbA1c as the primary glycaemic marker, 86, 88, 91, 93, 97, 98, 99, 103 except the study by Dashti et al, 105 which only reported FBG.

### Dietary patterns for weight and glycemic management in persons with type 1 diabetes: a meta-analysis of clinical trials [^115L2i8r]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Precision Nutrition: Future Integration With Published Society Guidelines

The ADA and ISPAD recommend individualized medical nutrition therapy as an essential aspect of treatment for individuals living with type 1 diabetes. The ADA's clinical practice guidelines (ie, Standards of Care in Diabetes) emphasize whole diet patterns that represent dietary intake more globally, as opposed to a reductionist view of macro- and micronutrients. The ADA's Standards of Care also underscore the importance of individualizing eating patterns to incorporate a variety of foods that reflect personal and cultural preferences, given that there is no one-size-fits-all eating pattern that works for all persons with diabetes. Thus, the existing guidelines emphasize nutrient quality independent of macronutrient intake, as well as the adequacy (eg, nonstarchy vegetables, whole grains, whole fruits, legumes, lean proteins) and moderation (eg, red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains, alcohol, foods high in sodium) of specific food groups. Nonetheless, evidence for stratifying recommendations to optimize health within population subgroups is lacking. The scant evidence base and lack of clinical practice guidelines addressing diet approaches for managing overweight and obesity in type 1 diabetes warrants particular attention. The ADA Standards of Medical Care focus exclusively on weight in the context of type 2 diabetes in the chapter titled Obesity and Weight Management. Our findings highlight that future research is urgently needed to rigorously examine the impact of dietary interventions on weight in those with type 1 diabetes, with particular attention to potential subgroups of interest. In the future, evaluating the effects of dietary interventions on clinical outcomes within specific subgroups, including by age (eg, in youth and older adults), type of insulin regimen, and weight status, will provide insight into the unique behavioral and metabolic factors that influence how diet patterns impact health outcomes in subgroups of persons with type 1 diabetes. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can help to determine whether other characteristics such as gut microbiome composition, genotype, and baseline diet impact behavioral or physiological responses to different diets.

Lifestyle.

Interventions designed to impact an individual's physical activity levels and food intake are critical parts of type 2 diabetes management. All patients should receive standardized general diabetes education (individual or group, preferably using an approved curriculum), with a specific focus on dietary interventions and the importance of increasing physical activity. While encouraging therapeutic lifestyle change is important at diagnosis, periodic counseling should also be integrated into the treatment program.

Weight reduction, achieved through dietary means alone or with adjunctive medical or surgical intervention, improves glycemic control and other cardiovascular risk factors. Modest weight loss (5–10%) contributes meaningfully to achieving improved glucose control. Accordingly, establishing a goal of weight reduction, or at least weight maintenance, is recommended.

Dietary advice must be personalized. Patients should be encouraged to eat healthy foods that are consistent with the prevailing population-wide dietary recommendations and with an individual's preferences and culture. Foods high in fiber (such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes), low-fat dairy products, and fresh fish should be emphasized. High-energy foods, including those rich in saturated fats, and sweet desserts and snacks should be eaten less frequently and in lower amounts. Patients who eventually lose and keep weight off usually do so after numerous cycles of weight loss and relapse. The health care team should remain nonjudgmental but persistent, revisiting and encouraging therapeutic lifestyle changes frequently, if needed.

As much physical activity as possible should be promoted, ideally aiming for at least 150 min/week of moderate activity including aerobic, resistance, and flexibility training. In older individuals, or those with mobility challenges, so long as tolerated from a cardiovascular standpoint, any increase in activity level is advantageous.

At diagnosis, highly motivated patients with HbA 1c already near target (e.g. < 7.5%) could be given the opportunity to engage in lifestyle change for a period of 3–6 months before embarking on pharmacotherapy (usually metformin). Those with moderate hyperglycemia or in whom lifestyle changes are anticipated to be unsuccessful should be promptly started on an antihyperglycemic agent (also usually metformin) at diagnosis, which can later be modified or possibly discontinued if lifestyle changes are successful.

### High-protein low-carbohydrate diets: what is the rationale? [^11396RHV]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Dietary recommendations released by the large majority of international scientific committees and organizations suggest that the diet for the prevention and treatment of the most compelling health problems of our societies (obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases and cancer) should be a diet moderately low in caloric content, low in fat content (particularly in saturated fat), poor in total cholesterol and rich in fibre. Despite this uniformity in official recommendations, alternative diets with low carbohydrate and high protein content continue to be extremely popular within consumers and patients. Recently, new studies seem to suggest that high-protein low-carbohydrate diets may have particularly positive effects on reducing body weight and other risk factors for heart disease. Gannon and Nuttall conducted direct comparisons of high-protein low-carbohydrate diets compared with high-carbohydrate low-protein diets in subjects with type 2 diabetes. They found that high-protein low-carbohydrate diets reduced fasting plasma glucose, 24-h glucose area under the curve and haemoglobin A(1c). On the basis of these results, a joint committee of the American Diabetes Association, North American Society for the Study of Obesity and the American Society for Clinical Nutrition suggested that a low-carbohydrate diet may be preferred to a low-fat diet for the induction of weight loss and glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes. What is the rationale? What mechanisms are involved?

### Improving the scientific rigour of nutritional recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes: a comprehensive review of the American diabetes association guideline-recommended eating patterns [^113qMzHQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors of the ADA guideline documents, in their evaluation of a low‐carbohydrate eating pattern, raise concerns about the quality of evidence that they do not apply to other dietary patterns. For example, regarding low‐carbohydrate diets, the 2014 recommendations state, "many of the studies were small, were of short duration, and/or had low retention rates". However, these issues could apply to plant‐based and DASH eating patterns as well. Another concern, raised in the 2018 standards, is that there is "not a standard definition" of low‐carbohydrate diets. While we agree that this is important, the issue — which essentially centres on the question of what an efficaciously low‐carbohydrate intake level is — can be evaluated within the currently available literature. This approach was used in the meta‐analysis by Snorgaard et al in 2017, which showed that the lower the actual percentage of daily calories consumed as carbohydrate (as reported by research participants), the greater the glycaemic control achieved. 79 One of the key limitations observed in most studies on low‐carbohydrate diet is the discrepancy between the prescribed and actual carbohydrate intake. Most participants end up consuming more carbohydrate at the end of the intervention than was prescribed, probably affecting the outcome. This is a limitation that can be seen with any dietary intervention for which the prescribed diet and the diet actually consumed tend to be very different. Another limitation is how many of the glycaemic control improvements were attributable to the specific dietary intervention and how many were attributable to the weight loss alone. This is an issue with any of the dietary patterns that resulted in weight loss and is an important area of future research.

### Navigating the spectrum of 4 evidence-based nutrition options for type 2 diabetes management [^114Xp2Ab]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex, pervasive disease that creates a health and financial burden. The goal is to head off progression to insulin requirement, and dietary changes have been recognized as a first-line intervention in the treatment protocol. Four evidence-based nutritional options are reviewed and their benefits for metabolic consequences.

Evidence Acquisition

We conducted a comprehensive search of relevant literature using the PubMed database for recent systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and original research articles.

Evidence Synthesis

The Mediterranean and plant-based diets have demonstrated benefits for the prevention and treatment of diabetes, weight reduction, lipid improvements, and overall cardiovascular risk reduction. A low carbohydrate diet is another viable option for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction, though it is not as uniformly defined and is difficult to maintain long term. The ketogenic diet is similarly very restrictive and produces significant HbA1c reductions.

Conclusion

Type 2 diabetes prevention and treatment is crucial in this widespread disease. The first-line treatment is lifestyle modifications with dietary interventions being at the forefront. With a unique clinical model and a variety of dietary options, our program strives for individualized evidence-based care. Nutritional modifications are the best initial approaches to overcoming insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. All dietary modifications, like any medical intervention, require education on benefits vs risks.

Medical nutrition therapy — For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, we suggest a Mediterranean style diet to improve glycemic control, body weight, and hypertension. We suggest a nutrition intervention strategy providing 13–50% of their total daily caloric intake from carbohydrates for diabetes management. We suggest a vegetarian dietary pattern for glycemic control and weight loss, and we suggest against intermittent fasting.

### Improving the scientific rigour of nutritional recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes: a comprehensive review of the American diabetes association guideline-recommended eating patterns [^111zec3Z]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Our review is based only on studies in which glycaemic control in people with T2D is an endpoint, because of its central importance to T2D management. The aim has been to produce a review and presentation (Tables S1 and S2) of a more complete body of evidence that is objective, fair and easily accessible to most readers and may prove useful in the creation of future iterations of the ADA guidelines.

Another section of the ADA guidelines on HbA1c target guidance was recently reviewed and assessed by the American College of Physicians when they issued new HbA1c target guidance. Using the Agree II instrument for evaluation, the American College gave a score of 3.7 out of 7 for the ADA guidelines, the second‐lowest of six guidelines scored. Additionally, the ADA guidelines scored significantly lower than all others in "rigor of development". Table S6 provides our assessment of the ADA guidelines using the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust evaluation method, along with recommended steps for improving the overall process. Additionally, another review evaluated the evidence for CVD prevention in the 2016 edition of the Standards of Care. 4 The prior two and current reviews of separate sections of the ADA guidelines all raise the same underlying concern regarding the rigour of the guideline development process. Given this, we believe our review is a critically important document that reinforces the need for a process change.

### Effect of a ketogenic diet versus mediterranean diet on glycated hemoglobin in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the interventional keto-med randomized crossover trial [^116uGPYU]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Consensus has not been reached on what constitutes an optimal diet in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In 2018–2019, both Diabetes UK and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) released nutrition guidelines for preventing and managing diabetes, endorsing an individualized approach and agreeing on several key nutrition recommendations, including: 1) incorporating nonstarchy vegetables; and 2) minimizing added sugars and refined grains. Diabetes UK also emphasized considering food patterns over macronutrient composition and gave the highest rating for the Mediterranean diet for patients with and at risk for T2DM. In contrast, the ADA did not recommend a specific, single dietary pattern, but recommended several, including the Mediterranean diet and low-carbohydrate (low-carb) and very low-carb diets. In addition, for the first time, the ADA suggested reducing overall carbohydrate intake to decrease blood glucose levels and noted that in select adults with T2DM, low- or very low-carb eating patterns were viable approaches.

### Type 2 diabetes remission and lifestyle medicine: a position statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^116idsrB]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes remission — lifestyle intervention recommendations emphasize that "Adequate research exists demonstrating that T2D remission is achievable without pharmacologic interventions or surgery", and that "we recommend that T2D remission by intensive lifestyle change be the primary modality for T2D care". The statement identifies dietary strategy preference: "The dietary intervention used by the authors indicates that a therapeutically dosed WFPB is the preferred intervention", supported by the observation that "sufficiently intensive lifestyle interventions consistently produce partial or complete remission in a significant proportion of patients". Medication management during transition is addressed: "We also recommend that existing pharmaceutical therapies not be abandoned prematurely, but continue to be utilized to achieve and maintain optimal blood sugar control, with the goal of reducing and eliminating these measures as soon as possible" as lifestyle measures are applied.

### Commonalities among dietary recommendations from 2010 to 2021 clinical practice guidelines: a meta-epidemiological study from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^1129Tuvj]. Advances in Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Dietary recommendations across clinical practice guidelines — study objectives, scope, and methods — are outlined, stating the primary objective was to conduct a meta-epidemiologic study (with guidelines as the unit of analysis) comparing dietary recommendations from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) developed by governments, major medical professional societies, and large health stakeholder associations for adults with prespecified chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease [CVD], type 2 diabetes [T2D], cancer, autoimmune diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, digestive diseases, and weight-related conditions). Primary dietary outcomes were dietary patterns, food groups, and food components, with secondary outcomes of macronutrient and micronutrient recommendations, and the report includes an assessment of dietary messaging consistency across CPGs; it did not assess the evidence used to develop CPGs or formally evaluate aspects such as guideline group composition or grading of evidence. Methods used a systematic review approach following the National Academy of Medicine's Standards for Systematic Reviews; a risk-of-bias assessment was not completed per meta-epidemiologic guidelines, results are reported according to those guidelines including an adapted PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement, and a protocol was registered on PROSPERO (PROSPERO 2021 CRD42021226281). The significance statement notes this is the first study to compare dietary recommendations across current CPGs for multiple major chronic diseases and that guidelines are closely aligned in recommending daily intake of plant sources of food with limited consumption of alcohol and salt or sodium, concluding that clinicians should feel confident making these recommendations in accordance with their respective practice guidelines; background context cites a 2019 analysis in 195 countries attributing more than half of diet-related deaths to nonoptimal intake of whole grains, fruit, and sodium.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112AwXHV]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5 — nutritional management in diabetes and chronic kidney disease — notes evidence supporting protein restriction and cautioning against high-protein diets. Based on 2 meta-analyses, low-protein diets reduced risks of loss of kidney function and/or increased albuminuria, and even a modest limitation of dietary protein (0.89 versus 1.02 g/kg body weight per day) substantially reduced the risk of CKD stage 5 or death (RR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.72; P = 0.04) in people with type 1 diabetes and CKD stage 2. High-protein diets are a particular concern because they increase albuminuria and may accelerate loss of kidney function; higher protein intake (≥ 20% versus 10% of total daily calories) is associated with loss of kidney function in women with mild kidney insufficiency (estimated GFR < 80 and > 55 mL/min/1.73 m²) and development of microalbuminuria in people with diabetes and hypertension; therefore, people with diabetes and CKD should avoid high-protein diets.

### Non-sugar sweeteners: helpful or harmful? The challenge of developing intake recommendations with the available research [^117PKG8s]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Uncertainty because of limited research pervades recommendations

Uncertainty surrounding the role of non-sugar sweeteners in weight management and chronic disease is also highlighted in other recommendations. For example, the dietary guidelines for Americans (DGA) 2020–2025 suggest using non-sugar sweeteners to replace caloric sweeteners, but state that long term use is discouraged, despite minimal research to support this recommendation. The 2020 scientific report of the DGA committee, which informs DGA, included only one study that examined specific types of non-sugar sweeteners. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2023 standards of care in diabetes state that products with non-sugar sweeteners may be an acceptable alternative to sugar sweetened products when consumed in moderation, and indicate that non-sugar sweeteners do not seem to significantly affect glycaemic control, although their impact on weight management is unclear. The ADA recommendations are, however, also based on research that did not examine all types of non-sugar sweeteners (for example, there were no studies on acesulfame potassium, which is widely found in foods and beverages).

The American Heart Association and ADA 2012 joint statement said that there is no clear conclusion regarding the effects of non-sugar sweeteners on appetite, energy intake, body weight, cardiometabolic risk factors, or the reduction of added sugars, and highlights the need for research that examines individual types of non-sugar sweeteners and specific population groups. Finally, while the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics practice guidelines for adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (2017) tackled individual types of non-sugar sweeteners for managing glycaemia in adults with diabetes, a stated limitation was the minimal number of long term studies to inform findings. The report concluded that adults with diabetes should be informed that intake of aspartame, sucralose, and steviol glycosides, within the ADI levels, will not have a significant influence on glycaemic control; yet, no studies were included that examined saccharin, acesulfame potassium, and neotame intake on glycaemic outcomes in this population.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management [^113jvskj]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Carbohydrate intake during exercise for diabetes management — amounts needed to maintain euglycemia and planning guidance. Increased carbohydrate intake and/or reduction in insulin dose is typically required to reach the goal of euglycemia during exercise. Past studies suggest 10 to 15 g of carbohydrate is needed to prevent hypoglycemia for low- to moderate-intensity aerobic activity lasting 30 to 60 min, and a similar amount of activity following an insulin bolus may require 30 to 60 g of carbohydrate to maintain euglycemia. For wilderness travel, frequent snacks are recommended to maintain energy needs for prolonged activity, and increased carbohydrate intake is generally recommended to help mitigate the risk of altitude illness. Recommendation: Those planning protocols should understand how to adjust carbohydrate intake based on blood glucose and exercise, with plans individualized to patients' medical and exercise history and the environmental stressors to which they are exposed (Evidence grade:1B).
