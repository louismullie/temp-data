## Question

First line drug for ottitis externa

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the first-line drug for otitis externa. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with diffuse, uncomplicated acute otitis externa versus complicated disease. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend as initial therapy. Next, I will examine comparative effectiveness across topical classes and the role of steroids. After that, I need to check tympanic membrane status and how it modifies the choice of agent. Finally, I will consider practical selection factors like cost, adherence, and follow-up, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with caveats for special scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Diffuse, uncomplicated acute otitis externa in patients aged 2 years and older is the target population for first-line recommendations, and it is almost exclusively bacterial, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, so I should anchor on that phenotype rather than chronic, necrotizing, or fungal disease, which change management entirely [^501dd35c] [^59d21c16].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — do any guidelines still endorse systemic therapy upfront? The AAO-HNSF guideline makes a strong recommendation against systemic antibiotics as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE, and instead recommends topical preparations as initial therapy, with high confidence in the efficacy of topical therapy and no meaningful differences in outcomes across topical classes in meta-analyses, which aligns with the Cochrane conclusion that topical treatments alone are effective for uncomplicated AOE [^d5cf12a6] [^1e9c0ecf] [^2086b726].

> I will now examine comparative effectiveness across topical agents. Wait, let me verify whether any class is clearly superior. Multiple meta-analyses and systematic reviews show no clinically meaningful differences in cure rates among topical antibiotics, including quinolones versus non-quinolones, and no consistent advantage of steroid-containing combinations over antibiotics alone, although some trials suggest faster symptom relief with steroids, so the practical implication is that several topical options are acceptable first-line choices [^2086b726] [^61f1f904] [^52d52cb4].

> But wait, what if the tympanic membrane is not intact or status is uncertain? I need to ensure ototoxicity risk is addressed. When there is a known or suspected perforation or a tympanostomy tube, guidelines recommend a non-ototoxic topical preparation, and fluoroquinolone otic drops are preferred in that scenario because they are not ototoxic and achieve high local concentrations, whereas aminoglycosides should be avoided if the middle ear is exposed [^7cd32554] [^38ce79e0] [^db420bae].

> Let me consider practical selection factors. Cost, adherence, and patient preference matter. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone is inexpensive and effective when the tympanic membrane is intact, but neomycin hypersensitivity is not rare, especially in chronic or eczematous ears, so I should confirm tolerance and consider a quinolone if there is a concern. Ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin drops are non-ototoxic and often dosed once or twice daily, which can improve adherence, and ciprofloxacin with a steroid may hasten pain relief in some patients, though superiority for overall cure is inconsistent across endpoints [^e7fbf136] [^de207e6e] [^3d18c8f4].

> Hold on, I should verify delivery issues that can undermine any topical choice. If the canal is edematous or obstructed, I need to ensure access: perform aural toilet and consider placing an ear wick to facilitate medication penetration, and I should reassess in 48–72 hours if there is no improvement to confirm the diagnosis, adherence, and patency of delivery, because failure to improve is often due to blocked access rather than the wrong drug [^d96cfe34] [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a].

> I should double-check the role of systemic therapy. Systemic antibiotics are not first-line for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; they are reserved for extension beyond the ear canal, diabetes or immunocompromise, or inability to deliver topical therapy effectively, and even then, I need to select agents active against Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus, recognizing that routine oral antibiotics add harm without benefit in uncomplicated cases [^d5cf12a6] [^8bde4d29] [^1920969b].

> Let me synthesize. For diffuse, uncomplicated AOE in patients aged 2 years and older with an intact tympanic membrane, a topical antimicrobial is the first-line drug class, and within that class, reasonable choices include neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone, a quinolone such as ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin combined with a steroid, with selection driven by cost, adherence, allergy risk, and patient preference, acknowledging no consistent superiority of one topical agent over another in cure rates. If the tympanic membrane is perforated or status is uncertain, I should choose a non-ototoxic quinolone otic preparation, and if the canal is obstructed, I should facilitate delivery with aural toilet and/or a wick and reassess in 48–72 hours if not improving [^1e9c0ecf] [^2086b726] [^7cd32554] [^d96cfe34].

---

The first-line treatment for acute otitis externa is **topical antibiotic ear drops** [^1e9c0ecf], with or without a corticosteroid, because they achieve high local concentrations and are effective against the most common pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus) [^45aa076f]. Systemic antibiotics are **not recommended as initial therapy** for uncomplicated cases [^d5cf12a6] because they are less effective and carry more side effects [^1920969b]. If the tympanic membrane is perforated or its status is unknown, use **non-ototoxic fluoroquinolone drops** (e.g. ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin) [^7cd32554] [^38ce79e0]. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone is a reasonable first-line option when the tympanic membrane is intact, but avoid if there is a risk of hypersensitivity [^e7fbf136]. Reassess in 48–72 hours if there is no improvement [^8bc30361].

---

## First-line pharmacologic treatment

Topical antibiotic ear drops are the **cornerstone of therapy** for AOE [^1e9c0ecf]. They deliver high local concentrations of antibiotics directly to the infected tissue, achieving bactericidal levels that systemic antibiotics cannot match [^45aa076f]. Topical therapy is effective, safe, and associated with minimal systemic side effects [^52d52cb4].

---

### Recommended topical antibiotics

Several classes of topical antibiotics are effective for AOE, including:

- **Aminoglycosides**: Neomycin, gentamicin
- **Polymyxin B**: Often combined with neomycin and hydrocortisone
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin

---

### Choice of topical antibiotic

The choice of topical antibiotic depends on several factors, including:

- **Tympanic membrane integrity**: If the tympanic membrane is perforated or its status is unknown, non-ototoxic fluoroquinolone drops (e.g. ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin) are preferred [^7cd32554] [^38ce79e0].
- **Patient factors**: Allergies, hypersensitivity reactions, and patient preference.
- **Cost and availability**: Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone preparations are inexpensive and widely available, making them a popular first-line choice when the tympanic membrane is intact [^e7fbf136].

---

### Role of corticosteroids

Adding a topical corticosteroid to antibiotic drops can reduce inflammation, edema, and pain, thereby accelerating symptom relief [^3e4f098c]. Commonly used corticosteroids include hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, and fluocinolone acetonide [^61f1f904]. Recent randomized trials show that ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide achieves faster pain resolution than ciprofloxacin alone, though overall cure rates are similar [^3d18c8f4].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting topical therapy

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate the **superiority of topical antibiotics** over placebo and the lack of added benefit from systemic antibiotics in uncomplicated AOE [^45aa076f]. A Cochrane review concluded that topical treatments alone are effective for uncomplicated AOE, with no significant differences in clinical outcomes among various topical interventions [^2086b726].

---

## Situations requiring systemic antibiotics

Systemic antibiotics are **not recommended as initial therapy** for uncomplicated AOE [^d5cf12a6]. They are reserved for specific situations, including:

- Extension of infection beyond the external auditory canal (e.g. cellulitis, necrotizing otitis externa) [^8bde4d29].
- Immunocompromised patients or those with significant comorbidities (e.g. diabetes mellitus) [^4f84b429].
- Failure of topical therapy after 48–72 hours [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) **strongly recommend topical therapy** as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated AOE [^1e9c0ecf] [^52d52cb4]. They advise against routine use of systemic antibiotics unless specific indications are present [^d5cf12a6].

---

## Practical considerations and patient counseling

Effective management of AOE also involves **patient education and adherence**:

- **Proper administration**: Patients should be instructed on correct drop administration, including tragal pumping and positioning [^d96cfe34].
- **Aural toilet**: Debris removal and wick placement may be necessary if the ear canal is obstructed [^cb2a1fc8].
- **Follow-up**: Reassess within 48–72 hours if symptoms do not improve [^8bc30361].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended first-line treatment** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated AOE with intact tympanic membrane | Topical antibiotic drops (neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone or fluoroquinolone) [^e7fbf136] |
| Perforated tympanic membrane or unknown status | Non-ototoxic fluoroquinolone drops (ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin) [^7cd32554] [^38ce79e0] |
| Complicated AOE (extension beyond canal, immunocompromised) | Systemic antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin) plus topical therapy [^8bde4d29] |

---

Topical antibiotic ear drops, with or without corticosteroids, are the **first-line treatment** for acute otitis externa. They are effective, safe, and preferred over systemic antibiotics in uncomplicated cases. Systemic antibiotics are reserved for specific indications, and patient education is essential for optimal outcomes.

Introduction

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage, and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. Otitis externa may be associated with eczema of the ear canal, and is more common in swimmers, in humid environments, in people with narrow ear canals, in hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of empirical treatments for otitis externa? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

Nine studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid, topical aluminium acetate, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical corticosteroids, and combinations of these agents.

Treatment TOPICAL MEDICATIONS Topical antimicrobials, with or without topical corticosteroids, are the mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. Topical antimicrobials are highly effective compared with placebo, demonstrating an absolute increase in clinical cure rate of 46 percent or a number needed to treat of slightly more than two. 17 Hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides, particularly neomycin, may develop in up to 15 percent of the population, and has been identified in approximately 30 percent of patients who also have chronic or eczematous otitis externa. 17, 18 Adherence to topical therapy increases with ease of administration, such as less frequent dosing. TREATMENT METHODS Use of a topical otic preparation without culture is a reasonable treatment approach for patients who have mild symptoms of otitis externa.

If the tympanic membrane is intact and there is no concern of hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides, a neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone otic preparation would be a first-line therapy because of its effectiveness and low cost. Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone are approved for middle ear use and should be used if the tympanic membrane is not intact or its status cannot be determined visually. 12 Oral analgesics are the preferred treatment. First-line analgesics include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. When ongoing frequent dosing is required to control pain, medications should be administered on a scheduled rather than as-needed basis. Opioid combination pills may be used when symptom severity warrants. Benzocaine otic preparations may compromise the effectiveness of otic antibiotic drops by limiting contact between the drop and the ear canal.

The lack of published data supporting the effectiveness of topical benzocaine preparations in otitis externa limits the role of such treatments. CHRONIC OTITIS EXTERNA The treatment of chronic otitis externa depends on the underlying causes. Because most cases are caused by allergies or inflammatory dermatologic conditions, treatment includes the removal of offending agents and the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids. Chronic or intermittent otorrhea over weeks to months, particularly with an open tympanic membrane, suggests the presence of chronic suppurative otitis media. Initial treatment efforts are similar to those for acute otitis media. With control of the symptoms of otitis externa, attention can shift to the management of chronic suppurative otitis media.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline—scope and target population covers an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 and provides evidence-based recommendations to manage AOE, defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE, and recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. The guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists—head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, and is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Acute otitis externa (AOE)—initial management recommendation: Clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE, with a recommendation based on randomized trials with some heterogeneity and a preponderance of benefit over harm; aggregate evidence quality is Grade B from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with significant limitations and heterogeneity, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for the efficacy of topical therapy as initial management but low regarding comparative benefits of different classes of drugs or combinations of ototopical agents. Benefits are effective therapy with low incidence of adverse events, while risks and costs include direct cost of medication that varies greatly depending on drug class and selection and risk of secondary fungal infection (otomycosis) with prolonged use of topical antibiotics; overall, the benefits-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note RCT results from largely specialty settings may not be generalizable to patients seen in primary care settings, where the ability to perform effective aural toilet may be limited; intentional vagueness is that there are no specific recommendations regarding the choice of ototopical agent; patient preferences have a substantial role in choice of topical therapeutic agent; exceptions are patients with a nonintact tympanic membrane; the policy level is Recommendation and there were no differences of opinion.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.

Purpose

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Action Statements

The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours [corrected] to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Acute otitis externa: an update [^bb15ddd3]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa is a common condition involving inflammation of the ear canal. The acute form is caused primarily by bacterial infection, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus the most common pathogens. Acute otitis externa presents with the rapid onset of ear canal inflammation, resulting in otalgia, itching, canal edema, canal erythema, and otorrhea, and often occurs following swimming or minor trauma from inappropriate cleaning. Tenderness with movement of the tragus or pinna is a classic finding. Topical antimicrobials or antibiotics such as acetic acid, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones are the treatment of choice in uncomplicated cases. These agents come in preparations with or without topical corticosteroids; the addition of corticosteroids may help resolve symptoms more quickly. However, there is no good evidence that any one antimicrobial or antibiotic preparation is clinically superior to another. The choice of treatment is based on a number of factors, including tympanic membrane status, adverse effect profiles, adherence issues, and cost. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone preparations are a reasonable first-line therapy when the tympanic membrane is intact. Oral antibiotics are reserved for cases in which the infection has spread beyond the ear canal or in patients at risk of a rapidly progressing infection. Chronic otitis externa is often caused by allergies or underlying inflammatory dermatologic conditions, and is treated by addressing the underlying causes.

Acute otitis externa (AOE)—early response and reassessment specifies that clinical improvement should be checked in 48–72 hours; if improved, complete the course of therapy, and if not improved, determine whether there is illness other than AOE and assess drug delivery, adherence to therapy, and the need to change therapy.

4, 25 as a means of monitoring response to treatment. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate can also be used to monitor therapeutic response. 25 The excellent antipseudomonal activity of the fluoroquinolones has generally made them the treatment of choice for necrotizing otitis externa, although a combination of a beta-lactam antibiotic and aminoglycoside is also effective. 26 In severe cases, a prolonged course of parenteral antibiotics may be needed, but the excellent gastrointestinal absorption of the fluoroquinolones allows milder infections to be treated with a two-week course of oral therapy. Treatment should also include surgical debridement of any granulation or osteitic bone. 4, 7, 25 Thus, an otolaryngologist should usually be involved early in the course, especially if the patient does not respond quickly to appropriate treatment. Because the infection can persist asymptomatically, the patient should be reevaluated at the end of the course of treatment.

At this time any further cleansing can be performed as needed. If the infection is not resolving, over-the-counter clotrimazole 1 percent solution, which also has some antibacterial activity, can be used. In vitro studies show that topical solutions of thimerosal and M-cresyl acetate are more effective agents but are messier. 11 If the tympanic membrane is perforated, tolnaftate 1 percent solution should be used in order to prevent ototoxicity. 11 All of these topical agents are typically used at a dosage of three or four drops twice daily for seven days. Aspergillus infections may be resistant to clotrimazole and may require the use of oral itraconazole.
6. The most important treatment is identifying and removing the irritant or allergen. Topical steroids are beneficial, including a cream for the pinna when it is involved.

An acidifying agent, usually Burow's otic solution with 2 percent acetic acid, is often added to prevent secondary infections, reacidify the skin, dry weeping lesions and remove crusts. Three to five days of use, three or four times daily, is usually sufficient for topical therapy. Systemic steroids and antihistamines may be needed for severe allergic reactions.

### Otitis externa: review and clinical update [^9809f6b7]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Otitis externa can take an acute or a chronic form, with the acute form affecting four in 1,000 persons annually and the chronic form affecting 3 to 5 percent of the population. Acute disease commonly results from bacterial (90 percent of cases) or fungal (10 percent of cases) overgrowth in an ear canal subjected to excess moisture or to local trauma. Chronic disease often is part of a more generalized dermatologic or allergic problem. Symptoms of early acute and most chronic disease include pruritus and local discomfort. If left untreated, acute disease can be followed by canal edema, discharge, and pain, and eventually by extra-canal manifestations. Topical application of an acidifying solution is usually adequate in treating early disease. An antimicrobial-containing ototopical is the preferred treatment for later-stage acute disease, and oral antibiotic therapy is reserved for advanced disease or those who are immunocompromised. Preventive measures reduce recurrences and typically involve minimizing ear canal moisture, trauma, or exposure to materials that incite local irritation or contact dermatitis.

If there is extension outside the ear canal or host factors requiring systemic therapy, prescribe systemic antimicrobial active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with or without topical therapy, plus other management based on underlying condition; factors requiring systemic therapy include diabetes, immune deficiency, or inability to effectively deliver topical therapy despite aural toilet. If no such extension or factors, assess for a perforated tympanic membrane (known or suspected) or tympanostomy tube; if present, prescribe topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation, and if absent, prescribe topical therapy based on benefits, cost, compliance, preference. If the ear canal is obstructed, perform aural toilet to remove obstructing debris and place a wick if edema prevents drug delivery; if not obstructed, educate the patient or caregiver on how to administer topical drops.

Many of the oral antibiotics selected are inactive against P aeruginosa and S aureus, and treatment with penicillins, macrolides, or cephalosporins increases disease persistence (rate ratios 1.56 to 1.91) and treatment with cephalosporins also increases recurrence (rate ratio 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.58). Orally administered antibiotics have systemic adverse effects that include rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, altered nasopharyngeal flora, and development of bacterial resistance.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^db420bae]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the external auditory canalthat can be acute (most common) or chronic. The estimated incidence of acute otitis externa (AOE) is between 1 in 100 and 1 in 250 of the general population,, and it is a common infection treated by health care professionals.

Historically, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were identified as common causative pathogens. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, with water exposure in the ear canal commonly noted.Patients with AOE present with otalgia, tenderness, diffuse ear canal edema, and otorrhea.In severe cases, symptoms may result in sleep disturbance and severe discomfort, leading to many health care visits.

In uncomplicated AOE, current guidelines recommend treatment with topical antimicrobial agents with or without anti-inflammatory drugs, risk factor avoidance, and pain management, when required. Topical antibiotics are the preferred first-line treatment because they can reach high local concentrations in the infected area,, demonstrate a low risk of adverse events (AEs), and minimize the development of antibiotic resistance.

Topical antibiotics include aminoglycosides (neomycin and gentamicin) or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin), with cure rates ranging from 65% to 90%.Topical fluoroquinolones are not associated with ototoxic effects and are effective in the presence of a tympanic membrane perforation. Ciprofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic particularly effective against gram-negative bacteria (including P aeruginosa).

In AOE, the addition of corticosteroids to ototopical antibiotic treatment is believed to enhance the resolution of the inflammatory response and improve associated symptoms.Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties.The combination of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, has already shown superiority vs ciprofloxacin alone for the treatment of diffuse otitis externaand vs ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone acetonide alone for children with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMTs).This combination is currently approved to treat AOE and AOMTs in more than 50 countries outside the US and for AOMTs in the US and Canada. The present study was conducted to evaluate the superiority of the combination of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, vs ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide alone to treat AOE.

Acute otitis media (AOM)—antibiotic choice and comparative trial design—notes that amoxicillin-clavulanate has a broader spectrum than amoxicillin and may be a better initial antibiotic; however, because of cost and adverse effects, the subcommittee has chosen amoxicillin as first-line AOM treatment. For head-to-head comparisons, stringent diagnostic criteria should be the standard for these studies, antibiotic comparisons for AOM should now include an observation arm for patients with nonsevere illness to ensure a clinical benefit over placebo, and studies should also have enough patients to show small but meaningful differences. Additional research is needed to determine whether risk factors such as child care settings and siblings younger than 5 years indicate a need for different initial treatment, to develop new antibiotics that are safe and effective and test them against the currently available medications, and to conduct randomized controlled trials using different durations of antibiotic therapy in different age groups to optimize therapy with the possibility of decreasing duration of antibiotic use, which would need to be performed initially with amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and again include an observation arm in nonsevere illness.

Acute otitis externa (AOE)—follow-up and treatment failure notes that follow-up is warranted if symptoms fail to resolve completely by 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Initial treatment failure of diffuse AOE may be caused by an obstructed ear canal, poor adherence to therapy, misdiagnosis, microbiologic factors, host factors, or contact sensitivity to eardrops. If topical antimicrobial therapy was prescribed, the clinician should reassess the patency of the ear canal to ensure that edema or debris are not impeding drug delivery. Any obstruction should be addressed with aural toilet, wick placement, or both, or if the obstruction cannot be relieved, systemic therapy is begun with an oral antibiotic that covers P aeruginosa and S aureus.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3141b1be]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^38ce79e0]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane—topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

The following constitutes key background information on acute otitis externa: 
- Definition: Acute otitis externa is defined as an infection of the cutis and subcutis of the external auditory canal, possibly involving the tympanic membrane and pinna as well.
- Pathophysiology: More than 90% of acute otitis externa cases are caused by bacteria, most commonly P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Polymicrobial infection is common. Fungi are a rare cause of acute otitis externa.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of acute otitis externa in the US is estimated at 810 per 100,000 person-years.
- Disease course: The characteristic symptom of acute otitis externa is severe pain, which is typically worsened by pressure on the tragus or tension on the pinna. Other symptoms include otorrhea, itch, erythema, and swelling of the ear canal, potentially leading to conductive hearing loss. Inadequately treated acute otitis externa may lead to chronic otitis externa.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Early diagnosis and rapid initiation of a 4- to 6-week course of antibiotics help lower the morbidity and mortality, but recurrence is common.

Type of antibiotic prescribed for ear symptoms and conditions

Otitis externa is treated in just over 30% of cases with a macrolide or broad-spectrum antibiotic, regardless of whether there is an uncertain or no indication for an antibiotic. For patients with otitis externa for whom an antibiotic was uncertain and who did receive an antibiotic, this antibiotic was a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in fewer than half of the cases. Acute otitis media was treated with macrolides or broad-spectrum antibiotics in fewer than 10% of the cases. When an antibiotic was prescribed for patients with acute otitis media with an uncertain or certain indication for an antibiotic, prescribers chose a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in over 90% of the cases (Fig. 2, Supplementary Appendix 4).

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^8c7c6078]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, superior to ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone acetonide alone in treating acute otitis externa?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial including 493 patients, ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone was not superior to either agent alone for the primary outcome of therapeutic cure. A faster resolution of otalgia, superiority in sustained microbiological response, and superiority in the microbiological outcome were noted with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone compared with fluocinolone or ciprofloxacin alone.

Meaning

Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone otic solution did not show statistical superiority compared with ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone alone for the primary end point, although the combination showed statistical superiority in many secondary efficacy end points and a good safety profile.

### Updated guidelines for the management of acute otitis media in children by the Italian Society of Pediatrics: treatment [^a5c59683]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

New insights into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) have been gained in recent years. For this reason, the Italian Paediatric Society has updated its 2010 guidelines.

Methods

A literature search was carried out on PubMed. Only pediatric studies published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018 in English or Italian were included. Each included study was assessed according to the GRADE methodology. The quality of the systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR 2. The recommendations were formulated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts.

Results

Prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for children with otorrhea, intracranial complications and/or a history of recurrence and for children under the age of 6 months. For children 6 months to 2 years of age, prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for all forms of unilateral and bilateral AOM, whether mild or severe. Prompt antibiotic treatment is also recommended for children over 2 years with severe bilateral AOM. A watchful-waiting approach can be applied to children over 2 years with mild or severe unilateral AOM or mild bilateral AOM. High doses of amoxicillin, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for patients with a high risk of infection by Beta-lactamase producing strains, remain the first-line antibiotics.

Conclusions

AOM should be managed on a case-by-case basis that takes account of the child's age, the severity of the episode and whether it is unilateral or bilateral. In patients under 2 years, prompt antibiotic treatment is always recommended.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^1656a28d]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably the result of an increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States. The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM. Amoxicillin at conventional or high doses (80-90 mg/kg/day) remains an appropriate choice for first-line therapy for AOM. For patients in whom amoxicillin is unsuccessful, second-line therapy should have demonstrated activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. Appropriate options for second-line therapy include high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day based on the amoxicillin component) and ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime has been suggested as a second-line agent in the past, but recent surveillance data suggest it may no longer be active against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Tympanocentesis is useful for identifying the causative pathogen, and it may be beneficial for patients who have failed multiple courses of antibiotics. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recently was approved for use in children and should be administered to all children less than 2 years old and those at risk for recurrent AOM (e.g., day care attendance, siblings with a history of recurrent AOM). Consensus recommendations are provided for the management of AOM, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy. The current challenges in the management of AOM include the need for an increased understanding of epidemiology, increasing resistance among common middle ear pathogens, use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in designing treatment strategies, and understanding the potential impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common diagnosis in childhood acute sick visits. By three years of age, 50% to 85% of children will have at least one episode of AOM. Symptoms may include ear pain (rubbing, tugging, or holding the ear may be a sign of pain), fever, irritability, otorrhea, anorexia, and sometimes vomiting or lethargy. AOM is diagnosed in symptomatic children with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new-onset otorrhea not caused by acute otitis externa, and in children with mild bulging and either recent-onset ear pain (less than 48 hours) or intense erythema of the tympanic membrane. Treatment includes pain management plus observation or antibiotics, depending on the patient's age, severity of symptoms, and whether the AOM is unilateral or bilateral. When antibiotics are used, high-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day in two divided doses) is first-line therapy unless the patient has taken amoxicillin for AOM in the previous 30 days or has concomitant purulent conjunctivitis; amoxicillin/clavulanate is typically used in this case. Cefdinir or azithromycin should be the first-line antibiotic in those with penicillin allergy based on risk of cephalosporin allergy. Tympanostomy tubes should be considered in children with three or more episodes of AOM within six months or four episodes within one year with one episode in the preceding six months. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines and exclusive breastfeeding until at least six months of age can reduce the risk of AOM.

### AAO-HNSF releases clinical practice guideline on acute (...) [^52d52cb4]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice • Sufficient dosing of oral analgesics is essential for alleviating discomfort and allowing patients to rest and continue their normal activities. • Topical therapy for uncomplicated AOE is the first-line treatment, with no significant differences between different drug classes. • If a patient has AOE with a perforated tympanic membrane, or if perforation is due to tympanostomy tube placement, then a non-ototoxic topical preparation is advised. • If AOE is complicated by progression beyond the ear canal, systemic antimicrobial agents may be warranted. From the AFP Editors. Physicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials initially in patients with diffuse uncomplicated AOE, unless the condition has moved beyond the ear canal or if specific indications for systemic therapy are present.

Topical therapy is the recommended initial treatment for AOE because of its safety, effectiveness, and exceptional outcomes in comparative studies. Physicians should prescribe topical therapy initially for diffuse uncomplicated AOE. If a patient's tympanic membrane is perforated, including from a tympanostomy tube, the physician should prescribe a non-ototoxic topical preparation. A variety of topical therapies are approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AOE. Most options provide antimicrobial activity through an antibiotic, a steroid, or a low-pH antiseptic. Three meta-analyses determined that topical therapy is an effective first-line option and that there are no important differences in outcomes with different drug classes, with quinolones vs. nonquinolones, or with topical therapy alone vs. combination therapy with a steroid.

Because there are few differences in effectiveness with most topical antimicrobials and steroids, the patient's preference and the physician's experience are important in choosing the treatment method, as are cost, therapy adherence, and possible adverse effects. For patients two years or older, the management course for diffuse AOE is as follows: Analgesics should be prescribed based on the severity of the patient's pain. If the condition has extended beyond the ear canal or if indications for systemic therapy are present, systemic antimicrobials active against Pseudomonas aeruginosaand Staphylococcus aureus should be prescribed. If needed based on the underlying condition, other management options should also be provided.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^2086b726]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

Search Strategy

Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible.We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low.Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial).In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively).One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate.No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning.Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid.The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed.Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision.Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

### Necrotizing otitis externa: a systematic review [^fdf7b3d4]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To carry out a systematic review of scientific evidence available about necrotizing otitis externa, emphasizing epidemiologic data, diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols, follow-up criteria, prognosis factors, and chronologic evolution.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for publications in English and French languages, between 1968 and October 1, 2011.

Study Selection

We included publications of all types including at least 6 cases. We excluded publications focused on cranial base osteomyelitis not originating from the external ear and publications limited to a specific population.

Data Extraction

We assessed publication quality according to international guidelines.

Data Synthesis

For each publication, data were entered in a spreadsheet software for analysis. We excluded individual data already published in other studies or reviews.

Conclusion

Our review revealed the absence of strong scientific evidence regarding diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols and follow-up criteria. This implies the use of highly empirical indexes of suspicion in clinical practice. Our review confirmed the existence of a typical but not exclusive population at risk (aged, male, and diabetic patient) and also revealed major issues: lack of primary prevention in population at risk, delays before referral and management, bacteriologic issues caused by antibiotic misuse (agent identification problems, rise of resistant strains), persistence of recurrent cases. A better diffusion of medical information should help improve the management of this severe disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^45aa076f]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE)—efficacy of topical therapy and lack of added benefit from systemic antibiotics: Three randomized trials have compared topical antimicrobial versus placebo for treating diffuse AOE, and a meta-analysis of the 2 trials with similar methodology yields a combined absolute rate difference (RD) of 0.46 based on 89 patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28 to 0.63), suggesting that only 2 patients need to be treated (NNT) with topical antimicrobials to achieve 1 additional cure; bacteriologic efficacy (RD = 0.61) was higher than clinical efficacy. A Cochrane review affirms that “Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated AOE,” and randomized trials show no significant difference in cure rates when adding an oral antibiotic to topical therapy at 2 to 4 days (RD = −0.01; 95% CI, −0.21 to 0.18) or at 5 to 6 days (RD = 0.08; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.30), with another trial showing no differences in pain duration or bacteriologic efficacy between topical ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone (Cipro HC) and combination therapy with oral amoxicillin and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone. An advantage of topical therapy is the very high concentration of antimicrobial that can be delivered to infected tissue, often 100 to 1000 times higher than can be achieved with systemic.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3e4f098c]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE)—analgesic options, routes, and cautions: Mild to moderate pain usually responds to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs given alone or in fixed combination with an opioid (eg, oxycodone or hydrocodone; ibuprofen with oxycodone), and orally administered analgesics are the preferred route of administration whenever possible, although parenteral analgesia may be necessary rarely. Administering a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug during the acute phase of diffuse AOE significantly reduces pain compared with placebo. Acute analgesia and, occasionally, procedure-related sedation, may be required to accomplish adequate aural toilet in patients with extreme inflammation and tenderness of the canal, while nonpharmacologic therapies such as heat or cold, relaxation, and distraction are of unproven value. Benzocaine otic solution, with or without antipyrine, is available for topical anesthesia but is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for safety, effectiveness, or quality; topical anesthetic drops should not be used if a tympanostomy tube is present or if there is uncertainty regarding the integrity of the tympanic membrane, because these drops are not approved for use in the middle ear. If a topical anesthetic drop is prescribed for temporary pain relief, the patient should be reexamined within 48 to 72 hours to ensure appropriate response; symptoms of uncomplicated AOE should improve within 48 to 72 hours of initiating appropriate topical therapy. Adding a topical steroid to topical antimicrobial drops has been shown to hasten pain relief in some randomized trials, but other studies have shown no significant benefit. Use of a faces, Oucher, or visual analog scale may help determine the level of pain, particularly for children and non–English-speaking patients.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^07830105]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Statement 1—differential diagnosis for acute otitis externa (AOE) specifies that clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal, with a Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over risk; the action statement profile lists aggregate evidence quality Grade C observational studies and Grade D reasoning from first principles, level of confidence in evidence high, benefit improved diagnostic accuracy, risks/harms/costs none in following the recommended action, benefits-harm assessment preponderance of benefit over harm, value judgments importance of accurate diagnosis, intentional vagueness none, role of patient preferences none regarding the need for a proper diagnosis, and exceptions none. Supporting text notes symptoms including otalgia (70%), itching (60%), or fullness (22%), with or without hearing loss (32%) or ear canal pain on chewing; identifies a hallmark sign of diffuse AOE as tenderness of the tragus when pushed and the pinna when pulled, or both; and states that otoscopy will reveal diffuse ear canal edema, erythema, or both, with or without otorrhea, and material in the ear canal. It also warns that AOE can mimic the appearance of acute otitis media (AOM) and emphasizes that distinguishing AOE from AOM is important because the latter may require systemic antimicrobials.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3f3c4303]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) research priorities emphasize determining if water precautions are necessary or beneficial during active treatment and when to discontinue them, improving recognition of treatment failure versus topical sensitivity, and conducting high-quality randomized trials comparing clinical efficacy with explicit double-blind protocols and assessing systemic antimicrobial therapy versus topical therapy. Trials are also prioritized to report early clinical outcomes (eg, after 2-4 days of therapy) and compare time to symptom resolution alongside categorical responses, and to compare “home therapies” (vinegar, alcohol) versus antimicrobials with attention to the role for patient preferences. Further needs include defining indications for aural toilet and wick placement, determining the independent efficacy of aural toilet, comparing wick versus no wick and suction or active debridement versus dry mopping, and defining best methods to teach clinicians to safely and effectively perform aural toilet and wick insertion. Additional priorities are to determine optimal assessment of tympanic membrane integrity in AOE (including the utility of tympanometry), develop medicated wicks that gradually release drug into the ear canal, and continue monitoring bacteriology and antibiotic resistance patterns in AOE.

### Acute otitis media guidelines in selected developed and developing countries: uniformity and diversity [^99b3f0c5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood disease, with an enormous economic and healthcare-related burden. Guidelines and consensus papers for AOM diagnosis and management were published in many countries. Our objective was to study the differences and similarities between these protocols in developing and developed countries.

Methods

The keywords: 'acute otitis media' AND 'children' AND ['treatment' or 'management'] AND ['guideline' or 'consensus'] were used in various electronic databases between 1 January 1989 through 31 December 2015. Overall, 99 sources from 62 countries were retrieved: 53 from 22 developed countries, and 46 from 40 developing countries. Representative guidelines from America (the USA, Argentina), Europe (Italy, Moldova), Africa (South Africa, Tanzania, Ethiopia), Asia (Japan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka),and Oceania (South Australia, Fiji) were compared.

Results

Paediatric societies publish guidelines in most developed countries; in developing countries, the Ministry of Health usually initiates guideline formulation. Most guidelines use the same diagnostic criteria and offer watchful waiting in mild-moderate scenarios. Amoxicillin is the suggested first-line antibiotic, whereas options for second-line and third-line therapies vary. Duration of therapy varies and is usually age dependent: 5-7days for children <2years and 10days for children >2years in developed countries, while duration and age groups vary greatly in developing countries. Reduction of AOM risk factors is encouraged in developed countries, but rarely in developing countries.

Conclusions

Guidelines for AOM from developing and developed countries are similar in many aspects, with variation in specific recommendations, due to local epidemiology and healthcare accessibility. Formulation of regional guidelines may help reduce AOM burden.

### Medical and surgical management of otitis media in children [^4adc0f06]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

OM, though frequent and seemingly simple to evaluate and manage, remains a treatment challenge. Increasingly sophisticated clinical trials assessing OM medical treatment efficacy and outcome have demonstrated that many treatment regimens that were commonly used a decade ago are no longer recommended. Surgical therapy for OM, though remaining the same, has come under intense scrutiny from several angles but still plays a central role for this disease. Given the multiple facets of OM, its frequency, and its potential to cause short- and long-term morbidity in children, the next decade is sure to bring further treatment innovations.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^450857f2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical study, ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution was efficacious and safe in treating AOE but did not demonstrate superiority vs ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solutions alone in the main study end point of therapeutic cure. However, the findings suggest the benefits of combining the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide to better manage patients with AOE, with regard to both the bacterial infection and the typical disease signs and symptoms.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin and other otic preparations for otitis externa [^fcc711ce]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Ofloxacin otic is as effective in curing otitis externa in children (<12 years of age) as is the preparation combining polymyxin/neomycin plus hydrocortisone and as ciprofloxacin otic. Furthermore ofloxacin otic, as it requires less frequent dosing, is likely to encourage greater patient adherence and consequently to achieve a better cure rate than both of these treatment options. Because a number of cases of otitis externa are complicated by an undiagnosed tympanic membrane perforation, the lack of ototoxicity associated with ofloxacin otic makes it a particularly safe option for use in these patients.

### Initial impact of the acute otitis externa clinical practice guideline on clinical care [^478a1e3f]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives. Determine the influence of the acute otitis externa clinical practice guideline on clinical care. Study Design. Cross-sectional study with historical controls. Setting. Outpatient departments in the United States. Methods. Cases of acute otitis externa occurring in 2004-2005 (before guideline publication) and 2007-2008 (after guideline publication) were extracted from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey. Prescribing rates for ototopical medications, analgesic recommendations, and oral antibiotics were determined and compared before and after guideline publication and relative to guideline recommendations. Results. An estimated 5.50 (standard error of the estimated mean, 0.38) million visits (mean age, 27.7 [1.7] years; 49.8% male) with a primary and singular coded diagnosis of acute otitis externa were studied (2.64 [0.26] million visits for 2004-2005 and 2.86 [0.28] million visits for 2007-2008). Prescribing rates for ototopical preparations were 67.2% (5.3%) and 67.6% (5.0%) before and after guideline publication, respectively (P = .955). Recommendation rates for analgesics were 14.2% (3.3%) and 20.6% (3.9%), respectively (P = .248). Prescription rates for oral antibiotics were 21.7% (4.8%) and 30.5% (3.6%), before and after, respectively (P = .166). Conclusion. Clinician behavior in the medical treatment of acute otitis externa has not significantly changed after guideline publication, despite clear, evidence-based guideline recommendations. These data have important implications for performance measures based on the guideline. Further efforts toward guideline dissemination are likely needed.

### Current indications for surgical intervention with lateral skull base osteomyelitis [^65b589f9]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Lateral skull base osteomyelitis (SBO), also called malignant otitis externa or necrotitizing otitis externa, is a subacute yet relentless infection of the external auditory canal and skull base most often found in elderly males and diabetics. When SBO was first described in the 1950s, the first‐line therapy was surgical intervention. Over the past few decades, a transition toward culture‐directed antibiotics has shifted the treatment paradigm of SBO toward primary medical management, with mortality rates now decreased to 10%–20% compared to 50% initially.

Today, the treatment of SBO involves multidisciplinary coordination between otolaryngology and infectious disease. Although the introduction of quinolone antibiotics has significantly decreased mortality rate, the rate of surgical intervention has not drastically changed over time.Due to the rarity of this condition, there is significant variability in practice styles between individuals and institutions, and there is no consensus on the specific indications for surgical intervention. The purpose of this best practice review was to interpret the available evidence to better define contemporary indications for surgery.

Otitis media with effusion guideline—evidence-based statements and clinical judgment state that guidelines are intended to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes for patients, and minimize harm; the evidence-based approach requires that evidence be identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link between evidence and statements, and statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supplant professional judgment; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than with a recommendation, options offer the most opportunity for practice variability, and Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients’ interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for 357, 390 children with otitis media [^fb10b689]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Otitis media (OM) is a common complication of respiratory tract infections in children. Over 130,000 acute OM cases were diagnosed and treated in Finnish children in public health care centers in 2014.Nearly half of the infants have suffered from acute OM during their first living year and 70% before the age of 2 years.Among 17 European evidence-based guidelines, all recommend analgesics, and 15 recommend the wait-and-see practice in selected cases, and when treated, 14 recommend amoxicillin as the first-choice antibiotics: 7 with the dose of 40–50 mg/kg/day and 7 with the dose of 90 mg/kg/day.

The Finnish Current Care Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of OM, which were published in 2011 and updated in 2017, are in line with the European guidelines.The Finnish guidelines recommend that children younger than 24 months of age, and children with bulging eardrum, draining middle ear or purulent OM in both ears should be treated immediately, and the first-line antibiotics are amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.High amoxicillin dosing is not needed due to the low frequency of pneumococcal penicillin resistance in the country. Second-generation cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfa and macrolides are the second-line drugs recommended for those allergic to penicillin. Children 2 years of age and upward with less prominent clinical findings can be left without antibiotics, but they must be reexamined after 2 to 3 days if the symptoms continue.

A task force set up by the European Paediatric Association concluded that the overconsumption of antibiotics in children with spontaneously recovering respiratory tract infections is 1 of the 4 most important health care problems in children in Europe.Indeed, many children with signs and symptoms of OM during acute respiratory infection recover spontaneously, and a wait-and-see practice with delayed introduction of antibiotics, if needed, is justified in appropriate cases and eventually reduces the consumption of antibiotics at the population level.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate antibiotic prescriptions for children with OM in a nationwide private network of outpatient clinics in Finland. Special focus was paid to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid prescriptions, which have been the first-choice recommendations since 2017, according to Finnish guidelines. A nationwide dataset allowed an estimation of variations by age, time, region and the specialty of the physicians. Further, we were interested in identifying potential needs and specific areas for future active interventions antibiotic use among children with OM.

### Use of systemic antibiotics for acute otitis externa: impact of a clinical practice guideline [^4f8ccb1e]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the extent of systemic antibiotic use among patients with acute otitis externa (AOE), as well as the impact of an AOE clinical practice guideline publication in 2006.

Study Design

Interrupted time series study of retrospective data.

Setting

Medicaid billing data from 29 states between 2002 and 2010.

Patients

Patients with age less than 65 years, continuous Medicaid eligibility for 12 months before AOE diagnosis, and dispensation of antibiotics within 1 day before through 3 days after AOE diagnosis.

Main Outcome Measures

The proportion of AOE visits that received systemic antibiotics among all AOE visits that were dispensed any antibiotics, systemic or topical.

Results

We found 682,865 AOE visits that received systemic or topical antibiotics for AOE. The proportion of systemic antibiotic therapy either with or without topical therapy was 43.1% before and 38.3% after AOE guideline publication. There was no significant immediate drop (-0.01; 95%CI, -0.031-0.011) or change in trend (0.002; 95%CI, -0.001-0.004) in the prevalence of systemic antibiotic therapy after guideline publication.

Conclusion

Publication of an AOE clinical guideline did not lead to a decline in systemic antibiotic therapy as initial AOE treatment. Additional efforts will be needed to curb systemic antibiotic treatment for AOE.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in childhood for which antibiotics are commonly prescribed; a systematic review reported a pooled prevalence of 85.6% in high-income countries. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in 1997 and updated in 1999, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Current Contents, CINAHL, LILACS and two trial registers. The date of the search was 14 February 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo, and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: 1) pain at various time points (24 hours, two to three days, four to seven days, 10 to 14 days), and 2) adverse effects likely to be related to the use of antibiotics. Secondary outcomes were: 1) abnormal tympanometry findings, 2) tympanic membrane perforation, 3) contralateral otitis (in unilateral cases), 4) AOM recurrences, 5) serious complications related to AOM and 6) long-term effects (including the number of parent-reported AOM symptom episodes, antibiotic prescriptions and health care utilisation as assessed at least one year after randomisation). We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome of interest.

Main Results

Antibiotics versus placebo We included 13 trials (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries, which we assessed at generally low risk of bias. Antibiotics do not reduce pain at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01; 5 trials, 1394 children; high-certainty evidence), or at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; 7 trials, 1264 children), but result in almost a third fewer children having pain at two to three days (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.88; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20; 7 trials, 2320 children; high-certainty evidence), and likely result in two-thirds fewer having pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7; 1 trial, 278 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Antibiotics increase the risk of adverse events such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14; 8 trials, 2107 children; high-certainty evidence). Antibiotics reduce the risk of children having abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; NNTB 11; 7 trials, 2138 children), slightly reduce the risk of experiencing tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.89; NNTB 33; 5 trials, 1075 children) and halve the risk of contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11; 4 trials, 906 children). However, antibiotics do not reduce the risk of abnormal tympanometry findings at six to eight weeks (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.13; 3 trials, 953 children) and at three months (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.34; 3 trials, 809 children) or late AOM recurrences (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.11; 6 trials, 2200 children). Severe complications were rare, and the evidence suggests that serious complications do not differ between children treated with either antibiotics or placebo. Immediate antibiotics versus expectant observation We included six trials (1556 children) from high-income countries. The evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may result in a reduction of pain at two to three days (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79; NNTB 8; 1 trial, 396 children; low-certainty evidence), but probably do not reduce the risk of pain at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12; 4 trials, 959 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and may not reduce the risk of pain at 11 to 14 days (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10; 1 trial, 247 children; low-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics increase the risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.51; NNTH 10; 3 trials, 946 children; high-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics probably do not reduce the proportion of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks and evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may not reduce the risk of tympanic membrane perforation and AOM recurrences. No serious complications occurred in either group.

Authors' Conclusions

This review reveals that antibiotics probably have no effect on pain at 24 hours, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. For most children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified. Therefore, clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics.

### Comparison of safety and efficacy of foam-based versus solution-based ciprofloxacin for acute otitis externa [^5719fca4]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare and evaluate the efficacy and safety of a foam-based antibiotic formulation in the treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE) with the more conventional solution-based formulation.

Study Design

Phase 2, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Multicenter.

Subjects and Methods

Sixty-three eligible adult patients with unilateral AOE were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: an experimental 0.3 percent foam-based ciprofloxacin, (FoamOtic Cipro) or 0.3 percent solution-based ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan). All patients received the same dose regime (twice daily for 7 days). The primary efficacy variable was response to therapy (cure) in the test-of-cure visit. Secondary variables included improvement of the disease symptoms otalgia, tenderness, edema, and otorrhea.

Results

Sixty-four patients were enrolled in the study. Seven patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis due to major deviations from the protocol. Per-protocol analysis (n = 57) showed that cure was achieved in all the patients (P = 1.000). No significant differences were found between groups for symptomatic relief, resolution of otic discharge, or onset of pain reduction. Both treatments were found to be highly efficacious and safe, demonstrating the noninferiority of the experimental drug.

Conclusion

Foam-based ciprofloxacin is a safe and an effective new treatment for AOE.

### Benign necrotizing otitis externa [^3d63c795]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Benign necrotizing otitis externa (BNOE) is a rare condition of the external acoustic meatus characterized by ulceration of the floor of the deep meatus overlying an area of bony necrosis. Recognition of this condition as different from malignant necrotizing otitis externa (MNOE) and carcinoma of the external ear is important because its treatment is very different. The best choice of treatment for BNOE is not clear because both long-term medical therapy and surgery have been advocated as first-line treatments. We describe a case involving a 50-year-old man and present what we believe to be the first published photographs of the surgical management of BNOE.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^3d18c8f4]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

At visit 4, the therapeutic response was significantly superior in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group compared with the ciprofloxacin group (90 of 103 [87.4%] vs 69 of 91 [75.8%]; difference in response rate, 11.6%; 95% CI, 0.7%-22.4%; P =.04) but not with the fluocinolone group (36 of 45 [80.0%]; difference in response rate, 7.4%; 95% CI, –6.0% to 20.7%; P =.25) (Table 2). Similar results were observed in the CITT population, and no statistically significant difference was reached in the MITT-PA/SA population.

Otalgia disappeared significantly faster in patients treated with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (median, 5.0 days [range, 4.2-6.3 days]) compared with those treated with ciprofloxacin (median, 5.9 days [range, 4.3-7.3 days]; 95% CI, 4.3-7.3 days; P =.002) or fluocinolone (median, 7.7 days [range, 6.7-9.0 days]; 95% CI, 6.7-9.0 days; P <.001) in the MITT population (Figure 2). The median time to end of ear pain was 5.0 days (range, 4.2-6.3 days) in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group, 5.9 days (range, 4.3-7.3 days) in the ciprofloxacin group, and 7.7 days (range, 6.7-9.0 days) in the fluocinolone group (Figure 2). A significantly lower median time to end of ear pain was also observed in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group (5.9 days; range, 4.9-6.4 days) vs the ciprofloxacin (6.9 days; range, 5.9-7.9 days; P <.001) and fluocinolone (7.6 days; range, 6.0-8.5 days; P =.01) groups in the CITT population and vs the fluocinolone group (7.5 days; range, 4.5-11.5 days; P =.01) in the MITT-PA/SA population.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^4f84b429]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Statement 2—modifying factors in diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE): Clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy). Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over risk. The action statement profile characterizes the aggregate evidence quality as Grade C, observational studies, the level of confidence in evidence as High, the benefits-harms assessment as a Preponderance of benefits over harm, and the policy level as Recommendation. Key clinical history components that can modify management include diabetes, HIV infection or other immunocompromised states, history of radiotherapy, and presence of tympanostomy tubes or a perforated tympanic membrane (nonintact tympanic membrane).

### Malignant otitis externa: a novel stratification protocol for predicting treatment outcomes [^6cb02648]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

1) Stratify malignant otitis externa into severe and nonsevere disease categories. 2) Predict treatment courses and outcomes based on this stratification.

Setting

Tertiary center.

Patients

Retrospective review 2004 to 2014; 28 patients. Inclusion criteria are a diagnosis by senior authors, radiographic evidence of disease, admission for intravenous antibiotics/debridement, minimum 1 year of follow-up.

Interventions

Severe group stratification if two or more of the following: cranial nerve VII palsy, fungal positive culture, relapse, surgery performed, major radiographic findings. All other patients stratified to nonsevere group.

Main Outcome Measures

Cure, alive/refractory disease, death by disease, death by other cause. Secondary measures are antibiotic duration and number of disease-related admissions.

Results

Forty-three percent (12 of 28) and 57% (16 of 28) of patients stratified into the severe and nonsevere groups. The severe group had significantly more adverse disease-specific outcomes than the nonsevere group (7 of 12 versus 0 of 16; p=0.002). Disease-specific mortality was 42% and 0% in the severe and nonsevere groups, respectively. The severe group had longer antibiotic courses (12.8 versus 6.9 wk; p=0.01) and more disease-related admissions/relapses (1.6 versus 1, p<0.001). Only four of 12 severe group patients achieved cure. All but two nonsevere patients achieved cure, with those two dying of other causes.

Conclusion

A subgroup of malignant otitis externa may exist that is not as susceptible to parenteral antibiotics and local debridement. A combination of clinical and radiographic findings may be useful for stratifying patients into severe/nonsevere categories. Patients with severe disease may be more likely to die of their disease and have worse treatment courses such that additional surgical intervention may be indicated.

### The evolution of ototopical therapy: from cumin to quinolones [^8d92aba8]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

A radical change has occurred in the management of otorrhea over the past decade. Multiple studies have supported the efficacy of topical quinolones in the management of acute otitis media, acute otitis externa, and CSOM. For the first time, otolaryngologists have a scientific foundation on which to base our treatment protocols for these conditions. We no longer must rely solely on our clinical experience and prejudices. The quinolone drops have a superior safety profile and a broad antimicrobial spectrum, their overall cost is lower than the alternatives, and their convenient dosing schedule is tolerated well by most patients. When one takes all these factors into consideration, it becomes clear that topical quinolone therapy, with or without a steroid additive, is the treatment of choice for otorrhea in patients with a tympanic membrane perforation or ventilating tube. The development of ototopical medications has followed along the lines of Darwinian evolution, and the quinolone drops have clearly demonstrated the concept of "survival of the fittest."

### Topical antibiotics without steroids for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^c764224f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

Objectives

Assess topical antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations (CSOM).

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965), PREMEDLINE, metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), and article references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials; any topical antibiotic without steroids, versus no drug treatment, aural toilet, topical antiseptics, or other topical antibiotics excluding steroids; participants with CSOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data onto RevMan; two authors inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.

Main Results

Fourteen trials (1,724 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included otitis externa, mastoid cavity infections and other diagnoses. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up usually short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week: relative risk (RR) was 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.59) (two trials, N = 197). No statistically significant difference was found between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) at weeks one or three: pooled RR were 0.89 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.32) (three trials, N = 402), and 0.97 (0.54 to 1.72) (two trials, N = 77), respectively. A positive trend in favour of quinolones seen at two weeks was largely due to one trial and not significant after accounting for heterogeneity: pooled RR 0.65 (0.46 to 0.92) (four trials, N = 276) using the fixed-effect model, and 0.64 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.17) accounting for heterogeneity with the random-effects model. Topical quinolones were significantly better at curing CSOM than antiseptics: RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.67) at one week (three trials, N = 263), and 0.58 (0.47 to 0.72) at two to four weeks (four trials, N = 519). Meanwhile, non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) compared to antiseptics were more mixed, changing over time (four trials, N = 254). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than no drug treatment or topical antiseptics; non-quinolone antibiotic effects (without steroids) versus no drug or antiseptics are less clear. Studies were also inconclusive regarding any differences between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics, although indirect comparisons suggest a benefit of topical quinolones cannot be ruled out. Further trials should clarify non-quinolone antibiotic effects, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications) and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether quinolones may result in fewer adverse events than other topical treatments.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^2e971472]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Other secondary end points included (1) sustained microbiological cure; (2) clinical cure at visit 3 and visit 4; (3) microbiological cure at visit 3 and visit 4; (4) therapeutic cure at visit 4; (5) changes in otorrhea, edema, and otalgia at visit 3 and visit 4; and (6) AEs throughout the study. Compliance was assessed by dividing the number of doses the patient took by the number of prescribed doses. Patients were considered compliant if their percentage compliance was between 80% and 120%. Safety was evaluated by recording AEs reported by the patient or the investigator and by the assessment of vital signs.

### Treatment and prevention of otitis media [^70f046e8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and summarize recent advances in the treatment and prevention of otitis media (OM).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-March 2000) was performed to identify relevant primary and review articles. References from these articles were also reviewed if deemed important.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language primary and review articles focusing on the treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) were included. Studies focusing exclusively on OM with effusion or serous OM and chronic suppurative OM were excluded. Information regarding prevention and drug therapy was reviewed, with an emphasis placed on advances made in the last two years.

Data Synthesis

Recently, an expert panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended use of only three of 16 systemic antibiotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AOM: amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and ceftriaxone. Controversy exists over the importance of key selection factors used by the expert panel in determining which antibiotics to recommend in a two-step treatment algorithm, that is, in vitro data, pharmacodynamic profiles, and necessity for coverage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae at all steps of empiric treatment. Additional antibiotic and patient selection factors useful for individualizing therapy include clinical efficacy, adverse effects, frequency and duration of administration, taste, cost, comorbid infections, and ramifications should bacterial resistance develop to the chosen antibiotic. Presumed or past patient/caregiver adherence (especially when antibiotic failure has occurred) is also paramount in selecting antibiotic therapy. A three-step treatment algorithm for refractory AOM that employs amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (depending on the prior dose of and adherence to amoxicillin therapy), and ceftriaxone or tympanocentesis at steps 1, 2, and 3, respectively, appears rational and cost-effective. The recent upsurge in antimicrobial resistance is highlighted, and recommendations are presented for the treatment of AOM and prevention of recurrent otitis media (rAOM).

Conclusions

Amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for initial empiric treatment of AOM, although the traditional dosage should be increased in patients at risk for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. In cases refractory to high-dose amoxicillin, TMP/SMX should be prescribed if adherence to prior therapy seemed good or complete, or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate if adherence was incomplete or questionable. Ceftriaxone should be reserved as third-line treatment. The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae emphasizes the importance of alternative medical approaches for the prevention of OM, as well as judicious antibiotic use in established cases. Removal of modifiable risk factors should be first-line therapy for prevention of rAOM. We support the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine per guidelines for prevention of rAOM from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with consideration given to influenza vaccine for cases of rAOM that historically worsen during the flu season. Sulfisoxazole prophylaxis should be reserved for children who are immunocompromised, have concurrent disease states exacerbated by AOM, or meet the criteria of rAOM despite conjugate pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Therapy should be intermittent, beginning at the first sign of an upper respiratory infection, and should continue for 10 days. The invasive nature and risks of anesthesia relegate myringotomy, tympanostomy tubes, and adenoidectomy to last-line therapies for rAOM.
