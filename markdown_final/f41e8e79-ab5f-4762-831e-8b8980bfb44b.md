## Question

A 6-week-old child is brought to his pediatrician for a physical exam and hepatitis B booster. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 19-year-old G-1-P-1. He was previously up to date on all vaccines and is mildly delayed in some developmental milestones. His mother is especially concerned with colic, as the boy cries endlessly at night. During the conversation, the infant's mother breaks down and starts crying and complaining about how tired she is and how she has no support from her family. She admits to repeatedly striking the infant in an effort to stop his crying. On physical exam, the infant's vitals are normal. The child appears cranky and begins to cry during the exam. The infant's backside is swollen, red, and tender to touch. Which of the following is the best response to this situation?
A. Confront the mother directly
B. Contact child protective services
C. Recommend treating the colic with a few drops of whiskey
D. Encourage the mother to take a class on parenting

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to respond to a case of suspected child physical abuse in a 6-week-old infant, based on the clinical scenario provided. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate safety assessment and whether there is imminent risk. Then, I should verify the clinical findings and whether they fit patterns of abuse. Next, I will review the mother's disclosure and psychosocial context. After that, I need to confirm the legal obligations for mandated reporting. Then, I will examine the differential diagnosis and what testing is indicated. Next, I should outline communication strategy with the caregiver. Finally, I will determine disposition, documentation, and follow-up planning, and I will double-check each step against guidelines to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the immediate safety assessment: the infant is 6 weeks old, non-ambulatory, and has a swollen, red, tender buttock consistent with recent soft tissue injury. The mother has admitted to striking the infant to stop crying, which constitutes physical abuse and places the infant at imminent risk of harm, so I need to ensure the infant is not discharged to an unsafe environment pending evaluation and reporting, and I should involve social work and consider hospital admission for safety and coordinated assessment [^111mGxEo] [^112VRt6q].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical findings against abuse patterns: in non-ambulatory infants, any bruising or soft tissue injury is highly concerning for abuse, and the location on the buttocks is a non-bony prominence area that increases suspicion. The mother's admission of striking provides a direct mechanism consistent with inflicted injury, and the infant's developmental immobility makes accidental explanations implausible, so this constellation supports a working diagnosis of physical abuse and warrants a full abuse evaluation including skeletal survey and head imaging per guidelines [^114jBxW9] [^112VRt6q] [^115safVN].

> I need to check the psychosocial context and risk factors: the mother is young, reports no family support, and is experiencing significant distress and fatigue. These are established risk factors for child maltreatment, and her explicit admission of hitting the infant indicates loss of impulse control and a need for urgent intervention to prevent escalation and recurrence, reinforcing the need for immediate safety planning and supportive services alongside mandated reporting [^114p3hiD] [^116xkvns].

> Hold on, I should verify the legal obligations before proceeding: in the United States, physicians are mandated reporters. When there is reasonable suspicion of child abuse, we must report to Child Protective Services promptly, typically within 24 hours, and failure to report is unlawful. I should not confront the mother in a way that could provoke flight risk or further harm, and I should document verbatim the mother's admission and my clinical findings to support the report [^111Hz4rz] [^114vMyj3] [^1165U9pc].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis and required workup: even though the history and exam are highly suggestive of abuse, I should exclude medical mimics such as coagulopathy or metabolic bone disease. A standardized child abuse evaluation should include a skeletal survey for occult fractures, neuroimaging for occult head injury given the infant's age, and screening labs for bleeding disorders as indicated. In non-ambulatory infants, rib and long bone fractures are particularly concerning for abuse, and guidelines support routine abuse evaluations for certain fracture patterns in young children [^115imTb3] [^112111j8] [^115safVN].

> I should double-check the communication strategy: I will use a trauma-informed, nonjudgmental approach, explain that the infant's injuries and the reported mechanism require a comprehensive medical evaluation and that we are legally obligated to involve CPS to ensure safety. I will avoid accusatory language, focus on the infant's well-being, and offer concrete support resources. If I anticipate difficulty with this conversation, I will involve social work or a senior colleague to deliver the message clearly and objectively [^114vMyj3] [^116ZQfoS] [^116xkvns].

> Next, I should review disposition and immediate actions: I will not discharge the infant to the mother's sole care today. Instead, I will arrange hospital admission under a surgical or trauma service for safety, coordination of the abuse workup, and reliable reporting, with a care team huddle prior to any discharge planning. I will notify CPS immediately and request an emergency safety assessment, and I will ensure the infant remains in a supervised, safe environment until safety is established [^111mGxEo] [^112VmUnN] [^114vMyj3].

> I need to ensure meticulous documentation: I will record verbatim the mother's admission of striking the infant, document the objective findings on exam with body diagrams, and clearly state the rationale for suspecting physical abuse. I will avoid templated histories and will attribute the history source explicitly, and I will document interpreter use if needed to maintain evidentiary integrity for CPS and potential legal proceedings [^1165U9pc].

> Let me think about follow-up and family support: after the acute safety phase, pediatric follow-up should address medical consequences of abuse, developmental surveillance, and linkage to community resources. Pediatricians play a key role in coordinating care for maltreated children and strengthening caregiver capabilities when safe reunification is pursued, and integrated behavioral health or early intervention services should be engaged early to support the infant's development and the family's functioning [^116EFTGM] [^113oiaR9].

> But wait, what about the distractor options: recommending whiskey for colic is dangerous and inappropriate. Parenting classes alone are insufficient in the setting of admitted physical abuse. And confronting the mother directly risks escalating danger and compromising the mandated reporting process, so the correct course remains immediate safety intervention, mandated reporting, and structured medical evaluation rather than any of these alternatives [^114vMyj3].

> In summary, I should confirm that the best response is to contact Child Protective Services immediately, ensure the infant's safety through hospital admission and coordinated abuse evaluation, communicate transparently and nonjudgmentally with the caregiver about concerns and obligations, and document comprehensively to support the report and ongoing care plan, aligning with evidence-based guidance on suspected infant physical abuse [^111mGxEo] [^114vMyj3].

---

The best response is to **contact child protective services immediately** because the infant is at imminent risk of harm from admitted physical abuse [^114vMyj3] and has concerning injuries [^112VRt6q]. The provider must also **ensure the infant's immediate safety** by arranging hospital admission for evaluation and protection [^111mGxEo], and **document the mother's admission and injuries thoroughly** for legal and medical records [^1165U9pc]. Options A, C, and D are inappropriate: confronting the mother risks escalation, whiskey is dangerous and unethical, and parenting classes are insufficient for acute safety needs [^114vMyj3].

---

## Clinical assessment and documentation

- **Immediate safety assessment**: The infant's swollen, red, and tender backside indicates recent physical trauma, consistent with physical abuse [^114p3hiD].

- **Mother's admission**: The mother's admission of repeatedly striking the infant to stop crying is a clear red flag for physical abuse and necessitates immediate intervention [^111mGxEo].

- **Documentation**: Thorough documentation of the mother's admission, physical findings, and the infant's developmental and social context is essential for legal and medical records [^1165U9pc].

---

## Legal and ethical obligations

- **Mandatory reporting**: Physicians are legally obligated to report suspected child abuse to Child Protective Services (CPS) immediately [^111mGxEo].

- **Confidentiality**: While maintaining confidentiality, the physician must prioritize the infant's safety and well-being, which overrides parental confidentiality in cases of abuse [^notfound].

- **Ethical considerations**: The physician's primary ethical responsibility is to protect the infant from harm, necessitating immediate intervention and reporting [^115jmSXJ].

---

## Recommended immediate actions

- **Contact CPS immediately**: The physician should contact CPS without delay to report the suspected abuse and initiate an investigation [^114vMyj3].

- **Hospital admission**: Arrange for immediate hospital admission of the infant for medical evaluation, protection, and further assessment of injuries [^111mGxEo].

- **Support for the mother**: Provide the mother with resources for postpartum depression, stress management, and parenting support, recognizing her distress and lack of support [^114dX37b].

---

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Evaluation** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Confront the mother directly | - Risks escalation and further harm to the infant <br/> - Not appropriate in this acute setting | Not recommended |
| B. Contact Child Protective Services | - Legally and ethically required <br/> - Ensures infant safety and initiates investigation | Strongly recommended |
| C. Recommend treating the colic with a few drops of whiskey | - Dangerous and unethical <br/> - No evidence supporting this practice | Not recommended |
| D. Encourage the mother to take a class on parenting | - Insufficient to address immediate safety concerns <br/> - Does not prevent further abuse | Not recommended |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The best response is to **contact child protective services immediately**, ensure the infant's safety through hospital admission, and document the mother's admission and injuries thoroughly. This approach fulfills legal and ethical obligations while prioritizing the infant's safety and well-being [^111mGxEo].

### Ongoing pediatric health care for the child who has been maltreated [^116EFTGM]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediatricians provide continuous medical care and anticipatory guidance for children who have been reported to state child protection agencies, including tribal child protection agencies, because of suspected child maltreatment. Because families may continue their relationships with their pediatricians after these reports, these primary care providers are in a unique position to recognize and manage the physical, developmental, academic, and emotional consequences of maltreatment and exposure to childhood adversity. Substantial information is available to optimize follow-up medical care of maltreated children. This new clinical report will provide guidance to pediatricians about how they can best oversee and foster the optimal physical health, growth, and development of children who have been maltreated and remain in the care of their biological family or are returned to their care by Child Protective Services agencies. The report describes the pediatrician's role in helping to strengthen families' and caregivers' capabilities and competencies and in promoting and maximizing high-quality services for their families in their community. Pediatricians should refer to other reports and policies from the American Academy of Pediatrics for more information about the emotional and behavioral consequences of child maltreatment and the treatment of these consequences.

### Perceived social risk in medical decision-making for physical child abuse: a mixed-methods study [^112xVxzb]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study found that the CAP perception of the child's SES is strongly and independently linked to physician perception of risk for abuse after adjustment for physician, child and family characteristics. While the relationship of SES to differential child abuse evaluation has been described previously in non-CAP physicians, this study shows that SES plays a role in CAP perceptions of abuse risk. The experimental model in this study that reversed social risks, demonstrates that CAP social risk perception is associated with diagnostic decision-making.

CAP risk perception for abuse encompasses child, family, parental and social risk indicators; social cues reflecting CAP impressions of the caregivers and their actions; and, non-social cues such as attendance at well child visits. After taking these factors into account, CAP perceptions of risk remained independently associated with the child's perceived SES. While child abuse may be more prevalent in poor communities, population-based studies show that the attributable risk of poverty to abuse is low, that is, most poor families do not abuse their children. Laskey's study found that general pediatricians are more willing to consider an abuse diagnosis among poor children. Our findings add to Laskey's work by using clinical cases rather than scenarios, adjusting for multiple aspects of the social history, and quantifying physicians' perceptions of SES. Prior studies have stratified patient SES based on public/private insurance status which provides little differentiation in this largely publicly insured population. Asking physicians to quantify their perception of SES allowed us to both stratify a race/SES association and to link their perception of SES to social risk.

### Characteristics of child welfare investigations reported by healthcare professionals in Ontario: secondary analysis of a regional database [^1167PvYu]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Child maltreatment has detrimental effects on child health. Healthcare professionals, as mandatory reporters, are one of the best-positioned groups to identify child maltreatment. This is true across various divisions of the healthcare system, while primary care providers are in frequent and continuous contact with families and may notice the initial signs of maltreatment, hospital-based providers may encounter more severe cases of abuse or neglect. Healthcare professionals make up approximately 10% of reports to child welfare services in Canada and play an important role in protecting vulnerable populations such as infants and young children, children with disabilities, and children with physical and mental health conditions. Further, investigations reported to child welfare by healthcare professionals are more likely to be substantiated than reports from non-professional sources (eg, relatives, community members).

Existing literature has explored the characteristics of investigations reported to child welfare by hospital-based providers, including emergency department physicians. Within the Canadian context, an analysis of data from the Ontario Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect 2013 (OIS-2013) revealed that investigations reported by hospital-based providers most often involved concerns for children at risk of future maltreatment, followed by concerns of exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), neglect and physical abuse. Investigations that assess whether a child is at risk of future maltreatment are not focused on alleged maltreatment but rather on assessing if risk factors in the child's environment may lead to future maltreatment, including concerns about the caregiver. Hospital-based reports are often initiated because caregivers require acute care for medical needs related to domestic violence, substance abuse or a mental health crisis. Studies examining maltreatment concerns originating from emergency departments in the USA show high rates of physical abuse and neglect, likely due to severe injury presentation. In both the USA and Canada, young children, particularly infants, are more likely to be hospitalised due to severe maltreatment-related injuries.

Mary Bridge Children's Hospital — non-accidental trauma (NAT) screening red flags identify concerning history, physical exam, and imaging features for suspected physical abuse. Historical "Red Flag" items include no or inconsistent history, changing or unwitnessed injury, delay in seeking care, prior ED visit, domestic violence in the home, prematurity "(< 37 weeks)", low birth weight/IUGR, chronic medical conditions, and referral for suspected child abuse. Physical exam "Red Flag" findings in infants include torn frenulum, failure to thrive, and "Large heads in infants (consider measuring of OFC in children < 1 yr)", as well as "Any bruise in any non-ambulatory child - "if you don't cruise you don't bruise", bruising in non‑exploratory locations (TEN region: Torso, Ears, Neck), patterned bruises/marks/scars, and perineal bruising or injury. Radiographic "Red Flag" findings include metaphyseal ("corner") fractures, rib fractures (especially posterior) in infants, any fracture in a non-ambulatory infant, an undiagnosed healing fracture, and "SDH and/or SAH on neuro-imaging in young children, particularly in the absence of skull fracture < 1 year".

### What parents know matters: parental knowledge at birth predicts caregiving behaviors at 9 Months [^112Ze1xm]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the mediating role of socioeconomically disadvantaged parents' knowledge of early cognitive and language development at the first postpartum visit in the relation between education and caregiving behaviors at 9 months.

Study Design

Parental knowledge was assessed at the 1-week newborn visit (n = 468); anticipatory guidance received and desired at 1-month (n = 212) and 6-month (n = 191) visits were reported; and caregiving behaviors toward infants during a teaching task were observed at 9-month visit (n = 173).

Results

We found substantial variation in knowledge and caregiving behaviors. Parents who had more knowledge of infant development at 1 week were more likely to respond to cues (r = 0.18; P < .05) and foster social-emotional (r = 0.17; P < .05) and cognitive growth (r = 0.20; P < .05) at 9 months. Importantly, the indirect effect of education on cognitive growth fostering at 9 months through knowledge at 1 week was significant, controlling for primary language and number of other children in the home (infancy: β = 0.06; B = 0.07; SE = 0.04; 95% CI, 0.007–0.165; early childhood: β = 0.04; B = 0.06; SE = 0.03; 95% CI, 0.008–0.152). Open-ended responses indicated that anticipatory guidance in the first 6 months focused on infant physical growth; however, parents did not request additional anticipatory guidance from their pediatricians.

Conclusions

This study sheds light on the importance of promoting parental knowledge about cognitive and language development to foster parental cognitive stimulations and language inputs during the first year of life. This study highlights the important role of anticipatory guidance on cognitive and language development during the earliest well-child visits and the need to better understand parental baseline knowledge to tailor anticipatory guidance to the family strengths and needs.

### Outcomes after injury prevention counselling in a paediatric office setting: a 25-year review [^116bDEUn]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

Injuries continue to cause more deaths in US children than all non-communicable and infectious diseases combined. However, these deaths are only a small part of the problem. For every child that dies, approximately 25 children are hospitalised and 925 are treated in emergency departments, costing close to $300 billion annually to US citizens. Injury prevention (IP) advocates continue to find ways to address this problem through new product innovations, passing legislation or making environments safer for children. Another technique is to educate families about potential age-appropriate risks so that caregivers are aware of potential hazards, and they can implement preventative strategies. Primary care providers (PCPs) have typically been tasked with screening families for risk of unintentional injuries and providing age-appropriate safety counselling. Professional societies and national task forces encourage PCPs to have these conversations at every office encounter. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), in its Bright Futures recommendations for health maintenance, recommends specific topics for IP counselling at each well-child visit.

### Practice of general pediatrics in Saudi arabia: current status, challenges, and opportunities [^111SCSid]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Study participants

The study was able to attract pediatricians from four hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Many pediatricians (a total of five) declined to participate and did not consent to be audio recorded due to the novelty of medical qualitative research in Saudi Arabia. Even residents were hesitant, and four excused themselves from participating. Table 1.

Table 1
Study participants? characteristics

Value and attitude

All consultants and trainees appreciate general pediatricians' roles in Saudi society. They understand the value of their care and feel they have a more significant part to play in population growth and the Saudi 2030 vision. A pediatrician stated, "General pediatric is a basic necessity next to education for Saudi society, " and another pediatrician said, "General pediatric is the cornerstone of pediatric medicine, and no hospital can function without it". However, trainees had a negative attitude toward general pediatrics as a specialty. One trainee stated, "It (general pediatrics) is a non-specialized field (laughing), yes, really!"

Type and time of Care

The majority of participants think that general pediatricians should be considered primary care providers in Saudi Arabia. They believe in their duty to both healthy and sick children. The idea of having a general pediatrician for each child in the Kingdom was a common goal among participants. Still, all pediatricians voiced concerns about the lack of qualified providers to meet public demands. One pediatrician stated, "Saudi public is ready for the idea of a pediatrician for every child, but we do not have enough doctors". Regarding the current "Well Baby Clinic Module of Care", all participants raised some concerns. From being overcrowded to the lack of qualified providers, the module is not meeting the Ministry of Health's designed standard of care. A pediatric resident protested, "Clinic (well-baby clinic) is open for vaccines (only)". The current scheduled first visit at the age of two months was subject to criticism by all participants. They all wished for an earlier first visit, ranging from between two days from discharge to a maximum of the first two weeks of life. The first visit can be used for early detection, breastfeeding support, follow-up on jaundice, and anticipatory guidance for parents, especially first-time parents. All of the pediatricians shared stories of complications of the current delayed first visit. One pediatrician had a child developing kernicterus because of jaundice and delayed presentation to pediatric care.

### A 6-month-old with vaccine-hesitant parents [^112WztQm]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Many primary care pediatricians find vaccine hesitancy to be one of the most frustrating situations that they face. Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children implicitly call into question an intervention that most pediatricians see as one of the safest and most effective health care interventions of all time. Many pediatricians respond by refusing to care for children whose parents refuse vaccines, and some may consider that the parent's refusal warrants referral to child protective services. We present a case in which a pediatrician faces this dilemma, with responses from pediatricians in academia and private practice.

Skeletal injuries — age patterns and abuse prevalence note that children presenting with fractures from PCA are typically very young, with 68–80% of patients less than 18–24 months of age, and that it is estimated that 24.9% of all fractures in children younger than 1 year of age are attributable to abuse. Seriously consider PCA in non-ambulatory infants, because the energy from the usual reported fall mechanism is inadequate to cause the fracture.

### Frequent pediatric emergency department use in infancy and early childhood [^117GFk9G]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the threshold and population factors associated with pediatric emergency department (PED) use above the norm during the first 36 months of life.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study of children born between 2003 and 2006, treated in a single PED within the first 36 months of life. Exclusion criteria included out-of-county residence or history of abuse or neglect. The primary outcome, frequent PED use, was defined by the 90th percentile for PED visits per patient. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors associated with frequent PED use.

Results

A total of 41,912 visits occurred for 16,664 patients during the study. Pediatric ED use skewed heavily toward less than 2 visits per patient (median, 2; range, 1–39; interquartile range, 2). The threshold for frequent PED use was 5 or more visits per patient and occurred for 14% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 13%-15%) of patients. Most visits were coded with low acuity International Classifications of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes. The following factors were strongly associated with frequent PED use: lack of primary care physician (odds ratio [OR], 6.03; 95% CI, 5.39%-6.80%; P < 0.0001), non private insurance (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 2.99%-4.46%; P < 0.0001), and history of inpatient admission (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.66%-2.24%; P < 0.0001). Leaving without being seen, black race, Hispanic ethnicity, and residence in a poverty-associated zip code were also significantly associated, but less strongly predictive of, frequent PED use.

Conclusions

The threshold for frequent PED use was more than 5 visits per patient within the first 36 months of life. Further study is needed to better define this population and develop targeted interventions to ensure care provision occurs in the ideal setting.

### Patient safety in medical imaging: a joint paper of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the European federation of radiographer societies (EFRS) [^1168G2K6]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Protection of children and other vulnerable persons

Aside from examination or procedure-specific paediatric considerations, child protection is an extremely important issue in patient safety. According to the European Commission and UNICEF, comprehensive national child protection systems must be in place which should apply to all aspects of a child's life. There is an onus on all health professionals in medical imaging departments to respect and protect the rights of the child. In many jurisdictions, radiologists and radiographers will also have legal responsibilities related to the reporting of suspected physical abuse of children/suspected non-accidental injury. While some children may be referred for imaging examinations where there is a pre-existing suspicion of abuse, other cases may only become apparent when radiologists, and radiographers in particular, are interacting with children and their parents or guardians.

Attention must also be given to other vulnerable persons which may include: the elderly, those with memory complaints, intellectual disabilities, or mental health issues. In any such cases, appropriate systems to facilitate communication and consent should be in place. These systems must include the requirements for responsible adults, guardians, or chaperones.

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable", with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### Healthy steps: a case study of innovation in pediatric practice [^114dX37b]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Healthy Steps (HS) represents a significant innovation in the way pediatric primary care can be delivered. Based on the standards and principles of Bright Futures and the American Academy of Pediatrics Health Supervision Guidelines, HS enhances and expands traditional pediatric care by including a child development specialist (Healthy Steps specialist) as part of the pediatric practice team. Services offered by this person, typically a nurse, early childhood educator, or social worker, include more time to spend discussing preventive issues during well-child visits, home visits, a telephone information line exclusively addressing developmental and behavioral concerns, new written materials, and more seamless linkages to community resources and parent support groups. The original HS cohort consisted of 15 pediatric practices in a variety of settings (private practices, health centers, pediatric training programs). Evaluated for the effects of HS on their family were 3737 intervention and comparison families. HS families received significantly more preventive and developmental services, compared to families in the control group. HS families were also less likely to be dissatisfied with their pediatric primary care. Additionally, HS had a positive impact on parenting in many areas including adherence to health visits, nutritional practices, developmental stimulation, appropriate disciplinary techniques, and correct sleeping position. Other outcome measures (such as initiation or duration of breastfeeding, child development knowledge, sense of competence, and reports of child language development at 2 years of age) did not differ between intervention and comparison group. Compared to other early childhood intervention efforts, HS offers a comparable positive impact on parenting at a relatively inexpensive cost: an estimated 400 dollars per family per year (compared to 4500 dollars from Early Head Start). Approximately 3 years after the evaluation of HS ended, 10 of the original 24 sites are still in operation, and an additional 24 sites have started up. Although funding and reimbursement remain an important barrier, continued growth of HS suggests an abiding interest in this approach to expand and enhance preventive and developmental care in pediatric primary care.

### Developmental screening: is there enough time? [^111KCQUh]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine developmental screening in well-child care. Providers cite time restraints as a limitation preventing its widespread adoption. The objectives were to determine whether routine screening lengthened well-visits and was associated with changes in parent satisfaction and report of anticipatory guidance.

Methods

Visits before and after implementation of routine screening were timed. Parents whose children were seen before or after screening began were contacted to query their perceptions of the visit.

Results

There was no change in visit lengths after the screener was included. With screening, more parents reported their provider talked about their concerns, and that their questions were answered. There were no changes in parent satisfaction ratings or reports of anticipatory guidance discussions.

Conclusions

The perceived obstacle that routine screening requires more time than pediatricians have should not prevent its adoption. Screening tools may empower some parents otherwise reluctant to raise concerns unsolicited.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^117REejW]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Shared decision-making and family information — For purposes of this guideline, the committee believes that at a minimum, families should be provided with information about the risks and benefits of all procedures, including invasive procedures such as a lumbar puncture (LP) and a bladder catheterization, and an opportunity for questions and dialogue between the family and care team should be provided. Clinicians work in different settings with a range of familiarity with their patients and families, access to medical records, and abilities to follow-up with patients in a timely fashion, and families possess a spectrum of knowledge and skills to continuously observe and assess infants discharged from the hospital, with considerable interest in shared decision-making including a recent mobile device app to help clinicians communicate with parents. The decision to actively monitor an infant at home or in the hospital requires a collaborative discussion between the family and the care team.

Disposition — ED suspected NAT: If any suspicion of NAT has been raised during the ED encounter, a face-to-face care team 'huddle' must take place prior to ED discharge, and all members involved in the patient's care should participate including (at a minimum) the ED physician, ED RN and Social Worker. Medical/Surgical trauma service admission with Q4 hour neuro checks for further child abuse work up, and consider PICU admission for any child with intracranial injury/bleed or skull fracture(s) identified on head CT. For suspected NAT cases not involving head trauma, admission to Medical/Surgical or PICU after injuries are reviewed by ED MD and Pediatric General Surgeon as medically indicated. The plan includes prior to hospital discharge: care team 'huddle' including all members involved in the patient's care; phone communication may be utilized as necessary; and outpatient CAID follow-up as needed.

### Selective skeletal surveys for infants with skull fractures: examining the rates of return to medical care for concern of physical abuse [^112vrC55]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to describe which infants with a skull fracture (1) receive a child abuse pediatrician (CAP) consultation, (2) receive a skeletal survey, and (3) re-present to medical care before age 3 years with concerns for physical abuse.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of infants younger than 12 months who presented to the emergency department between January 1, 2005, and December 30, 2015, with a skull fracture. Medical records were reviewed for the skull fracture presentation and for all future medical evaluations at the same institution with concerns for physical abuse until 3 years of age.

Results

Of 366 infants with a skull fracture, a CAP was contacted for 272 (74%) and 76 (20.8%) infants who received a skeletal survey. Factors associated with skeletal survey acquisition included younger age (< 6 months), no history to explain the skull fracture, other injuries on examination, and social risk factors. Six children (1.6%) re-presented to medical care with concerns of physical abuse before age 3 years. Five of these infants did not have a skeletal survey at the time of their skull fracture, and 1 was likely a case of missed physical abuse at the time of the skull fracture.

Discussion

Most skull fractures in infancy occur accidentally, and a skeletal survey may not be necessary for every infant. Obtaining a thorough history including social risk factors, performing a complete physical examination, and consulting with a CAP is an effective first step in the evaluation of physical abuse in infants with skull fractures.

### Patterns of skeletal fractures in child abuse: systematic review [^115imTb3]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review has combined cross sectional studies in a meta-analysis to estimate the probability of abuse given rib fractures, skull fractures, or long bone fractures. We have also identified features related to the child or type of fracture sustained that should alert clinicians to consider physical abuse as a possible cause (box 2).

In the absence of a confirmed traumatic cause, rib fractures had the highest probability (71%) of being caused by abuse. Humeral fractures had a one in two chance of being the result of abuse, and for femoral or skull fractures the estimated probability was one in three. Fractures resulting from abuse have been described in virtually every bone in the body. Published studies of bone fractures not described in this review were limited to small case series and case studies, and a comparative analysis was not possible.

Causes of fractures

We identified a strong inverse relation between the age of the child and the likelihood of a fracture from abuse. A greater breakdown of age related data presented in the primary studies would have been beneficial to the analysis. Overall, the primary studies confirmed that the pattern and causes of fractures varied considerably at different stages of the child's age and development. Osteopenia of prematurity and bone dysplasia were reported in the infant and toddler age group and should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis, with appropriate investigations to exclude associated clinical, skeletal, and biochemical abnormalities. The prevalence of non-abusive traumatic causes increased with age. This is unsurprising because of the different hazards and environments that children are exposed to as they grow up. Clinicians who work in the child protection field need an understanding of some of the basic biomechanics behind childhood injuries to inform their decisions as to whether causal explanations for a fracture are plausible.

### Long term follow up of high risk children: who, why and how? [^113dhzP7]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical care

If the major goal of follow-up is to provide ongoing clinical care for a high-risk child, a minimal checklist of areas to cover for a health professional, such as a paediatrician, would be represented by the shaded areas in Additional file 1: Table S1. Depending on what is found at each assessment, referral for more thorough evaluation of some areas might be required. If progress is otherwise satisfactory, then follow-up could be limited to the areas highlighted, but occasionally other issues might require assessment.

The issue of how long to follow a child who is progressing normally and whose family is coping appropriately will depend on many circumstances. Children at two years who are walking freely with no abnormal neurological signs, talking in 2–3 word sentences, with no vision or hearing problems, whose parents have no major behavioural concerns, and who have no other health problems that require ongoing care, and whose family is functioning well, can be discharged from specialist surveillance and referred back to primary care services, with a clear management and follow-up plan. Whether later assessments at preschool or early school ages are warranted could be decided on an individual basis and informed by screening during primary care visits or by family concerns. However, it must be recognised that many of the cognitive and academic problems that occur at school-age will not be predicted by progress in the first few years of life. Many high-risk children will not be able to function adequately in the preschool or school setting. They will remain undiagnosed and unassessed until they have failed and been brought to the attention of someone at an age that is usually too late for effective intervention. Ideally the highest risk children should be reassessed prior to school entry, and after the first few years at school. The reality is that resources are limited, and few centres are able to offer such assessments routinely, even though the cost of follow-up is minimal compared with the cost of providing intensive care. While the cost of follow-up needs to be acknowledged, the cost of inaction, which is more difficult to measure, may be much greater. Moreover, one of the other difficulties experienced by families is that once they are 'out of the system', it is hard to get back in to mobilise the resources required quickly. As a minimum, parents of high risk children, health professionals and educators need to be "alert but not alarmed" and advised that serious issues can still arise at later times. Maintaining good records of previous assessments will facilitate reassessments at later ages.

### Pediatric emergency department visits due to child abuse and neglect following COVID-19 public health emergency declaration in the southeastern United States [^114iCLoF]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Measures

The primary outcomes are (1) the number of visits admitted through the ED that involved CAN; (2) the rate of ED visits that were CAN visits; and (3) the proportion of CAN visits that were identified as a specific maltreatment type along with child characteristics (e.g. age and sex). The first measure is the raw number of pediatric ED visits where a professional suspected CAN, as measured by chart review, regardless of the chief concern for the visit. The second measure is the number of visits that were identified as CAN divided by the total number of ED visits (per 1,000 visits). This measure indicates whether there was a shift in the prominence of CAN cases in the ED during the pandemic. The final outcome measure is the number of ED visits that consist of different types of maltreatment (any form of neglect, neglect due to a lack of supervision, medical neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse), a measure of acuity (whether the CAN visit resulted in time spent in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)), and child characteristics (ages 0–1, 2–5, 6–10, 11–17, female, male, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, Asian, or Hispanic), divided by the total number of CAN-related visits. In other words, this measure is the percent of all CAN-visits that consist of various maltreatment types, severity of CAN, or specific child characteristics. Child characteristics are parent-reported. Race/ethnicity is often reported in a non-standard manner and is missing for approximately 6% of cases; therefore, we are cautious in our interpretation of the differences across race/ethnicity. When performing the age, sex, and race/ethnicity-specific analyses, the denominators of ED visits are limited to ED visits among those age groups, sexes, and races/ethnicities. The maltreatment type is designated by the social worker who responds to the case, and are not mutually exclusive; for example, a visit may be labeled both physical abuse and neglect due to lack of supervision.

### Efficacy of the small step program in a randomised controlled trial for infants below age 12 months with clinical signs of CP; a study protocol [^1136qpSV]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Theoretical background for the small step program – the child's perspective

The Small Step Program is an individualized, goal directed, and intensive intervention that focuses on hand use, mobility, and communication. The program is intended to be carried out in the child's home environment and be conducted by their parents who are trained and coached by therapists. The program is designed be used from about 4 months of age and seeks to take advantage of the theoretically plastic period of brain development at this age. The program is designed to include and combine components that are known to be of importance in evidence-based intervention approaches for older children. The challenge in the Small Step Program is to adapt this knowledge and apply it within an intervention for very young children.

The goal-directed approach has been successfully used in older children. However, for families in a very vulnerable time period of life, with a young infant with high risk of developing CP, it is not easy to define goals in either the short or long-term perspective. In a goal-setting approach, the person's own individual wishes are a strong ingredient, and it is suggested that the goals should be functional and meaningful for daily life. Such a goal-centred approach is taken in the Small Step Program, and collaboration between the parents and therapists will help the family to determine and focus on what their infant will likely be able to learn as a next step within the different foci and to define goals that are closely related to the child's ability and cognitive level.

Within the Small Step Program, great emphasis is put on children's self-initiated actions, which are stimulated by meaningful and motivating activities and toys. The stimuli should be clear and understandable for the child and should be related to the child's developmental stage. It is assumed that development is driven by children's unique characteristics and capacity to explore a situation through which they discover new and more advanced activities. Therefore, the training should be conducted at a level that is challenging, but not too demanding, i.e. the training should fall within the zone of proximal development, ZPD. The scaffolding and shared attentional focus provided by the ZPD aims to ensure that the child's interest is maintained for as long as possible, which will promote the internalisation of independent developmental achievements. This concept is commonly applied within motor learning programs. The challenge here lies in helping parents understand how self-initiated actions can be promoted for infants with a very low ability level.

Notification of family — suspected NAT: The communication should clarify that medical providers are not investigators and that that will be the role of Child Protective Services. Inform parents if a CPS Referral has been filed and/or if Child Advocacy is consulted, and notification to family should be straightforward and non-punitive. Be direct and objective, inform parents inflicted trauma is part of diagnostic consideration, keep the focus on the child, avoid appearing judgmental, and assure parents of thoroughness of evaluation. If you are unable to have this conversation with the parents, ask SWS or a senior colleague to do so.

### Child abuse inventory at emergency rooms: CHAIN-ER rationale and design [^113GysNV]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Procedure

In the standard clinical care, the first step in the process of recognition of child abuse is completing the SPUTOVAMO-R by ER professionals during the ER visit. SPUTOVAMO-R is to be considered positive for the suspicion of physical child abuse when at least one of the six questions is deviant. The result of this first step will predominantly determine the consecutive clinical work-up for the potentially maltreated child. A suspicion of child abuse by the ER professional (positively screened SPUTOVAMO-R) is followed by a systematic workup for possible child abuse starting with a pediatric consultation in the ER. After the work-up, all screened positive cases are discussed in the multidisciplinary Child Abuse Team in the presence of the Child Protection Services.

The research procedure for the study subjects runs parallel to the clinical work up and is as follows. All SPUTOVAMO-R positives and a random sample of the SPUTOVAMO-R negatives will undergo the same systematic diagnostic work up. For the expert panel it is unfeasible to perform such an extensive reference test in all 5,000 cases and therefore a random sample of 15% of the negative SPUTOVAMO-R cases will be taken. Before the start of the study, all ER personnel will be adequately trained in objectively recognizing child abuse and in filling in the SPUTOVAMO-R form.

The diagnostic work up for this study will be supplementary to the essential clinical care and consists of several extra steps. First, pediatricians will clarify the initial injury for all study subjects. In order to be sure that the expert panel will have access to all necessary information to judge the SPUTOVAMO-R results, pediatricians will phone all included families to ask any additional questions related to the injury, which are not apparently asked or documented in the ER report. Second, identification of child abuse risk factors will be assessed by parental, general practitioners' and youth health care giver's questionnaires. These risk factors will include factors regarding the child, its parents and its family. Third, additional information about the event under study, as well as information about potential later ER visits, during a 6 months follow up period will be obtained.

### Well-child care clinical practice redesign for serving low-income children [^112eDXXq]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Our objective was to conduct a rigorous, structured process to create a new model of well-child care (WCC) in collaboration with a multisite community health center and 2 small, independent practices serving predominantly Medicaid-insured children. Working groups of clinicians, staff, and parents (called "Community Advisory Boards" [CABs]) used (1) perspectives of WCC stakeholders and (2) a literature review of WCC practice redesign to create 4 comprehensive WCC models for children ages 0 to 3 years. An expert panel, following a modified version of the Rand/UCLA Appropriateness Method, rated each model for potential effectiveness on 4 domains: (1) receipt of recommended services, (2) family-centeredness, (3) timely and appropriate follow-up, and (4) feasibility and efficiency. Results were provided to the CABs for selection of a final model to implement. The newly developed models rely heavily on a health educator for anticipatory guidance and developmental, behavioral, and psychosocial surveillance and screening. Each model allots a small amount of time with the pediatrician to perform a brief physical examination and to address parents' physical health concerns. A secure Web-based tool customizes the visit to parents' needs and facilitates previsit screening. Scheduled, non-face-to-face methods (text, phone) for parent communication with the health care team are also critical to these new models of care. A structured process that engages small community practices and community health centers in clinical practice redesign can produce comprehensive, site-specific, and innovative models for delivery of WCC. This process, as well as the models developed, may be applicable to other small practices and clinics interested in practice redesign.

### A directed content analysis of discussions between mothers and pediatricians around feeding and growth topics during infant well-child visits [^117RRk2H]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

This study identified specific feeding and growth topics discussed during 2-, 4-, and 6-month well-child visits. Conversations between mothers (N = 20) and pediatricians (N = 5) during visits were audio-recorded. Conversation segments were classified as pediatrician-initiated guidance, mother-initiated questions/concerns, or updates using directed content analysis. Pediatricians and mothers completed surveys on perceptions of guidance delivered. Feeding clusters included introducing solids/drinks, breast milk/formula amount and timing, feeding in specific situations; and breast milk/formula preparation. Growth clusters included appropriate growth and growth tracking. There was considerable variability in specific topics discussed between and within families across visits. Mothers desired additional guidance around introducing solids (42.1%) and allergen foods (31.6%). Pediatricians (80%) felt the amount of guidance to deliver in a standard visit was too much, and additional guidance outside of visits would benefit caregivers. Future research should investigate strategies to further support families by offering additional guidance during or outside of well-child visits.

### Variations in guidelines for diagnosis of child physical abuse in high-income countries: a systematic review [^115safVN]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The highly variable practices observed regarding the early detection and diagnostic workup of suspected child physical abuse contribute to suboptimal care and could be partially related to discrepancies in clinical guidelines.

Objective

To systematically evaluate the completeness, clarity, and consistency of guidelines for child physical abuse in high-income countries.

Evidence Review

For this systematic review, national or regional guidelines that were disseminated from 2010 to 2020 related to the early detection and diagnostic workup of child physical abuse in infants aged 2 years or younger by academic societies or health agencies in high-income countries were retrieved. The definitions of sentinel injuries and the recommended diagnostic workup (imaging and laboratory tests) for child physical abuse were compared. Data were analyzed from July 2020 to February 2021.

Findings

Within the 20 included guidelines issued in 15 countries, 168 of 408 expected statements (41%) were missing and 10 statements (4%) were unclear. Among 16 guidelines characterizing sentinel injuries, all of them included skin injuries, such as bruises, hematoma, or burns, but only 8 guidelines (50%) included intraoral injuries and fractures. All 20 guidelines agreed on the indication for radiological skeletal survey, head computed tomography, and head magnetic resonance imaging but differed for those of bone scintigraphy, follow-up skeletal survey, spinal magnetic resonance imaging, cranial ultrasonography, chest computed tomography, and abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography. Additionally, 16 guidelines agreed on exploring primary hemostasis and coagulation but not on the tests to perform, and 8 guidelines (50%) mentioned the need to investigate bone metabolism.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that guidelines for the diagnosis of child physical abuse in infants were often clear but lacked completeness and were discrepant on major issues. These results may help identify priorities for well-designed original diagnostic accuracy studies, systematic reviews, or an international consensus process to produce clear and standardized guidelines to optimize practices and infant outcomes.

### Reactions of non-abused children aged 3–9 years to the sexual knowledge picture instrument: an interview-based study [^111tBH4i]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The estimated worldwide prevalence of child sexual abuse (CSA) ranges between 0.4% and 31%. The consequences of CSA can be major, affecting both short-term and long-term health and having both physical (from acute injuries to life-long chronic diseases) and psychosocial (eg, depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse and difficulties in forming intimate and trusting relationships) manifestations. In order to offer timely and appropriate care for victims, it is necessary for medical and psychological care professionals to recognise CSA early. Related physical injuries might heal quickly, and young children in particular experience many barriers to disclosing abuse. Symptoms of PTSD and age-inappropriate sexual behaviour and knowledge are considered the most commonly identified signs of CSA.

Meanwhile, research on adult survivors of CSA shows that some of the cues the survivors gave as young children, such as telling about the abuse 'in their own words' or showing non-verbal and behavioural signs, remained unidentified by professional caregivers over time.

The Sexual Knowledge Picture Instrument (SKPI) is a child-friendly picture book that was developed for professionals to assess a child's knowledge of intimate body parts, intimacy, and adult sexuality, and to observe their non-verbal reactions at the same time. The pictures show daily routines in the lives of most children, gender differences, body parts and their functions, and normal intimate behaviour between children and/or adults. A manual for professionals was also developed. The manual contains instructions, a semi-structured interviewing protocol, and a scoring list for the evaluation of verbal and non-verbal reactions of the child. The SKPI is currently being validated in a study to determine its value as a diagnostic tool for CSA in young children. The main hypothesis in this study is that abused children can be distinguished from non-abused children by their verbal and non-verbal reactions to the instrument, and that looking at the pictures may lower the burden for abused children to disclose.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^114vMyj3]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Child abuse screening — communicating with families — prioritizes clear, culturally sensitive, and direct communication with concrete actions for clinicians and institutions. Key directives include "Effectively communicate with families about the physical child abuse screening process to maintain open lines of communication". During screening, "it is essential to develop rapport with the family and patient during the initial encounter", to "Maintain a high level of cultural sensitivity", and to recognize that "Awareness of a patient's socioeconomic, neighborhood, ethnic, and religious background is critical". Institutional expectations include that "Health care facilities need to institute cultural competency training", that "The Joint Commission requires hospitals to address cultural competency, effective communication, and patient- and family-centered care", and that "the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) encourage providers to have cultural competence training". Communication principles "include" to "Clearly state your role as an advocate for the child or adolescent", "Be direct and objective as you proceed through the screening process", "Use a neutral tone and avoid accusatory statements to present the appearance of being nonjudgmental", and "Notify parents that physical abuse is a consideration in the trauma work up of their child and that abuse can occur without obvious physical examination findings". After the interview process, "explain your particular concerns and your duty to report the suspicion of child abuse". Then, "introduce the need for and role of other services (such as the Child Abuse team) and agencies (such as CPS and Law Enforcement) that help complete the patient assessment", "Inform the family that you are available to address any further concerns throughout the assessment process", and "If at any time you feel uncomfortable having these conversations, involve social work or a senior colleague".

### Methadone hydrochloride (methadone) [^116fbQx7]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

Methadone is a μ-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to that of morphine and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Methadone, like morphine and other opioids used for analgesia, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion.

Abuse

Drug addiction is characterized by a preoccupation with the procurement, hoarding, and abuse of drugs for non-medicinal purposes. Drug addiction is treatable, utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach, but relapse is common.

"Drug seeking" behavior is very common to addicts and drug abusers. Drug seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of the office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addictions.

Physical Dependence and Tolerance

Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Methadone Hydrochloride Injection, like other opioids, may be diverted for non-medical use. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.

Abuse of Methadone Hydrochloride Injection poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Methadone Hydrochloride Injection with alcohol and other substances. In addition, parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious disease such as hepatitis and HIV.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids may also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal symptoms (See PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy and Labor and Delivery)

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^1165U9pc]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Trauma center documentation of suspected abuse — history source attribution, limits of forensic interviewing, avoidance of templated histories, and interpreter use are specified as follows: It is appropriate to document the suspicion of PCA ("rule out abuse" and "suspected/probable abuse") and an injury that is NOT consistent with a stated mechanism. If the history is available from the primary caretaker responsible for the child/adult at the time of injury, then document this; if the history is only available from the health professional report or EMS, then clearly document this in the chart. Avoid using templated or "cut and paste" medical, social, family, and medication histories because these are known to contain errors. Forensic interviewing is beyond the scope of clinical trauma providers, therefore, do NOT focus questions solely on identifying the perpetrator; this forensic information is obtained by specialty trained providers or law enforcement at a later time. Health professionals often obtain medical histories when they have limited ability to speak a second language; do NOT employ this practice in a possible abused patient. When it becomes apparent that a patient has injuries related to potential abuse, re-take the history with the assistance of a credentialed interpreter, and document the identity of the interpreter; a health professional must be able to testify in court that he or she is bilingual, or the history taken by a non-fluent provider is not valid. Use caution when taking a history from a patient or caretaker with limited English, Always offer an interpreter, and if declined, document that as well, and document specifically which questions parents/caregivers were asked that demonstrate an apparently fluent conversation with the health professional.

### Bilateral fibular fractures in a pre-ambulant infant [^115NSMUg]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

This fracture pattern has been reported in a 10-month-old girl following repetitive banging of the child's walker (supported ambulation) against a kitchen cabinet with her lower legs at the level of the fractures. They have also been described in a 26-month-old boy, for whom there was no history of trauma or other apparent explanation. We acknowledge that there is no proof of our proposed hypothesis. In an infant of this age, a personalised biomechanical and/or finite element testing of this mechanism would be required, similar to a recently published study investigating rolling as a mechanism for humeral fractures in non-ambulant infants.

Where radiologic evidence of bony injury in infants and young children has been identified, it must be considered within the clinical context in which it is presented, and a determination made as to whether any proffered history or mechanism of injury could account for the injury. The objective evidence of multiple episodes of sustained repetitive banging of our patient's legs against the metal frame of his playpen was accepted as the causative mechanism of injury. It is vital that physical abuse is excluded as the cause of injury, as a misdiagnosis risks leaving a child with abusive parents or caregivers. Other less common non-inflicted causes of otherwise unexplained fractures must also be considered to avoid an incorrect diagnosis of physical abuse and erroneously separating a child from their parents or caregivers. Both scenarios are potentially damaging to children and their caregivers. Radiologic imaging constitutes only part of the investigation of suspected physical abuse and clinicians must ensure that an overview of the clinical picture is presented to formulate a reasoned diagnosis based on all the available evidence.

### Sentinel surveillance of child maltreatment cases presenting to Canadian emergency departments [^111yK77Y]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Non-health care professionals were identified as involved in 5% of cases. The majority of these cases indicated the involvement of child welfare (4%) for 'maltreatment by a parent or caregiver'. Other non-health care professionals, such as law enforcement, were identified as involved in less than 1% of cases.

In 4% of cases, maltreatment reportedly occurred during a visitation period with a parent or step-parent. Finally, children were reportedly removed from their home in just over 1% of cases.

Distribution of CM type by age and gender

Table 2 presents the frequencies of CM types by age and gender. Female patients accounted for 88% of sexual assault cases while male patients tended to have slightly higher prevalence of physical abuse, neglect, and injury due to exposure to family violence. Physical abuse and sexual assault were more prevalent among older children (aged 12–15 years), while younger children were more likely to be brought to ED for neglect (1–3 years) and injury due to exposure to family violence (< 1 years). Sexual assaults were identified among all age groups with children under the age of one, followed by children 8–11 years showing the lowest levels.

### Child abuse: behavioral aspects and other associated problems [^1175NbH2]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Although researchers in psychology and the social sciences will need to continue to identify the behavioral consequences of abuse and treatment strategies, pediatricians may still be the first line professionals to suspect and intercept victims. Remember that, especially in cases where there have been threats or falsification of illness, it is wise to enlist integrated multidisciplinary services to ensure the safety of the child before confronting any potential perpetrators. Physicians have become better trained to be more vigilant in detecting signs of physical abuse, but it seems that psychologic and sexual maltreatment may cause more long-term problems but are more difficult to detect. Although a book by Everett and Gallop is written for mental health professionals, the chapters on why a history of childhood trauma is often missed, recognizing signs and symptoms, and asking about abuse, are all helpful for pediatricians and other health care professionals. In certain situations, physicians should attempt to talk to children privately, so that those who are old enough might have an opportunity to relate events that are traumatic, and so that abusive parents will not have an opportunity to interrupt, instill additional fear in the child, or abruptly change providers. Children need someone to ask them directly about their experiences and act on any suspicions. Asking once may not be enough, because a frightened child may initially deny physical or sexual abuse, but be ready to tell at another time. A vocal adult survivor of Munchausen syndrome by proxy and severe physical abuse explains: The dilemma is how to be loved and accepted. Even once a child recognizes that it is wrong, victims may be afraid to speak up for fear of anger and more abuse at the hand of the abuser. By the time I reached eleven, I was angry enough at what my mother had gotten away with, I would have been more truthful. It would have been a relief to have someone else voice their own suspicions. But, no one ever asked and I could not be the one to give away my mother or the love of my family. Although society is still struggling with its ability to prevent abuse, it must also be concerned with dealing with its consequences. The problem seems overwhelming in its enormity and the resources do not seem to be adequate to tackle these issues so basic to the care and nurturing of children. Nonetheless, physicians must keep their eyes open to behaviors that signal distress, recognize and strive to eliminate the underlying cause, and make certain that children receive treatment to minimize the myriad of behavioral and other long-term problems that are associated with child abuse.

### Should our well-child care system be redesigned? A national survey of pediatricians [^1154sBtP]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to examine pediatricians' views about whether and how well-child care for children 0 to 5 years of age should be changed.

Methods

A mail survey of a national random sample of 1000 general pediatricians was performed with a survey instrument that examined pediatricians' attitudes and behaviors toward our current way and an ideal way of providing well-child care. Results were analyzed for the following 3 major domains of change in well-child care: provider type, visit format, and visit location.

Results

Sixty percent (n = 502) of eligible subjects responded to the survey. Nearly all respondents (97%) rated the current US system as excellent or good in providing well-child care. Most pediatricians (85%-91%) reported that they are currently the main providers of anticipatory guidance, developmental screening, and psychosocial screening. However, a majority (54%-60%) reported that, in an ideal system that maximized the effectiveness and efficiency of care, nonphysicians would provide these services. Fewer pediatricians (24%) reported that ideally nonphysicians should provide the physical examination. The majority of respondents (79%-93%) reported that at least some anticipatory guidance, minor acute care, and chronic care services could be conducted through telephone or e-mail communication, and 55% stated that at least some well-child care services should be provided in alternative locations, such as day care centers. In multivariate analysis, support for these changes was distributed widely across pediatricians with varying personal and practice characteristics.

Conclusions

Although most pediatricians are generally satisfied with our current way of providing well-child care, a majority think that a system that is less reliant on physicians and face-to-face office visits would be a more effective and efficient way to provide care.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana er) [^115PbKMd]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Drug Abuse and Addiction

Controlled Substance

OPANA ER contains oxymorphone, an opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine and other opioid agonists and is a Schedule II controlled substance. OPANA ER and other opioids used in analgesia, can be abused and are subject to criminal diversion (see WARNINGS: Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids).

Drug addiction is characterized by a preoccupation with the procurement, hoarding, and abuse of drugs for non-medicinal purposes. Drug addiction is treatable, utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach, but relapse is common.

"Drug seeking" behavior is very common to addicts and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.

Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. OPANA ER, like other opioids, may be diverted for non-medical use. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.

Abuse of OPANA ER poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of OPANA ER with alcohol and other substances. In addition, parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious disease such as hepatitis and HIV.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS: Usage in Pregnancy and PRECAUTIONS: Labor and Delivery).

### The association of parental or caregiver alcohol use with child maltreatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies [^113371YD]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Maltreatment of children by their parents or caregivers is a widespread yet under‐recognised public health issue. This includes all forms of ill‐treatment and neglect that result in actual or potential harm to a child, perpetrated by someone in a position of responsibility, trust or power. Four types of child maltreatment are widely recognised, including physical abuse (e.g. hitting or kicking), psychological or emotional abuse (e.g. verbal threats or insults), sexual abuse (e.g. sexual harassment, assault or rape) and neglect (e.g. failure to provide appropriate education or health care). While estimates of prevalence vary widely because of methodological differences, the true burden of child maltreatment is likely to be far higher than reported. Shame or fear makes it difficult for survivors to disclose maltreatment, particularly when trusted caregivers are implicated, and young children may not be able to communicate what they have experienced. Moreover, children are often exposed to multiple types and repeated episodes of maltreatment, with detrimental long‐term effects. The most severe forms of child abuse or neglect may be fatal. Exposure to child maltreatment is associated with higher risk of mental health problems, including alcohol and drug‐related problems, later in life. Parents who experienced maltreatment in their own childhood are also more likely to abuse or neglect their children.

### The prenatal visit [^1162CWmQ]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

A pediatric prenatal visit during the third trimester is recommended for all expectant families as an important first step in establishing a child's medical home, as recommended by Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents, Fourth Edition As advocates for children and their families, pediatricians can support and guide expectant parents in the prenatal period. Prenatal visits allow general pediatricians to establish a supportive and trusting relationship with both parents, gather basic information from expectant parents, offer information and advice regarding the infant, and may identify psychosocial risks early and high-risk conditions that may require special care. There are several possible formats for this first visit. The one used depends on the experience and preference of the parents, the style of the pediatrician's practice, and pragmatic issues of payment.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^115sdbBM]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Child abuse evaluation in lower-risk BRUE — social risk assessment: Clinicians Should Obtain an Assessment of Social Risk Factors To Detect Child Abuse in Infants Presenting With A Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, Moderate Recommendation). Aggregate Evidence Quality is Grade C and Strength is a Moderate recommendation. Benefits include identification of child abuse, potential benefit to the safety of other children in the home, and identification of other social risk factors and needs with help connecting caregivers with appropriate resources (eg, financial distress); risks and costs include that this can be resource intensive and not always available, and some social workers may have inadequate experience in child abuse assessment. The benefit-harm assessment states that identifying child abuse and identifying and addressing social needs outweigh the cost of attempting to locate the appropriate resources or decreasing the trust in the medical team.

### Outcomes after injury prevention counselling in a paediatric office setting: a 25-year review [^116S3Tgs]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Article selection

The goal of the project was to review all evaluations of the effectiveness of office-based paediatric IP counselling research studies that were published after Bass' article. Using Google Scholar, the study team identified all peer-reviewed articles published between 1 July 1991 and 1 June 2016 that referenced the Bass article. Since Bass' article was instrumental in showing patient behaviour change and injury reduction following paediatric office counselling, we began with all published studies that cited the report by Bass. All articles chosen were initially vetted by one research assistant to ensure they met inclusion criteria. These criteria included: (1) an intervention for a family with a child < 5 years of age; (2) an unintentional injury mechanism addressed during counselling; (3) one or more mechanisms recommended to be discussed for children < 5 years in the 2007 AAP Policy Statement; (4) counselling occurring in the office setting; (5) an assessment of an outcome (eg, change in knowledge, behaviour or injury occurrences); and (6) English-language publication. One-time behavioural surveys and other observational study designs were not included. Age less than or equal to 5 years was chosen in order to focus on preschoolers who spend a significant amount of time at home. Also, children of this age commonly attend well-child visits with their parent/guardian, and these caregivers are the ones that would primarily be making the behaviour change after receiving counselling. Full manuscripts of those identified by the research assistant were then reviewed by the four authors to ensure that all inclusion criteria were met and to resolve any discrepancies. Conflicts between reviewers on design or outcome were discussed as a team and resolved by consensus. After the initial articles were chosen, references of all articles that met inclusion were reviewed, and they went through the same process as above.

In order to be as inclusive as possible, the study team also performed a literature review using key search terms to attempt to ensure that all office-based IP counselling papers with an outcome that met our inclusion criteria were reviewed. The key words chosen included: (A) counseling or 'anticipatory guidance', (B) unintentional injury or safety, (C) child or childhood or pediatric or paediatric or children and (D) office-based. All duplicate articles were deleted, and the remaining articles were independently reviewed by the authors to assess for eligibility and discussed by the team to alleviate any controversies. A complete flow chart of the search strategy can be found in figure 1.

### Evaluating the child for sexual abuse [^114M18Sy]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Child victims of sexual abuse may present with physical findings that can include anogenital problems, enuresis or encopresis. Behavioral changes may involve sexual acting out, aggression, depression, eating disturbances and regression. Because the examination findings of most child victims of sexual abuse are within normal limits or are nonspecific, the child's statements are extremely important. The child's history as obtained by the physician may be admitted as evidence in court trials; therefore, complete documentation of questions and answers is critical. A careful history should be obtained and a thorough physical examination should be performed with documentation of all findings. When examining the child's genitalia, it is important that the physician be familiar with normal variants, non-specific changes and diagnostic signs of sexual abuse. Judicious use of laboratory tests, along with appropriate therapy, should be individually tailored. Forensic evidence collection is indicated in certain cases. Referral for psychologic services is important because victims of abuse are more likely to have depression, anxiety disorders, behavioral problems and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Consensus recommendations — agreement process and rationale: The guideline's recommendations reflect universal agreement or a strong consensus among committee members, and in the one situation with only majority agreement, additional members were appointed and added; subsequently, consensus was achieved. The major reason for disagreement was varying levels of risk tolerance, and for these recommendations the Key Action Statements provide more detailed explanations of uncertainties and attempts to derive numbers needed to test and treat.

### Consent by proxy for nonurgent pediatric care [^111CWU4H]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Minor-aged patients are often brought to the pediatrician for nonurgent acute medical care, physical examinations, or health supervision visits by someone other than their legally authorized representative, which, in most situations, is a parent. These surrogates or proxies can be members of the child's extended family, such as a grandparent, adult sibling, or aunt/uncle; a noncustodial parent or stepparent in cases of divorce and remarriage; an adult who lives in the home but is not biologically or legally related to the child; or even a child care professional (eg, au pair, nanny). This report identifies common situations in which pediatricians may encounter "consent by proxy" for nonurgent medical care for minors, including physical examinations, and explains the potential for liability exposure associated with these circumstances. The report suggests practical steps that balance the need to minimize the physician's liability exposure with the patient's access to health care. Key issues to be considered when creating or updating office policies for obtaining and documenting consent by proxy are offered.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^113N7tvx]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Child and adolescent obesity — care strategies when IHBLT is not available and physical activity goals: When an IHBLT is not available, pediatricians and other PHCPs can increase the intensity of weight management support through collaboration and by connecting families with community resources; pediatricians and other PHCPs should familiarize themselves with resources and actively collaborate with other specialists and community programs, and pediatricians and other PHCPs should assess the availability and pediatric expertise of local dietitians and offer referrals to patients where possible. Exercise specialists can provide counseling and training to engage children and families in noncompetitive, cooperative, fun, aerobic and nonaerobic activities. Behavior goals related to physical activity include aiming for the physical activity guidelines of 60 minutes perday of moderate to vigorous physical activity and reducing time spent in sedentary behavior, and physical activity limitations should be considered with a stepped care plan for a gradual increase in physical activity. Several successful studies have been conducted in the primary care setting, with less than 5 hours of treatment and using individual visits rather than group visits.

### Caregiver-fabricated illness in a child: a manifestation of child maltreatment [^111Sky9X]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Caregiver-fabricated illness in a child is a form of child maltreatment caused by a caregiver who falsifies and/or induces a child's illness, leading to unnecessary and potentially harmful medical investigations and/or treatment. This condition can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Although caregiver-fabricated illness in a child has been widely known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, there is ongoing discussion about alternative names, including pediatric condition falsification, factitious disorder (illness) by proxy, child abuse in the medical setting, and medical child abuse. Because it is a relatively uncommon form of maltreatment, pediatricians need to have a high index of suspicion when faced with a persistent or recurrent illness that cannot be explained and that results in multiple medical procedures or when there are discrepancies between the history, physical examination, and health of a child. This report updates the previous clinical report "Beyond Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy: Identification and Treatment of Child Abuse in the Medical Setting" The authors discuss the need to agree on appropriate terminology, provide an update on published reports of new manifestations of fabricated medical conditions, and discuss approaches to assessment, diagnosis, and management, including how best to protect the child from further harm.

### The eye examination in the evaluation of child abuse – 2023 [^1166jXh7]. AAO (2023). High credibility.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) — indications for ophthalmology consultation emphasize objective clinical triggers and appropriate use: Eye abnormalities can be caused by direct blunt trauma or can be associated with more global brain injury, and in children with AHT, the absence of external indicators of eye injury does not rule out the possibility of significant RHs; therefore, one cannot rely on ocular signs or symptoms to determine which children might benefit from ophthalmologic consultation, and rather, ophthalmologic consultation is based on objective indicators of possible eye pathology, including findings that raise concern of possible AHT (eg, increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hemorrhage, or unexplained coma). Ophthalmologic consultation in the setting of suspected abuse is recommended for any child with visible injury to the eye, unexplained alterations of consciousness, intracranial hemorrhage, coagulopathy, or possible medical disease that might mimic abuse, while an ophthalmologic examination is not an appropriate screening test for AHT in neurologically well-appearing infants who have an extracranial injury suggestive of abuse because RHs are uncommonly identified in this setting. Ophthalmologists have an obligation to report their suspicions to the appropriate child protective service agency and, when available, consult with child abuse pediatricians or other professionals in the field of child abuse for guidance and additional assistance.

### Guidelines for child custody evaluations in family law proceedings [^113GUBTq]. The American Psychologist (2010). Medium credibility.

Child custody evaluation — screening for violence and maltreatment — psychologists endeavor to conduct appropriate screening for family violence, child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and resultant trauma; the rationale notes that separation, custody disputes, and renewed parent-child contact may generate or increase risks of violence, alienating behaviors, and child abuse, that parenting skills may become compromised in an environment of intimidation and fear, and that an extensive literature links violence and other forms of maltreatment to relationship conflict and separation and to problems with custody and post-separation co-parenting; with respect to the screening process, psychologists are endeavoring to preserve, protect, and promote safe, healthy and functional relationships and living arrangements, strive to identify potential physical or sexual abuse, child abuse including alienating behaviors, intimate partner abuse, power imbalance or coercion and control behaviors on the part of family members or caregivers, and to utilize these findings, as appropriate, in their assessment processes and recommendations, and adopt a rigorous multimethod and multiunit approach; psychologists strive to maintain an in-depth knowledge of abuse dynamics to screen appropriately for abuse and coercive behaviors, consider that a thorough screening would optimally include both parents as well as other individuals such as stepparents, partners, grandparents, siblings, and extended family members, note that such screening contributes to the identification of information, behaviors, or disclosures indicating that violence, abuse, coercion, or intimidation is or may become an issue, state that screening is ideally an ongoing process throughout the custody evaluation, rather than a one-time event, and strive to implement screening across all types of cases, including those in which no allegations or judicial findings of intimate partner violence have been made.

### Reflections on well-child care practice: a national study of pediatric clinicians [^112Zpwbs]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess perspectives about the practice of well-child care among pediatric clinicians, especially in the areas of child development and behavior.

Methods

Thirty-one focus groups (282 pediatricians and 41 pediatric nurse practitioners) in 13 cities addressed current practices, priorities used to determine content of well-child care visits, and changes to improve visit quality and outcomes.

Results

Although most clinicians were positive about their practice of well-child care, they reported areas of concern and suggested ideas for improvements. Establishing a therapeutic relationship and individualizing care were viewed as significant contributions to quality of care. Participants agreed about the importance of eliciting parent concerns as the first priority for all well-child care visits. Community resources outside the office setting were seen as both a major influence on and, in some communities, a limitation to pediatric care. The challenges of early recognition of developmental and behavior problems through standardized questionnaires and effective interviewing were viewed as a priority to improve pediatric effectiveness in monitoring and treatment. To enhance primary care practices in developmental and behavioral pediatrics, participants suggested innovations in practice organization, community linkages, information technology, and integration of existing innovative programs. Education for pediatricians and enhanced resident training in developmental and behavioral pediatrics were endorsed.

Conclusions

Pediatric clinicians' support a vision of preventive care that is comprehensive, family centered, and developmentally relevant, both for children with greater risk to long-term healthy development and for families with more normative child-rearing concerns.

### Optimal resources for children's surgical care: from the committee on children's surgery American college of surgeons [^115PUiZW]. APSA (2014). Medium credibility.

Primary care physicians and pediatricians — roles in children's surgical care emphasize collaboration and continuity: The patient's personal physician or pediatrician is important to infants and children of any age and the primary care physician or pediatrician is helpful in providing information about the patient's history, dealing with long-term problems, and meeting the family's psychosocial health needs. Primary care physicians and pediatricians are also important to provide continuity of care throughout the patient's home recovery period and return to health, and the immediate presence of the primary care physician or pediatrician is not a requirement. When a committed surgeon has assumed responsibility for an infant or child with a surgical problem in a Level I, II or III children's surgical center, he/she should recognize the primary care physician or pediatrician as a valuable resource; depending on the local circumstances, a primary care physician may serve as a member of the care team or may provide continuity of care and act as a liaison with the family. Children with surgical needs should not be admitted or transferred by the primary care physician without the knowledge and active involvement of the surgical service.

### The future pediatrician: promoting children's health and development [^112LbwkH]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The field of pediatrics in the US began in late-nineteenth century urban slums, where young children were monitored to ensure they received safe milk and mothers were educated about nutrition and hygiene. The subsequent reduction of infectious disease through sanitation and vaccination, and a continuing appreciation of the powerful impact of the social context of children's well being, reinforced this early emphasis on preventive care. The past several decades have seen a shift in the distribution of childhood morbidity, as changing social patterns of family life and access to health care have increased the prevalence of chronic illness and developmental and emotional problems. More recently, practitioners and policymakers have recognized the importance of children's social and physical environments on life-long health and social competence. These changes are casting increasing attention on the preventive care available to young children and their families. Whereas public policies have provided most children with access to health care, questions have been raised about the content and quality of that care. Recommendations to improve the quality of preventive care include such strategies as risk-based individualized care plans; greater use of tested practice management tools, such as flow sheets and e-mail; team care; and standardized data collection, including structured screening. Both the content of preventive care and the training of practitioners to provide that care should be guided by a predetermined set of measurable outcomes for which providers should be held accountable, as well as other outcomes to which they should be expected to contribute.

### Child abuse: approach and management [^114p3hiD]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on child abuse:

- **Definition**: Child abuse is a violation of human rights, defined as an act, or failure to act, on the part of a parent, guardian, and/or caregiver that results in the death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse, or exploitation of a child, or which places the child in an imminent risk of serious harm, and/or seriously impacts the child's long-term development and potential.
- **Pathophysiology**: Child maltreatment encompasses physical, sexual (including sex trafficking), and emotional/psychological abuse and neglect.
- **Epidemiology**: Approximately 4.4 million children are reported to Child Protective Services each year, with about 9 out of 1,000 children in the US found to have evidence of maltreatment after investigation, and 9.2% of victimized children experiencing sexual assault. The global prevalence of self-reported child physical abuse is estimated to range from 7% to 19%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for child maltreatment include child factors (chronic illness, emotional or behavioral difficulties, physical disabilities, preterm birth, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy), caregiver factors (young parental age, criminal history, alcohol or substance abuse, depression or other mental health issues, poor impulse control, history of abuse, unrealistic expectations for the child, poor knowledge of the child, negative perception of normal childhood behavior, low educational attainment, low self-esteem), home environment (family or intimate partner violence, non-biologically related adult living in the home, single-parent home), and community environment (poverty, social isolation, or lack of social support).
- **Disease course**: Common findings of physical abuse include signs of non-accidental trauma such as bite marks, skin and mucosal abrasions, lacerations, and bruises (commonly on the head and face, as well as on ear, neck, torso, buttocks, or upper arms), patterned burns (object contact burns, scalding immersion burns), fractures (ribs, sternum, long bones, vertebrae, scapulae, or skull), and head trauma. Signs of sexual abuse include dysuria, genital or anal pain or bleeding, symptoms of STIs, and pregnancy. Children may present with anxiety, distress, or unwillingness to undress or be examined.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Abusive head trauma is a sequelae of child physical abuse which can result in often permanent and significant brain damage. The fatality rate from child abuse is estimated at 2.87 per 100,000 boys and 2.11 per 100,000 girls.

Physical examination and health utilization in intimate partner violence (IPV) — the guideline advises, "Be aware of and recognize injury patterns that have a higher association with IPV", noting that "Head, neck, or facial injuries among women were more associated with IPV in a meta-analysis of ED studies, while abdomen and thorax injuries were significantly more common among women survivors of IPV in another study", and that "Women injured by IPV are more likely to have multiple injuries", while "Data are lacking for specific indicators for IPV in LGBTQ+ patients and men". Among female victims identified in police databases, "64% received ED care in the year before the reported assault" and "The majority of victims also had multiple visits for non-injury related complaints", and survivors report high rates of generalized medical complaints including chronic pain, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and multiple physical symptoms such as insomnia, fatigue, fainting, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, vaginal discharge, and painful intercourse.

### Clinical evaluation and management of children with suspected physical abuse [^111Hz4rz]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Evaluating and managing children with suspected physical abuse is challenging. Few single injuries are pathognomonic for abuse and, as a result, child abuse is easily missed. As such, a healthy bit of skepticism is needed to recognize and protect abused children. The medical history and clinical presentation should guide evaluation. Medical providers must consider the differential diagnosis, epidemiology of injuries, and child development to inform the assessment. In this review, we address evidence-based recommendations to inform child physical abuse evaluations. We also discuss the role of medical providers in communicating with families, mandated reporting and interpreting medical information for investigative agencies and other non-medical colleagues entrusted with protecting children.

Eliciting and responding to psychosocial problems

According to health workers, use of PACK Child in consultations led to more psychosocial risk issues being identified in consultations, sometimes resulting in referral and resolution of these disclosures.

"It prompted you now with that section to ask for social problems. I also had one child: she didn't have an ID. Mum didn't have an ID that's why she didn't register the child, and she can't apply for a grant, and I helped her. So that section is really good. It prompts you to ask those questions. In the past we overlooked it". (Nurse, Focus Group 4, Phase 2)

However, our observations of consultations revealed that routine psychosocial risk questions, delivered in an embedded checklist approach to consultations were framed in a way to rule out problems instead of encouraging disclosure. Furthermore, in some cases, where disclosures were made, the health worker could be seen to minimise its importance or not address the problem reported by caregivers. For one health worker the lack of expertise within facilities was a key reason why psychosocial issues are not fully addressed.

"We have a problem with psychiatrist. If you get the problem of abuse, then you must send the child to the hospital, because we don't have a person here every day, that's also a problem. Sometimes when you book the people, for that then the guy cancels his visit". (Nurse, Focus Group 9, Phase 3)

### The many roles of pediatric integrated behavioral health specialists [^113oiaR9]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The primary care pediatric setting is intended to provide continuous and comprehensive care throughout a child's life, ensuring overall well-being. Routinely scheduled well-child visits are ideal to assess developmental progress, environmental health, behavior/psychosocial issues, and other concerns. Delivering integrated behavioral health (IBH) in the primary care setting may aid in identifying any early concerns or difficulties and provides resources and support when these issues first emerge; thus, promoting the child's well-being. IBH should be engaged early and often to establish a relationship with families and follow them as the child develops, regardless of the presence of a precipitating behavior concern.

### A brief intervention in primary care to improve parents' discipline practices and reach other caregivers [^117Wvxj5]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parenting lays the foundation for a child's health. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) encourages health care providers to educate parents about using healthy discipline and avoiding unhealthy discipline, especially physical punishment. Pediatricians can counsel directly or, if available, recommend other resources and programs. A short list of effective programs includes Healthy Steps, the SEEK program, the Video Interaction Project, Triple P, the Incredible Years, and Play Nicely. Despite overwhelming evidence that parenting education works, and that many parents want support, less than half of parents of young children report that they received discipline education as part of their child's well visit.

This gap in services reflects the many challenges of educating parents about discipline in pediatrics. Pedia-tricians report being hindered by lack of time, lack of resources, lack of knowledge about how to counsel, and lack of evidence that counseling is effective. Other implementation barriers include cost, office-space, determining who will provide the intervention, cultural sensitivity, meeting individual family needs, and educating fathers and other caregivers who may not attend the visit. A key point in a document, "Parenting Matters", published by the National Academies states, "most studies are focused on mothers, with a lack of research on fathers and other caregivers". Of concern, fathers are often using unhealthy discipline strategies — in 1 report, 40% of fathers spanked their 3-year-old child. Also, parents report that family and friends are who they turn to first for advice about childrearing. Thus, health care providers should consider trying to reach other caregivers through the parent presenting in clinic. Of note, most effective parenting programs are hours in duration and none are known to reach caregivers who do not attend. Studies of brief clinical interventions are needed to overcome these hurdles.

In this context, the primary aim of this study was to determine whether a brief intervention helps parents improve their discipline and the secondary aim was to determine whether the intervention reaches other caregivers. We discuss how the results have been used to integrate parenting education into the well-child visit at our institution.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^116xkvns]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Child abuse — trauma-informed pediatric care distinguishes approach and treatment and directs integration into practice. A trauma-informed care approach acknowledges the entire history of previous traumatic events, as well as the current trauma, and delivers all aspects of care with this awareness, whereas trauma medical treatments are evidence-based protocols aimed at treating injuries related to trauma. Integrate the delivery of trauma-specific medical treatments with a trauma-informed care approach. Early recognition of trauma exposure in conjunction with appropriate intervention can assist in the prevention of lifelong consequences. Address any family distress, providing emotional support and safety for the family, and offering proactive guidance regarding recovery. When used in conjunction with family-centered care, a trauma-informed care approach can improve the quality of care provided to patient and their caregivers. While caring for patients who have experienced physical abuse, be aware that these patients often have triggers that can affect their behavior and willingness to participate in medical therapies. After becoming aware of and understanding the triggers, alter the patient's care plan accordingly. This action may change these behaviors and provide the patient with a feeling of safety.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^112rVCpu]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The opioid crisis has grown to affect pregnant women and infants across the United States, as evidenced by rising rates of opioid use disorder among pregnant women and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome among infants. Across the country, pregnant women lack access to evidence-based therapies, including medications for opioid use disorder, and infants with opioid exposure frequently receive variable care. In addition, public systems, such as child welfare and early intervention, are increasingly stretched by increasing numbers of children affected by the crisis. Systematic, enduring, coordinated, and holistic approaches are needed to improve care for the mother-infant dyad. In this statement, we provide an overview of the effect of the opioid crisis on the mother-infant dyad and provide recommendations for management of the infant with opioid exposure, including clinical presentation, assessment, treatment, and discharge.

Hospital consultation referral and consent — treating physician(s) should directly inform the child and family about the referral before the assessment, and explanations should include the concerns that prompted the request and the intent of providing comprehensive care to the family. In these situations, the treating physician is the consultee, and it is important to consider the family's priorities, clarify the reason for referral, correct any misperceptions, and negotiate appropriate goals. Formal consent for hospital consultation is considered part of the authorization for treatment signed by parents at admission to the hospital; if the parent refuses the consultation, the clinician and treating physician(s) should together attempt to define and address the reason(s) for refusal and consider the urgency of the consultation. Even when a family refuses the consultation, the clinician can provide valuable advice and support to the pediatric health care team facing a difficult clinical situation.

Try to ensure that discussions with parents are holistic and that opinions offered by health professionals are made within that context. This requires all aspects of the child's current and past experience to be taken into account, including parental and wider clinical views about the child's current quality of life. At the same time, although the child remains the primary focus, recognising the quality as well as the prolongation of life, the family's understanding, wishes and needs should be included. Ensure equally that the family understands that the health professionals over-riding responsibility is to the welfare of the child and that is the basis of decision making. Excellent literature is available to help families understand and make these critical care choices.

Ensure the full multidisciplinary team is aware of all important aspects of a child's care, particularly specialists who are not routinely part of the team and who may have a misunderstanding of expectations. Consider whether colleagues from referring hospitals also need to be involved.

Information offered to families may change as the clinical team changes on a weekly basis, for example, due to the consultant of the week rotas. In complex situations, particularly where admissions have been prolonged, it is appropriate to assign a lead clinician role for the child. The lead needs to be compassionate and caring as well as having the appropriate level of knowledge and understanding of the child's condition. The 'Lead' role for children with complex or life-changing conditions can:
Act as liaison between family and medical/nursing team supporting access to the full multidisciplinary team.
Recognise and acknowledge a family's understanding and expectations and if misunderstandings develop be prepared to intervene to resolve any uncertainties.
Be responsible for the overall care of the child.
Help coordinate a consistent clear message to the family by all health professionals avoiding potential areas of confusion

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114gmt6o]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Abuse and maltreatment definitions — Abuse/Maltreatment is any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a caregiver or person in a position of power over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a patient of any age group, and EMS clinicians should have a heightened awareness for vulnerable populations which include, but is not limited to, children, elderly, and adults with mental or physical disabilities. Child Abuse/Maltreatment states that child maltreatment includes any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child; an act of commission (child abuse) is the physical, sexual, or emotional maltreatment or neglect of a child or children; and an act of omission (child neglect) includes, but is not limited to, failure to provide for the child's needs (e.g., physical, emotional, medical/dental, and educational neglect) and failure to supervise (e.g., inadequate supervision or safety precautions, lack of appropriate car seat use, and exposure to violent or dangerous environments). Human Trafficking is when people are abducted or coerced into service (e.g., being forced into servitude without compensation and/or prostitution), and signs may include, but are not limited to, patient with branding/tattoos and environmental clues such as padlocks and/or doorknobs removed on interior doors and intact windows that are boarded up.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^1116ESiz]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days — this clinical practice guideline addresses the evaluation and management of well-appearing, term infants, 8 to 60 days of age, with fever ≥ 38.0°C; it derives 21 key action statements with assessed and graded strength of recommendations and summarizes recommendations in three algorithms for infants 8 to 21 days of age, 22 to 28 days of age, and 29 to 60 days of age. The guideline states that parents' values and preferences should be incorporated as part of shared decision-making, that the committee has attempted to develop numbers needed to test and provided numbers needed to treat, and that the recommendations do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care, with variations, taking into account individual circumstances, potentially appropriate.
