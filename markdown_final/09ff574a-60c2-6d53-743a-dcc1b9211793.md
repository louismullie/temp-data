## Question

How do you check for a blood paternal testing for a father and child ?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to check for blood paternal testing for a father and child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the testing context, because prenatal and postnatal paternity testing use different samples and methods. Then, I should verify the appropriate sample types and collection procedures. Next, I will examine the genetic markers and laboratory methods, including STRs, SNPs, and Y-STRs, and when each is used. After that, I need to check the statistical framework for interpreting results, including paternity indices and probability thresholds. Finally, I should review quality assurance, limitations, and ethical considerations, and then synthesize a concise, actionable answer with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the context, because I need to ensure we are not mixing prenatal and postnatal workflows. Postnatal paternity testing is typically done after birth using buccal swabs or blood from the child and the alleged father, whereas prenatal testing can be invasive (CVS or amniocentesis) or noninvasive using maternal plasma cell-free DNA; I should explicitly distinguish these paths to avoid confusion and guide the user to the right approach based on timing and risk tolerance [^6c7b7e97] [^82c7bb5a].

> Next, I should review sample types and collection for postnatal testing, and I need to double-check that buccal swabs are indeed the standard. Yes, buccal swabs are the most common and noninvasive source of genomic DNA for both the child and alleged father, with blood as an alternative when swabs are not feasible; the key is obtaining sufficient high-quality DNA for STR or SNP analysis, and laboratories typically accept either matrix depending on logistics and consent considerations [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine the genetic markers used postnatally, and I should confirm the industry standard. Autosomal short tandem repeats (STRs) are the conventional backbone of paternity testing, with 15–20 highly polymorphic loci typically sufficient to achieve probabilities exceeding 99.99% when the alleged father is the biological parent; this STR-based approach is robust, widely validated, and the reference method against which newer platforms are compared [^70c0bb53] [^2e2aa744].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prenatal options; I need to check invasive versus noninvasive pathways. Invasive prenatal testing via chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis yields fetal genomic DNA suitable for standard STR-based paternity analysis, but carries procedure-related risks such as miscarriage and infection; thus, these are generally reserved for situations where invasive testing is already indicated for medical reasons, not solely for paternity determination [^6c7b7e97] [^82c7bb5a].

> For noninvasive prenatal paternity testing, I should confirm the principle and timing. Cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma permits SNP-based paternity analysis as early as about 6 weeks' gestation, with methods that genotype dozens to hundreds of carefully selected SNPs and calculate a combined paternity index; accuracy can approach or exceed 99.99% when fetal fraction is adequate, and modern targeted sequencing with UMIs improves specificity and cost-effectiveness compared with earlier array-based approaches [^b0d739c2] [^e1f10f98] [^82c7bb5a].

> Wait, let me verify the statistical framework so I don't misstate how results are interpreted. Paternity testing relies on a likelihood ratio approach: the paternity index (PI) quantifies how much more likely the child's genotype is if the alleged father is the true father versus a random unrelated man, and the combined PI across loci is converted to a posterior probability; inclusion typically uses a threshold around 99.99% or higher, while exclusion is supported by multiple mismatches and a CPI below 1, with mutation models and silent allele allowances integrated when needed [^a868f8bc] [^70c0bb53].

> I should confirm quality assurance steps that affect reliability. Accredited laboratories follow AABB standards, validate sample identity, and monitor for contamination or sample mix-ups; in prenatal workflows, fetal fraction assessment and maternal contamination checks are essential, and indeterminate calls are issued when fetal fraction is too low or data quality is insufficient, which is why timing and lab protocols matter for accuracy and interpretability [^294d1a3d] [^e1f10f98].

> But wait, what if the case involves a deceased or unavailable alleged father? I need to check kinship options. Y-STR haplotyping can support paternal lineage testing when a direct sample from the alleged father is unavailable, recognizing that Y-STRs are shared among paternal relatives and cannot distinguish brothers or father–son pairs; thus, results reflect patrilineality rather than unique paternity and should be interpreted cautiously in deficiency cases [^34e3fab0] [^ee4aafd9].

> Next, I should review limitations and ethical considerations so the user understands risks and disclosures. Noninvasive prenatal testing can fail if fetal fraction is too low, and both prenatal and postnatal methods can reveal misattributed paternity; pretest counseling should discuss the possibility of nonpaternity, consent requirements, and the potential psychosocial impact of unexpected results, including depression and anxiety reported after discovery of nonpaternity via direct-to-consumer testing, which underscores the need for supportive counseling pathways [^770f4176] [^e49dd80d] [^d66ea90b].

> Let me synthesize the practical answer now, and I should double-check that I've tied each step to the right context. For postnatal paternity testing, collect buccal swabs or blood from the child and alleged father, analyze autosomal STRs at 15–20 loci, and interpret using CPI to reach a probability of paternity; for prenatal testing, choose invasive STR-based testing only if medically indicated, or use noninvasive SNP-based testing on maternal plasma after 6 weeks with a validated lab, ensuring adequate fetal fraction and counseling on limitations and incidental findings [^70c0bb53] [^6c7b7e97] [^b0d739c2] [^770f4176].

Blood paternity testing compares the child's and alleged father's DNA to determine biological relatedness. The most accurate method is **STR analysis** of buccal swabs or blood, with a typical accuracy of 99.99% when testing 15–20 loci [^70c0bb53]. Noninvasive prenatal paternity testing using maternal blood is available from 7–10 weeks' gestation and is highly accurate but more expensive and less widely available [^b0d739c2] [^e1f10f98]. Results are reported as a **probability of paternity**, with ≥ 99% indicating inclusion and ≤ 0% indicating exclusion. Testing should be performed in accredited labs, with informed consent and consideration of ethical issues such as misattributed paternity and psychological impact [^770f4176] [^e49dd80d].

---

## Sample collection methods

Blood paternity testing can use **different sample types**, each with specific advantages and limitations:

| **Sample type** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Blood samples | Collected from the alleged father and child via venipuncture | - High DNA yield <br/> - Widely accepted in legal contexts | - Invasive <br/> - Requires trained personnel |
| Buccal swabs | Noninvasive collection of cells from the inner cheek using sterile swabs | - Noninvasive <br/> - Simple <br/> - Widely accepted | - Lower DNA yield than blood <br/> - Risk of contamination if not handled properly |
| Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) | Maternal blood sample collected from 7–10 weeks gestation containing fetal cell-free DNA | - Noninvasive <br/> - Early detection <br/> - No risk to fetus | - More expensive <br/> - Less widely available <br/> - Requires specialized equipment |

---

## Laboratory analysis methods

Several **laboratory techniques** are used to analyze DNA samples for paternity testing:

- **Short tandem repeat (STR) analysis**: The gold standard, analyzing 15–20 highly polymorphic STR loci to calculate a combined paternity index (CPI) and probability of paternity [^70c0bb53].
- **Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis**: Used in noninvasive prenatal testing, analyzing hundreds of SNPs to determine paternity with high accuracy [^b0d739c2] [^e1f10f98].
- **Y-chromosome analysis**: Useful in cases involving male lineage or when the alleged father is unavailable, but limited to male offspring and cannot distinguish between close male relatives [^34e3fab0] [^ee4aafd9].

---

## Accuracy and reliability

Blood paternity testing is **highly accurate**, with STR-based methods typically achieving a probability of paternity ≥ 99.99% when the alleged father is the biological father. Noninvasive prenatal testing has also demonstrated high accuracy, with studies reporting 100% concordance with traditional methods [^b0d739c2] [^e1f10f98]. Factors influencing accuracy include sample quality, laboratory proficiency, and the number of genetic markers analyzed [^2ba354d8].

---

## Legal and ethical considerations

Blood paternity testing carries **significant legal and ethical implications**:

- **Legal implications**: Results can be used in court for child support, custody, and inheritance cases. Legal testing requires strict chain-of-custody procedures and accreditation of the testing laboratory [^19c5260b].
- **Ethical considerations**: Testing can reveal misattributed paternity, potentially causing emotional distress and family disruption. Pretest counseling is essential to prepare individuals for possible outcomes [^770f4176] [^e49dd80d].
- **Consent**: Informed consent must be obtained from all parties involved, including the mother, alleged father, and child (if applicable) [^4df7096d].

---

## Turnaround time and cost

Turnaround time and cost vary by method and provider. STR-based testing typically takes 3–5 business days, whereas **NIPT** takes 7–10 business days. Costs also vary: STR-based testing is generally $300–$500, while NIPT is $1,000–$2,000.

---

## Psychological impact

Blood paternity testing can have **significant psychological effects**, including emotional distress, anxiety, and family conflict — especially when results reveal misattributed paternity. Counseling and support services are recommended to help individuals cope with these outcomes [^e49dd80d].

---

Blood paternity testing is a **highly accurate method** for determining biological fatherhood, using STR or SNP analysis of blood or buccal samples. It has important legal and ethical implications, and results should be interpreted with care and supported by counseling.

Discussion

We report the first highly accurate, noninvasive, clinically available prenatal paternity test. Traditional postnatal paternity testing involves analysis of single tandem repeat sequences and comparison with alleged fathers. Because large amounts of intact genomic child DNA are available postnatally, measurements are robust, and only 15–20 single tandem repeat sequences are necessary to achieve highly accurate paternity results.

Options are limited for determining paternity prenatally without amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, or very early in the preganancy. Although fetal cfDNA from maternal plasma is reliably measured,and various groups have reported the amplification and detection of fetal-specific alleles using polymerase chain reaction,,, these methods do not include sufficient fetal-specific alleles to measure paternity accurately and are not amenable to scaling of interrogated loci.

The use of cfDNA to correctly identify paternity was recently reported in 30 cases.However, that study only compared the known father to one unrelated male. If the actual father is not one of the two samples, this method may identify paternity in an individual who is simply more closely related than the other due to close genetic relationships in, for example, small ethnic subpopulations. This underscores the importance of testing against a large population of unrelated males; in this study, we tested against 5,000 random individuals.

Of greater concern is the fact that they do not report a per-test accuracy, instead reporting the chance of correctly guessing paternity in 30 cases, which is one in a billion—a number calculated by taking the chance of correctly guessing paternity per test (1/2) and raising it to the 30th power (30 tests). This combined statistic may be misleading and is not clinically useful, given that each test need not be highly accurate to provide this impressive number. For example, assuming 99% per-test accuracy (well below the 99.99% industry standard), the overall chance of guessing 30 tests correctly is still 74%.

Disclosure options

In this case, the finding of misattributed paternity has implications for the certainty of the diagnosis because it means that it is now impossible (with the samples available) to determine whether the single dominant variant is de novo and likely to be pathogenic or has been inherited from the biological father and is likely to be benign. The finding also has implications for any conversation with the parents about the likelihood of this disease occurring in any future child they might have—an issue that is central to cases such as Sally’s, but may not be relevant for everyone. This raises important questions for the clinical team: should they limit their discussion with the family to the likely diagnosis, emphasizing that the chance of this happening in a future child of this couple is extremely low (since they know the variant was not inherited from either of Sally’s stated parents)? Should they also raise the possibility that the true diagnosis has been missed, thus making it impossible to accurately counsel the parents about recurrence risk? Or should they discuss the question of genetic relatedness, and perhaps even attempt to obtain a DNA sample from the ‘genetic father’ to confirm the diagnosis? If they take the former approach, what should they do about recording the information and the test results in Sally’s clinical records, and how should they respond if asked a direct question about genetic paternity (or about reproductive implications) during the consultation? What responsibilities do the clinicians have to be open and honest about all of their findings and interpretations with the parents who have come to them seeking information about Sally’s condition, its cause, and the reproductive implications?

1 INTRODUCTION

Paternity testing is conducted to determine the biological linkage between a child and an alleged father, and it can be done either before or after the birth of the child. A common method for postnatal paternity testing is the analysis of genetic information obtained from buccal swabs or other biological samples of the child and the alleged father to generate a probability of paternity. The main difficulty in implementing this approach in prenatal paternity testing lies in the procurement of fetal DNA. Currently, fetal DNA sampling methods can be divided into invasive and noninvasive sampling. Invasive sampling includes chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis whereby amniotic fluid is obtained. Because invasive sampling induces a risk of miscarriage and infection, 1, 2, 3 these procedures are not recommended unless to aid in diagnosis of severe genetic disorders such as those related to fetal aneuploidy. 4

Noninvasive sampling refers to maternal peripheral blood sampling wherein fetal DNA is present as cell‐free DNA (cfDNA). Since the discovery of cell‐free fetal DNA in maternal bloodstream circulation, 5 a variety of cfDNA‐based methods have been developed for numerous clinical applications. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 In terms of prenatal paternity testing, early attempts used short tandem repeats (STRs) as genetic markers, 11, 13 but because overwhelming maternal signals effectively concealed the fetal signals of autosomal STRs, only Y‐chromosome STRs (Y‐STRs) could be utilized, and this restricted application to only male fetuses. 10, 14 Moreover, Y‐STR analysis could not exclude relationships from the same male lineage, and the high mutation rate of Y‐STRs (10 −3 to 10 −2 per locus per generation) increased the probability of false paternity exclusions. 15

### Measuring paternal discrepancy and its public health consequences [^da6efa94]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2005). Low credibility.

Paternal discrepancy (PD) occurs when a child is identified as being biologically fathered by someone other than the man who believes he is the father. This paper examines published evidence on levels of PD and its public health consequences. Rates vary between studies from 0.8% to 30% (median 3.7%, n = 17). Using information from genetic and behavioural studies, the article identifies those who conceive younger, live in deprivation, are in long term relationships (rather than marriages), or in certain cultural groups are at higher risk. Public health consequences of PD being exposed include family break up and violence. However, leaving PD undiagnosed means cases having incorrect information on their genetics and fathers continuing to suspect that children may not be theirs. Increasing paternity testing and use of DNA techniques in clinical and judicial procedures means more cases of PD will be identified. Given developing roles for individual's genetics in decisions made by health services, private services (for example, insurance), and even in personal lifestyle decisions, the dearth of intelligence on how and when PD should be exposed urgently needs addressing.

### Informatics-based, highly accurate, noninvasive prenatal paternity testing [^baad9757]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

By comparison, assuming a 99% per-test accuracy using Parental Support, the chance of correctly guessing all 36,402 calls is ~1 in 10 158. Assuming 99.99% accuracy, the typical after-birth paternity testing accuracy level, the chance of correctly guessing all 36,402 calls is still only 2.6%. This suggests that the Parental Support method is >99.99% accurate.

It is important to note that a closely related male may return a false paternity inclusion. Preliminary results show that a paternal grandfather or uncle of the child in question returns test statistics that, although smaller than the actual father's test statistic, have P values of <10 −4 (data not shown); for this reason, samples from closely related alleged fathers must be measured for comparison to ensure correct paternity identification.

The method used herein obviates problems with traditional- and cfDNA-based methods by measuring autosomal SNPs using a high-throughput SNP array. A large amount of maternal cfDNA is present in the plasma measurements, which generally results in low signal-to-noise ratio when determining fetal genotype from cfDNA. Identifying the maternal genotype and fetal fraction allows us to predict the amount of maternal signal and adjust accordingly. Whereas each individual SNP measurement is noisy, aggregating data over 300,000 SNPs allows for highly accurate paternity determinations. This test provided accurate paternity confirmation as early as 6 weeks into pregnancy, with as low as 2.3% fetal cfDNA fraction, suggesting that paternity testing can be performed very early in pregnancy when fetal fractions are still very low. This is important when paternity is considered as a reason for termination of pregnancy.

This method is adaptable to other platforms, such as next-generation sequencing, which has recently been used to identify fetal cfDNA in maternal plasma.That study used massively parallel sequencing of maternal plasma cfDNA from a single subject, identifying the entire fetal and maternal genomes. Parental genotypes were included to assemble the fetal genome and determine maternal versus paternal SNP inheritance, and not in a statistical paternity test; the method lacks informatics-based analysis that contributes to the accuracy with which we identify and exclude paternity, and is more labor intensive, thereby not lending itself well to clinical applications. In addition, the maternal haplotype was inferred from chorionic villi sampling, thus negating the advantage of a noninvasive test. We are currently attempting to validate the efficacy of Parental Support using next-generation sequencing.

### Management and counseling of the male with advanced paternal age [^7048af67]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Increasing percentages of children are being born to older fathers. This has resulted in concerns about the potential adverse effects of advanced paternal age. To help clinicians counsel couples, a systemic review was performed to attempt to address questions that these couples may ask: Should routine sperm testing be performed in older males? Should preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) be performed? How do providers counsel patients about risk? Should young males freeze sperm if they plan to delay paternity? Using the terms "advanced paternal age", "semen testing", "preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening", and "cryopreservation", a comprehensive search was performed in PubMed and the Cochrane Library, and numerous international societal guidelines were reviewed. In total, 42 articles or guidelines were reviewed. There were no limits placed on the timing of the articles. Thirty articles were found to be relevant and beneficial to answering the above questions. Each question was answered separately by the supporting literature. While primary research exists to support the role of semen testing, PGD/preimplantation genetic screening, and sperm banking in males who may be affected by advancing age, comprehensive studies on the possible clinical benefit of these interventions have yet to be performed. As a result, societal guidelines have yet to incorporate distinct best-practice guidelines on advanced paternal age.

### Forensic use of Y-chromosome DNA: a general overview [^34e3fab0]. Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Y-STRs for paternity testing, kinship analysis, and familial searching

Because Y-STR haplotypes are shared between paternally related men belonging to the same paternal lineage, Y-STR haplotyping is suitable for solving paternity disputes of male offspring, other types of paternal kinship questions, and for familial searching. It is also suitable to male identification cases involving human remains such as in disaster victim and missing person identification where only distant relatives are available. In paternity testing, Y-STR haplotyping is particularly suitable in deficiency cases, where the putative father of a male child is deceased and not available for DNA testing. With autosomal DNA profiling, the paternity of the unavailable putative father to the child can be established or rejected with the necessary high degree of certainty only if both parents of the deceased putative father are available for testing. If only one or none of the paternal grant parents of the male child are available, Y-STR profiling comes into play as long as any male relative of the deceased putative father is available for analysis. By use of standard Y-STRs with low–medium mutation rates [i.e. one or a few mutations every 1000 generations per each locus, (Goedbloed et al.)], male relatives of the deceased putative father will share the same Y-STR haplotype with the putative father, and thus with his son, in case of biological paternity. Obviously, RM Y-STRs characterised by increased mutation rates are not suitable for paternity and kinship testing, as the mutations observed with increased probabilities will trouble the estimation of paternity/kinship probabilities.

### Discovering misattributed paternity in genetic counselling: different ethical perspectives in two countries [^d66ea90b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

Misattributed paternity or 'false' paternity is when a man is wrongly thought, by himself and possibly by others, to be the biological father of a child. Nowadays, because of the progression of genetics and genomics the possibility of finding misattributed paternity during familial genetic testing has increased. In contrast to other medical information, which pertains primarily to individuals, information obtained by genetic testing and/or pedigree analysis necessarily has implications for other biologically related members in the family. Disclosing or not a misattributed paternity has a number of different biological and social consequences for the people involved. Such an issue presents important ethical and deontological challenges. The debate centres on whether or not to inform the family and, particularly, whom in the family, about the possibility that misattributed paternity might be discovered incidentally, and whether or not it is the duty of the healthcare professional (HCP) to disclose the results and to whom. In this paper, we consider the different perspectives and reported problems, and analyse their cultural, ethical and legal dimensions. We compare the position of HCPs from an Italian and British point of view, particularly their role in genetic counselling. We discuss whether the Oviedo Convention of the Council of Europe (1997) can be seen as a basis for enriching the debate.

### Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity [^191ed8ef]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2007). Low credibility.

Claims for reimbursement of child support, the reversal of property settlements and compensation can arise when misattributed paternity is discovered. The ethical justifications for such claims seem to be related to the financial cost of bringing up children, the absence of choice about taking on these expenses, the hard work involved in child rearing, the emotional attachments that are formed with children, the obligation of women to make truthful claims about paternity, and the deception involved in infidelity. In this paper it is argued that there should not be compensation for infidelity and that reimbursement is appropriate where the claimant has made child support payments but has not taken on the social role of father. Where the claimant's behaviour suggests a social view of fatherhood, on the other hand, claims for compensation are less coherent. Where the genetic model of fatherhood dominates, the "other" man (the woman's lover and progenitor of the children) might also have a claim for the loss of the benefits of fatherhood. It is concluded that claims for reimbursement and compensation in cases of misattributed paternity produce the same distorted and thin view of what it means to be a father that paternity testing assumes, and underscores a trend that is not in the interests of children.

### When genomic medicine reveals misattributed genetic relationships-the debate about disclosure revisited [^de96b8f7]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

One possibility would be to seek to discuss the result with Sally’s mother alone as she is likely to be aware of the possibility of misattributed paternity. However, were this course of action to be chosen, the information may not be shared with Sally’s father, leaving him to believe, wrongly, that any future pregnancies would potentially be at significant risk when in fact the risk is negligible. This would mean knowingly allowing a patient to leave the clinic with a false belief about his reproductive risk, thereby undermining the autonomy of the man who in the eyes of the law, and indeed the family, is Sally’s father. Furthermore, it would leave the clinicians involved with important information about someone that they had not imparted. Knowing whether or how to document this in the medical records, to ensure it is neither accidentally disclosed nor unnecessarily reinvestigated at some future time, needs careful consideration.

Ethical arguments can be made both for and against disclosure in such cases.A commonly made argument against disclosure of misattributed parentage is that it is not directly relevant to clinical care. While this is true in many cases, in this case, the clinical relevance to reproductive autonomy is apparent. Another argument made against disclosure is that this information has the potential to undermine the family unit itself, resulting in harmful consequences and potentially leading to violence or abandonment that would not be in the best interests of either the child or the family as a whole. Although such harms are not easily predictable, and harms might also be caused where such information is withheld, this concern is a common response to this type of case. Another argument in favor of nondisclosure is that the family came to the clinic to find the cause of Sally’s condition and understand the risk of having a second affected child, but they did not (or at least not explicitly) come to find out about paternity (for which a test is available directly to the consumer).Their preferences about receiving this incidental and unsought information, and likely responses to the result, cannot be determined without revealing the concern.

### Is there a role for genetic counselors in prenatal paternity testing?-an assessment based on audit of 13 years of clinical experience in south Australia [^735efaf1]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2017). Low credibility.

The role of genetic counselors in prenatal paternity testing has not been widely studied in the genetic counseling literature. In South Australia, the genetic counselors of the State's public sector clinical genetics service are the primary contact point for women seeking information and testing, also coordinating the testing process. This has provided the opportunity to review all prenatal paternity testing performed in the State over a 13 year period and to consider the role played by the genetic counselor. We explored the reasons why women requested prenatal paternity testing and whether the genetic counselor was an appropriate health professional to facilitate this testing for women. The study had two parts, an audit of the clinical genetics files of 160 women who requested prenatal paternity testing between March 2001 and March 2014, and qualitative interviews of genetic counselors, clinical geneticists, obstetricians and social workers with involvement in this area. The audit determined that in 69.9 % of cases the long-term partner was the father of the pregnancy, for 23.7 % the short-term or other partner was the father and for 6.4 % the paternity results were not known by the genetic counselor. For 45.5 % of women whose long-term partner was excluded as the father, the women chose to have a termination of pregnancy. The results of the qualitative interviews yielded five major themes: accessibility of testing, role of the genetic counselor, social and relationship issues, decision making in pregnancy and emotional issues. We conclude that the genetic counselor is an appropriate health professional to facilitate prenatal paternity testing. Genetic counselors did not view their role as significantly different from a request for prenatal testing for another indication.

### The making and breaking of paternity secrets in donor insemination [^fca37d95]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

This paper analyses the complex issues faced by regulators of the infertility treatment industry in response to the social and technological changes that heralded a new openness in knowledge about genetics, paternity and the concomitant need for donor offspring to know their genetic origins. The imperative for full information about their donor and biological father, who contributed to their creation and half of their genome, was an outcome unanticipated by the architects of the donor insemination programme. Genetic paternity testing realised the possibility of fixed and certain knowledge about paternity. This paper outlines medicine's role in the formation of normative families through the use of donor insemination. Extending information from an Australian study on the use of DNA paternity testing, it analyses what the social and scientific changes that have emerged and gained currency in the last several decades mean for the new 'openness' and the role of paternity testing in this context. It concludes with recommendations about how to deal with the verification of paternity in linking donor conceived adult children to their donor.

### Paternity testing requested by private parties in Italy: some ethical considerations [^2d13c8de]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

In Italy, judicial and extrajudicial requests for paternity testing have increased in recent years. A retrospective analysis of such private extrajudicial requests received by the legal medicine unit of the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health of Padua University was conducted to identify problem areas most helpful in determining whether to accept private parties' requests for paternity testing. Such testing is most delicate when a presumptive father may be seeking to disown paternity and when testing is wanted without the consent of a member of the mother-child-father triangle. Tests that could establish paternity where none has been recognised are less problematic, as the child will not lose out. Legal and ethical-deontological aspects of consent, of the protection of minors and of children's and parents' need for follow-up interviews to deal with the outcome of such testing are carefully considered by the Padua University team when deciding whether to accept a request for testing. It is argued that because such issues are not dealt with by mail-order laboratories, the use of such services is inappropriate.

### Noninvasive prenatal paternity testing by means of SNP-based targeted sequencing [^b32e9953]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

3.4 Paternity test specificity

The ability to differentiate between the biological father and closely related males of the same paternal lineage was demonstrated when a brother of the biological father was tested as the alleged father in three of the paternity‐confirmed cases, and “Exclusion” calls were given for all three siblings (Table 3). Further validation of the present approach was performed by testing each of 60 unrelated men as the alleged father in place of the biological father in the 15 family cases. All tests gave calls of “Exclusion,” and large numbers of mismatches were found in each test (Table 4). In addition, significant separation in CPI between that for the biological father and those for unrelated men were observed (Figure 3), indicating the high specificity of this approach in paternity testing.

Combined paternity indices for biological father and unrelated men. The logarithm of CPIs (log CPIs) calculated for the 15 family cases were all greater than 8.0 when the biological father was tested (red circles), and each was a distinct outlier compared with the respective set of log CPIs obtained for 60 unrelated men each tested as alleged father (box‐and‐whisker plots). The dotted line marks where log CPI = 0, and the case numbers correspond to those given in Table 2

### Noninvasive prenatal paternity testing by means of SNP-based targeted sequencing [^3e0f9116]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

The utility of the method in noninvasive prenatal paternity testing was ultimately demonstrated through the successful determination of paternity in 15 family cases, results of which were all subsequently validated (Table 2 ; Table S5). The minimum logarithm of CPI and paternity probability for these cases were 8.6% and 99.9999997%, respectively, well above the lower limits for paternity inclusion and attesting to the strength of the method. Moreover, close male relatives were readily excluded as the biological father in three cases (Table 3), validating the potential to eliminate close relative‐derived false paternity‐inclusion cases. 27 The exclusion of 60 unrelated men when tested as alleged father in each of the 15 cases further verified the specificity of the method (Figure 3 ; Table 4). Notably, the paternity probabilities generated by the method were comparable with those obtained by STR analysis but much higher than those from Y‐STR analysis (Table 2), revealing the increased power of the novel method compared with Y‐STR analysis. Besides, although Y‐STR analysis is extremely useful for paternal lineage identification, 32 it is less effective for paternity testing because of difficulties in differentiating between male relatives. The Y‐STR analysis‐generated probabilities are therefore more correctly patrilineality or male line probabilities, and the Y‐STR paternity‐inclusion results confirmed only paternal lineage relationship.

### Paternity testing under the cloak of recreational genetics [^343c25b7]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Direct-to-consumer (DTC) internet companies are selling widely advertised and highly popular genetic ancestry tests to the broad public. These tests are often classified as falling within the scope of so-called 'recreational genetics', but little is known about the impact of using these services. In this study, a particular focus is whether minors (and under what conditions) should be able to participate in the use of these DTC tests. Current ancestry tests are easily able to reveal whether participants are related and can, therefore, also reveal misattributed paternity, with implications for the minors and adults involved in the testing. We analysed the publicly available privacy policies and terms of services of 43 DTC genetic ancestry companies to assess whether minors are able to participate in testing DTC genetic ancestry, and also whether and how companies ethically account for the potential of paternity inference. Our results indicated that the majority of DTC genetic ancestry testing companies do not specifically address whether minors are able to participate in testing. Furthermore, the majority of the policies and terms of services fail to mention the vulnerability of minors and family members in receiving unexpected information, in particular, in relation to (misattributed) paternity. Therefore, recreational genetics carries both the risk of unintentionally revealing misidentified paternity, and also the risk that fathers will deliberately use these services to test their children's paternity without revealing their intentions to the mother or any other third party.

### Discovering your presumed father is not your biological father: psychiatric ramifications of independently uncovered non-paternity events resulting from direct-to-consumer DNA testing [^e49dd80d]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Direct-to-consumer DNA tests provide information on ancestry and family relations. Their increased use in recent years has led many to discover that their presumed father is not their biological father, a non-paternity event (NPE). We aimed to explore and quantify the psychiatric effects of discovering one's father's identity was misattributed. We distributed questionnaires in a private online community of individuals who learned they were NPEs. Questionnaires included clinical scales assessing depressive, anxiety, and panic symptomatology as well as background and personal details regarding participants' NPE discovery and demography. A total of 731 people participated. Results demonstrated increased levels of depression, anxiety, and panic symptoms relative to controls. Multiple factors influenced such effects, including demographics, background information, family members' reactions, and personal reactions. We identified a worsening relationship or attitude toward the mother as a risk factor for worse mental health. The ability to openly discuss the discovery and acceptance of it were identified as protective factors. This is the first paper to explore the psychiatric sequelae of discovering misattributed paternity in a large cohort. This unique psychosocial stressor is likely to become more common as direct-to-consumer DNA tests gain popularity, requiring the attention of mental health professionals.

Introduction

Reliable prenatal paternity testing requires direct chorionic villus sampling or amniotic fluid sampling via amniocentesis, both of which increase risk of harm to the mother and fetus. Amniocentesis carries a miscarriage risk of 1 in 300 to 1 in 500 (ref.) and a small risk of other complications. Chorionic villus sampling carries a similar miscarriage risk and a 1/3,000 risk of fetal limb reduction defects, especially when performed before 10 weeks of gestation. Although the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that these procedures be offered to all pregnant women,they are most often used when the mother is at a high risk for genetic defects, such as after a positive first-trimester screen.

The discovery of fetal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal blood suggested that a noninvasive paternity test could be developed, which would avoid the risks associated with invasive procedures.Although fetal cfDNA in maternal circulation was initially reported more than a decade ago,,, the development of a reliable, noninvasive paternity test using maternal peripheral blood has proved elusive because fetal cfDNA typically comprises <20% of the total cfDNA in maternal plasma and is highly fragmented.The limited amount of fetal cfDNA and its heavy dilution by maternal cfDNA present significant technical challenges. These can be overcome by coupling microarrays or high-throughput sequencing, which measure hundreds of thousands to millions of DNA segments, with sophisticated bioinformatics techniques to extract maximal information from the limited fetal genotype data obtained from maternal plasma cfDNA measurements.

We previously reported such a method, called Parental Support, which uses single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray measurements from maternal and paternal DNA to improve the fidelity of noisy embryonic DNA genotype measurements.Although this method accurately identifies ploidy at all 24 chromosomes in single embryonic cells, it has not been adapted to paternity testing.

Here, we use a version of the Parental Support algorithm to determine whether the fetal components of the cfDNA SNP measurements made on cfDNA isolated from maternal plasma could be due to the alleged father. We report the results of testing this new method on 21 pregnant women, with each sample independently tested against the confirmed father as well as 1,820 unrelated individuals. We identify paternity with 100% accuracy as early as 6 weeks into pregnancy.

Pitfall F: The government might not collect samples or request or apply DNA testing results uniformly in decision-making processes

Specific cases described by participants capture how inconsistencies in DNA testing and decision-making processes might manifest. Inconsistencies included instances where DNA tests were requested to evaluate explicitly non-genetic relationships, where the study team found contrasts between the use of DNA in similar cases or where participants felt DNA evidence was weighted in an unexpected or precedent-breaking way, and where policies or laws around the collection, processing, or evaluation of DNA evidence were not followed. Case 19 provides an example of an unreasonable request for DNA evidence, in which USCIS erroneously requested a DNA test of a husband-wife couple. Their attorney (NG21) brought the request to the attention of a USCIS officer, who attributed the request to clerical error. A series of cases where DNA evidence was used to determine with whom a child could reside demonstrates the shifting value placed on paper documentation, histories of caregiving relationships, and DNA evidence. In case 21, NG02 suggested that new DNA requirements put in place by HHS complicated the reunification of parents and children separated under the zero-tolerance immigration policy. While HHS required DNA testing for government-separated children in case 21, in case 12 in the case of an unaccompanied youth, a caregiving relationship was sufficient to release a child to a sponsor despite negative paternity results. In the visa petition context, in both cases 16 and 17, fathers with little or no contact with their children submitted petitions but had little access to paper documentation because they had fled wars. In case 16, results of paternity submitted ahead of a request were not considered sufficient evidence, and in case 17, NG15 was concerned that DNA testing would not help the petition since the father and child had long been estranged and there was little paper documentation available. IA13 highlighted a scenario (case 18) in which, despite DNA evidence of paternity, a father’s petition for his child was rejected based on the law in the country of origin, which required demonstrated financial support and cohabitation. The decision was ultimately overturned in accordance with US law. In contrast, in case 23 a man remained in danger of being deported despite submitting DNA evidence of his biological relationship with six full siblings, all born to two US citizen parents, together with medical records, a birth certificate, documents related to his name change upon adoption, and statements from his adoptive and biological family members. Some case descriptions indicated that government or state officials themselves obstructed DNA collection. In case 24, described above, a US Embassy did not cooperate in the DNA collection required to finalize an intercountry adoption. In addition, in the transnational missing persons context, in cases 27, 29, 30, and 31, DNA samples were initially not collected from UHR despite state law requiring DNA sampling of unidentified corpses.

### Informatics-based, highly accurate, noninvasive prenatal paternity testing [^2a640a86]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Twenty-one maternal blood samples with known paternity were tested using Parental Support (Table 1). One sample could not be evaluated due to the low fraction of fetal cfDNA in the maternal plasma (<2%, Table 1). For each of the remaining 20 samples with sufficient fetal cfDNA, 1,821 independent paternity tests were run using the confirmed father and a random set of 1,820 unrelated male individuals, for a total of 36,420 paternity tests. We confirmed paternity in 100% (20/20) of the cases, with P values of <10 −4 (Table 1). The test accurately identified paternity as early as 6 weeks into pregnancy and with a low fraction of fetal cfDNA.

Of note, 99.95% (36,382/36,400) of the tests correctly excluded paternity using Parental Support. Only 18 (0.05%) were called indeterminate. None of the tested samples had an incorrect paternity determination.

### Informatics-based, highly accurate, noninvasive prenatal paternity testing [^6522e4c2]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose:

The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an informatics-based, noninvasive, prenatal paternity test using array-based single-nucleotide polymorphism measurements of cell-free DNA isolated from maternal plasma.

Methods:

Blood samples were taken from 21 adult pregnant women (with gestational ages between 6 and 21 weeks), and a genetic sample was taken from the corresponding biological fathers. Paternity was confirmed by genetic testing of the infant, products of conception, control of fertilization, and/or preimplantation genetic diagnosis during in vitro fertilization. Parental DNA samples and maternal plasma cell-free DNA were amplified and analyzed using a HumanCytoSNP-12 array. An informatics-based method measured single-nucleotide polymorphism data, confirming or rejecting paternity. Each plasma sample with a sufficient fetal cell-free DNA fraction was independently tested against the confirmed father and 1,820 random, unrelated males.

Results:

One of the 21 samples had insufficient fetal cell-free DNA. The test correctly confirmed paternity for the remaining 20 samples (100%) when tested against the biological father, with P values of <10 −4. For the 36,400 tests using an unrelated male as the alleged father, 99.95% (36,382) correctly excluded paternity and 0.05% (18) were indeterminate. There were no miscalls.

Conclusion:

A noninvasive paternity test using informatics-based analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism array measurements accurately determined paternity early in pregnancy.

Pitfall E: The appropriate technology and/or infrastructure to test a relationship is not always available

This might include stakeholders’ understanding of testing methodologies, established procedures for requesting and submitting DNA test results, systems for locating and collecting samples, or data management challenges. IA23 described the reaction of USCIS in case 14: “So, we did the blood test with my client who was father/mother A with a half sibling father/mother B and another half sibling father/mother C to establish that, you know, he was, you know, was the father. And USCIS couldn’t wrap its head around that.” IA23 expressed surprise that “they had difficulty” with complex kinship methodologies for demonstrating paternity. NG06 recalled a series of difficult cases out of one East African country, captured in case 15. This country had no paperwork available for ordering a DNA test and no paperwork or system for locating relatives. In case 16, DNA testing was successfully carried out, but submission to USCIS posed a problem. The client and his attorney (IA17) submitted a DNA test before it was requested by USCIS, knowing they had no other documentation of a father-child relationship, but USCIS responded with a request for a birth certificate listing the names of both parents. There did not seem to be a structure in place to allow DNA test results to be submitted up front. TC08 and 09 noted, “Generally the hearsay that I have would be that this [process is] document-driven and then DNA is [requested] towards the end. Documents failed and…then they’ll go to the DNA.” For transnational missing persons, as in unsolved cases 28 and 29, even if FRSs and UHR samples were genotyped and databased, current database structures and policies created information silos that decreased the likelihood of successful associations being made.

Materials and Methods

Inclusion criteria for enrolled women/couples were singleton pregnancies in the first or second trimester with known paternity. Couples were enrolled through in vitro fertilization clinics, obstetric offices, or online advertisements. All women who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled during the period from April to June 2011. Gestational ages ranged from 6 to 21 weeks, and paternity was confirmed in various ways (Table 1). Nine of 21 samples had known parentage through control of fertilization during in vitro fertilization, with paternity reconfirmed through genotype-specific preimplantation genetic diagnosis. The remaining 12 samples had paternity confirmed by independent paternity testing on fetal or postnatal genetic material (DNA Diagnostic Center, Fairfield, OH). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and genetic samples were collected under an institutional review board–approved research protocol.

### A qualitative study of women and partners from Lebanon and Quebec regarding an expanded scope of noninvasive prenatal testing [^4df7096d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

NIPT use for paternity testing

Only one Quebecois participant disapproved the use of NIPT for paternity testing because it could lead to termination of pregnancies and suggested to perform such test only after delivery.

No, I would not agree to that test either. Again, I think there would be children who would have died today. I think it should be done when the child is born, at that time. Qc 7 Cp F

However, all other participants, whether in Lebanon or in Quebec, were interested in such use. They argued that even if it might not be of personal interest for them to use NIPT for paternity testing, it would be helpful for other couples in case of doubts or conflicts related to the identity of the father or in case a woman with different partners wants to identify the father. Nevertheless, participants were convinced that such use must be on request only or on a case-by-case basis and that both partners should consent to it.

If it is to determine paternity, well if there are any doubts, if someone requires it, O.k. But from the outset, I would not do the test from the outset to say oh yes, it’s true that you are the father and the mother. So, provided it’s on request. Qc 9 Cp M

Yeah […] but I think not without the exclusive consent of the parents, because otherwise there will be incidental non paternity findings that may destabilize people. It may be an option that is requested by families, but both parents must consent to it. Qc 8 Cp F

Yes, I agree if there is a reason behind it. However, it should not be done automatically just to know who the father is, and it should be specific to each case. Lb 6 F

If there is any conflict within the couple and they both agreed to do it there is no problem. They both should decide if they want to go for it or not. Lb 10 Cp F

### Informatics-based, highly accurate, noninvasive prenatal paternity testing [^558c8223]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Microarray intensities were extracted using BeadStudio (Illumina) software. Fetal fraction in maternal plasma was determined by considering autosomal SNPs for which the mother is homozygous. The group of maternal homozygous SNPs was divided into subsets in which the fetus is either very likely or very unlikely to have the same genotype as the mother, on the basis of population frequencies. The fetal fraction is proportional to the difference of observed off-allele intensity between the two subsets.

The genotyping results were analyzed using Parental Support.For each mother and alleged father combination, the method generated a test statistic that indicated how well the genotype of that possible father accounted for the fetal component of the genotypic measurements made on maternal plasma cfDNA. The test statistic was calculated separately for the mother with each of 5,000 unrelated males, creating an unrelated-male test statistic distribution for that case (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures S1–S19 online). The test statistic was then calculated for the mother and alleged father, and a single-hypothesis rejection test determined whether the alleged father's test statistic fell under the distribution of test statistics created using the unrelated males. If the alleged father's test statistic was excluded from the unrelated-male test statistic distribution, then the alleged father was determined to be the biological father. If the alleged father's test statistic fell within the unrelated-male test statistic distribution, then it was determined that he was not the biological father.

Specifically, a paternity inclusion (confirming paternity) was called when the P value of the alleged father's test statistic according to the distribution of unrelated males was <10 −4. An indeterminate result (no call) was called when the calculated P value fell between 10 −4 and 0.02 (Figure 1). A paternity exclusion was called when the calculated P value was >0.02. No determination was made when the fetal DNA fraction in maternal cfDNA was <2%. The set of unrelated individuals used to generate the expected distribution was comprised of individuals from a wide variety of racial backgrounds, and paternity determination was recalculated using different racial sets of unrelated individuals, including the race indicated for the alleged father. Inclusion and exclusion results were automatically generated by the informatics method; no human judgment was necessary.

### Non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy and beyond: challenges of responsible innovation in prenatal screening [^a5efa3fe]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

In this document, we use ‘NIPT' as a general term for non-invasive prenatal testing based on quantitative or qualitative analysis of cfDNA in maternal blood, used in the context of prenatal screening. By prenatal screening we understand the routine offer of medical tests to pregnant women without a known individual higher risk of having a child with a specific disorder or a compromised outcome of the pregnancy. This is usually a two-tier procedure, consisting of a screening test stricto sensu with diagnostic follow-up testing in case of a positive result. In many Western countries, prenatal screening is offered in a public health setting. This entails a systematic approach with quality controlled uniform provision procedures, and (different levels of) public funding. In other countries or states, such as in the USA, prenatal screening is made available to (self-paying or insured) patients through individual practitioners or practices, ideally in accordance with professional guidelines. Finally, NIPT for sex selection and paternity testing is commercially offered by laboratories as direct-to-consumer (DTC) tests.

When, in this document, we refer to ‘women and their partners', or ‘women or couples', this is to acknowledge that decisions about prenatal screening or its outcomes will often be shared by pregnant women with their partners and that these partners (mostly the biological father-to-be) do have an interest in knowing a diagnosis in their future child. Moreover, depending on the conditions tested, some outcomes may also have implications for the father himself.However, professionals should ascertain that consent for prenatal testing and other procedures is based on a free and voluntary decision of the woman herself, as it is her body and her pregnancy. Legally, prenatal screening is offered to the woman only, with her partner having no say in the relevant decisions.

Paternity Analysis

We successfully assigned paternity to 411 of the 463 (89%) of the live-born offspring. The majority of offspring were genotyped from each litter (minimum 58% of offspring in a given litter, mean 86.3%). Restricting analyses to litters where 100% of babies were sampled (N = 22 litters) does not qualitatively change results (analyses not shown), therefore we present the results with this 58% cutoff. The minimum number of fathers that contributed to each litter was determined using. This program estimates the likelihood that offspring are related to each other (i.e. are siblings), as well as the likelihood that any of the genotyped adults are the mothers and fathers of the offspring. For litters where not all offspring were successfully genotyped, the actual number of fathers may be higher. The data set included genotypes of known mother/offspring relationships and genotypes for adult males serving as potential fathers, without any designation of relatedness. Each population was analyzed separately using population-specific allele frequencies calculated from the adult samples in that population. We estimated rates of errors (i.e. null alleles, mutations, genotyping error) and mismatches between mother and offspring alleles using. Using the allele frequencies, as well as the known mother–offspring relationships,generated expected genotypes of the males contributing to each offspring in a litter with a 95% confidence level.settings were as follows: polygamous mating system, dioecious and diploid species, medium run length, full-likelihood analysis method, medium likelihood precision, and no sibship size prior. To assess the accuracy of our results and to identify the effects of different error rates on the number of fathers assigned to a litter, simulations were conducted inutilizing varying genotyping error rates (0–2%), as well as different run lengths (“medium” to “very long”) and precision levels (“medium” to “high”). Our paternity assignments were robust to these variations.

### FDA authorizes blood test for assessing risk of hereditary cancers (...) [^21929a33]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

The test, the Invitae Common Hereditary Cancers Panel, analyzes a person’s blood sample for changes in 47 genes that are linked to hereditary forms of cancer. FDA described the test as “an important public health tool that can offer individuals more information about their health, including possible predisposition to certain cancers. ”. For individuals suspected of having an increased risk of hereditary forms of cancer, the Invitae test can be used to confirm the presence or absence of hundreds of possible genetic changes, or variants, in the 47 target genes. “This test is intended for people who may have an increased risk of developing cancer to better understand what that level of risk is, ” said Lori Minasian, M. D. , deputy director of NCI’s Division of Cancer Prevention, who was not involved in the development of the test. Individuals who are concerned about whether their family history puts them at risk for cancer should consult with a genetic counselor, Dr. Minasian added.

The Invitae test is available only by prescription from a doctor. Using genetic test results to help guide medical care The test’s panel of 47 genes includes the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Certain DNA changes in these genes increase the risk of hereditary forms of breast and ovarian cancer as well as several additional types of cancer. The panel also includes. Many tools for assessing a person’s risk of cancer, including genetic tests, have been developed in recent decades. “This particular test is the first to have undergone FDA’s critical review to demonstrate that it is safe and effective for its intended use, ” Dr. Minasian said. To validate the test’s performance, Invitae researchers analyzed more than 9, 000 samples from people known to have one of the genetic changes included in the test, achieving greater than 99% accuracy for all of the tested changes, according to the FDA.

Revealing new variants that may be involved in cancer Invitae’s test uses next-generation sequencing to check for changes in the 47 target genes. To interpret the test results, the company uses evidence from various sources, including information from published studies, public databases, prediction programs, and Invitae’s internal curated database of cancer-related genetic variants, explained Jim McKinney, an FDA spokesperson.

Pitfall B: Kinship analysis can reveal sensitive information

DNA testing can reveal unknown or unexpected information about relationships (e.g. misattributed parentage). Participants also illustrated how conversations leading up to DNA testing could reveal sensitive information about family relationships. The effect of DNA test results on the immigration process, introduced under pitfall A above, and lack of preparation on the part of professionals to communicate results, might compound any trauma from the revelation of sensitive information. Case 9, in which a man wished to bring the child he had with a woman abroad to the United States, demonstrated all three of these aspects of this pitfall. A man revealed to his wife that he had a child abroad with another woman and filed a petition for the child. During the application process, DNA testing was requested and unexpectedly revealed that he was not the genetic father. IA01 described the father’s reaction as “dumbfounded.” With no genetic or legal connection to the child, the petition was denied; outside of undergoing a legal adoption process, the man was left with no options to bring the child to the United States. IA01 summarized the effect of DNA testing on cases like this one:

If the DNA turns out that, hey, that’s not your child or that’s not your parent or that’s not your brother or sister, then, then that’s really it. Then that person, regardless of what kind of emotional connection you have with that individual or however much time you spent, that person is just a random person in your life and they’re not necessarily eligible for benefits.

Misattributed paternity also ended the petition under the Central American Migrant Minors Program of the father in case 10. NG21 alluded to the challenge of communicating results of nonpaternity to a man who believed he was the genetic father: “[The attorney] was one of my colleagues that I shared an office with. And, yeah, she was definitely not prepared to give him those results.” Case 11 demonstrated another type of trauma that can emerge from the revelation of misattributed paternity. NG15 recalled three instances of misattributed paternity in a refugee resettlement center. These results not only ended the application process for the fathers in the cases but they often brought up trauma from rape among the women in the population served by the center.

### Noninvasive prenatal paternity testing by means of SNP-based targeted sequencing [^a868f8bc]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

2.6 Calculation of PI and posterior probability of paternity

Given the genotypes of mother, alleged father, and fetus as well as the allele frequencies from the alleged father's population, a value for the paternity index (PI) at a particular SNP was calculated based on the method described in Buckleton et al 34 (Data S1) using the equations designed and formulated for postnatal testing (Table S2). Only SNPs with sequencing depth > 100× in both analyses of maternal cfDNA and alleged paternal genomic DNA and with maternal‐fetal genotype probability ≥ 99.0% were classified as effective‐SNPs and used in paternity calculations. In cases of mismatch between detected genotype and expected genotype (ie, any nonmutated genotype projected from the parental genotypes), whether in the form of genetic inconsistency where both mother and alleged father were homozygous with the same allele but the fetus was heterozygote or as opposing homozygosity where both fetus and alleged father were homozygous but of different alleles, the parameters of mutation rate and silent allele probability 27 were included in the calculations (Table S2).

As the SNPs were considered independent of each other, the combined paternity index (CPI) was expressed as the product of PIs for all effective‐SNPs. The posterior probability of paternity was subsequently given by CPI/(CPI + 1), and a posterior probability of paternity > 99.99% was taken to indicate the alleged father to be the biological father.

Paired donation and donor evaluation policies and incidental findings are addressed as follows: transplantation requires specific informed consent, and minimum consent elements may be specified by paired donation programs, and the transplant program should inform the donor candidate of policies regarding confidentiality and anonymity in KPD and nondirected donation, and should ensure donor acceptance of these policies before donation. Participating in donor evaluation includes risks of discovery, including possible discovery of a health condition that requires referral for further care, a condition that could affect the donor candidate’s insurability or cost of insurance, or an infectious disease with a reporting requirement to public health authorities; transplant programs should establish policies for managing such discoveries and share these policies as part of the informed consent process for evaluation. Testing a donor candidate and intended recipient in a family for immuno-compatibility may identify misattributed biological relationships as an incidental finding; for example, misattributed paternity is estimated to occur in approximately 1 to 3% of father-child living kidney donor-recipient pairs.

- chest radiograph,
- pulmonary function tests,
- carbon monoxide diffusion, and

### Noninvasive prenatal paternity testing by means of SNP-based targeted sequencing [^b0d739c2]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To develop a method for noninvasive prenatal paternity testing based on targeted sequencing of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

Method

SNPs were selected based on population genetics data. Target‐SNPs in cell‐free DNA extracted from maternal blood (maternal cfDNA) were analyzed by targeted sequencing wherein target enrichment was based on multiplex amplification using QIAseq Targeted DNA Panels with Unique Molecular Identifiers. Fetal SNP genotypes were called using a novel bioinformatics algorithm, and the combined paternity indices (CPIs) and resultant paternity probabilities were calculated.

Results

Fetal SNP genotypes obtained from targeted sequencing of maternal cfDNA were 100% concordant with those from amniotic fluid‐derived fetal genomic DNA. From an initial panel of 356 target‐SNPs, an average of 148 were included in paternity calculations in 15 family trio cases, generating paternity probabilities of greater than 99.9999%. All paternity results were confirmed by short‐tandem‐repeat analysis. The high specificity of the methodology was validated by successful paternity discrimination between biological fathers and their siblings and by large separations between the CPIs calculated for the biological fathers and those for 60 unrelated men.

Conclusion

The novel method is highly effective, with substantial improvements over similar approaches in terms of reduced number of target‐SNPs, increased accuracy, and reduced costs.

Determination of paternal genotype—the initial management is determination of the paternal erythrocyte antigen status; if the father is negative for the erythrocyte antigen in question and paternity is certain, further assessment and intervention are unnecessary; in Rh-D alloimmunization with an Rh-positive father, heterozygosity can be estimated by using Rh-D antisera with the father’s cells and a positive result is determined by agglutination; if the father is homozygous for the D antigen all his children will be Rh positive, whereas if heterozygous there is a 50% likelihood each pregnancy will have an Rh-negative fetus not at risk of anemia; DNA-based diagnosis is commercially available and can also identify minor antigens (C, c, E, and e), and evaluation for other erythrocyte antigens should be performed in the same manner.

### Noninvasive prenatal paternity testing by means of SNP-based targeted sequencing [^e1f10f98]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

3.3 Targeted sequencing in paternity testing

Paternity testing using the targeted sequencing method (Figure 2) was applied to 15 alleged family cases. In each case, the full panel of target‐SNPs was sequenced, the genotypes were determined, effective‐SNPs were identified, and the paternity probability was calculated. The numbers of target‐SNPs classified as effective‐SNPs ranged from 108 to 174 (average 148; Table 2), corresponding to an effective‐SNPs percentage ranging from 30.3% to 48.9% (average 41.6%). All test cases yielded paternity probabilities > 99.9999%, and “Inclusion” results were called (ie, the alleged father in each case was determined to be the biological father). In each case, mismatches between detected and expected genotypes were extremely low (≤2 loci; Table 2), and the fetal fraction was determined to be greater than 4.5%, above the threshold of 4.0% required to support the validity of noninvasive prenatal test results. 28 Details of Case 1 are given in Table S4 to illustrate the approach. All paternity results were subsequently either confirmed using STR‐based conventional paternity tests on fetal/child genomic DNA for cases with paired amniotic fluid/buccal samples or cross‐validated using Y‐STR‐based tests on maternal cfDNA (Table 2). All 15 STR loci (Figure S1) or at least 10 Y‐STR loci were detected in each test, sufficient to provide validating results (Table S5).

Figure 2 
Schematic representation of the noninvasive prenatal paternity test. Both genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from tissue samples of the alleged father and cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from maternal plasma were subjected to target enrichment based on QIAseq Targeted DNA Panels with incorporation of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). The target‐enriched libraries were sequenced, and target‐SNPs were filtered for high confidence maternal‐fetal genotype calls. The mother, alleged father, and fetus genotypes of these target‐SNPs were then analyzed to generate paternity probabilities

### Genetic similarity between relatives provides evidence on the presence and history of assortative mating [^0dc407ec]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To test equilibrium, we used all available mother-father-child trios from MoBa. We relied on trios to test equilibrium for the following reasons: 1) It allowed estimating the partner correlation and parent-offspring correlations in the same model; 2) it allowed us to include both the mother-offspring and father-offspring dyads simultaneously thus increasing statistical power; 3) it allowed us to estimate variances separately for the two generations; 4) there was no need to distinguish between correlations between relatives in the parent generation and in the offspring generation, as this is inherent in the design; 5) focusing on the nuclear family removes the need to make assumptions about the genetic signal or gene-environment correlations; and finally, 6) the sample in MoBa is inherently selected on parent-offspring dyads whereas the availability of other relatives is coincidental. Using other relatives, such as siblings, could therefore lead to stronger ascertainment bias. After randomly selecting one offspring from each nuclear family, we were able to construct a sample of 76,869 genotyped mothers, 51,549 genotyped fathers, and 66,751 genotyped offspring, resulting in a total of 87,896 incomplete and complete trios. Of these, 35,025 were complete trios, whereas 9889 included only partners, 23,177 included only mother-offspring dyads, and 4157 included only father-offspring dyads.

Measures

We used beta weights from large, publicly available up-to-date genome-wide association studies listed the Supplementary Note 8. None of the used genome-wide association studies used data from MoBa. Polygenic indices were calculated using LDPred v.1, a Bayesian approach that uses a prior on the expected polygenicity of a trait (assumed fraction of non-zero effect markers) and adjusts for linkage disequilibrium (LD) based on a reference panel to compute SNPs weights. Genotypes were coordinated with the summary statistics, with the number of overlapping SNPs reported in Supplementary Note 8. LD adjustment was performed using the European subsample of the 1000 Genomes genotype data as LD reference panel. The weights were estimated based on the heritability explained by the markers in the GWAS summary statistics and the assumed fraction of markers with non-zero effects. For each GWAS trait we created LDpred PGI with the –score command in plink2. Prior to calculating correlations between partners and relatives, we residualised the polygenic indices by regressing out the first 20 principal components of genetic ancestry, as well as chip, imputation, and batch number.

### Noninvasive prenatal paternity testing by means of SNP-based targeted sequencing [^89400600]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a method for noninvasive prenatal paternity testing based on targeted sequencing of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

Method

SNPs were selected based on population genetics data. Target-SNPs in cell-free DNA extracted from maternal blood (maternal cfDNA) were analyzed by targeted sequencing wherein target enrichment was based on multiplex amplification using QIAseq Targeted DNA Panels with Unique Molecular Identifiers. Fetal SNP genotypes were called using a novel bioinformatics algorithm, and the combined paternity indices (CPIs) and resultant paternity probabilities were calculated.

Results

Fetal SNP genotypes obtained from targeted sequencing of maternal cfDNA were 100% concordant with those from amniotic fluid-derived fetal genomic DNA. From an initial panel of 356 target-SNPs, an average of 148 were included in paternity calculations in 15 family trio cases, generating paternity probabilities of greater than 99.9999%. All paternity results were confirmed by short-tandem-repeat analysis. The high specificity of the methodology was validated by successful paternity discrimination between biological fathers and their siblings and by large separations between the CPIs calculated for the biological fathers and those for 60 unrelated men.

Conclusion

The novel method is highly effective, with substantial improvements over similar approaches in terms of reduced number of target-SNPs, increased accuracy, and reduced costs.

### Performing parentage analysis for polysomic inheritances based on allelic phenotypes [^6950d231]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Scheme of simulation-based likelihood approach

The foundations for assigning parentage with confidence by a simulation-based likelihood approach were establish by. There are three typical categories in this approach: (1) identifying the father (or one parent) when the mother (or the other parent) is unknown; (2) identifying the father (or one parent) when the mother (or the other parent) is known; and (3) identifying the father and the mother (or parents) jointly. There are two situations in the third category, the first is for dioecious species and the sexes of individuals are recorded (termed sexes known), and the second is for monoecious species or the sexes of individuals are not recorded (termed sexes unknown). The procedures of a parentage analysis are broadly as follows.

For each of the first two categories, two hypotheses are established: the first hypothesis is that the alleged father is the true father, denoted by H 1 ; the alternative hypothesis is that the alleged father is not the true father, denoted by H 2. For the third category, “father” needs to be changed to “parents” in both hypotheses.

Given a hypothesis H, the likelihood is defined as the probability of some observed data given H, written as. Returning to H 1 and H 2 as described above, we call the natural logarithm of the ratio oftothe LOD score, or LOD as the abbreviation, symbolically. Moreover, if a LOD is positive, it means that H 1 is more likely to be true than H 2. Similarly, a negative LOD means that H 2 is more likely to be true than H 1.

provided a statistic Δ for resolving paternity, the definition of which is:where LOD 1 and LOD 2 are, respectively, the LODs of the most-likely and the next most-likely alleged fathers, and n is the number of all alleged fathers. For a practical application, the statistic Δ needs to be singly calculated for each individual offspring. Monte-Carlo simulations are subsequently used to assess the confidence level of Δ. The symbolrepresents that the threshold of Δ reaches the confidence level 95%, in the sense that if, the probability that the assigned parent is the true parent is at least 0.95.

The likelihood equations used into accommodate genotyping error miscalculate the probability of observing an erroneous genotype. Therefore, we applied the corrected equations inin the following.

### Benchmarking statistical methods for analyzing parent-child dyads in genetic association studies [^e0dff370]. Genetic Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3 Methods for case–mother dyads

In any study of nuclear families, genetic measurements are frequently missing for one parent. More often than not, fathers are missing: they can be harder to recruit, and paternity is inherently harder to be confident of than maternity (Shi et al.). Consider a study ofcase–mother dyads, whereaffected (case) offspring are sampled from the population, and the affected offspring and their mothers are genotyped/imputed or sequenced. One might come up with a straightforward approach of applying the TDT (or any method for case–parent trio data) on such family pairs for whom the genotype of the father at the SNP of interest can be unambiguously inferred. However, this process of selectively including only unambiguous dyads and discarding ambiguous ones can lead to invalid inference due to biases that depend heavily on allele frequencies (Curtis & Sham,).

2.3.1 TDT‐like approaches

The first appropriate methodological development for the analysis of nuclear family data with missing genetic information on one parent was the 1‐TDT (Sun et al.). It examines the difference between the GRRs of heterozygotes versus homozygotes (two possible choices) by using all heterozygous parent–homozygous offspring and homozygous parent–heterozygous offspring pairs (Sun et al.). Under the null hypothesis, these two GRRs are expected to be the same and the 1‐TDT test statistic has an approximatedistribution. If the total number of afore‐mentioned parent–child pairs is not large, an exact p value can also be calculated under the binomial distribution. Like the TDT, the 1‐TDT does not use parental phenotype information. The GDT‐PO can also be directly applied to data with one missing parent. Unlike the 1‐TDT, GDT‐PO examines all heterozygous parent–homozygous offspring and homozygous parent–heterozygous offspring among available parents that are unaffected (recall, GDT only uses phenotypically discordant pairs). For a data set where all offspring are affected and all their parents are unaffected, 1‐TDT and GDT‐PO become identical. The GDT‐PO statistic has an asymptoticdistribution under the null hypothesis.

### Practice bulletin no. 181: prevention of Rh D alloimmunization [^f6f94c97]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Paternity considerations for Rh D prophylaxis state that the mean rate of nonpaternity among population studies is approximately 3%. Strategies of selective administration of Rh D immune globulin depending on the partner’s blood type have been shown to be cost equivalent to systematic prophylaxis. If paternity is certain and the father is known to be Rh D negative, antenatal prophylaxis is unnecessary, whereas if the partner’s Rh type is not known, routine antenatal prophylaxis remains the preferred option. An alternative strategy is to assess fetal RHD genotype with noninvasive testing and only administer Rh D immune globulin if the fetus is Rh D positive, but despite improved accuracies, this test is not routinely recommended.

### Framing the utility and potential pitfalls of relationship and identity DNA testing across United States immigration contexts [^f1e8338e]. HGG Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Utility A: DNA testing can provide documentation of genetic relationships when other forms of documentation are unavailable, inaccurate, or insufficient to meet the burden of evidence

Participants named lack of documentation as a primary reason DNA testing is used for visa or citizenship applications and petitions for noncitizen relatives; often, DNA testing ultimately supported access to an immigration benefit by providing documentation of relationships. Participants often described challenges presented by birth certificates. In case 01 and case 18, DNA testing provided genetic documentation of a father-child relationship where the father was not listed on the birth certificate. In case 02, the grandparents had chosen to be listed as the parents on the birth certificate of their grandchild, whom their young daughter had out of wedlock; DNA testing provided genetic documentation of a mother-child relationship for their daughter and grandchild’s visa petition. In case 13, the birth certificate correctly listed the relevant father-child relationship, but the certificate’s authenticity was questioned; DNA testing provided documentation. In case 14, a client had been deported several times despite a birth certificate naming a US citizen as his father; the client and attorney hoped that DNA testing would demonstrate the paternal relationship to support a claim to citizenship, although testing had not been completed at the time of the interview.

Participants also described cases where the absence of a history of interactions or a caregiving relationship was the primary barrier to the desired immigration benefit. For example, describing an as-yet-unresolved case (case 17), NG15 questioned the potential usefulness of DNA testing as documentation to support the reunification of a father and child estranged due to war, given the lack of a caregiving relationship. In case 18, DNA documentation initially was considered insufficient to support the reunification of a father and child with no history of a caregiving relationship, but the initial denial was ultimately overturned on the basis of the genetic relationship.

Documentation or clues to identify and connect transnational missing persons to families also can be scarce, making DNA testing a valuable tool. DNA testing in combination with other evidence in case 26 allowed for the identification of a person whose family had been searching for her. But DNA testing does not always provide resolution. In cases 28 and 29, forensic anthropologists submitted DNA samples from UHR for upload to CODIS, but to date no FRSs have matched.

### The frequency of misattributed paternity in Sweden is low and decreasing: a nationwide cohort study [^d4acf741]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The occurrence of misattributed paternity has consequences throughout society with implications ranging from inheritance and royal succession to transplantation. However, its frequency in Sweden is unknown.

Objective

To estimate the contemporary frequency of misattributed paternity in Sweden.

Methods

The study was based on nationwide ABO blood group data and a nationwide register of familial relationships in Sweden. These data were analysed using both a frequentist Poisson model and the Bayesian Gibbs model. The conduct of the study was approved by the regional ethics committee in Stockholm, Sweden (reference numbers 2018/167-31 and 2019-04656).

Results

Nearly two million mother-father-offspring family units were included. Overall, the frequency of misattributed paternity was estimated at 1.7% in both models. Misattributed paternity was more common among parents with low educational levels, and has decreased over time to a current 1%.

Conclusions

The misattributed paternity rate is similar to the rates in other West European populations. Apart from widespread societal implications, studies on heritability may consider misattributed paternity as a minor source of error.

### Noninvasive prenatal paternity testing by means of SNP-based targeted sequencing [^2e2aa744]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Conventional paternity tests analyze autosomal STRs in genomic DNA by performing PCR amplification and capillary electrophoresis. 29 Compared with the present approach, STR analysis does not involve complex bioinformatics, but since genomic DNA is analyzed, conventional methods cannot be applied to noninvasive prenatal testing. Moreover, although close male relative‐derived false paternity‐inclusion results are less problematic for autosomal STR‐based methods compared with Y‐STR analysis, elimination of such false positives in the present approach is a significant advantage over conventional tests. 27

Compared with previous SNP‐based targeted sequencing methods for noninvasive prenatal paternity testing, the present approach differed in terms of the analyzed SNPs, the amplicon‐based nature of target enrichment, and the data analysis algorithm. Importantly, the SNPs selection process significantly reduced the number of sequenced target‐SNPs yet supported comparable discriminating power, and the amplicon‐based approach allowed the use of UMI barcoding to facilitate absolute quantification of SNP alleles and more reliable genotyping, both features representing significant improvements to previous methods. Moreover, where only maternally homozygous SNPs were included in paternity calculations in previous studies, 20, 21, 22 the present analysis algorithm included all SNPs with high‐confidence fetal genotype calls, disregarding the maternal genotype, thus providing an added means to increase the effective‐SNPs percentage. Furthermore, the sequencing of significantly reduced numbers of target‐SNPs associates with reduced costs and increased cost‐effectiveness.

In conclusion, despite limitations that include the testing of only a few family cases and only the Han Chinese population, the current pilot study has demonstrated the utility of the approach in noninvasive prenatal paternity testing. The method has further potential for application to a range of related clinical functions such as relationship testing or screening for single gene disorders, and such feasibility could be evaluated in future studies.

### The impact of paternal age on new mutations and disease in the next generation [^bbdd7b7c]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Origins and frequency of new mutations in humans

The rate at which new mutations arise is crucial to our understanding of both genetic disease and genome biology. Much insight into the biology of DNMs has been gained from large-scale implementation of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) of mother-father-child family trios—sequencing of coding portions (WES) or the whole genomes (WGS) of a child and both biologic parents (Fig. 1 A). Such studies have convincingly shown that the number of new point mutations present in a new born is on an average 60 (approximately 30–90, depending on parental age at conception), placing the average human germline mutation rate at approximately 1.2 × 10 -8 per nucleotide per generation. Overall, the number of DNMs increases steadily and relatively monotonically with parental age. It is also possible to determine the parental origin of DNMs using a haplotype phasing strategy. This can be performed directly using the WGS data from the family trio when an informative heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is present in the vicinity of the DNM that allows the maternally and paternally-derived alleles in the child to be distinguished (Fig. 1 B). Such phasing methods have shown that approximately 80% of all DNMs are present on the paternally-derived allele, and the number of DNMs in a child is predominantly influenced by the age of the father at conception (Fig. 1 C).

2.7 STR‐based paternity testing

To confirm paternity results in alleged family cases, conventional STR‐based paternity testing using fetal genomic DNA extracted from amniotic fluid or buccal swabs was performed. The AmpFISTR Identifiler PCR amplification kit (Applied Biosystems) was employed, following the manufacturer's protocol and according to strict AABB standards. For alleged family cases with male fetus where amniotic fluid was not available, cross‐validation of the paternity results was performed through additional testing with maternal cfDNA using the AmpFISTR Yfiler PCR amplification kit (Applied Biosystems), following the manufacturer's protocol modified for use with cfDNA. Parental genomic DNA was analyzed in parallel in each case. Capillary electrophoresis (50‐cm capillary array, POP‐7) of PCR amplicons from both kits were conducted in an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions and strict AABB standards, and data were analyzed using the GeneMapper ID software v.5 (Applied Biosystems). The associated paternity probabilities were calculated according to equations similar to those described above but based on frequencies of the matched STRs in the population of the alleged father.

2.8 Specificity studies

The specificity of the paternity test (ie, its ability to identify nonpaternity) was examined by testing one close male relative of the alleged father in place of the alleged father in three family cases. In addition, 60 unrelated men were tested in place of the alleged father in each of the 15 family cases.

### Fatherlessness, sperm donors and' so what?' parentage: arguing against the immorality of donor conception through' world literature' [^fa9502a7]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

Guidance for best practice in gamete conception has been articulated for a while; for example, the DCN was formed in 1993 to support donor-conceived families and encourage openness about donor conception (see). In UK law, all registered donors are limited to assisting 10 UK families; they must provide detailed medical and personal information to help the construction of a profile, and since 2005 they must agree to their identity being shared with the offspring when they turn 18. The limitations imposed in the UK mean that it is improbable that a registered donor will create hundreds of offspring—in fact, UK statistics suggest that ‘less than 1% of donors create 10 families with most sperm donors creating one or two’.

In America, regulated sperm donors are also subject to robust screening; America’s largest sperm bank (California Cryobank) accepts only 1% of donor applicants, and competitor Xytex accepts less than 3%. Following the ‘donor eligibility final rule’ enforced in 2005 by the US’s FDA, donor samples are screened for ‘clinical evidence of relevant communicable disease agents and diseases’. Since then, biological data are more readily available; many banks test donors for over 280 genetic and inherited conditions (example: Xytex, since 2019). A consensus has emerged that argues against complete anonymity in donor conception; many academics, industry professionals and donor-conceived offspring argue for known donation or identity release (see).

### Genetic counseling and screening of consanguineous couples and their offspring practice resource: focused revision [^a2f9d3de]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2021). High credibility.

Ethical issues and special considerations for detecting consanguinity—detection has increased with the ability to identify regions of homozygosity using microarray and genomic sequencing, and these findings can challenge counseling; pre-test counseling of couples considering testing should include the possibility of detecting unanticipated biological relationships; speculation of specific biological relationships in laboratory reports is discouraged, and if a test result raises the possibility of incest, the relationship should be confirmed and not assumed; despite technological advances there remains no standard approach to counseling in these situations, so counseling should be tailored to the individual based on family and social history and testing indication, and social work services and ethics or legal consultation may provide additional guidance; there are now fewer states in the United States with laws restricting first cousin marriages, and the unique laws in each state continue to necessitate the need for genetic counselors and other health professionals to maintain general knowledge about the laws in their own state and neighboring states in their service area; in patient interviews, the term “intellectual disability” should be used in place of “mental retardation”.

### Noninvasive prenatal paternity testing by means of SNP-based targeted sequencing [^70c0bb53]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In conventional postnatal paternity tests, child DNA is sampled, and autosomal STRs are used as genetic markers. Such tests require the genotyping of only 15 to 20 STR markers to generate highly accurate results, 29 with the industry standard for paternity probability set at 99.99% to establish unambiguous paternity. Current noninvasive prenatal paternity methods based on maternal cfDNA use only Y‐STRs 14 or alternatively, a large number, typically thousands, of SNPs as genetic markers. 20, 21 SNP‐based approaches are superior because of higher compatibility with the fragmented nature of cfDNA via the use of shorter amplicon lengths, reduced false positives and false negatives, and no fetus gender limitations. The large number of SNPs reflects both the lower paternity‐differentiating power of SNPs compared with STRs, with the estimated power of 50 SNPs, having minor allele frequencies between 0.2 and 0.8, being similar to 12 STRs in postnatal tests 30 as well as the noisy data, resulting from low target allele concentrations, against which analysis of more SNPs are required to allow for filtering of low‐quality data.

In the present study, we hypothesized that with systematic selection of SNP loci and accurate genotyping achieved through UMI‐based targeted sequencing, the number of tested SNPs could be reduced from thousands 20, 21 to hundreds. To this end, SNP selection was performed based on population genetics data and comprised selection criteria that would simplify calculations, reduce SNP redundancy, and increase discriminative power (Data S1). The criteria to increase discriminative power by selecting SNPs with high heterozygosity were consistent with previous studies, 20 and the selection process subjectively resulted in a panel of 356 target‐SNPs (Table S1). Following sequencing data analysis, 108 to 174 target‐SNPs were classified as effective‐SNPs and included in paternity calculations (Table 2). These numbers were comparable with that reported in a previous study where an initial panel of over 1400 SNPs had been sequenced, but only 130 to 162 SNPs were used in paternity calculations, 22 suggesting that the present selection process effectively reduced the number of redundant SNPs and increased the percentage of effective‐SNPs. Although, in general, the more SNPs sequenced, the more the discriminating power of the test, in practice, the actual number of SNPs sequenced would be limited by costs and high cfDNA input, and the discriminating power would be dependent on the number of SNPs that are eventually included in paternity calculations.

### Perceived barriers to paternal expanded carrier screening following a positive maternal result: to screen or not to screen [^87afa789]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2021). Medium credibility.

Expanded carrier screening identifies individuals who are at risk of having a child with an autosomal recessive condition. The most accurate risk assessment requires that both mother and father undergo carrier screening to determine whether they are carriers of the same autosomal recessive condition. A couple identified as carriers of the same condition has a 25% chance of having a child with that condition. However, the father does not always opt for carrier screening following a positive result in the mother. This study aimed to identify barriers that prevent the father from carrier screening after a positive finding in the mother. A total of 58 women participated in this study. All participants had undergone expanded carrier screening prior to the study and had met with a genetic counselor for a pre-test, informed consent session. Of the 58 women, 34 had partners who did not undergo screening and 24 had partners who did. Participants completed a survey to determine the barriers that prevented the father of the baby's participation. We report that the mother's insurance type, whether the father has insurance, relationship status, and knowledge of the carrier screen showed statistically significant differences between women whose partners underwent screening and those that did not. In summary, our finding suggests that increasing insurance coverage of paternal screening and improving the patient's knowledge of the expanded screen would encourage paternal screening.

Genomic testing, including single-nucleotide polymorphism-based microarrays and whole-genome sequencing, can detect long stretches of the genome that display homozygosity. The presence of these segments, when distributed across multiple chromosomes, can indicate a familial relationship between the proband's parents. This article describes the detection of possible consanguinity by genomic testing and the factors confounding the inference of a specific p-arental relationship. It is designed to guide the documentation of suspected consanguinity by clinical laboratory professionals and to alert laboratories to the need to establish a reporting policy in conjunction with their ethics review committee and legal counsel.

### Detection and integration of genotyping errors in statistical genetics [^ac44a29f]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

Detection of genotyping errors and integration of such errors in statistical analysis are relatively neglected topics, given their importance in gene mapping. A few inopportunely placed errors, if ignored, can tremendously affect evidence for linkage. The present study takes a fresh look at the calculation of pedigree likelihoods in the presence of genotyping error. To accommodate genotyping error, we present extensions to the Lander-Green-Kruglyak deterministic algorithm for small pedigrees and to the Markov-chain Monte Carlo stochastic algorithm for large pedigrees. These extensions can accommodate a variety of error models and refrain from simplifying assumptions, such as allowing, at most, one error per pedigree. In principle, almost any statistical genetic analysis can be performed taking errors into account, without actually correcting or deleting suspect genotypes. Three examples illustrate the possibilities. These examples make use of the full pedigree data, multiple linked markers, and a prior error model. The first example is the estimation of genotyping error rates from pedigree data. The second-and currently most useful-example is the computation of posterior mistyping probabilities. These probabilities cover both Mendelian-consistent and Mendelian-inconsistent errors. The third example is the selection of the true pedigree structure connecting a group of people from among several competing pedigree structures. Paternity testing and twin zygosity testing are typical applications.

Maternal contamination

It is recommended that a maternal cell contamination test be performed on all prenatal specimens in order to rule out significant contamination of fetal DNA with maternal DNA. It is important to consider that all CVS and AF samples (with or without culture) may have maternal contamination. Although chorionic villus samples should be carefully dissected to remove maternal tissue,it is still important to check that maternal contamination is not present. Monitoring for maternal contamination is achieved by the analysis of polymorphic DNA sites in the fetal versus parental DNA samples.

The possibility of maternal DNA contamination should be investigated (and preferably excluded) in every case. It is recommended to use a panel of short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRs). There are several commercially available STR kits, such as the Amp FISTR Identifier kit (ABI), which analyses 16 STR markers. When the fetal globin genotype is the same as that of the mother, and there are no informative markers to indicate the presence or absence of maternal contamination, the fetal diagnosis report should state these findings and indicate a greater risk of error in the fetal result.
In dichorionic diamniotic twins (DCDA) where it is important to obtain an accurate diagnosis for each twin, STR analysis should be used to confirm there has been no twin-to-twin sample mixing, during fetal sampling. This is particularly important if the sample was obtained by CVS. In such cases, reporting the fetal sex may also be beneficial to obstetricians in the event that they have to carry out a selective termination.
If the paternal DNA sample is analysed in addition to the fetal and maternal DNA sample, then these tests may also identify non-paternity. Such incidental findings should be handled according to local practice. In laboratories which do not routinely analyse paternal samples when performing prenatal diagnosis, paternity is assumed to be true and the prenatal report should state that the accuracy of the diagnosis is based on declared relationships.

Patient consent and reports

According to local practices and legislation, there should be a consent form signed by the patient and counsellor accompanying the diagnostic samples, consenting to DNA testing, DNA storage and, if appropriate, the use of the remaining DNA for standardizing and developing new tests.

The fetal DNA report should detail the types of DNA analysis performed and clearly state the risk of misdiagnosis based on the reported technical errors of the protocols utilized.

### An ethical argument for health insurance coverage of paternal prenatal genetic testing [^0506dcef]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite evidence-based recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Medical Genetics to offer prenatal genetic carrier screening for reproductive partners, partner carrier screening or genetic testing is inconsistently covered by pregnant patients' health insurance plans. Health policies that exclude reproductive partners from insurance coverage for prenatal carrier screening or genetic testing contradict multiple ethical principles and can even contribute to adverse maternal-child health outcomes. Incomplete or missing information regarding partner carrier status can lead to costly, invasive, and potentially risky interventions for the pregnant patient that can be avoided by a simple and less expensive blood test in the reproductive partner. Lack of information regarding carrier status also harms the neonate by obviating an opportunity for early detection and treatment of potential medical complications. Insurance policies that exclude coverage for paternal genetic testing perpetuate the disproportionate burdens of pregnancy care and risk shouldered by pregnant people. To rectify these ethical dilemmas, partner carrier screening and genetic testing should be considered and covered as routine components of obstetric health care that are covered by health insurance.

### Committee opinion no. 693: counseling about genetic testing and communication of genetic test results [^770f4176]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Nonpaternity and consanguinity—pretest disclosure and legal considerations include that nonpaternity has been estimated to be found in 3–10% of pregnancies, and genetic tests that compare fetal and parental DNA can disclose nonpaternity, so the possibility of nonpaternity should be discussed with the patient so she can fully consider options if there is a chance of nonpaternity. Genetic technologies that rely on sequence analysis may reveal parental consanguinity, which should be disclosed before testing, and in suspected consanguinity in a minor’s pregnancy, obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care providers are encouraged to discuss reporting requirements with qualified legal professionals.

### What is the role of paternal genetic transmission on risk for PTSD and internalizing and externalizing disorders? [^1934966b]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Four different sets of half-sibling pairs were then defined, being groups with discordant biological fathers for PTSD, MD, AUD, or DUD, one group for each paternal disorder, consisting of 1,752, 8,888, 15,295, and 5,224 maternal half-sibling pairs, respectively. The offspring lived for no longer than 1 year with an affected father, to restrict environmental influence of affected fathers. Notably, inverse analyses examining maternal genetic risk were not possible, as there were not sufficient numbers of paternal half-sibling pairs with discordant biologic mothers.

In multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models, we studied lifetime diagnoses of PTSD, MD, AUD, or DUD in biological father, on time to first diagnosis (of PTSD, MD, AUD, or DUD) in offspring. Hazard ratios (HRs) refer to the potential increase in risk in the child with the affected father compared to their half-sibling with an unaffected father. We made use of separate stratums for each half-sibling pair to adjust for unmeasured shared factors among the half-siblings. Offspring age was used as time scale and individuals were followed from age five, or from 1987-01-01, whichever occurred lastly, to first diagnosis, emigration, death, or study end of 2018-12-31, whichever occurred firstly. The year 1987 was chosen for reasons of availability of PTSD data in registries. Models were controlled for sex and birth year of child and birth year in father. To further evaluate any sex-specific effects, all models were run with additional interaction effects between the exposure of having an affected biological father, with the sex of the child. The 16 interaction effects were evaluated at Bonferroni-corrected levels of 0.05/16 = 0.003. To evaluate differences in effects dependent on type of paternal diagnosis, all data were included in the same model with separate effects for the different paternal diagnoses and with robust variance to take into account offspring included more than once. We calculated contrasts of differences between paternal diagnoses for testing whether they differed at Bonferroni-corrected levels of 0.05/24 = 0.002.

Data analysis was conducted from February 27, 2024, to October 31, 2024. Statistical analyses were performed using R, version 4.4.0 (R,) and SAS, version 9.4 (Inc.).

### Keeping it in the family: reproduction beyond genetic parenthood [^ec12a149]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Recent decades have seen the facilitation of unconventional or even extraordinary reproductive endeavours. Sperm has been harvested from dying or deceased men at the request of their wives; reproductive tissue has been surgically removed from children at the request of their parents; deceased adults’ frozen embryos have been claimed by their parents, in order to create grandchildren; wombs have been transplanted from mothers to their daughters. What is needed for requests to be honoured by healthcare staff is that they align with widely shared expectations about what people’s reproductive potential ought to be, what marital relationships ought to result in, and which kinds of ties are desirable between parents and children. Costly and invasive technologies are not considered excessive when they are used to support the building of appropriate families. However, deviations from dominant reproductive norms, even if technologically simple and convenient to the participants, are unlikely to receive support. In this paper, we offer examples of such deviations and explore their implications. If reproduction is important as a way of creating genetic relationships, should reproductive material in storage be offered to genetic relatives other than the people from whom it originated? And if parents are allowed to have reproductive material collected from their offspring, or even to use it to create babies, should offspring likewise be allowed to use their parents’ reproductive material? We tackle these questions and suggest ways in which interests in genetic ties could be operationalised in a more coherent and less-invasive manner than they currently are.

Recent decades have seen the facilitation of unconventional or even extraordinary reproductive endeavours. Sperm has been harvested from dying or deceased men at the request of their wives; reproductive tissue has been surgically removed from children at the request of their parents; deceased adults' frozen embryos have been claimed by their parents, in order to create grandchildren; wombs have been transplanted from mothers to their daughters.

### If marc is suzanne's father, does it follow that suzanne is marc's child? An experimental philosophy study in reproductive ethics [^fa3059c5]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Looked at in this way, the genetic relationship between Marc and the donor may be regarded by our respondents as a proxy indicator of a future relationship between the resulting offspring and the sperm donor. If so, it is not obviously the genes themselves that are the significant feature here. A follow-up study could yield interesting results if it included, for example, a friend of Marc’s or an adoptive sibling as a sperm donor. In such a case, one might also assume an ongoing relationship, but one which would lack a close genetic connection between Marc and the sperm donor.

The emergence of an asymmetry between the respondents’ interpretation of the child/parent relationship may also indicate that people view parenthood as something that has a variety of components. Parent can be a verb as well as a noun. It is not just what one is, but also what one does. In contrast, the word ‘child’ is not a verb, and does not function in the same semantic way as the term ‘parent’. To be x’s child is thus interpreted in one particular relational sense, which is primarily biological: participants regard the offspring as being the child of the sperm donor, even where they also regard Marc as the father.

However, to be y’s parent can be understood in a variety of ways, some of which are static and biologically given, while others are dynamic and active. It may be this that leads to the apparently inconsistent ‘x is y’s parent, but y is not x’s child’. This apparent inconsistency, though, seems not only explainable but perhaps justifiable if one takes a Lockean view of what makes someone a father: ‘So little power does the bare act of begetting give a Man over his Issue, if all his Care ends there, and this be all the Title he hath to the Name and Authority of a father.’For Locke, being a father is something that emerges from the activities of caring. By implication, fatherhood is a status that can be gained or lost and is not fixed biologically.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Collection of samples

Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 15 pregnant mothers, and peripheral blood or buccal samples were obtained from the alleged fathers, close male relatives of the alleged fathers, and 60 unrelated men. Paired amniotic fluid samples collected at 16 to 19 weeks of gestation from two of the pregnant mothers were provided by the Prenatal Diagnostic Laboratory at Tsan Yuk Hospital (Hong Kong, China), and buccal samples were collected from the newborn in three other cases. All participants were of Han Chinese origin. Maternal peripheral blood samples (approximately 10 mL) were collected in cell‐free DNA collection tubes (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and peripheral blood samples from adult males (approximately 5 mL) were collected in Vacuette blood collection tubes (Greiner Bio‐One, Kremsmünster, Austria). Buccal samples were collected using flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA). Only singleton pregnancies were included in the study, and gestational ages at blood sampling were 7 to 20 weeks. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Medtimes Medical Group Ethics Review Board.

2.2 Extraction of DNA

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of male adults and from buccal swab and amniotic fluid samples using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Maternal cfDNA was extracted from maternal plasma using the Maxwell RSC LV ccfDNA Custom Kit (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Concentrations of the extracted genomic DNA and cfDNA were measured using the NanoDrop Lite spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit with the Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively. All procedures were performed following the respective manufacturer's protocols for the respective sample types.

2.3 Selection of SNPs

An initial panel of SNPs with minor allele frequencies greater than 0.30 and covering all 22 autosomes was selected as target‐SNPs for sequencing (Table S1). This panel was selected based on population genetics data from the 1000 Genomes Project according to a list of defining criteria (Data S1) and for practical purposes, subjectively stipulated to include only 356 SNPs.

### Guidelines for the appropriate use of genetic tests in infertile couples [^9b1342db]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

Research on genetic causes of male and female infertility rapidly expanded in the last years, following the development of in vitro fertilising techniques. Genetic tests are now available to explore the cause of the infertility and assess the risk of a given couple to transmit its genetic characteristics. This allows at-risk couples to take an informed decision when electing for a medically assisted reproduction. It also allows the professionals to offer a prenatal diagnosis when appropriate. Thus, the genetic work-up of the infertile couple has become good practice for an appropriate diagnosis, treatment and prognostic assessment. The lack of national or international rules for the genetic approach to the infertile couple, prompted the Italian community of professionals in the field of reproductive medicine to join and set up guidelines for the genetic diagnosis of male and female infertility. The group of clinical and research experts is representative of 12 national scientific societies and was supported by external experts from four international societies. We examine the clinically relevant genetic causes of male and female infertility and suggest the category of patients for which each genetic test is recommended or optional, both for an accurate diagnosis and prior to ART.

General revisions to standardized pedigree nomenclature—The ‘E’ notation (Evaluation) from the previous recommendations has been eliminated because of a lack of general usage, and the results of the individual's evaluation(s) can be listed below the individual's symbol, but they do not need to be preceded by an ‘E’. The Task Force discussed changing the ‘relationship line’ connecting spouses or partners from a solid to a dotted line, but it was decided that such a change is largely unnecessary and would be disruptive both to practicing clinicians and electronic medical records and pedigree software; in consanguineous unions, a solid double line denotes a genetic relationship.

Conclusion

In this paper, we explore the question of whether access to gametes and embryos in storage ought to be extended to those other than their genetic parents (or their parents’ parents). We note that reproductive interventions, such as harvesting sperm from dead men or invasive experimental fertility preserving surgery on small children, are increasingly being undertaken while other measures that may be more straightforward and less costly are disallowed. The idea that genetic family connections are valuable has been important in justifying and facilitating access to reproductive technologies. Yet there is a bias towards only some genetic relationships, and only some trajectories of genetic transmission. We suggest that family members more broadly may have some of the same—or equally valid—interests as prospective genetic parents do and may therefore benefit from access to gametes, embryos and other reproductive tissues of their genetic relatives. (Other people may also have a claim, but in this paper we have stayed within the confines of the assumption that genetic relatedness is valuable and only questioned the type of close genetic relatedness.) In a world where infertility rates are rising, and the social, medical and health costs of fertility treatment are steep, we suggest that there are grounds for expanding our perspectives on who ought to have access to reproductive materials in storage.

### Framing the utility and potential pitfalls of relationship and identity DNA testing across United States immigration contexts [^19c5260b]. HGG Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ethical and social implications of DNA relationship testing in the context of immigration are compounded by a combination of the vulnerabilities of migrant populations and the potential harms that might arise from testing.,,Many of the potential harms of DNA testing are shared across immigration and health-related contexts, including discrimination, stigmatization, privacy violations, revelation of sensitive information (such as misattributed parentage), and poorly informed or coerced consent. In immigration contexts, these risks are heightened by the power differential between those undergoing testing and those ordering the tests. While healthcare providers might be considered figures of authority, immigration agents or officials have the power to make decisions about families’ futures based on genetic information. The recent, rapid expansions of DNA testing for relationship verification in US immigration contexts—in both volume and purpose—demonstrate this power.

DNA data have been used to verify relationships for family-based immigration visas since a 1985 case in the United Kingdom.In the United States, DNA testing was first harnessed as evidence for family-based immigration visas in a legacy Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) memo in 2000, which instructed that officers could suggest DNA testing in cases where other forms of documentation failed to verify a relationship.DNA testing has continued to be voluntary in most cases, with few exceptions (Table 1). Where DNA testing is voluntary, it might be requested by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) after reviewing the evidence of the relationship provided; attorneys and/or clients also may choose to use DNA testing if they know there is little other documentation (e.g. birth certificate) of a relationship. Commercial relationship laboratories provide DNA testing for family-based immigration visas; currently, relationship testing laboratories must be accredited by the American Academy of Blood Banks (AABB) for results to be accepted in immigration and legal proceedings.Generally, only close relationships, such as parent-child or siblings, are tested. The genetic markers tested depend on the laboratory, but most use a set of 20–30 standardized, highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) markers. The laboratory will issue a report indicating the likelihood of the tested relationship to the ordering party and the government agency seeking the results.

### Male-biased mutation rates and the overestimation of extrapair paternity: problem, solution, and illustration using thick-billed murres (uria lomvia, alcidae) [^089dd2cc]. The Journal of Heredity (2004). Low credibility.

The widespread utility of hypervariable loci in genetic studies derives from the high mutation rate, and thus the high polymorphism, of these loci. Recent evidence suggests that mutation rates can be extremely high and may be male biased (occurring in the male germ-line). These two factors combined may result in erroneous overestimates of extrapair paternity, since legitimate offspring with novel alleles will have more mismatches with respect to the biological father than the biological mother. As mutations are male driven, increasing the number of hypervariable loci screened may simply increase the number of mismatches between fathers and their legitimate offspring. Here we describe a simple statistic, the probability of resemblance (PR), to distinguish between mismatches due to parental misassignment versus mutation in either sex or null alleles. We apply this method to parentage data on thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), and demonstrate that, without considering either mutations or male-biased mutation rates, cases of extrapair paternity (7% in this study) would be grossly overestimated (14.5%-22%). The probability of resemblance can be utilized in parentage studies of any sexually reproducing species when allele or haplotype frequency data are available for putative parents and offspring. We suggest calculating this probability to correctly categorize legitimate offspring when mutations and null alleles may cause mismatches.

### Benchmarking statistical methods for analyzing parent-child dyads in genetic association studies [^b175b162]. Genetic Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Studies of genetic associations of most human traits and diseases focus on population‐based designs (e.g. case–control studies, cohort studies, or data from biobanks) especially for complex and heterogeneous disorders, where both genetic and environmental risk factors are likely involved. For rare disorders, this often requires amassing cases sampled from multiple populations, which creates the possibility of type I error inflation due to confounding (as termed by epidemiologists) or population stratification (as referred to by geneticists). Family‐based designs, on the other hand, play an important role in the investigation of genetic underpinnings of low frequency or rare disorders (e.g. birth defects) (Benyamin et al.). The case–parent trio design is one of the most popular family‐based designs which consists of an affected child (i.e. the proband) and both parents. Statistical methods focused on transmission of variants within families, such as in case–parent trio design, protect against population stratification (Schwender et al.). However, genetic information on both parents is often not available because it is more difficult to recruit biological fathers, which often leads to an abundance of information on mother–child dyads (Shi et al.). As more multiethnic studies become possible, the value of family‐based methods that are less prone to population stratification are key for studies of childhood diseases. It is essential to define the best suited analytical approach for each alternative family‐based scenario, especially in the presence of a predominance of dyads in available samples.

Identity testing—The major application of identity testing is to establish a relationship between individuals or samples by characterizing highly variable regions of human DNA, typically short tandem repeats and/or single-nucleotide polymorphisms; with sufficient informative markers, it is possible to establish a relationship between genetic samples with high confidence; older or more degraded samples may provide lower quantities of high-quality genetic material, requiring a more limited test; other applications include suspected specimen swaps, establishing parentage or biological relationships, forensic identification of a decedent or suspect, and chimerism analysis in bone marrow transplant cases to assess donor-recipient genetic mixture.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^3f3385cd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening—general principles emphasize informed choice, timing, partner testing, and documentation: Information about genetic carrier screening should be provided to every pregnant woman, and after counseling, a patient may decline any or all screening. Carrier screening and counseling ideally should be performed before pregnancy to enable consideration of reproductive options, including advanced reproductive technologies. If an individual is found to be a carrier, the individual’s reproductive partner should be offered testing, and concurrent screening of the patient and her partner is suggested when timelines for prenatal diagnostic decisions are constrained. If both partners are carriers, genetic counseling should be offered and prenatal diagnosis and advanced reproductive technologies to decrease the risk of an affected offspring should be discussed. Prenatal carrier screening does not replace newborn screening, nor does newborn screening replace the potential value of prenatal carrier screening. Carriers’ relatives are at increased risk, patients should be encouraged to inform relatives, and clinicians should not disclose this information without the patient’s permission. Family history, including ethnic background and any known consanguinity, is important for risk assessment; individuals with a positive family history should be offered carrier screening and may benefit from genetic counseling, ideally with information on the specific mutation. Carrier screening for a particular condition generally should be performed only once and documented in the health record, and any decision to rescreen should be undertaken only with the guidance of a genetics professional who can assess the incremental benefit of repeat testing for additional mutations.

### Forensic use of Y-chromosome DNA: a general overview [^ee4aafd9]. Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

The male-specific part of the human Y chromosome is widely used in forensic DNA analysis, particularly in cases where standard autosomal DNA profiling is not informative. A Y-chromosomal gene fragment is applied for inferring the biological sex of a crime scene trace donor. Haplotypes composed of Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat polymorphisms (Y-STRs) are used to characterise paternal lineages of unknown male trace donors, especially suitable when males and females have contributed to the same trace, such as in sexual assault cases. Y-STR haplotyping applied in crime scene investigation can (i) exclude male suspects from involvement in crime, (ii) identify the paternal lineage of male perpetrators, (iii) highlight multiple male contributors to a trace, and (iv) provide investigative leads for finding unknown male perpetrators. Y-STR haplotype analysis is employed in paternity disputes of male offspring and other types of paternal kinship testing, including historical cases, as well as in special cases of missing person and disaster victim identification involving men. Y-chromosome polymorphisms are applied for inferring the paternal bio-geographic ancestry of unknown trace donors or missing persons, in cases where autosomal DNA profiling is uninformative. In this overview, all different forensic applications of Y-chromosome DNA are described. To illustrate the necessity of forensic Y-chromosome analysis, the investigation of a prominent murder case is described, which initiated two changes in national forensic DNA legislation both covering Y-chromosome use, and was finally solved via an innovative Y-STR dragnet involving thousands of volunteers after 14 years. Finally, expectations for the future of forensic Y-chromosome DNA analysis are discussed.

Pregnancy after vasectomy—Most men whose partners become pregnant after vasectomy have motile sperm in the semen, but some are azoospermic on multiple examinations, and if azoospermia is found the physician should inform the patient that the pregnancy could have been due to a transient recanalization despite the semen analysis results. Case reports have confirmed paternity based on genetic testing even when men previously had multiple semen analyses showing azoospermia (sperm counts below the limit of detection), and patients may be informed that genetic analysis to document paternity is available.

### Legal developments in assisted reproduction [^3b65e99d]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2008). Low credibility.

Courts have been quite consistent in allowing ex-partners in marriages or similar relationships, usually men, to veto the other partner's reproductive use of jointly-created IVF embryos. This supports the principle of voluntary parenthood. In contrast, child custody disputes following surrogate motherhood may favor the commissioning couple or the surrogate. Decisive are the best interests of the child, which a court may find favorable to the former or the latter, or custody shared between them. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) may be restricted by governmental licensing regulations, and raises concerns about diagnosis showing noninheritance of a feared disorder, but not other conditions harming a subsequently born child. Travel abroad raises concerns of legality. Some countries explicitly allow nationals to go to other countries for services legally barred in their own, but others would bind nationals by their prohibitive laws if they were to receive, or counsel, services abroad that are lawful where delivered.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^0962b15c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening counseling and partner testing—if a woman is found to be a carrier for a specific condition, her reproductive partner should be offered screening to provide accurate genetic counseling for the couple with regard to the risk of having an affected child. Additional genetic counseling should be provided to discuss the specific condition, residual risk, and options for prenatal testing, and if a carrier couple (ie, carriers for the same condition) is identified before pregnancy, genetic counseling is encouraged so that reproductive options (eg, donor gametes, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis) can be discussed. Individuals with a family history of a genetic disorder may benefit from the identification of the specific familial mutation or mutations rather than carrier screening, and knowledge of the specific familial mutation may allow for more specific and rapid prenatal diagnosis. Prenatal carrier screening does not replace newborn screening, nor does newborn screening diminish the potential benefit of prenatal carrier screening, and screening for any condition is optional and, after counseling, a patient may decline any or all carrier screening.

Special considerations for possible first- or second-degree parental relationship—When the percentage of homozygosity could be consistent with a first- or second-degree parental relationship (>10% ROH with multiple ROH of >3–5 Mb or larger), laboratory reports should indicate that the results could be associated with possible consanguinity to ensure that the ordering clinician understands the implications.

### Paternal age bioethics [^390daf44]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

Modern genetic sequencing studies have confirmed that the sperm of older men contain a greater number of de novo germline mutations than the sperm of younger men. Although most of these mutations are neutral or of minimal phenotypic impact, a minority of them present a risk to the health of future children. If demographic trends towards later fatherhood continue, this will likely lead to a more children suffering from genetic disorders. A trend of later fatherhood will accelerate the accumulation of paternal-origin de novo mutations in the gene pool, gradually reducing human fitness in the long term. These risks suggest that paternal age is of ethical importance. Children affected by de novo mutations arising from delayed fatherhood can be said to be harmed, in the sense of 'impersonal' harm or 'non-comparative' harm. Various strategies are open at societal and individual levels towards reducing deleterious paternal age effects. Options include health education to promote earlier fatherhood, incentives for young sperm donors and state-supported universal sperm banking. The latter approach would likely be of the greatest benefit and could in principle be implemented immediately. More futuristically, human germline genetic modification offers the potential to repair heritable mutational damage.

### Estimating genetic relatedness in admixed populations [^0f287c64]. G3 (2018). Low credibility.

Estimating genetic relatedness is an important problem in biological statistics and population genetics. For instance, paternity or maternity assignment (see,,,), and forensic studies (reviewed in) require a robust statistical framework to infer relatedness between genotyped individuals. Genetic relatedness also plays an important role in the study of quantitative traits where the proportion of trait variability explained by shared alleles indicates the strength of the genetic component of the trait. In several allied fields, accurate estimation of genetic relatedness is critical. For instance, association studies and linkage analyses without accounting for the increased relatedness due to population genetic structure could lead to spurious associations. Genetic relatedness is also important in fields such as conservation genetics.

The genetic relatedness,between two individuals X and Y can be defined in terms of the probability that their alleles are Identical By Descent (IBD).is thus also twice the coefficient of coancestry,and can be thought of as the inbreeding coefficient of any offspring that X and Y may sire.

Conventional relatedness estimators work in either of three ways: (1) estimating a coefficient of relatedness between two individuals using multilocus genotype data, and linkage data to inform the length of IBD tract sharing; or (2) assigning sib-ship partitions, reconstructing pedigrees, and using the pedigrees to estimate relatedness; or (3) directly estimating relatedness from known pedigrees. All relatedness estimators, however, have high variances, primarily owing to difficulty in parsing out true IBD states from observed Identity By State (IBS) states. This delineation of IBS vs. IBD is achieved by estimating the conditional probabilities of observing a genotype at a locus in one individual X, given the observed genotype at the same locus in individual Y.

In the presence of population genetic structure though, localized inbreeding makes individuals within the same subpopulation ‘more related’, than as suggested by their pedigree. Pervasive or specific inbreeding in recent generations past between two related individuals can be quantified though, if sufficient information is available on the existing genetic subpopulation structure. The estimated inbreeding coefficients (e.g. θ,) affect the aforementioned conditional probabilities. Alternately, maintenance of advantageous alleles in subpopulations by selection within a total population could also yield ‘artificial’ patterns of relatedness between individuals that share alleles, but not necessarily by direct descent.

### What do the results of genetic (...) [^49ca7919]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Many genes in which harmful genetic changes increase the risk for cancer have been identified. Having an inherited harmful genetic change in one of these genes is sometimes referred to as having a hereditary cancer syndrome. Genetic testing of the blood or saliva can be used to identify whether someone has an inherited harmful genetic change in one of these genes. How is genetic testing done. Genetic tests are usually requested by a genetic counselor, doctor, or other health care provider who has reviewed an individual’s personal and family medical history and identified a potential inherited cancer pattern. Testing is done on a small sample of bodily fluid or tissue—usually blood but sometimes saliva, cells from inside the cheek, or skin cells. The sample is then sent to a genetic testing laboratory. Test results are usually returned in about 2 to 3 weeks.
- family members with breast or ovarian cancer
- family members with colon cancer and endometrial cancer
- Cancer in both organs in a set of paired organs, such as both kidneys or both breasts
- Rare types of cancer
- The presence of birth defects that are known to be associated with inherited cancer syndromes, such as certain noncancerous illnesses or physical abnormalities.
- Being a member of a racial or ethnic group that is known to have an increased risk of having a certain inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome and having one or more of the above features as well It is generally recommended that, when possible, genetic counseling and testing for a hereditary cancer syndrome begin with a family member who has had cancer. What genetic tests are available for inherited cancer risk. There are several types of genetic tests that are used to look for harmful inherited gene changes that may be present in a family.

The standard approach uses tests that look for harmful variants in multiple genes at the same time. These tests, called multigene tests, are often used when there is not a known gene mutation in a family. Depending on the patient’s personal and family history as well as their preference for the amount of information they want, the health care provider may order a panel test that focuses on genes for a particular type of cancer, or they may order a broad panel test that looks at genes linked to a variety of common cancers. When a gene variant is known to be present in the family, sometimes the entire gene is tested for changes. Alternatively, testing may focus on just the specific variant that is known to be present in the family.

### Increased power for detection of parent-of-origin effects via the use of haplotype estimation [^eb47cf9c]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Utility of Paternal Data for Detection of Maternally Inherited Imprinting Effects

Although case-mother duos are a more commonly used unit than case-father duos, in real studies, both types of duos might be collected. In Figure S4, it can be seen that, somewhat counter-intuitively, when performing a test of the parameter I m in the presence of genuine maternally inherited imprinting effects, more power is gained from a sample of case-father duos than from a sample of case-mother duos. (Both types of duos provide less power than case-parent trios.) This is true whether or not haplotype estimation with SHAPEIT2 is performed. This observation can be explained by the observation that, to detect maternally inherited imprinting effects, we are only interested in determining whether or not the child inherited a risk allele from the mother. The expected proportion of case-mother duos in which the parent of origin can be determined unambiguously can be calculated from column five of Table 3 of Ainsworth et al.;a similar calculation can be performed for case-father duos. Performing this calculation, we find that, provided the allele frequency of the maternally transmitted allele that increases disease risk is < 0.5 (i.e. the “risk” allele is the minor allele), a higher proportion of case-father duos than case-mother duos allows unambiguous determination of the parent of origin (data not shown). If the major allele is the risk allele, this is reversed, and it is the case-mother duos that provide the greater power. Similarly, for a paternally inherited imprinting effect, provided the risk allele is the minor allele, it is the case-mother duos that provide the higher power; if instead the risk allele is the major allele, case-father duos provide higher power.

### Modeling assortative mating and genetic similarities between partners, siblings, and in-laws [^943d7019]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Ethics

The establishment of The Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and initial data collection was based on a license from the Norwegian Data Protection Agency and approval from The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics. The MoBa cohort is now based on regulations related to the Norwegian Health Registry Act. The current study was approved by The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics, Southern and Eastern Norway (project# 2017/2205). Informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The consent allows linking with data from other sources. The participants did not receive monetary compensation.

Sample

MoBa is a population-based pregnancy cohort study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Participants were recruited from all over Norway from 1999 to 2008. The women consented to participation in 41% of the pregnancies. The cohort now includes 114,500 children, 95,200 mothers and 75,200 fathers. The current study is based on version 12 of the quality-assured data files.

We use data on the parent generation in the MoBa sample, that is, mothers and fathers but not children, and study the following relationship types among them, detailed in Fig. 1 : Partners are the opposite-sex genetic parents of a child, regardless of their past or current relationship status. Siblings descend from the same two parents in the generation before the one represented in our study sample. We do not use data from individuals with unknown parents. In-laws (siblings-in-law) are separated by two degrees, one of partnership and one of siblingship, that is, either one’s sibling’s partner or one’s partner’s sibling. Co-in-laws (co-siblings-in-law) are the respective partners of siblings and are thus separated by three degrees: two of marriage and one of siblingship, that is, one’s partner’s sibling’s partner. We identified siblings and their partners mapped through a link with the population register at Statistics Norway. This way, we identified 63,781 complete pairs of partners, 13,455 complete pairs of siblings, 21,496 complete pairs of in-laws, and 8699 complete pairs of co-in-laws (after removing 3 extended families where the co-in-laws were siblings). Women were on average 30.62 (SD = 4.66) years old and men were on average 33.18 (SD = 5.37) years old.

### Keeping it in the family: reproduction beyond genetic parenthood [^e86dee08]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Becoming a parent is a sought-after milestone in the Western world and beyond. And for many, it is vastly preferable that one’s children are one’s own, that is, one’s genetic offspring. Other possibilities, such as gamete donation or adoption, tend to be sought only as a last resort.Even when one’s family member is not capable of participating in reproductive decisions, there may be a default assumption that they would wish to have children. It has been claimed that when a man dies and his wife wishes to have reproductive material collected from him so as to create a child, the guiding principle should be one of ‘inferred consent’.

Parents are expected to care about their offspring reproducing. The parents of children who are at risk of losing their fertility are said to have an obligation to undertake fertility preservation measures.Parents’ wish to help their offspring to procreate may even transcend the death of those offspring—for example, in the case where four adults created their own grandchildren, 4 years after their own offspring—the grandchildren’s genetic parents—died in a car crash.

### Genome-wide association analyses in family triads and dyads following assisted reproductive technology [^57b99561]. Genetic Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.1 The Case‐Parent Triad Design

The motivation behind the original association tests for case‐parent triads (Falk and Rubinstein) was that the design provides excellent protection against population stratification. In the case‐parent triad design, a fetal effect is a relative risk (RR) estimated by comparing the frequencies of the alleles transmitted to the offspring to the frequencies of the non‐transmitted alleles. The non‐transmitted alleles thus function as “pseudo‐controls,” perfectly matched to the transmitted alleles within a parent. Although distinct population subgroups might confound a standard case–control analysis, family triad data avoid this through the implicit matching.

An additional—and increasingly popular—benefit of the case‐parent triad design is the possibility of estimating additional genetic effects such as maternal effects and PoO effects. It also facilitates reconstruction of haplotypes from a selection of SNPs, since phase can be deduced from knowing the PoO of SNP alleles. In a family triad, maternal effects refer to the possible impact of maternal genes directly on the offspring during pregnancy. Estimating maternal effects from case‐parent triads involves comparing allele frequencies (both transmitted and non‐transmitted) in the mothers with allele frequencies in the fathers, assuming fathers to be “neutral,” that is, that paternal genes do not influence the risk of the offspring carrying the trait (Wilcox et al.; Weinberg et al.; Gjessing and Lie). This design is still “matched” in the sense that as long as both parents in a triad derive from the same subpopulation, there is a protection against population stratification. However, the design is more exposed to systematic bias if mothers and fathers to some extent derive from different subpopulations with different allele frequencies. A PoO effect, on the other hand, refer to how the effect of a fetal allele may depend on the parent of origin of that allele. PoO effects are frequently associated with imprinting effects and, therefore, often assume the absence of effect from one of the two fetal alleles, for instance the paternally derived allele (Gjerdevik et al.). A PoO effect can also be seen as an interaction effect, where the parent of origin of the allele interacts with the allele effect. Depending on how a PoO effect is implemented in the model, it may benefit from the same protection against population stratification as a regular fetal effect, or as a maternal effect.

### Genetic counseling and screening of consanguineous couples and their offspring practice resource: focused revision [^cafa6ea8]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2021). High credibility.

Expanded carrier screening—efficiencies in technologies have reduced testing costs and increased the scope of genes that can be concurrently analyzed; in a highly consanguaneous population, unique variants accounted for more than half of pathogenic variants identified, and based on this observation, it is possible that use sequencing techniques rather than targeted variant testing will improve detection of couples at 25% risk to have offspring with an autosomal recessive condition.

### Diagnostic exome-based preconception carrier testing in consanguineous couples: results from the first 100 couples in clinical practice [^af35fc11]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Once a couple is aware of their genetic risk(s), they can opt for reproductive choices such as refraining from having (further) children, accepting the risk, using donor gametes, or considering PND and PGT to avoid the birth of an affected child. Finally, couples may use the information to optimally prepare themselves for the birth of a potentially affected child, including choices for pre- and postnatal interventions to optimize outcome where applicable. The diverse options are illustrated by our follow-up data so far. Many couples testing positive for recessive disease carrier state in PCT will not have experience with the disease in their families, complicating their informed decision-making regarding available reproductive options.PCT-specific genetic counseling is essential and we have instigated several lines of clinical follow-up to aid in the development and improvement of these approaches. The lack of availability of an affected individual, currently needed for the development of a PGT laboratory protocol,requires development of novel PGT approaches. We and others are developing methods to directly phase the parental genomes, circumventing this requirement. Recently, PGT has already moved to genome-wide methods, – allowing embryo analysis for multiple genetic defects with a single test instead of requiring multiple workups and analyses. This is clearly relevant in the context of consanguineous couples. Obviously, performing PGT for multiple disorders will yield a lower number of transferable embryos, potentially resulting in clinical and ethical dilemmas.

Naturally, couples’ opinions about the PCT and the quality of PCT-related counseling and (after-) care is of eminent importance. We are currently conducting an extensive clinical follow-up study including in-depth interviewing techniques to gain more insight in this matter and aid in the adaptation of counseling practices.

Conclusion

The results presented here show the clinical feasibility and utility of our ES-based comprehensive PCT approach for consanguineous couples. The high diagnostic yield emphasizes the benefit of including almost all AR disease genes, identifying the very rare carrier states consanguineous couples are particularly prone to. Recognizing their shared carrier status is of significant clinical importance for these couples, allowing them a well-informed reproductive choice. Our results open up avenues to future applications for this approach within the expert environment of clinical genetics. Extensive pretest counseling is essential.

### Diagnostic exome-based preconception carrier testing in consanguineous couples: results from the first 100 couples in clinical practice [^2b250719]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The percentage of consanguineous marriages in specific parts of the world, such as the Middle East, West and South Asia, Northern Africa, and parts of Southern Europe ranges from 20% to 50%.It reflects traditions in many communities worldwide offering social and economic advantages. – Although such marital practices are less common in Western European societies, increasing migration has led to increased distribution of consanguinity and its recognition as a potential factor in disease incidence and risk assessment. Preconception risk assessment enables consanguineous couples to make informed reproductive decisions, including options to avoid disease transmission such as prenatal diagnosis (PND) or preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). Relevant for clinical practice is the fact that consanguineous couples who are actually at 25% risk of having affected offspring, but without a positive family history, thus far could not be distinguished from consanguineous couples not at risk, except for relatively frequent disorders. Existing preconception carrier screening (PCS) panels generally contain limited numbers of genes and thus are less effective for the detection of the often (extremely) rare AR disease consanguineous couples may be at risk of(personal communication with centers offering smaller panels). Routine diagnostic ES has proven to be a very effective technology to identify new or rare disease genes—among these, many AR genes in consanguineous families. In a previous study, we presented pilot data and proof of principle of an unbiased ES-based preconception carrier test (PCT) in a research setting,showing its feasibility for application in diagnostics. This test was further developed toward a diagnostic, more automated pipeline and implemented in our clinical practice. Here we present the results of diagnostic PCT in 100 consanguineous couples.

### Framing the utility and potential pitfalls of relationship and identity DNA testing across United States immigration contexts [^efc658cf]. HGG Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Utility B: DNA testing can disprove or detect fraud when claimed relationships or identity are in question

In some case examples, government suspicion was directed at those seeking an immigration benefit, and DNA testing helped remove suspicion. In case 04, a DNA test was ordered by a client and his attorney to provide evidence of the client’s identity, relieving the government’s suspicion that he was not eligible for naturalization. In case 23, a man who was born to two US citizens and adopted abroad was in danger of being deported from the United States; he hoped DNA testing, in conjunction with other evidence, would demonstrate his claim to US citizenship. In case 08, it was the client and her attorney who used a DNA test to verify a claim. The client had a child whom she believed had died as an infant. Years later, an adult approached her claiming to be the child and seeking to join her in the United States. DNA testing was used to verify the relationship prior to submitting a petition for the child. While it alleviated the concerns of the attorney and client, the DNA test opened the client up to government suspicion. The question arose as to whether she had committed fraud in the past by not disclosing the existence of her child. DNA testing can help the government detect fraud, as in case 05. In this case, when the brother and sister samples submitted to a laboratory both profiled as male, and re-sampled as male, the unusual finding triggered an investigation; the investigation indicated that the same samples, known to be genetically related, were being intentionally submitted in place of actual samples of the family members. In case 06, the State Department reviewed submissions for different individuals from the same country and found that the same profile had been used for multiple cases.

### Informative missingness in genetic association studies: case-parent designs [^2de6b572]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

We consider the effect of informative missingness on association tests that use parental genotypes as controls and that allow for missing parental data. Parental data can be informatively missing when the probability of a parent being available for study is related to that parent's genotype; when this occurs, the distribution of genotypes among observed parents is not representative of the distribution of genotypes among the missing parents. Many previously proposed procedures that allow for missing parental data assume that these distributions are the same. We propose association tests that behave well when parental data are informatively missing, under the assumption that, for a given trio of paternal, maternal, and affected offspring genotypes, the genotypes of the parents and the sex of the missing parents, but not the genotype of the affected offspring, can affect parental missingness. (This same assumption is required for validity of an analysis that ignores incomplete parent-offspring trios.) We use simulations to compare our approach with previously proposed procedures, and we show that if even small amounts of informative missingness are not taken into account, they can have large, deleterious effects on the performance of tests.
