## Question

what is clozaril level range

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the therapeutic plasma concentration range for clozapine (Clozaril). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the concentration–response data that define a lower efficacy threshold and an upper safety threshold. Then, I should confirm toxicity cutoffs used in high-credibility datasets. Next, I will review pharmacokinetic context and interindividual variability, including ancestry, smoking, drug interactions, and inflammation. After that, I need to check how norclozapine and the clozapine/norclozapine ratio inform interpretation. Finally, I will verify practical TDM logistics and synthesize a clinically actionable interpretation with appropriate cautions [^117ViC4u] [^114h2VjF] [^11436ZBu] [^112ZgzdJ].

> Let me first confirm the canonical therapeutic window. I initially recalled an upper bound of about 500 ng/mL, but wait, let me verify the most consistently cited thresholds. Contemporary summaries indicate that response rates improve above roughly 350 ng/mL and that dose-dependent adverse effects increase notably above about 600 ng/mL, which supports a pragmatic target range of 350–600 ng/mL, with the lower threshold around 350 ng/mL and a soft upper safety boundary around 600 ng/mL [^117ViC4u]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; although this numeric range is derived from observational TDM literature, its clinical relevance is reinforced by large, ancestrally diverse analyses emphasizing a narrow therapeutic range and the linkage of metabolism to outcomes, even if those studies do not specify exact cut points [^112Lqq6F] [^1134kKQH].

> I should confirm where toxicity begins to dominate the risk–benefit balance. High-credibility pharmacokinetic cohorts commonly exclude plasma samples above 2000 ng/mL, which, while not a formal toxic threshold, reflects levels considered far beyond the therapeutic range and associated with safety concerns in clinical practice [^114h2VjF] [^1134kKQH]. I need to ensure we also address seizure risk, which is dose related and rises with higher plasma exposure; vigilance is warranted as concentrations climb above the 600 ng/mL region and particularly approaching four-figure levels, where neurotoxicity and other adverse effects become more likely [^116yNABD] [^117ViC4u]. Let me reconsider potential confounders; toxicology series also show severity varies with exposure context and patient familiarity, reminding me that interpretation must integrate clinical state and recent dosing history [^115tUVqF].

> Next, I will examine pharmacokinetic context to sanity-check the plausibility of these targets. At 100 mg twice daily, steady-state troughs average about 122 ng/mL with peaks around 319 ng/mL, though observed ranges are wide, reinforcing that doses must be individualized to reach 350–600 ng/mL if clinically indicated [^11436ZBu] [^112ZgzdJ]. Wait, I should double-check that this does not imply typical patients automatically sit in range at moderate doses; it does not, because interindividual variability in clearance and bioavailability is substantial, necessitating TDM to titrate toward the target window when response is suboptimal or adverse effects emerge [^115abxzr].

> Let me consider ancestry and genetics because they meaningfully shift expected concentrations at a given dose. People of sub-Saharan African ancestry tend to be faster clozapine metabolizers, whereas those of East Asian or Southwest Asian ancestry are slower metabolizers relative to people of European ancestry, implying that dose requirements to reach 350–600 ng/mL can diverge systematically across populations [^112Lqq6F] [^117FVMsH] [^111TkGcc]. Hold on, I should verify transferability; cross-ancestry PRS work demonstrates consistent directional effects of genetic predictors on plasma concentrations, supporting the clinical message that TDM should be used proactively across diverse groups to guide dosing [^1134kKQH].

> I need to check modifiable metabolic factors next. Tobacco smoke induces CYP1A2 and can lower concentrations, often requiring higher doses to reach the target window, whereas strong CYP1A2 inhibitors like fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin can markedly increase clozapine levels, sometimes necessitating dose reductions to one third when coadministered, with careful monitoring upon initiation or discontinuation of these interacting agents [^112ZgzdJ] [^113iJ5g4]. Let me verify the clinical hierarchy here; contemporary inpatient data suggest fluvoxamine exerts a strong dose-related elevation of clozapine levels and can override smoking induction, underscoring the need for rigorous TDM and cautious coadministration during titration [^115RcANW].

> But wait, what if inflammation is present. Elevated CRP and intercurrent infection can acutely raise clozapine concentrations through cytokine-mediated CYP1A2 suppression, which can push patients above the 600 ng/mL region without a dose change; monitoring levels during infection and considering temporary dose reduction can mitigate concentration-related toxicity such as sedation and seizures [^115RcANW] [^116BN5bL]. I should confirm variability within individuals; even under stable conditions, intraindividual fluctuations approach 30%, reinforcing the value of trend-based interpretation rather than a single level in isolation [^115abxzr].

> I will now examine how metabolites inform interpretation. Norclozapine is not the primary efficacy target, yet the clozapine/norclozapine ratio can illuminate adherence, metabolic status, and potential interactions; values outside roughly 0.5–3.0 often prompt re-evaluation of sampling timing, adherence, or co-factors, though the clinical target remains the parent compound concentration [^114h2VjF] [^111iZzX9]. Hold on, I should verify that we do not overinterpret norclozapine; it refines the metabolic picture but should not replace clozapine-level guided decision-making on dose [^111iZzX9].

> Next, I should review practical TDM logistics to avoid misclassification. Trough samples are best drawn at steady state at least five days after a dose change and approximately 12 hours after the last dose to standardize interpretation, with consistent sampling conditions across serial measurements to minimize noise [^111mn2TC]. Let me double-check feasibility; dried blood spot approaches and structured monitoring programs can facilitate TDM access, and population PK data confirm meaningful intraindividual variability, supporting the need for repeated and context-aware measurements rather than one-off levels [^115MTvDZ] [^115abxzr].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the actionable interpretation. The therapeutic plasma concentration range for clozapine is best targeted at 350–600 ng/mL, corresponding to approximately 1,070–1,850 nmol/L; below 350 ng/mL, likelihood of response diminishes and dose escalation or interaction review is reasonable, whereas above 600 ng/mL, risk of concentration-related adverse effects such as sedation and seizures rises and consideration of dose reduction or mitigation is prudent; risk escalates further as levels approach 1000 ng/mL, and levels exceeding about 2000 ng/mL are generally considered far beyond the therapeutic window and warrant urgent reassessment of dosing and interacting factors [^117ViC4u] [^116yNABD] [^114h2VjF] [^1134kKQH]. I need to ensure the overall approach remains individualized, integrating symptoms, side effects, and safety monitoring within guideline-based care that supports clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia with TDM to navigate its narrow therapeutic range [^111WcTdS] [^115V4fkf] [^115abxzr].

> Finally, let me verify consistency and acknowledge limitations. The 350–600 ng/mL numeric thresholds derive primarily from TDM literature rather than randomized dose–level trials, but they are widely used in practice and align with pharmacologic plausibility, PK variability, and safety signals from regulatory labeling and large observational datasets; given these converging lines of evidence, this target window remains a clinically sound anchor that should always be applied alongside careful assessment of response, tolerability, ancestry, smoking, infection, and drug interactions, with repeat levels to confirm trends before making decisive dose changes [^117ViC4u] [^11436ZBu] [^112ZgzdJ] [^112Lqq6F] [^115abxzr].

The therapeutic plasma range for clozapine (Clozaril) is **350–600 ng/mL** (trough, 12 hours post-dose). Levels below 350 ng/mL are associated with reduced efficacy, whereas levels above 600 ng/mL increase dose-dependent adverse effects, especially seizures [^117ViC4u] [^116yNABD]. For ultra-resistant cases, levels of 700–1000 ng/mL may be considered with close monitoring, but levels above 1000 ng/mL are generally avoided because of toxicity risk. Therapeutic drug monitoring is **essential** to individualize dosing and manage variability from smoking, infections, and drug interactions [^114h2VjF] [^116BN5bL] [^112Lqq6F].

## Therapeutic plasma level range

- **Therapeutic range**: 350–600 ng/mL (trough, 12 hours post-dose) [^117ViC4u].
- **Below 350 ng/mL**: Associated with reduced efficacy and higher relapse risk [^117ViC4u].
- **Above 600 ng/mL**: Increased risk of dose-dependent adverse effects, notably seizures [^116yNABD] [^117ViC4u].

---

## Clinical implications of plasma levels

### Levels below therapeutic range (< 350 ng/mL)

At levels below the therapeutic range (< 350 ng/mL), **reduced efficacy** [^117ViC4u] is evidenced by an increased risk of relapse and symptom exacerbation. Low levels may reflect **non-adherence** or **rapid metabolism** [^114TkY8p] [^114h2VjF].

---

### Levels within therapeutic range (350–600 ng/mL)

At levels within the therapeutic range (350–600 ng/mL), the **optimal balance** of efficacy and tolerability is generally achieved. Individualization remains important, with dosing tailored to **patient-specific factors** [^114h2VjF] [^112Lqq6F] [^117ViC4u].

---

### Levels above therapeutic range (> 600 ng/mL)

- **Adverse effects**: Higher risk of seizures, sedation, and cardiovascular effects [^116yNABD] [^117ViC4u].
- **Ultra-resistant cases**: Levels up to 700–1000 ng/mL may be considered with close monitoring.
- **> 1000 ng/mL**: Generally avoided due to significant toxicity risk [^117ViC4u].

## Factors influencing clozapine plasma levels

Several factors **significantly affect clozapine plasma levels**, necessitating careful monitoring and dose adjustments [^117ViC4u]:

| **Factor** | **Effect on clozapine levels** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Smoking (CYP1A2 induction) | Decreases levels | May require higher doses [^114h2VjF] [^112ZgzdJ] |
| CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine) | Increases levels | May require dose reduction [^114h2VjF] [^113iJ5g4] [^115RcANW] |
| Infections/inflammation (elevated CRP) | Increases levels | Monitor closely, adjust dose as needed [^116BN5bL] [^115RcANW] |
| Genetic variability (CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) | Variable | Individualized dosing required [^114h2VjF] [^112Lqq6F] |
| Age, sex, BMI | Variable | Individualized dosing required [^114h2VjF] [^1125ugjW] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)**: Recommended to optimize dosing and minimize adverse effects [^115abxzr] [^112Lqq6F] [^117ViC4u].
- **Individualized dosing**: Adjust based on patient-specific factors and clinical response [^114h2VjF] [^117ViC4u].
- **Regular monitoring**: Essential, especially with changes in smoking status, infections, or concomitant medications [^112ZgzdJ] [^116BN5bL] [^113iJ5g4] [^117ViC4u].

## Summary table: clozapine plasma level ranges and clinical implications

| **Plasma level (ng/mL)** | **Clinical implications** | **Recommended actions** |
|-|-|-|
| < 350 | Reduced efficacy, higher relapse risk | Increase dose, assess adherence [^117ViC4u] |
| 350–600 | Optimal efficacy and tolerability | Maintain current dose, monitor regularly [^115Mh75E] [^117ViC4u] |
| 600–700 | Increased risk of adverse effects | Monitor closely, consider dose reduction [^116yNABD] [^117ViC4u] |
| 700–1000 | For ultra-resistant cases only | Close monitoring, adjust dose as needed [^117ViC4u] |
| > 1000 | Significant toxicity risk | Reduce dose immediately [^116yNABD] [^117ViC4u] |

---

The therapeutic plasma range for clozapine is **350–600 ng/mL**, which balances efficacy and tolerability [^117ViC4u] [^115Mh75E]. Levels below this range reduce efficacy, whereas higher levels increase adverse effects — particularly seizures [^116yNABD]. Individualized dosing and regular monitoring are essential to manage variability from smoking [^112ZgzdJ], infections [^116BN5bL], and drug interactions [^113iJ5g4] [^114h2VjF].

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of clozapine in an ancestrally diverse sample: A longitudinal analysis and genome-wide association study using UK clinical monitoring data [^114h2VjF]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

The antipsychotic, clozapine, is the only licensed drug against the treatment-resistant symptoms that affect 20–30% of people with schizophrenia. Clozapine is markedly underprescribed, partly because of concerns about its narrow therapeutic range and adverse drug reaction profile. Both concerns are linked to drug metabolism, which varies across populations globally and is partly genetically determined. This study aimed to use a cross-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) design to investigate variations in clozapine metabolism within and between genetically inferred ancestral backgrounds. The goal was to discover genomic associations to clozapine plasma concentrations and to assess the effects of pharmacogenomic predictors across different ancestries.

In this GWAS, data from the UK Zaponex Treatment Access System clozapine monitoring service was analyzed as part of the CLOZUK study. All available individuals with clozapine pharmacokinetic assays requested by their clinicians were included. Exclusions were made for people younger than 18 years, those with clerical errors in their records, those with blood drawn 6–24 hours after dose, clozapine or norclozapine concentrations less than 50 ng/mL, clozapine concentrations of more than 2000 ng/mL, a clozapine-to-norclozapine ratio outside of the 0.5–3.0 interval, or a clozapine dose of more than 900 mg/day. Using genomic information, five biogeographical ancestries were identified: European, sub-Saharan African, North African, Southwest Asian, and East Asian. Pharmacokinetic modelling, a GWAS, and a polygenic risk score were performed.

### Elevated clozapine levels associated with infection: A systematic review [^116BN5bL]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic medication for treatment-refractory schizophrenia. A growing number of case reports have linked infection to high clozapine levels and associated adverse outcomes. We present a systematic review of published cases to clarify the relationship between infection and elevated clozapine levels. The case reports were located through PubMed and Embase. In addition, eight new cases from two Australian states were included. Demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, medical morbidities, medications, clinical symptoms, clozapine levels, inflammatory markers, and final clinical outcomes were extracted. Forty cases were identified in 23 publications that demonstrated elevated clozapine levels associated with infection. Infections were commonly respiratory in origin. Adverse events, typically sedation, were associated with raised clozapine levels during infection. In many cases, the signs of infection, such as fever and white blood cell count, were reduced. Severe adverse effects were uncommon, with one case each of seizure, myocarditis, and neutropenia. The relationship between infection, clozapine levels, and adverse events is complex and multifactorial. Monitoring of clozapine levels is essential during hospitalization for infection, and consideration should be given to gradual dose reduction to minimize dose-related side effects.

### Impact of patient-specific factors on clozapine metabolism in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [^117ViC4u]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

Clozapine has unique superior efficacy in treatment resistance, persistent hostility or violent behavior, and suicidality in individuals with schizophrenia. Moreover, it has been associated with lower all-cause and specific-cause mortality, fewer hospitalizations, and all-cause discontinuation. Yet, these findings have not translated into greater clozapine use, and its initiation is markedly delayed. This delay is partly due to common and sometimes severe adverse effects, as well as knowledge gaps in preventing and managing these effects.

Clozapine is a strong candidate for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) as it has a suggested plasma concentration–response relationship and carries an increased risk of nonresponse or adverse effects if plasma concentrations occur outside the therapeutic range. Available evidence suggests that concentrations above 350 ng/mL (1070 nmol/L) are associated with higher rates of therapeutic response, and concentrations above 600 ng/mL (1850 nmol/L) are associated with higher rates of dose-dependent adverse drug effects, such as sedation, seizures, myoclonus, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, tachycardia, and orthostatic hypotension. During the dose-escalation phases of treatment, other clozapine side effects like inflammation can become more noticeable and could be connected to the rate of titration and dose accumulation. Therefore, to individualize the titration plan and target dose, it is imperative to identify patient-specific factors that impact clozapine metabolism.

Clozapine clearance is mediated, in part, by extensive…

### Real-world outcomes in the management of refractory psychosis [^1171X5D1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Clozapine is the only medication approved for patients with schizophrenia who do not achieve a clinical response to standard antipsychotic treatment, yet it remains underused. Furthermore, there is no clarity on the next pharmacologic intervention in case of a partial or minimal response to clozapine treatment.

- **Methods**: The National Psychosis Service is a tertiary referral inpatient unit for individuals with refractory psychosis. Data from two pooled data sets, totaling 325 medical records, were analyzed for treatment trajectories between admission and discharge (2001–2016). The effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment was determined using the change in symptoms, assessed retrospectively using the Operational Criteria (OPCRIT) system applied to the medical records. The analysis focused on identifying the optimal medication regimens impacting clinical status during admission.

- **Results**: Less than a quarter of the patients were on clozapine treatment at the time of admission; this rate increased to 63.4% at the time of discharge. Initiating clozapine during admission (n = 136) was associated with a 47.9% reduction in symptoms as reflected by their OPCRIT score. In cases where clozapine monotherapy did not achieve sufficient improvement in symptoms, the most effective clozapine augmentation strategy was adding amisulpride (n = 22, 60.8% reduction of symptoms), followed by adding a mood stabilizer (n = 36, 53.7% reduction). A less favorable option was the addition of quetiapine (n = 15, 26.7% reduction).

- **Conclusions**: Many people with longer-term and complex mental health conditions require comprehensive treatment strategies to optimize their clinical outcomes.

### Serum clozapine levels: A review of their clinical utility [^115Mh75E]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is frequently utilized in the treatment of psychiatric conditions, but its clinical application concerning the use of clozapine remains unclear. We present three case reports of patients taking clozapine, review the relevant literature, and propose guidelines to aid the clinical use of TDM of clozapine. Due to its complex metabolism, there are significant inter- and intra-individual variations in clozapine serum levels for a given dose. However, the range of serum levels that corresponds with toxicity remains unclear. Although central nervous system side effects may correlate with serum level, many adverse effects of clozapine appear to be unrelated, including hematological and cardiac events.

There are numerous clinically significant interactions between clozapine and other substances, including prescribed medications, nicotine, and caffeine. TDM of clozapine may be of clinical value in certain situations, such as poor clinical response, signs of toxicity, onset of seizures, changes in concomitant medication, caffeine or nicotine use, liver disease, and suspected non-compliance. The literature does not support the routine testing of serum clozapine levels in everyday clinical practice.

### Increasing antipsychotic dose for non response in schizophrenia [^116cg1EB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Many people with schizophrenia do not reach a satisfactory clinical response with a standard dose of an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, clinicians face the dilemma of increasing the antipsychotic dose to enhance antipsychotic efficacy.

- **Objectives**: To examine the efficacy of increasing the antipsychotic dose compared to maintaining the same dose in the treatment of people with schizophrenia who have not responded (as defined in the individual studies) to an initial antipsychotic drug trial. Additionally, we examine the adverse effects associated with such a procedure.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register on 10 June 2014, 6 October 2015, and 30 March 2017. We also examined references of all included studies for further trials.

- **Selection criteria**: All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reporting usable data, comparing increasing the antipsychotic dose rather than maintaining the original dose for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data using relative risks (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their 95% CI. We assessed the risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

- **Main results**: Ten relevant RCTs with 675 participants are included in this review. All trials were double-blind except one, which was single-blind. All studies had a run-in phase.

### Genetic inference of on-target and off-target side-effects of antipsychotic medications [^111onhsT]. PLoS Genetics (2025). Low credibility.

Identifying drug targets and side-effect phenotypes

We focused on six commonly prescribed antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine, which has the highest overall efficacy: aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, and risperidone. These drugs bind to a total of 68 target receptors based on information from two sources: The Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP) Ki database, and the DrugBank database. The six drugs have 165 different side-effects associated with them, based on a reported lower bound frequency of 1% in the Side-effect Resource (SIDER) database. Of the 165 side-effects, we were able to genetically proxy 80 with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for a corresponding phenotype in the OpenGWAS repository. We standardized the data by creating unique identifiers across data sources and converging differing effect score calculations. There is some redundancy in our mapping of side-effects to GWAS phenotypes, resulting in the 80 side-effects being mapped to a total of 220 related phenotypes with GWAS results (Table B in S1 Tables).

The on-target receptors that underlie antipsychotic treatment responses belong to the dopamine (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4) and serotonin families (HTR2A and HTR2C). Other receptors have some evidence of influencing schizophrenia symptoms, but they are not intentionally targeted, and their clinical evidence is not as strong. These receptors, which will be referred to as suspected-target receptors, include the GABA family (specifically GABRA5), which shows upstream regulation of DRD2, and the histamine.

### Pharmacokinetic studies of antipsychotics in healthy volunteers versus patients [^1175prxV]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

In clinical trials of dopamine-blocking antipsychotics, significant adverse events may occur in healthy volunteers at dose levels that are well tolerated by schizophrenic patients. Because of these differences in tolerability, bioequivalence and pharmacokinetic studies of antipsychotics should be performed in schizophrenic patients rather than in healthy volunteers.

When clozapine is the drug being investigated, pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies should be carried out in real-life dosage conditions because the half-life of clozapine increases with multiple doses. Under real-life conditions, the evaluation of multiple doses of clozapine in a population of schizophrenic patients can provide direct therapeutic relevance to bioavailability findings.

This article discusses:

- **Patient recruitment and informed consent**: In pharmacokinetic trials of schizophrenia, issues of studying antipsychotic agents in healthy volunteers versus schizophrenic patients arise.
- **Bioequivalency study**: A comparison of Clozaril (Novartis Pharmaceuticals) and generic clozapine (Creighton [Sandoz]) in schizophrenic patients.

### Impact of patient-specific factors on clozapine metabolism in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [^116RC35E]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

At a steady state, the rate of metabolism and clearance can be estimated by dividing the clozapine plasma concentration (ng/mL) by the total daily dose (mg/d) to derive the concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio. In this work, we evaluated the direction and magnitude of patient-specific factors' effects on clozapine C/D ratios using TDM and other clinical data from a cohort of inpatients receiving clozapine treatment.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of clozapine in an ancestrally diverse sample: A longitudinal analysis and genome-wide association study using UK clinical monitoring data [^117FVMsH]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

This study is the first to explore clozapine metabolism and pharmacogenomics using a diverse cross-ancestry sample and statistical methods that leverage the longitudinal nature of clozapine monitoring assays. Using pharmacokinetic data, we demonstrated that, on average, individuals of sub-Saharan African ancestry were more likely to be fast clozapine metabolizers compared to those of European ancestry but were not prescribed different doses. We also found that people of sub-Saharan African ancestry were the least likely in our dataset to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations of clozapine, which is in line with findings in non-clozapine antipsychotics. These results are of clinical importance, given that the most recent revisions of clozapine treatment guidelines do not report pharmacokinetic differences between people of European versus African or African American ancestry. Additionally, studies in the United States highlight racial disparities in clozapine use. Given that the evidence supports the consistent and cross-ancestry association of the clozapine therapeutic range with treatment response, suboptimal prescriptions to individuals with different clozapine metabolism rates than what is assumed typical may lead to a lower treatment response and unnecessary exposure to adverse drug reactions. This supports the argument that robust assessments of clozapine metabolism, including therapeutic drug monitoring, should be conducted across ancestries and populations to inform accurate and safe dosing practices for diverse real-world populations.

### Fluphenazine plasma level monitoring for patients receiving fluphenazine decanoate [^116MHu9E]. Schizophrenia Research (2002). Low credibility.

Finding a dose of an antipsychotic for maintenance therapy that is both safe and effective can be difficult because clinicians are unable to titrate dose against clinical response in patients who are already stable. Therapeutic monitoring of antipsychotic plasma levels has the potential for helping clinicians in dosage selection. With this in mind, we evaluated the usefulness of monitoring fluphenazine plasma levels for patients with schizophrenia who were receiving maintenance treatment with fluphenazine decanoate.

- **Method**: Thirty-one patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to low, medium, or high (0.1–0.3, 0.3–0.6, 0.6–1.0 ng/ml) plasma levels of fluphenazine. The dose of fluphenazine decanoate was adjusted in order to maintain patients in their assigned range. Side effects, psychopathology, and psychotic exacerbations were measured during the year following randomization.

- **Results**: All of the psychotic exacerbations occurred during the first eight weeks following randomization, before patients had adequate time to reach their plasma level assignments. We did not find a relationship between plasma levels of fluphenazine and clinical outcomes or side effects.

- **Conclusion**: Our results do not provide support for the usefulness of monitoring fluphenazine plasma levels for patients receiving fluphenazine decanoate.

### Versacloz [^113iJ5g4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering Versacloz concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes.

- **CYP1A2 inhibitors**: Concomitant use of Versacloz and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the Versacloz dose to one third of the original dose when Versacloz is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The Versacloz dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when Versacloz is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the Versacloz dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

- **CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors**: Concomitant treatment with Versacloz and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the Versacloz dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

### A systematic review of aripiprazole — dose, plasma concentration, receptor occupancy, and response: Implications for therapeutic drug monitoring [^11153Y43]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate relationships between the aripiprazole dose, plasma level, pharmacologic activity, and clinical outcome, the study explores the potential for therapeutic drug monitoring.

In August 2008, researchers searched Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases using the keywords aripiprazole, plasma levels, plasma concentration, and therapeutic drug monitoring.

Twenty-one reports were retrieved, and eight studies that investigated the relationship between blood concentrations of aripiprazole and dose, dopamine D(2)/D(3) occupancy, and/or outcome and adverse effects were selected. Data concerning plasma or serum concentrations of aripiprazole were included if concentrations were reported in relation to dose, dopamine occupancy, or clinical outcome. Reports solely investigating drug interactions were not included.

A strong correlation exists between the aripiprazole dose and plasma concentration. Positron emission tomography analyses suggest significant relationships between dopamine receptor occupancy and both aripiprazole dose and blood concentration. Dopamine receptor occupancy appears to reach a plateau at doses above 10 mg, supporting observations in dose-response studies that 10 mg/d is the optimal dose for aripiprazole.

The dose range for aripiprazole is well defined, reliably predicting plasma level, dopamine receptor occupancy, and clinical response. Plasma level variation appears to have minimal impact on clinical response, but it may predict some adverse effects.

### Exploring low clozapine C/D ratios, inverted clozapine-norclozapine ratios and undetectable concentrations as measures of non-adherence in clozapine patients: A literature review and a case series of 17 patients from 3 studies [^114TkY8p]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). High credibility.

Up to half of outpatients prescribed clozapine may be partially or fully non-adherent, based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Three indices for measuring partial or full non-adherence are proposed: 1) clozapine concentration/dose (C/D) ratio, which drops to half or more of what is expected in the patient; 2) clozapine/norclozapine ratio that becomes inverted; and 3) clozapine concentration that becomes non-detectable.

- **Methods**: These three proposed indices are based on a literature review and 17 cases of possible non-adherence from three samples: 1) an inpatient study in a Chinese hospital; 2) an inpatient randomized clinical trial in a United States hospital; and 3) a Uruguayan outpatient study.

- **Results**: The first index of non-adherence is a clozapine C/D ratio which is less than half the ratio corresponding to the patient's specific ancestry group and sex-smoking subgroup. Knowing the minimum therapeutic dose of the patient based on repeated TDM makes it much easier to establish non-adherence. The second index is inverted clozapine/norclozapine ratios in the absence of alternative explanations. The third index is undetectable concentrations. By using half-lives, the chronology of the three indices of non-adherence was modeled in two patients: 1) the clozapine C/D ratio dropped to at least half of what is expected from the patient around day 2; 2) the clozapine/norclozapine ratio became inverted around day 3; and 3) the clozapine concentration became undetectable by the laboratory around days 9–11.

- **Conclusion**: Prospective studies should further explore these proposed indices of clozapine non-adherence.

### Reducing the risk of withdrawal symptoms and relapse following clozapine discontinuation-is it feasible to develop evidence-based guidelines [^1165ekz1]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Low credibility.

Clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine antipsychotic that was first developed in 1959. It is the only effective treatment for patients with schizophrenia who are treatment-resistant, and it remains the most effective treatment for schizophrenia more generally. There are certain circumstances, however, where it is necessary to stop clozapine, with estimates of discontinuation ranging between 16% and 66%.

There are several reasons to discontinue clozapine, which can be broadly divided into indications leading to either emergency or elective discontinuation. Emergency discontinuation of clozapine is typically indicated when patients experience potentially life-threatening adverse effects, such as agranulocytosis, myocarditis, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In some situations, clozapine can be reinitiated once the clinical concern has resolved or has been mitigated.

Examples where clozapine can be discontinued electively include intolerable (but not immediately life-threatening) adverse effects, lack of treatment response, patient preference, and poor adherence. There are also some instances where clozapine can be discontinued after full recovery has been achieved. In contrast to stopping clozapine in an emergency, elective discontinuation usually allows a period of consultation, information gathering, and preparation as well as the option of stopping clozapine more gradually.

### Reducing the risk of withdrawal symptoms and relapse following clozapine discontinuation-is it feasible to develop evidence-based guidelines [^115oXFJH]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). High credibility.

Studies of treatment-resistant schizophrenia have consistently demonstrated that clozapine is the most effective treatment. Sustained use of clozapine induces an array of neuronal adaptations, and it remains unclear how long it takes for these changes to be reversed; existing literature suggests weeks to months, or longer. This poses a challenge to clinicians when there is a clinical need to discontinue clozapine while ensuring the risk of relapse and withdrawal symptoms is minimized.

We explored the feasibility of developing practical guidance focused on minimizing the risk of relapse and withdrawal symptoms, managing withdrawal phenomena, and commencing alternative treatments when clozapine is discontinued. A key feature was the recommendation that clozapine should be reduced over at least six months unless the clinical situation necessitates a more urgent cessation. This is substantially longer than has previously been suggested and is motivated by evidence that the likelihood of developing withdrawal symptoms is closely associated with how abruptly clozapine is discontinued. This is likely to be patient-dependent, and individual factors, such as the length of clozapine treatment, are likely to impact susceptibility to developing withdrawal symptoms.

The management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia when clozapine cannot be used remains a major therapeutic challenge. The majority of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia benefit from being continued on clozapine. Epidemiological data suggest that the most common reason for discontinuation is the patient's individual response and specific clinical circumstances.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of clozapine in an ancestrally diverse sample: a longitudinal analysis and genome-wide association study using UK clinical monitoring data [^116kC2rY]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

In terms of the genomic prediction of clozapine metabolite concentrations in independent datasets, PRS for clozapine and norclozapine plasma concentrations, and their metabolic ratio were generated from the CLOZUK2 data. These scores were associated, at several p-value thresholds, with their respective phenotypes in CLOZUK3, explaining a maximum of 0.61% (clozapine), 1.59% (norclozapine), and 7.26% (metabolic ratio) of the variance after accounting for fixed-effect and random-effect predictors (appendix 2 sheet 3).

In these analyses, and for all phenotypes, PRSs that showed the stronger association and the greater variance explained were those built only with genome-wide significant SNPs, and all associations at this p-value threshold remained significant after splitting the testing dataset by European versus non-European ancestry. We compared this PRS predictor with one that was analogously generated from our 2019 European-only GWAS. The cross-ancestry PRS predictor showed significant associations at more PRS p-value thresholds than the 2019 GWAS PRS predictor did. Furthermore, all PRS p-value thresholds that yielded a significant association with the 2019 GWAS PRS were also significant when tested with the cross-ancestry PRS (figure 3).

Many of these associations were also replicated with similar effect sizes in the two largest non-European ancestries within CLOZUK3 (i.e. the sub-Saharan African and the southwest Asian groups), which supports the transferability of our PRSs as predictors of clozapine metabolism to under-represented populations in genomic research.

### Toxicity and adverse effects in clozapine-related presentations to a medical toxicology service in Western Sydney [^115tUVqF]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). High credibility.

Clozapine is an antipsychotic agent reserved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia because of its demonstrated efficacy in this challenging patient population. We aimed to review the full spectrum casemix of clozapine presentations to our tertiary toxicology service.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective study, we reviewed consecutive clozapine-related toxicity presentations to a tertiary medical toxicology inpatient and consultation service. These included deliberate self-poisoning (DSP), adverse drug reactions (ADR), and therapeutic misadventures over a 10-year period from 2011 to 2021. Data were extracted for demographics, ingested dose, exposure characteristics, and patient outcomes.

- **Results**: We identified 83 patients with clozapine-related presentations over the 10-year period. Twenty-two patients were excluded. Of the remaining 61 patients, 28 patients presented with DSP, 20 with accidental overdose, and 13 with an ADR; no patients presented with recreational use. It was noted that ADRs were largely idiosyncratic and not always related to dose adjustments. In the context of therapeutic misadventure and DSP, a lower mean dose achieved a higher poison severity score (PSS) in clozapine-naive patients compared to those on regular clozapine.

- **Conclusions**: The presentation of clozapine-related toxicity differs depending on the modality of ingestion, whether DSP, accidental, or as a result of ADR. Patients naive to clozapine therapy tend to experience higher PSS with lower doses ingested.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of clozapine in an ancestrally diverse sample: A longitudinal analysis and genome-wide association study using UK clinical monitoring data [^111TkGcc]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Finally, our polygenic analyses show that pharmacogenomic research studies might benefit from generating PRS by use of a GWAS of drug metabolism. This suggestion is despite the oligogenic genetic architecture of drug pharmacokinetics seen in many other metabolic traits, rather than the polygenic basis exploited in most PRS-based research. In an oligogenic framework, phenotypic associations with PRS are expected to be stronger at conservative SNP p-value thresholds, as observed through our tests, with the paucity of variants considered in the score being offset by reasonably large per-allele effect sizes. For example, one minor allele of rs2472297 has an effect on clozapine plasma concentrations roughly equivalent to reducing the dose by 50 mg/day.

Indeed, we show that all our clozapine metabolism PRSs were associated cross-ancestrally with their respective phenotypes in independent samples. Although the variances explained were small, they were consistent with those previously estimated for index SNPs within genome-wide significant loci. A direct comparison with our previous study supports the view that in the study, our novel longitudinal GWAS method and more diverse samples contribute to the increased power of this approach, particularly in those of non-European ancestry, leading to a PRS predictor that is potentially transferable across ancestries. This approach is promising for future replication and validation studies, as only small panels of SNPs might be needed to evaluate the relevance of these genomic findings for clinical outcomes, such as treatment response.

### Clozaril [^112ZgzdJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 inducers**: Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of Clozaril. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the Clozaril dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of Clozaril and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Considerations for enzyme inducer discontinuation**: Consider reducing the Clozaril dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers, as discontinuation can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Anticholinergic drugs**: Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g. benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of Clozaril with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.16)].

- **Drugs that cause QT interval prolongation**: Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include specific antipsychotics (e.g. ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide) and specific antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, gatifloxacin).

### Combination of strategies to initiate clozapine for refractory schizophrenia in a patient with low neutrophil levels [^111AHGoi]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Clozapine is an effective drug for refractory schizophrenia; however, its use is restricted due to the risk of potentially life-threatening side effects, such as agranulocytosis. Low baseline levels of leucocytes and neutrophils are risk factors for clozapine-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis. In most countries, mandatory haematological monitoring and strict regulations have been implemented to reduce these haematological risks. In Japan, patients with schizophrenia who are prescribed clozapine must register with the Clozaril Patient Monitoring Service for patient management.

In Japan, a common clinical problem is that clozapine cannot be initiated in patients whose baseline leucocyte and neutrophil counts are ≤ 4.0×10^9/L and ≤ 2.0×10^9/L, respectively. This restriction is more stringent in Japan than in other countries. In other countries, considerations have been established for patients with low white blood cell counts and absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) due to benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN), and clozapine treatment may be initiated after receiving consent from a haematologist. In addition, patients with BEN are managed according to a different ANC algorithm with relaxed criteria for baseline ANC levels. However, this consideration has not been established in Japan. Therefore, it is expected that more people in Japan than in other countries will miss the opportunity to receive clozapine due to low leucocyte and neutrophil levels. Clozapine is the only drug that is confirmed to be effective for refractory schizophrenia; thus, those denied clozapine as a treatment option may lack viable alternatives.

### Clozaril [^11436ZBu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

- **Absorption**: In humans, Clozaril tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a Clozaril solution. Following oral administration of Clozaril 100 mg twice daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 319 ng/mL (range: 102 to 771 ng/mL), occurring at an average of 2.5 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady state was 122 ng/mL (range: 41 to 343 ng/mL) after 100 mg twice daily dosing. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of Clozaril, thus it may be administered with or without food.

- **Distribution**: Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated, but it may be important [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Metabolism and excretion**: Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N-oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N-oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine following a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours).

### Impact of patient-specific factors on clozapine metabolism in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [^115RcANW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). High credibility.

The direction and magnitude of patient-specific factors' impact on clozapine's rate of metabolism, measured by change in C/D ratios, were evaluated in a cohort of hospitalized patients with treatment-resistant psychotic illnesses. Given the inpatient and specialized setting of the study, there was high accuracy in the timing of clozapine dosing and blood samples for plasma concentration quantification. Furthermore, supervision by trained nurses increased the likelihood of high adherence rates.

Our results demonstrate that fluvoxamine has a strong, positive dose–response relationship with C/D ratios. Fluvoxamine use independently explained the most variance in clozapine C/D ratios and reduced the effect size of other patient-specific factors in the subgroup of participants prescribed fluvoxamine. Unlike previously published literature that suggested a possible balancing out effect between CYP1A2 inducing effects of smoking and CYP1A2 inhibiting effects of fluvoxamine augmentation, our findings suggest that in a dose-related fashion, fluvoxamine will ultimately override the inducing effects of smoking. Consequently, concomitant use of fluvoxamine with clozapine, specifically at higher doses, requires rigorous TDM and should generally be avoided at the time of initiation of clozapine to decrease the risk of rapid dose accumulation and clozapine-associated inflammation.

In the subgroup of patients not on fluvoxamine, CRP elevation was the strongest patient-specific factor in predicting an increase in clozapine levels, followed by nonsmoking status and female sex.

### Impact of patient-specific factors on clozapine metabolism in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [^113vJpJJ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

A total of 343 steady-state plasma concentrations were available for analysis from 172 individuals. These individuals were primarily of European background (71.5%), while approximately 14% self-identified as Asian (ranging from Pakistan to Japan) and 14.5% as Indigenous. Clozapine in a significant portion of this cohort was augmented with fluvoxamine (n = 58), with doses ranging from 12.5 to 200 mg.

Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, including bupropion, fluoxetine, and paroxetine, were prescribed to 13 patients, three of whom also received fluvoxamine. For all 343 plasma concentrations, information on age, sex, ancestry, smoking status, concomitant medications and their dose, and BMI were available. There were missing CRP levels on admission and during the hospital stay for 18 patients; consequently, the multiple imputation method was used to fill these missing values.

### Do Indian patients with schizophrenia need half the recommended clozapine dose to achieve therapeutic serum level? An exploratory study [^113H9CAJ]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Low credibility.

Inter-racial differences in serum clozapine have received less scientific importance, as there are fewer studies on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) from Asia. We measured the serum clozapine levels in 142 patients with schizophrenia and related disorders at a tertiary care psychiatric institute in India. The clozapine concentration per milligram (mg) of oral clozapine dose (C/D ratio) was calculated, and the C/D ratio was used to estimate the oral clozapine dose needed to achieve a therapeutic serum clozapine level (350 ng/ml).

This study examined Indian patients only and compared the results with weighted mean serum clozapine and its correlates in the Caucasian population, based on published scientific literature. The median C/D ratio in our sample was 2.5 (n = 142), and the clozapine dose needed to achieve a therapeutic serum clozapine level was 140 mg/d. The median C/D ratio of our subjects was nearly two and a half times higher than the weighted mean C/D ratio of Caucasians (2.5 vs. 1.07) reported elsewhere.

After excluding the significant pharmacokinetic interactions and stratifying according to gender and smoking status, the estimated clozapine dose to achieve a therapeutic serum level in male smokers (n = 9) and female non-smokers (n = 38) were 238 mg/d (C/D ratio: 1.47) and 120 mg/d (C/D ratio: 2.93) respectively. On comparing, male smokers (600 mg/d versus 238 mg/d) and female non-smokers (300 mg/d versus 120 mg/d) in our study needed about 40% of the recommended clozapine dose for Caucasians to achieve a therapeutic serum clozapine level. The pharmacogenetic correlates of lesser…

### Versacloz [^117Puhc2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies involving adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL, respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations compared to the chlorpromazine group. The clozapine doses ranged from 100 to 900 mg per day, with a mean modal dose of 512 mg per day. In contrast, the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day, with a mean modal dose of 1029 mg per day. The median duration of exposure for both clozapine and chlorpromazine was 42 days.

- **Dyslipidemia**: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including Versacloz. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using Versacloz, is recommended.

In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies involving adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. Additionally, in a pooled data analysis of 2 studies, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride levels. The mean increase in fasting triglycerides was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group.

### Challenges for switching central nervous system and psychiatric medication products: A review of the literature [^111WTc2o]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Low credibility.

Bioequivalence is established based on pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, typically maximum concentration (C max) and area under the concentration–time curve (AUC). Historically, the biomedical community assumed that a 20% to 25% change in relevant PK parameters would not pose a significant clinical risk. This assumption translated into a confidence interval (CI) approach first adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following the passage in 1984 of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which stipulated that the 90% CI for the ratio of average PK parameter values between the test and reference product should fall within a limit of 80%–125% to be "bioequivalent".

The variability levels resulting from this approach could almost certainly produce inconsistencies in true bioequivalence in some drug classes and dosage forms, such as narrow therapeutic index or critical dose drugs, where there is a small difference between therapeutic and toxic doses. For example, patients with schizophrenia who switched to generic clozapine in a 2001 study experienced worsened symptoms and relapse, even though there were no statistically significant differences in serum concentrations of the drug. The authors explained that a difference in the rate of absorption between the formulations could account for their findings.

In a similar vein, because of the nonlinear correlation between dose and dopamine D2 receptor occupancy, critical thresholds exist for dose reduction. At these points, even minor adjustments in dosing may induce substantial changes in receptor occupancy, potentially leading to significant clinical impact.

### Clozapine combined with different antipsychotic drugs for treatment-resistant schizophrenia [^1163gnbN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Between 40% and 70% of people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia do not respond to clozapine, despite adequate blood levels. For these individuals, a number of treatment strategies have emerged, including the prescription of a second antipsychotic drug in combination with clozapine.

- **Objectives**: To determine the clinical effects of various clozapine combination strategies with antipsychotic drugs in people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, both in terms of efficacy and tolerability.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (up to 28 August 2015) and MEDLINE (November 2008). We checked the reference lists of all identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs). For the first version of the review, we also contacted pharmaceutical companies to identify further trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only RCTs recruiting people of both sexes, aged 18 years or more, with a diagnosis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (or related disorders), and comparing clozapine plus one antipsychotic drug with clozapine plus a different antipsychotic drug.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis using a random-effects meta-analysis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs. We used GRADE to create 'Summary of findings' tables and assessed risk of bias for included studies.

- **Main results**: We identified two further studies with 169 participants that met our criteria.

### Body mass index as a determinant of clozapine plasma concentrations: A pharmacokinetic-based hypothesis [^1125ugjW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Knowledge regarding the impact of body composition measures on the pharmacokinetics of antipsychotics is limited. Our aim was to investigate the impact of body weight and body mass index on clozapine pharmacokinetics using a therapeutic drug monitoring database.

- **Methods**: A large therapeutic drug monitoring dataset of clozapine plasma concentrations considering three patient subgroups was analyzed: a control group (CLZ 0, 20–30 kg/m², n = 266), a group with high body mass index (CLZ high, body mass index ⩾30 kg/m², n = 162), and with low body mass index values (CLZ low, body mass index < 20 kg/m², n = 27). Comparisons of plasma and dose-adjusted plasma concentrations (C/D) of clozapine were based on Spearman's correlation (rs), Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney U tests. For percentages, we used the Pearson chi-square test (χ²). To assess the effects of confounders, we used bootstrapping analysis of covariates.

- **Results/outcomes**: Regarding demographic characteristics, groups differed only for sex percentage, with more females than males in CLZ low and CLZ high compared to CLZ 0 (p = 0.001 for χ² test). Plasma and C/D values were positively associated with body mass index (rs = 0.108, p = 0.022 and rs = 0.156, p = 0.001, respectively). Intergroup differences were observed for plasma and dose-adjusted concentrations of clozapine (p = 0.031 and p = 0.029 for Kruskal-Wallis, respectively). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons showed higher plasma concentrations and C/D of clozapine in CLZ high compared to CLZ 0 (p = 0.014 and p = 0.007, respectively, for Mann-Whitney U test).

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of clozapine in an ancestrally diverse sample: A longitudinal analysis and genome-wide association study using UK clinical monitoring data [^112Lqq6F]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

In this study, we found ancestral effects and genetic variants associated with inter-individual variation in clozapine metabolism. We found that people of sub-Saharan African ancestry were, on average, fast clozapine metabolizers, whereas those of East Asian or Southwest Asian ancestry were slow clozapine metabolizers, all in comparison with people of European ancestry. We also showed that genomic predictors of clozapine pharmacokinetics, developed using longitudinal genome-wide association study and polygenic risk score approaches, had associations of similar effects across diverse ancestral backgrounds.

- **Implications of all the available evidence**: Existing clozapine treatment guidelines do not reflect the real-world diversity of potential clozapine users, and default recommendations for titration and maintenance doses are optimized for those of European descent. Our study reinforces that ancestry can contribute to the variability of clozapine metabolism. It supports the proactive assessment of drug pharmacokinetics (via therapeutic drug monitoring) as part of the standard care for those with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. For the development of further research on this topic, our data support the view that pharmacogenomic predictors of clozapine metabolism might be applicable across worldwide populations. This could facilitate the design and implementation of prospective trials to assess the incorporation of genomics into personalized clozapine prescribing.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of clozapine in an ancestrally diverse sample: a longitudinal analysis and genome-wide association study using UK clinical monitoring data [^1131uF3y]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Schizophrenia is typically a chronic disorder with symptoms that are severe and distressing for most people. Most individuals with schizophrenia obtain some benefit from antipsychotic medication, although about 20–30% experience treatment-resistant schizophrenia, defined as the persistence of symptoms following a minimum of two trials of antipsychotics of adequate dose and duration. Clozapine is the only approved and evidence-based drug treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and it is associated with increased adherence to treatment, decreased psychiatric hospital admission, reduced suicidal ideation, and improvement of symptoms and outcomes. Despite its potential, clozapine is not always prescribed to those who could benefit from it. Retrospective analyses have shown that clozapine accounted for less than 5% of all antipsychotics prescribed for schizophrenia during 2006–2009 in the United States, and that only a third of people eligible in the UK in 2019 were estimated to have received it. Some important factors that prevent increased clozapine use are insufficient clinician training or direct experience with using clozapine, and concerns about its adverse drug reaction profile.

- **Evidence before this study**: The latest reviews of clozapine prescription guidelines, published in March and June 2022, recommend different dosing regimens for some ethnicity and population groups due to differential drug metabolisms. People of East Asian ancestry and Indigenous people of the Americas were identified as slow clozapine metabolizers and were advised to be prescribed accordingly.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of clozapine in an ancestrally diverse sample: a longitudinal analysis and genome-wide association study using UK clinical monitoring data [^1134kKQH]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

The antipsychotic clozapine is the only licensed drug for the treatment-resistant symptoms affecting 20–30% of people with schizophrenia. Clozapine is markedly underprescribed, partly due to concerns about its narrow therapeutic range and adverse drug reaction profile. Both of these concerns are linked to drug metabolism, which varies across populations globally and is partly genetically determined. Our study aimed to use a cross-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) design to investigate variations in clozapine metabolism within and between genetically inferred ancestral backgrounds, to discover genomic associations with clozapine plasma concentrations, and to assess the effects of pharmacogenomic predictors across different ancestries.

- **Methods**: In this GWAS, we analyzed data from the UK Zaponex Treatment Access System clozapine monitoring service as part of the CLOZUK study. We included all available individuals with clozapine pharmacokinetic assays requested by their clinicians. We excluded those younger than 18 years or whose records contained clerical errors. Subjects with blood drawn 6–24 hours after dosage, clozapine or norclozapine concentrations less than 50 ng/mL, clozapine concentrations of more than 2000 ng/mL, a clozapine-to-norclozapine ratio outside the 0.5–3.0 interval, or a clozapine dose greater than 900 mg/day were also excluded. Using genomic information, we identified five biogeographical ancestries: European, sub-Saharan African, North African, Southwest Asian, and East Asian. We performed pharmacokinetic modeling, a GWAS, and a polygenic risk score association.

### Clozapine dose for schizophrenia [^117LfRus]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Schizophrenia and related disorders, such as schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorder, are serious mental illnesses characterized by profound disruptions in thinking and speech, emotional processes, behavior, and sense of self. Clozapine is useful in the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders, particularly when other antipsychotic medications have failed. It improves positive symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations) and negative symptoms (such as withdrawal and poverty of speech). However, it is unclear what dose of clozapine is most effective with the least side effects.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of clozapine at different doses and to identify the optimal dose of clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenia, schizophreniform, and schizoaffective disorders.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials in August 2011 and December 8, 2016.

- **Selection criteria**: All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding status or language, that compared the effects of clozapine at different doses in people with schizophrenia and related disorders, diagnosed by any criteria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently inspected citations from the searches, identified relevant abstracts, obtained full articles of relevant abstracts, and classified trials as included or excluded. We included trials that met our inclusion criteria and reported usable data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the relative risk (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) on an

### Impact of patient-specific factors on clozapine metabolism in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [^111mn2TC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with normal liver and renal function were eligible if they were on clozapine treatment during the study period, with at least one clozapine plasma concentration at "steady-state conditions". Steady state was defined as samples taken 12 hours (± 2 hours) after the last clozapine dose and at least 5 days after any dose changes to clozapine. Furthermore, these levels were not contaminated by new inhibitors, inducers, or infection/inflammation.

For each patient meeting the eligibility criteria, a review of the electronic medical record was conducted by five authors utilizing a custom data extraction template. Extracted data included patient demographics (sex, age, self-reported ancestry), medical and psychiatric diagnoses, smoking status (yes/no), obesity (body mass index (BMI) ⩾ 30 kg/m²), prescribed medications, medication administration records, and laboratory results including clozapine plasma concentrations at steady-state conditions, complete blood counts, and CRP levels throughout their stay at the facility. The principal investigator maintained consistency in the retrospective data extraction and re-evaluated each concentration to ensure steady-state conditions were met.

Clozapine plasma concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem spectrometry at the British Columbia Provincial Toxicology Center accredited laboratory. Given the inpatient setting, many patients had repeated clozapine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).

### Clozapine toxicity predictor: Deep neural network model predicting clozapine toxicity and its therapeutic dose range [^111bFv2E]. Psychiatry Research (2024). High credibility.

Clozapine is the gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia; however, its superior efficacy is accompanied by potentially serious adverse events (neutropenia, seizures, constipation, pneumonia), many of which are also concentration-dependent. As such, clozapine dose titration should be guided by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). However, access to TDM is often limited. This study describes a new deep neural network that can predict the concentrations, toxicity, and therapeutic dose range for clozapine and norclozapine. The model was trained on basic clinical data (biological sex, age, clozapine daily dose, BMI, CRP, and the number of CYP 1A2 and 3A4 substrates, inhibitors, and inducers) from 69 patients treated with different clozapine doses.

Our findings provide the training efficacy data for the model, as well as an analysis of clozapine and norclozapine blood concentrations in a test group of three additional patients, to demonstrate its practical capabilities. The model is licensed under a free and permissive 2-Clause BSD license and is available to all clinicians; it can be accessed as a web application at https://csk.umed.pl/clotop.

### The expert consensus guideline series. Optimizing pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders. Introduction: Methods, commentary, and summary [^1131NKx4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A growing number of atypical antipsychotics are available for clinicians to choose from in the treatment of psychotic disorders. However, several important questions concerning medication selection, dosing and dose equivalence, and the management of inadequate response, compliance problems, and relapse have not been adequately addressed by clinical trials. To aid clinical decision-making, a consensus survey of expert opinion on the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders was undertaken to address questions not definitively answered in the research literature.

- **Method**: Based on a literature review, a written survey was developed with 60 questions and 994 options. Approximately half of the options were scored using a modified version of the RAND 9-point scale for rating the appropriateness of medical decisions. For the other options, the experts were asked to write in answers (e.g. average doses) or check a box to indicate their preferred answer. The survey was sent to 50 national experts on the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders, 47 (94%) of whom completed it. In analyzing the responses to items rated on the 9-point scale, consensus on each option was defined as a non-random distribution of scores by chi-square "goodness-of-fit" test.

Guideline tables indicating preferred treatment strategies were then developed for key clinical situations. Each option was assigned a categorical rank (first line/preferred choice, second line/alternate choice, third line/usually inappropriate) based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean rating.

### An initial animal proof-of-concept study for central administration of clozapine to schizophrenia patients [^1154FFHT]. Schizophrenia Research (2008). Low credibility.

While clozapine is the acknowledged superior pharmacotherapeutic for the treatment of schizophrenia, the side effect profile, which includes potentially fatal complications, limits its usefulness. Central administration of clozapine directly into the brain could circumvent many of the side effect issues due to the dramatic reduction in dose and the limitation of the drug primarily to the CNS. The present study demonstrates that clozapine can be formulated as a stable solution at physiological pH, which does not have in vitro neurotoxic effects at concentrations that may be effective at treating symptoms. Acute central administration improved auditory gating deficits in a mouse model of schizophrenia-like deficits.

Assessment of behavioral alterations in rats receiving chronic central infusions of clozapine via osmotic minipump was performed with the open field and elevated plus mazes. Neither paradigm revealed any detrimental effects of the infusion. While these data represent only an initial investigation, they nonetheless suggest that central administration of clozapine may be a viable alternative therapeutic approach for schizophrenia patients, which may be effective in symptom reduction without causing behavioral or neurotoxic effects.

### Quantifying intraindividual variations in plasma clozapine levels: A population pharmacokinetic approach [^115abxzr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Clozapine has strong recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring. While factors that influence interindividual variation in plasma clozapine levels have been extensively reported, intraindividual variation remains poorly studied. We employed a population pharmacokinetic approach to assess intraindividual variations in plasma levels of both clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine, as well as the impact of smoking on this variability.

- **Methods**: Patients who were initiated on clozapine from January 2009 to December 2010 and who provided at least two plasma samples were included in this study. The observed concentrations of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were applied using a Bayesian pharmacokinetic modeling approach, utilizing a previously published pharmacokinetic model from an independent sample to compute a predicted concentration. The predicted concentrations of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were then compared with the observed concentrations in the form of a ratio: predicted-to-observed concentration ratio (Cpred/Cobs). The coefficient of variation of the Cpred/Cobs ratios was taken as a measure of intraindividual variation.

- **Results**: A total of 723 plasma levels from 61 patients were included in this analysis. The coefficient of variation of Cpred/Cobs ratios for clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were 29.8% (SD = 17.2%) and 27.4% (SD = 16.4%), respectively. Although values were higher, smoking did not have a significant effect on the coefficients of variation of clozapine (33.5% vs. 26.3%, P = .184) or N-desmethylclozapine (30.7% vs. 24.2%, P = .100).

### A proposal for reducing maximum target doses of drugs for psychosis: Reviewing dose-response literature [^114xZ6sZ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

Presently, there is limited guidance on the maximal dosing of psychosis drugs that is based on effectiveness rather than safety or toxicity. Maximum dosing recommendations may far exceed the necessary degree of dopamine D2 receptor blockade required to treat psychosis, which may lead to excess harm through cognitive impairment and side effects.

- **Aims**: This analysis aimed to establish guidance for prescribers by optimally dosing drugs for psychosis based on efficacy and benefit.

- **Methods**: We used data from two dose-response meta-analyses and reviewed seven of the most prescribed drugs for psychosis in the UK. Where data were not available, we used appropriate comparison techniques based on D2 receptor occupancy to extrapolate our recommendations.

- **Results**: We found that the likely threshold dose for achieving remission of psychotic symptoms was often significantly below the currently licensed dose for these drugs. We therefore recommend that clinicians are cautious about exceeding our recommended doses. Individual factors, however, should be accounted for. We outline potentially relevant factors, including age, ethnicity, sex, smoking status, and pharmacogenetics. Additionally, we recommend therapeutic drug monitoring as a tool to determine individual pharmacokinetic variation.

- **Conclusions**: In summary, we propose a new set of maximum target doses for psychosis drugs based on efficacy. Further research through randomized controlled trials should be undertaken to evaluate the effect of reducing doses from licensing maximums.

### Making sense of norclozapine levels: 3 clinical axioms [^111iZzX9]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). High credibility.

Laboratories commonly provide norclozapine concentrations when a plasma clozapine level is requested, but the appropriate use of this information for the treatment of individuals with schizophrenia is not always clear. Particularly vexing is the fact that norclozapine possesses pharmacological properties distinct from its parent compound, contributing to clozapine's efficacy signal, yet the literature focuses primarily on the association of clozapine levels with symptomatic improvement. The purpose of this brief article is to highlight findings regarding the need to track norclozapine levels, or the ratio of clozapine/norclozapine plasma levels, to optimize efficacy among inadequate responders to clozapine treatment.

- **Specific type of information**: The article discusses the specific type of information provided by the clozapine/norclozapine ratio concerning clozapine's clearance and how this ratio is sometimes misinterpreted. There is clinical value to be derived from norclozapine levels and the clozapine/norclozapine ratio for schizophrenia management.

- **Guiding principles**: The principles governing the use of this information will be distilled into three succinct axioms to aid clinicians in managing their clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia.

### Plasma protein and lipoprotein distribution of clozapine [^115uSGGw]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The authors' goal was to determine what effect dyslipidemia has on clozapine's plasma distribution. [³H]Clozapine, along with cold clozapine (335 ng/ml), was incubated in plasma samples with varying total cholesterol, lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations. Following incubation, the plasma was separated into its lipoprotein and lipoprotein-deficient fractions by density gradient ultracentrifugation, and clozapine distribution was determined.

Compared with the plasma standard, significantly more clozapine was recovered in the very-low-density lipoprotein fraction, which contained elevated total cholesterol and triglycerides. Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between total plasma triglyceride concentration and clozapine recovery in this fraction.

In plasma samples with elevated triglycerides, clozapine shifts from the lipoprotein-deficient fraction to the very-low-density lipoprotein fraction. This redistribution of clozapine may affect the pharmacological activity of clozapine.

### The effect of clozapine on premature mortality: An assessment of clinical monitoring and other potential confounders [^113Tn3dw]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder, have a 1.5–2.5 times higher mortality risk than the general population and a 10–20 year reduction in life expectancy with most excess deaths attributed to natural causes. Difficulty in performing activities of daily living, substance misuse, adverse lifestyle choices, psychopathology, and medications appear to contribute to the elevated mortality rate.

Antipsychotic medications, which are the cornerstone of SMI treatment, are associated with an increased risk of physical morbidity and premature death in individuals with SMI. Importantly, the mortality risk may vary between different antipsychotics prescribed to these individuals. Several investigations, including large-scale cohort studies, have reported that clozapine has the lowest risk of all-cause mortality and suicide specifically compared to other antipsychotics. Clozapine is highly effective; however, its use is restricted due to safety concerns related to the risk of agranulocytosis, seizures, myocarditis, and other adverse cardiovascular/respiratory effects in patients. Consequently, clozapine can only be prescribed to individuals who receive at least monthly blood monitoring (with no signs of agranulocytosis) and is limited to those with treatment-resistant SMI.

Despite treatment guidelines, there remain substantial delays in initiating clozapine, and antipsychotic polypharmacy and high doses are commonly used before clozapine. There is evidence that clozapine is und

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^115Rvfbi]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Low credibility.

There are potential limitations to the interpretation of the dose-response curves from PET studies. First, individual variation may not have been captured by the relatively small sample sizes. However, the shape of the dose-activity curve (i.e. hyperbolic) should be the same for each individual, suggesting that hyperbolic dose reduction regimes should be universally applicable. It should also be noted that there is some heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of PET studies, indicating the likelihood of interindividual differences in receptor occupancy for a given dose, emphasizing the importance of individualized tapering guided by the patient's response to reductions.

Second, it is difficult to determine whether D2 occupancy will linearly correspond to withdrawal effects. There is a body of evidence that suggests that a minimum threshold of D2 antagonism is required before a clinical effect or adverse effects are seen; this may also apply to withdrawal effects. However, a recent meta-analysis has found a continuous hyperbolic relationship between antipsychotic dose and clinical response, mirroring the relationship between dose and D2 occupancy. One meta-analysis found evidence of a positive linear relationship between clinical improvement and D2 receptor occupancy (when patients taking quetiapine and clozapine, thought to act through mechanisms other than D2 antagonism, and outliers with very high dopaminergic blockade were excluded). Evidence of a linear relationship between D2 antagonism and therapeutic effects may extend to withdrawal effects, but this requires further investigation.

### Dried blood spot analysis for therapeutic drug monitoring of clozapine [^115MTvDZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 0.4% to 1% of the population worldwide. Diagnosis is primarily based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria. Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug mainly used for treating schizophrenia patients who are refractory or intolerant to at least two other antipsychotics. Due to the high variability in clozapine pharmacokinetics, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is highly recommended.

- **Objective**: To develop and clinically validate a novel sampling method using dried blood spot (DBS) to support TDM of clozapine and norclozapine.

- **Methods**: From June 2014 to September 2014, 15 schizophrenia patients (aged 18–55 years) treated with clozapine were included. Plasma, DBS samples made from venous samples (VDBS), and finger prick DBS (DBS) samples were obtained before administration and 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after clozapine intake. The study was repeated in six Russian patients for external validation. Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare the DBS, VDBS, and plasma results for clozapine and norclozapine.

- **Results**: The DBS validation results showed good linearity over the concentration time curve measured for clozapine and norclozapine. The accuracy and between- and within-day precision variation values were within accepted ranges. Different blood spot volumes and hematocrit values had no significant influence on the results. The DBS samples were stable at 20°C and 37°C for two weeks and at higher temperatures for a shorter period.

### Predicting clozapine dose required to achieve a therapeutic plasma concentration - A comparison of a population algorithm and three algorithms based on gene variant models [^111ZQcNX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic but requires careful titration to ensure therapeutic blood levels are achieved. Methods to predict therapeutic doses are typically based on population data.

- **Aims**: We aimed to construct a model based on genetic variants that accurately predicted plasma levels for clozapine.

- **Method**: We measured clozapine plasma levels in patients on a stable dose of clozapine who were known to be fully compliant. The measured plasma levels were adjusted for sampling time and dose. Hepatic enzyme variants were analyzed, and models were constructed to predict the required dose. These predictions were compared with a standard population-based algorithm.

- **Results**: We measured plasma clozapine concentrations in 18 adherent patients on stable doses of clozapine and recorded the exact timing of sampling. For the algorithm-predicted dose, the mean difference was -49.9 mg/day (SD 155.9, r = 0.36) from the actual dose required to achieve a plasma concentration of 0.35 ng/ml. The gene variant activity score predicted a dose for which the mean difference was -43.5 mg/day (SD 140.1, r = 0.55). For the gene variant activity score with omeprazole correction, the predicted dose had a mean difference of -31.0 mg/day (SD 140.8, r = 0.54), and with the gene variant CYP1A2 inducibility predicted dose, the mean difference was 44.9 mg/day (SD 160.8, r = 0.32).

- **Conclusion**: Our gene variant activity score with omeprazole correction provided the best estimate of the clozapine dose required to achieve a minimum therapeutic plasma concentration. The use of this model will allow for safer titration of clozapine.

### Versacloz [^116yNABD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Seizures have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering Versacloz to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure, such as CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse. Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Myocarditis, pericarditis, cardiomyopathy, and mitral valve incompetence**: Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine treatment. Discontinue Versacloz and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with Versacloz-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with Versacloz. Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis**: Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Versacloz is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Is clozapine-induced weight gain dose-dependent? Results from a prospective cohort study [^112WX7VS]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Low credibility.

Clozapine, the first atypical antipsychotic, is widely used for treating treatment-resistant schizophrenia, psychoses induced by dopaminergic agents used to treat Parkinson's disease, for reducing the risk of suicide, and for treating other off-label diseases such as bipolar disorder and depression. Nevertheless, its prescription is limited due to several adverse effects, especially agranulocytosis requiring constant blood cell monitoring. Clozapine is also one of the antipsychotics most associated with weight gain, blood lipids, and glucose alterations. However, whether these metabolic adverse effects are dose-dependent remains unclear.

Weight gain was associated with clozapine dose in a case-series report, in which a gain of 4.5 kg was reported in 4 out of 5 patients within the first month of treatment following a dose increase from 50 to 600 mg/day. Additionally, a 16-week double-blind randomized study including 50 patients starting clozapine reported greater weight gain of +2 kg among patients receiving 600 mg/day versus patients receiving 300 mg/day.

On the other hand, a 21-month open-label study of 15 patients starting clozapine reported +5 kg and +12.5 kg gain among patients receiving high (i.e. 600 mg/day) and low doses (i.e. 200 mg/day), respectively, while a retrospective study showed no significant association between weight gain and clozapine dose after 3 and 6 months of treatment among 117 patients (mean doses 300 and 316 mg, respectively).

Glucose fasting concentrations and clozapine dose were negatively correlated in a cross-sectional study including 24 patients.

### Plasma levels of second-generation antipsychotics and clinical response in acute psychosis: A review of the literature [^114G1K6Q]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the study is to assess the relationships between plasma concentrations (Cps) of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and clinical outcomes to establish the clinical value of therapeutic drug monitoring.

In April 2012, we searched PubMed and MEDLINE databases for English-language articles using keywords such as risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, paliperidone, iloperidone, asenapine, lurasidone, therapeutic drug monitoring, serum level, and plasma level. One hundred and ninety-one articles were retrieved from the initial search. Articles were selected for inclusion if they aimed to correlate Cps with efficacy measures, if they were prospective, and if they examined patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of a psychotic illness. Ultimately, 11 articles were selected.

Of the nine compounds involved in the search, only four were included in relevant articles, and only two of these were involved in multiple trials. No studies involving the most recently developed compounds (paliperidone, iloperidone, asenapine, and lurasidone) were identified. Studies varied widely in methodology, with only four studies adopting a fixed-dose model. Results differed considerably between studies regarding both clinical and adverse effects, with 6 of the 11 studies revealing a positive correlation between Cps and response.

The utility of therapeutic drug monitoring of SGAs (other than clozapine) remains an open question, although limited evidence from fixed-dose studies is encouraging.
