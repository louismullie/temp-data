## Question

Should psychiatric symptoms be managed now, or should treatment be deferred until the thyroid is normal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether psychiatric symptoms in patients with thyroid dysfunction should be treated concurrently or deferred until thyroid function normalizes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiologic and temporal associations between thyroid disease and psychiatric disorders. Then, I should verify mechanisms that could explain persistent psychiatric symptoms despite biochemical euthyroidism. Next, I will assess the risks of deferring psychiatric treatment. After that, I need to evaluate evidence and interactions that support concurrent management. Then, I should align recommendations with major guidelines. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic decision framework with monitoring strategies and state a clear conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the strength and direction of association so I don't jump to conclusions. Large biobank analyses show that both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are associated with higher odds of depression and anxiety, with genetic correlations concentrated at the MHC locus, suggesting shared autoimmune liability rather than a purely hormonal link, and these patterns are consistent across multiple datasets and approaches [^114Rd3NV] [^1147HkMT]. I should also double-check temporality to avoid reverse causation; nationwide registry data demonstrate increased psychiatric morbidity before and after the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, which supports a bidirectional and persistent relationship rather than a transient epiphenomenon tied only to hormone levels [^116vng2c].

> Now, I need to think about mechanisms that could explain why symptoms might persist after levothyroxine normalizes TSH. The "low tissue liothyronine" hypothesis and related work suggest a subset of LT4-treated patients have residual symptoms, potentially due to inadequate T3 signaling in specific brain regions despite normal serum TSH, and contemporary reviews emphasize that 10–20% report residual cognitive and mood complaints, indicating imperfect restoration of neural euthyroidism in some cases [^111jJi9V] [^111bFDq8]. Hold on, let me also verify the autoimmune angle; genetic studies localize shared risk to the MHC region, implying neuroimmune pathways that are not corrected by simply normalizing circulating TH levels, which could plausibly sustain psychiatric symptoms independent of serum TSH and free T4 values [^114Rd3NV] [^111UNv7k]. I should also review functional neuroimaging; PET data in both hypo- and hyperthyroidism show regional cerebral metabolic abnormalities that only partially normalize with treatment, aligning with residual symptomatology despite biochemical correction [^113ZQ4U9].

> Next, I should review the clinical risks of deferring psychiatric treatment, because safety must drive urgency. Case reports and series document severe presentations such as psychosis, delirium, and mixed affective states in the context of thyroid disease, and while endocrine optimization is necessary, these neuropsychiatric conditions often require prompt psychiatric intervention for stabilization and safety, not least because endocrine therapies may act too slowly for acute risk mitigation [^111eV5Nt] [^113Pp2KJ] [^112ZRy5Y]. Let me think about the broader functional burden as well; persistent brain fog and cognitive dysfunction are commonly reported in biochemically euthyroid patients on LT4 and correlate with impaired quality of life, which argues against a wait-and-see approach when symptoms are clinically significant [^111TVLJu]. I should also consider potential treatment resistance; thyroid dysfunction has been associated with poorer response in mood disorders, particularly in bipolar disorder, meaning delays could entrench disability and complicate recovery trajectories [^112QDf5f].

> I will now examine evidence supporting concurrent management and key drug–thyroid interactions that make coordination essential. Randomized data suggest supraphysiologic LT4 can have adjunctive antidepressant effects in bipolar depression, especially among women, illustrating that thyroid hormones may augment psychiatric care rather than replace it, although this strategy requires careful selection and monitoring for adverse effects [^111uUiyv]. Wait, let me verify psychotropic effects on thyroid tests; SSRIs can lower T3 and T4 in euthyroid patients within weeks but often remain within reference ranges, and in adequately LT4-replaced hypothyroid patients, SSRI initiation did not significantly change thyroid indices in one study, so the practical implication is monitoring rather than avoidance of SSRIs when clinically indicated [^112XSKE8]. I should also double-check antipsychotics and mood stabilizers; antipsychotic exposure, particularly quetiapine and olanzapine, has been associated with lower free T4, and lithium confers a well-known increased risk of hypothyroidism, reinforcing the need for coordinated, concurrent treatment with routine thyroid surveillance rather than deferral of psychiatric care [^114LgJ8u] [^116ptV67]. Finally, a "two-track" model for medically not yet explained symptoms highlights the importance of addressing physical and psychosocial factors simultaneously, which fits the clinical reality of thyroid–psychiatric comorbidity [^116VLyiW].

> Hold on, I should align this with authoritative guidelines to ensure recommendations are consistent and not idiosyncratic. Major endocrine guidelines caution against using thyroid hormones solely for nonspecific symptoms without biochemical hypothyroidism, underscoring that psychiatric syndromes should be treated on their own merits rather than by escalating thyroid therapy indiscriminately, and they recommend LT4 monotherapy as standard in overt hypothyroidism with avoidance of routine combination therapy or desiccated extract in most adults [^112JWB2T] [^116zs8V6]. I need to check subclinical hypothyroidism guidance; a high-credibility BMJ guideline issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones for adults with SCH given lack of benefit on quality of life and depressive symptoms, which again implies that psychiatric symptoms in SCH warrant direct psychiatric evaluation and treatment rather than endocrine overtreatment [^114LBMH9]. Let me also verify pragmatic targets and timing; UK consensus suggests optimizing LT4 to a TSH of roughly 0.3–2.0 mU/L for 3–6 months before declaring treatment failure, while evaluating other causes of symptoms in parallel rather than serially, which supports concurrent psychiatric assessment and management during endocrine optimization [^1155V2B7]. I should not forget special cases; in central hypothyroidism, LT4 dosing should be guided by free T4 rather than TSH, so waiting on TSH normalization would be inappropriate, and in pregnancy, more frequent thyroid monitoring is required, but neither scenario argues for deferring needed psychiatric care [^113m2fbv] [^116RTm1g].

> Let me now translate this into a practical clinical approach, but I should verify that it respects both safety and evidence. For severe psychiatric presentations such as psychosis, mania, suicidality, or delirium, initiate immediate psychiatric treatment alongside urgent thyroid management because endocrine correction alone is insufficient and too slow to mitigate acute risk, with close collaboration between psychiatry and endocrinology from day one [^111eV5Nt] [^113Pp2KJ]. For moderate syndromic illness, such as major depression or disabling anxiety, start psychiatric therapy within the first few weeks of thyroid therapy rather than waiting months for biochemical stabilization, as persistence and functional decline are common and early intervention prevents chronicity, coordinated with thyroid monitoring and dose titration every 6–8 weeks until stable per guidelines [^112JWB2T] [^111TVLJu]. For milder subsyndromal complaints, optimize LT4 thoughtfully while screening for alternative contributors and reassess within 8–12 weeks, escalating to psychiatric care if symptoms remain functionally impairing, and throughout, employ case-finding labs at baseline for new psychiatric presentations, including TSH, free T4, and anti-TPO, given the high comorbidity and treatability of overt thyroid disease [^113SKFsA] [^112JWB2T]. But wait, what if psychotropics shift thyroid parameters; anticipate SSRI-related small shifts, antipsychotic-associated lower fT4, and lithium-associated hypothyroidism, and plan proactive thyroid testing schedules rather than withholding indicated psychiatric medications, adjusting LT4 as needed in concert with the psychiatric regimen [^112XSKE8] [^114LgJ8u] [^116ptV67].

> Before I conclude, I should double-check that this synthesis addresses the initial dilemma and reflects the totality of evidence. The epidemiology and genetics show independent and overlapping pathways linking thyroid and psychiatric disease beyond serum hormones alone, temporality indicates psychiatric morbidity both precedes and follows thyroid diagnosis, mechanisms support tissue-specific hypothyroidism and autoimmunity in the brain, and clinical data demonstrate safety risks with deferral as well as therapeutic synergy when treatments proceed in parallel, all within the guardrails of guideline-based endocrine care that cautions against hormone overtreatment for nonspecific symptoms [^114Rd3NV] [^116vng2c] [^111jJi9V] [^111bFDq8] [^111eV5Nt] [^111uUiyv] [^112JWB2T] [^114LBMH9].

> Final conclusion and recommendation: Psychiatric symptoms should be managed concurrently with thyroid treatment, not deferred. The rationale is fourfold: pathophysiologic independence and shared autoimmunity can sustain symptoms despite normalized TSH, psychiatric morbidity occurs both before and after thyroid diagnosis, deferral risks safety and chronicity, and concurrent care is feasible with coordinated monitoring of bidirectional thyroid–psychotropic interactions, all consistent with endocrine guidelines that emphasize appropriate thyroid optimization while addressing residual symptoms through other means in parallel [^114Rd3NV] [^116vng2c] [^111eV5Nt] [^112XSKE8] [^114LgJ8u] [^111uUiyv] [^112JWB2T] [^1155V2B7] [^114LBMH9].

Treat psychiatric symptoms concurrently with **thyroid normalization** when symptoms are severe or disabling, as thyroid correction alone may not fully resolve psychiatric issues [^111bFDq8] and delays can worsen outcomes. For mild symptoms, monitor **closely** during thyroid treatment and add psychiatric treatment if symptoms persist once euthyroidism is achieved. Always screen for thyroid dysfunction in new psychiatric presentations and coordinate endocrine and psychiatric care [^113SKFsA] [^111eV5Nt].

---

## Clinical evidence on psychiatric symptom resolution with thyroid normalization

- **Hypothyroidism and psychiatric symptoms**: Hypothyroidism is linked to depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and psychosis; thyroid hormone replacement often improves these symptoms [^1129vyEN], but not always completely [^1156weVT].

- **Hyperthyroidism and psychiatric symptoms**: Hyperthyroidism is associated with anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and psychosis; antithyroid therapy can improve these symptoms [^113ZQ4U9], but some may persist.

- **Persistent symptoms despite thyroid normalization**: A significant minority report ongoing psychiatric symptoms despite biochemical euthyroidism [^111jJi9V], suggesting additional psychiatric treatment is often needed [^111bFDq8] [^111TVLJu].

---

## Risks of delaying psychiatric treatment until thyroid normalization

Delaying psychiatric care can exacerbate symptoms, reduce quality of life, and **increase suicide risk**. Even after thyroid function normalizes, untreated psychiatric symptoms can cause substantial functional impairment and delay recovery, prolonging suffering [^111jJi9V].

---

## Benefits of concurrent psychiatric and thyroid treatment

Concurrent management can provide faster symptom relief and **improve quality of life**. Treating psychiatric symptoms in parallel may enhance adherence to thyroid therapy and deliver comprehensive, coordinated care.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Screening and diagnosis**: Always screen for thyroid dysfunction in new psychiatric presentations [^113SKFsA] [^111eV5Nt].

- **Initial thyroid treatment**: Start thyroid hormone replacement or antithyroid therapy promptly when indicated [^112JWB2T] [^116BsELq].

- **Concurrent psychiatric treatment**: Begin psychiatric treatment concurrently if symptoms are severe or disabling.

- **Monitoring and adjustment**: Monitor closely and adjust psychiatric treatment as thyroid function normalizes.

- **Persistent symptoms**: If symptoms persist after euthyroidism, continue or initiate psychiatric treatment [^111bFDq8] [^111jJi9V] [^1155V2B7].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Severe psychiatric symptoms (e.g. psychosis, severe depression) | Treat concurrently with thyroid normalization |
| Mild psychiatric symptoms (e.g. mild anxiety, mild depression) | - Monitor during thyroid treatment <br/> - Add psychiatric treatment if symptoms persist |
| Persistent psychiatric symptoms after thyroid normalization | Initiate or continue psychiatric treatment [^111bFDq8] [^111jJi9V] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Treat psychiatric symptoms concurrently with **thyroid normalization** when symptoms are severe or disabling. For mild symptoms, monitor during thyroid treatment and add psychiatric treatment if symptoms persist once euthyroidism is achieved [^114LBMH9]. Always screen for thyroid dysfunction in new psychiatric presentations and coordinate endocrine and psychiatric care for optimal outcomes [^113SKFsA]. Concurrent treatment is **often necessary** because thyroid correction alone may not fully resolve psychiatric symptoms, and delays can worsen outcomes [^111jJi9V] [^116vng2c].

### The enigma of persistent symptoms in hypothyroid patients treated with levothyroxine: A narrative review [^111bFDq8]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Low credibility.

A significant minority of patients with hypothyroidism report persistent symptoms despite achieving normal thyroid biochemistry after levothyroxine (L-T4) replacement. Four principal lines of thinking, which are not mutually exclusive, may explain this enigma:

- **Low tissue liothyronine hypothesis**: This hypothesis emphasizes the potential imperfections of L-T4 replacement therapy that may lead to hypothyroidism in some tissues, such as the brain, while others (e.g. hypothalamus) are euthyroid.

- **Somatic symptom and related disorders hypothesis**: This draws attention to an incidental coexistence of a diagnosis of somatic symptom and related disorders in patients with treated hypothyroidism.

- **Autoimmune neuroinflammation hypothesis**: This highlights the potential consequences of inflammatory mediators due to thyroid autoimmunity (the most common cause of hypothyroidism) on the brain.

- **Comorbidities and psychosocial hypothesis**: This implicates a variety of physical and psychosocial factors that have been noted to be associated with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, which may primarily cause persistent complaints.

Over the past twenty years, a great deal of time and effort has been expended pursuing the 'low tissue liothyronine hypothesis'. However, it has failed to yield results that translate to patient benefits. This has skewed the balance in clinical practice in favor of pursuing answers relating to L-T4 and liothyronine combination treatment, while alternative explanations have been downplayed, and potentially useful interventions have been given insufficient attention.

### Reversible changes in brain glucose metabolism following thyroid function normalization in hyperthyroidism [^113ZQ4U9]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with hyperthyroidism frequently present with regional cerebral metabolic changes, but the consequences of endocrine-induced brain changes after thyroid function normalization are unclear. We hypothesized that the changes in regional cerebral glucose metabolism are related to thyroid hormone levels in patients with hyperthyroidism, and some of these changes can be reversed with antithyroid therapy.

- **Materials and methods**: Relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism was compared between 10 new-onset untreated patients with hyperthyroidism and 20 healthy control participants using brain FDG-PET scans. Levels of emotional distress were evaluated using the SAS and SDS. Patients were treated with methimazole. A follow-up PET scan was performed to assess metabolic changes of the brain when thyroid functions normalized.

- **Results**: Compared with controls, patients exhibited lower activity in the limbic system, frontal lobes, and temporal lobes before antithyroid treatment. There were positive correlations between scores of depression and regional metabolism in the cingulate and paracentral lobule. The severity of depression and anxiety covaried negatively with pretreatment activity in the inferior temporal and inferior parietal gyri, respectively. Compared to the hyperthyroid status, patients with normalized thyroid functions showed an increased metabolism in the left parahippocampal, fusiform, and right superior frontal gyri. The decrease in both FT3 and FT4 was associated with increased activity in the left parahippocampal and right superior frontal gyri.

### Brain glucose metabolism in hypothyroidism: A positron emission tomography study before and after thyroid hormone replacement therapy [^1129vyEN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is frequently associated with subtle behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The consequences of inadequate thyroid hormone availability to brain metabolism are poorly understood. This study assessed the relationships between neuropsychiatric symptoms and changes in relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism in hypothyroid patients undergoing thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

- **Design, setting, and outcome measure**: Relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism was compared in 13 previously untreated hypothyroid patients and 10 healthy control participants. Effects of thyroid hormone replacement therapy (levothyroxine, 3 months) were assessed using neuropsychiatric measures and positron emission tomography with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose.

Before treatment, hypothyroid patients exhibited lower regional activity than control subjects in the bilateral amygdala, hippocampus, and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left subgenual ACC, and right posterior cingulate cortex. The severity of depressive symptoms covaried negatively with pretreatment activity in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus and right subgenual and dorsal ACC. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy abolished pretreatment group differences in regional activity, robustly increased activity in the ventral ACC, and significantly reduced both clinician-rated and self-rated behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. Increased activity within the ventral ACC was associated with reduced somatic complaints, whereas increased activity within the dorsal ACC was associated with reduced symptoms.

### Acute delirium in the setting of primary hypothyroidism: The role of thyroid hormone replacement therapy [^113Pp2KJ]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Psychiatric illness, mostly mania and psychosis, is reported to occur after rapid normalization of thyroid function in patients with primary hypothyroidism. It is generally believed that the gradual restoration of thyroid function may reduce the risk of psychiatric complications. This case report describes the occurrence of acute delirium in a 67-year-old man with primary hypothyroidism shortly after the initiation of thyroid hormone replacement. The use of low-dose thyroxine initially and persistent severe biochemical hypothyroidism on presentation with psychiatric symptoms illustrate that psychiatric illness can still occur despite unaggressive thyroid hormone replacement. A temporal relationship with the initiation of thyroxine and rapid recovery of mental state over one to two weeks differentiates this condition from hypothyroidism-related psychopathology, which tends to have a more prolonged course.

The 2018 ETA guidelines recommend initiating antithyroid drugs as the medical treatment of choice for most patients with type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. This approach is emphasized in the management of hyperthyroidism associated with amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed upon, there are many nuances and complexities in consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding patient weight and residual thyroid function's impact on initial levothyroxine dosage and considering age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Since levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment.

For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be a benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being realized. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary, and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has been…

### Psychological well-being in patients on 'adequate' doses of l-thyroxine: results of a large, controlled community-based questionnaire study [^1117ghQJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Over 1% of the UK population is receiving thyroid hormone replacement with l-thyroxine (T4). However, many patients complain of persistent lethargy and related symptoms on T4 even with normal TSH levels. At the time of writing, there has been no large study to determine whether this is related to thyroxine replacement or coincidental psychological morbidity. We have, therefore, attempted to address this issue using a large, community-based study.

- **Design and patients**: Computerized prescribing records of five general practices were used to identify 961 patients who had been on thyroxine for a minimum of 4 months from a population of 63,000 (1.5%), along with age- and sex-matched controls. All 1,922 individuals were sent a two-page questionnaire, comprising the short form of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), designed to detect minor psychiatric disorders in the community, and a 12-question 'thyroid symptom questionnaire' (TSQ) in the same format. A covering letter explained that we were interested in 'how patients felt on medication' and made no direct reference to thyroxine.

- **Measurements**: Scores from the GHQ and TSQ were marked for each individual using the GHQ and Likert scoring methods. Patients' latest TSH measurements were obtained from laboratory records. Comparisons were then made on scores for the total GHQ-12, TSQ, and individual questions between patients (P) and control (C) groups. Separate analyses were made comparing the patients with a normal TSH (nP) and the control group.

- **Results**: Five hundred and ninety-seven (62%) of the patients (P) and 551 (57%) of the controls responded to the questionnaire, though the discussion of the results appears to be truncated.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^114aPam9]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

We studied the co-occurrence of thyroid dysfunction and psychiatric disorders in 502,480 subjects of the U.K. Biobank. The clinical diagnosis of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism was recorded as International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes using inpatient medical records during a hospital stay (U.K. Biobank data field 41202). More specifically, hypothyroidism was defined by either Hypothyroidism, unspecified (E039) or autoimmune thyroiditis (E063) codes. For hyperthyroidism, we considered thyrotoxicosis with diffuse goiter (E050), toxic single thyroid nodule (E051), thyrotoxicosis with toxic multinodular goiter (E052), and thyrotoxicosis, unspecified (E059).

Subjects were excluded based on multiple ICD-10 codes associated with thyroid conditions (n = 2730 subjects), spanning malignant or benign neoplasm of the thyroid gland (C73 and D34), carcinoma in situ of thyroid and other endocrine glands (D093), thyrotoxicosis from ectopic thyroid tissue (E053), factitial thyrotoxicosis (E054), other thyrotoxicosis (E058), acute, subacute, or drug-induced thyroiditis (E060, E061, and E064), chronic thyroiditis with transient thyrotoxicosis (E062), and other or unspecified chronic thyroiditis (E065, E069). Other exclusions included congenital hypothyroidism with diffuse goiter (E030) and without goiter (E031), hypothyroidism due to medications and other exogenous substances (E032), postinfectious hypothyroidism (E033), acquired atrophy of the thyroid (E034), myxedema coma (E035), other specified hypothyroidism (E038), and postprocedural hypothyroidism (E890).

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^1147HkMT]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

For a broader definition of thyroid disease patients, especially including those who never received in-patient treatment and were diagnosed by general practitioners, we used self-reported diagnoses from the U.K. Biobank (data field 20002). We also used the self-reported medication field (data field 20003), which records medications that individuals were actively taking at the time of their verbal interview with the U.K. Biobank. For hypothyroidism, we considered medication codes for levothyroxine sodium (1141191044), thyroxine sodium (1140874852), thyroxine product (1140884516), and sodium thyroxine (1140910814). For hyperthyroidism, carbimazole (1140874866), propylthiouracil (1140874776), and propylthiouracil product (1141157288) were considered.

We considered three common psychiatric disorders: MDD, BIP, and ANX. These phenotypes were extracted from various data fields and questionnaires similar to previous studies. For selecting MDD subjects, we combined data fields 2090 and 2100: seen doctor (GP) or psychiatrist for nerves, anxiety, tension, or depression, and in-patient ICD-10 codes (data field 41202).

For ANX, we used data field 20544: Mental health problems ever diagnosed by a professional, including codes for social anxiety or social phobia, any other phobia (e.g. disabling fear of heights or spiders), panic attacks, anxiety, nerves, or generalized ANX, and agoraphobia. Subjects were removed from the anxiety group if they reported schizophrenia, mania, hypomania, bipolar or manic-depression, or Asperger's syndrome.

### Increased psychiatric morbidity before and after the diagnosis of hypothyroidism: A nationwide register study [^116vng2c]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormones are necessary for fetal brain development, and hypothyroidism in adults has been associated with mood symptoms and reduced quality of life. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the association and temporal relation between hypothyroidism and mental disorders is ambiguous. Our objective was to investigate, at a nationwide level, whether a diagnosis of hypothyroidism is associated with psychiatric morbidity.

- **Methods**: This is an observational cohort study. Based on record linkage between different Danish health registers, 2,822 hypothyroid singletons, each matched with four nonhypothyroid controls, were identified and followed over a mean period of 6 years (range 1–13). Additionally, we included 385 same-sex twin pairs discordant for hypothyroidism. Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders, as well as treatment with antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics, were recorded. Logistic and cox regression models were used to assess the risk of psychiatric morbidity before and after the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, respectively.

- **Results**: Before the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, such individuals had an increased prevalence of diagnoses with psychiatric disorders (odds ratio [OR] 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI 1.12–2.04]) and increased prevalence of treatment with antipsychotics (OR 1.49 [CI 1.29–1.73]), antidepressants (OR 1.50 [CI 1.35–1.67]), and anxiolytics (OR 1.28 [CI 1.16–1.41]). After the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, patients had a higher risk of being diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (hazard ratio [HR] 2.40 [CI 1.81–3.18]).

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^116RTm1g]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, specifically concerning thyroid replacement therapy, including indications and normal TSH levels, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining monitoring every four weeks during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. This is advised for the development of hypothyroidism in patients with positive levels of serum anti-TPO antibodies or with a serum TSH > 2.5 mIU/L who are not being treated with levothyroxine.

### Thyroid function and mood disorders: A Mendelian randomization study [^116rL3Uj]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

Thyroid function tests are the first-line laboratory examinations in patients diagnosed with MDD, since symptoms of overt thyroid disease can mimic depression. However, it is still currently unknown if subclinical thyroid dysfunction in MDD patients should be treated or not, which is a common clinical problem in daily psychiatric practice, as subclinical hypo- and hyperthyroidism are prevalent, affecting 5–15% of the general population. Our genetic variants are not only associated with normal-range thyroid function, but a genetic risk score based on our TSH-associated variants also strongly associates with both subclinical hypo- and hyperthyroidism. The results of the study suggest that there is neither any noteworthy causal effect of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on MDD risk. In contrast to some previous observational studies, these findings are in line with the results of a recent large-scale (N = 23,038) analysis of individual-level data from several prospective cohorts.

Up to a third of BD patients do not respond adequately to standard treatments. While LT4 therapy in BD patients remains controversial, our study provides novel evidence that supports the rationale for such a treatment. This is important, since LT4 treatment could be a valuable, low-cost, and well-titratable therapeutic option for patients with treatment-resistant BD. Therefore, our results should encourage further clinical studies on thyroid hormone therapy in BD.

This is a well-powered study that could detect even smaller effects of variation in normal-range thyroid function on the tested outcomes.

### Association of thyroid hormone therapy with quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115B19e5]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

The benefit of thyroid hormone therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism is uncertain; new evidence from recent large randomized clinical trials warrants an update of previous meta-analyses.

- **Objective**: To conduct a meta-analysis of the association of thyroid hormone therapy with quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, Emcare, and Academic Search Premier, from inception until July 4, 2018.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials that compared thyroid hormone therapy with placebo or no therapy in nonpregnant adults with subclinical hypothyroidism were eligible. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligibility based on titles and abstracts of all retrieved studies. Studies not excluded in this first step were independently assessed for inclusion after full-text evaluation by two reviewers.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two independent reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias (Cochrane risk-of-bias tool), and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE tool). For synthesis, differences in clinical scores were transformed (e.g. quality of life) into standardized mean differences (SMDs; positive values indicate benefit of thyroid hormone therapy; 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 correspond to small, moderate, and large effects, respectively). Random-effects models for meta-analyses were applied.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: General quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms following a minimum follow-up of 3 months.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113nGTgj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Both the non-specific nature of complaints and inherent deficiencies in the diagnostic process raise an unsettling dilemma for patients and thyroid specialists alike. These issues are particularly pertinent to an etiological disease entity whose consequences are observed in similar outcomes: primary hypothyroidism due to total thyroidectomy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Treatment requirements and dosing of LT4 changed when guidelines relaxed the need for TSH-suppressive treatment targets for these patients. This shift was not primarily motivated by an improvement in the replacement strategy but rather by a revision of the long-held tenet that TSH may act as a thyroid growth-stimulating hormone. Even when present at low levels in circulation, it was believed to potentially stimulate the growth of remaining tumor cells, promoting the relapse of thyroid cancer in the long term.

This view has recently been revised, and TSH suppression is now deemed unnecessary for many thyroid cancer patients. This remarkable strategy change has presented a unique opportunity to study the implications for patient complaints following the decision to abandon TSH-suppressive LT4 treatment in low-risk thyroid cancer. Although this could not be conducted as a prospective study, careful retrospective analysis revealed some interesting trends. Over the years when replacement therapy aimed at complete TSH suppression, a relatively low rate of persistent hypothyroid complaints was reported by patients.

### Use of liothyronine (T3) in hypothyroidism: Joint British Thyroid Association/Society for Endocrinology consensus statement [^1155V2B7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Low credibility.

Persistent symptoms in patients treated for hypothyroidism are common. Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomised trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focused on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments.

The statement emphasizes several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism. Patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimized aiming for a TSH in the 0.3–2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. For some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below the reference range (e.g. 0.1–0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term. We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been explored…

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^115em58w]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

There is still a significant knowledge gap regarding whether the observed associations between (minor or overt) thyroid abnormalities and psychiatric diseases are directly mediated through thyroid hormones (TH). This is clinically relevant, as understanding the complex interactions between thyroid status, autoimmunity, and psychiatric disorders is essential before making treatment recommendations to prevent or treat coinciding psychiatric disorders in a patient with mild thyroid dysfunction, or vice versa.

An estimated 60–70% of the interindividual variation in thyroid function is determined by genetic factors. Beyond a direct genetic relationship between thyroid function and psychiatric disorders, various studies have suggested that genetic factors play an important role in various other autoimmune diseases, as well as psychiatric disorders.

In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been particularly successful in identifying the genetic determinants of thyroid function and, more recently, of psychiatric disorders. With the availability of these data, this is an optimal moment to investigate the role of common genetic variants in the complex relationships between thyroid function, autoimmunity, and common psychiatric diseases. Doing so could help determine whether the well-known clinical comorbidity between thyroid diseases and psychiatric disorders is specifically driven by THs or has a more general autoimmune-related basis.

### Thyroid hormones and illness [^112Zc8Kp]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

To review illness-associated changes in thyroid hormone levels with respect to the alterations in metabolism, regulation, and transport of thyroid hormones present in such a setting, we summarize normal pituitary-thyroid function and categorize the types of changes noted during illness. In addition, we examine studies that have addressed the metabolic status of patients with low thyroid hormone levels and the potential utility of thyroid hormone treatment in severely ill patients.

The finding of altered thyroid hormone levels in hospitalized patients confirms the participation of these factors in the adaptive response to illness. Thyroid hormone alterations that occur during illness can be classified into three categories: (1) decreased production of triiodothyronine, (2) decreased serum binding of thyroid hormones, and (3) decreased secretion of thyrotropin. The study of these hormonal changes has provided insight into normal thyroid hormone regulation and metabolism as well as into neuroendocrine adaptations to illness.

It seems reasonable to conclude that illness-associated changes in thyroid hormone levels are generally beneficial to the patient as a whole; however, the possibility of concomitant regional or individual tissue hypothyroidism exists. Conclusions about the potential utility of pharmacologic administration of triiodothyronine in selected diseases and clinical settings must await additional clinical trials. Finally, the predictable occurrence of altered thyroid hormone levels in hospitalized patients is noteworthy.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^116ptV67]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by episodes of mania, hypomania, and depression, occurring in about 2% of the population. While acute episodes can be dramatic and require hospitalization, successful treatment rests on the effective prevention of recurrences and residual symptoms.

Lithium has been a cornerstone of the treatment of acute mania and the prevention of mood episodes during the maintenance phase of the disease. Despite its narrow therapeutic range, which requires careful monitoring of drug serum levels, lithium has proven effective in 30–50% of patients, particularly in those with a family history of BD, non-rapid cycling BD, and without comorbid substance use disorders. Lithium appears to have neuroprotective properties and reduces suicidal behavior. However, potentially severe side effects have also been reported, including hypothyroidism, particularly in middle-aged women, for whom rates as high as 37% have been reported. The link between hypothyroidism and lithium treatment has been supported by case reports and other observational studies as reflected in a recent meta-analysis. These anticipated adverse effects have led to recommendations for frequent thyroid testing of patients treated with lithium, as reflected in recent UpToDate guidelines, despite some negative findings.

Guidelines for lithium treatment in patients with BD recommend thyroid function studies prior to treatment, once or twice during the first six months of therapy.

### Association of hypothyroidism and clinical depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cPiHJ]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is considered a cause of or a strong risk factor for depression, but recent studies provide conflicting evidence regarding the existence and the extent of the association. It is also unclear whether the link is largely due to subsyndromal depression or holds true for clinical depression.

The objective of this study was to estimate the association of hypothyroidism and clinical depression in the general population. Data was sourced from PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases, searched from inception until May 2020 for studies on this association.

Two reviewers independently selected epidemiologic and population-based studies that provided laboratory or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems diagnoses of hypothyroidism and diagnoses of depression according to operationalized criteria, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, or cutoffs in established rating scales.

Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated studies based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Summary odds ratios (OR) were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Prespecified coprimary outcomes were the association of clinical depression with either hypothyroidism or autoimmunity.

Of 4,350 articles screened, 25 studies were selected for meta-analysis, including 348,014 participants. Hypothyroidism and clinical depression were assessed.

### Low yield of thyroid-stimulating hormone testing in elderly patients with depression [^113oqqB2]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Although hypothyroidism is purportedly an important cause of depression, prior studies have involved small samples of young people and produced conflicting results. We examined the yield of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) testing in a large group of elderly patients with major depression or dysthymic disorder. The study sample comprised 883 outpatients aged 60 years or older from 18 primary care sites enrolled in the intervention arm of a clinical trial of depression management. Thyroid function was assessed by a single TSH value. Depressive diagnoses were confirmed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), and depression severity was assessed with the HSCL-20, a modified depression scale of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. TSH results were available for 725 (82.1%) participants. Although 32 (4.4%) of those tested had TSH > 5 mIU/L, the vast majority (27/32) had marginally elevated results (5.1–9.4 mIU/L). Only five patients (0.7%) had TSH levels > 10 mIU/L. Patients with elevated TSH did not differ from those with TSH ≤ 5 mIU/L in the severity or symptom pattern of depression as measured by the baseline HSCL-20 score (P = 0.37) or SCID score (P = 0.44). These findings should caution physicians against acceptance of borderline TSH values as the primary cause of a patient's clinical depression.

### Medical monitoring in patients with bipolar disorder: Clinical recommendations [^117EVfzB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Treatments for bipolar disorder can increase the risk for thyroid dysfunction, weight gain, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Because of these risks, a planned regimen of patient monitoring is recommended to track health concerns such as fluctuations in thyroid levels, weight, blood pressure, glucose levels, and lipid profile. Different health tests are needed depending on the type of medication the patient is prescribed.

### Combination treatment with T4 and T3: Toward personalized replacement therapy in hypothyroidism [^114dAJph]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy is the traditional lifelong replacement therapy for hypothyroid patients. Over the last several years, new evidence has led clinicians to evaluate the option of combined T3 and T4 treatment to improve the quality of life, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action in hypothyroidism. The aim of this review is to assess the physiological basis and the results of studies on this topic.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We searched Medline for reports published with the following search terms:
	- **Conditions and treatments**: hypothyroidism, levothyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid, guidelines, treatment
	- **Mechanisms and symptoms**: deiodinases, clinical symptoms
	- **Quality and mood aspects**: quality of life, cognition, mood, depression
	- **Physical and metabolic parameters**: body weight, heart rate, cholesterol, bone markers, SHBG
	- **Patient considerations**: patient preference for combined therapy

	The search was restricted to reports published in English since 1970, but some reports published before 1970 were also incorporated. We supplemented the search with records from personal files and references of relevant articles and textbooks. Parameters analyzed included the rationale for combination treatment, the type of patients to be selected, the optimal T4/T3 ratio, and the potential benefits of this therapy on symptoms of hypothyroidism, quality of life, mood, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The outcome of our analysis suggests that it may be time to consider a personalized regimen of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in hypothyroid patients.

- **Conclusions**: Further prospective randomized controlled studies are needed.

### Changes in brain size with treatment in patients with hyper- or hypothyroidism [^111DrwRa]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2002). Low credibility.

Although neuropsychological symptoms and signs are common in thyroid disease, their organic substrate is unknown. We performed brain MR imaging in patients with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism before and after treatment and correlated the results with hormonal markers.

- **Methods**: Eight patients with hyperthyroid disease and three with hypothyroid disease underwent imaging within 1–2 days of thyroid hormone testing. Images were registered, and brain and ventricular sizes were measured using a semiautomated contour and thresholding technique. Changes in brain and ventricular volume were correlated with serum levels of total thyroxine (T(4)), unbound triiodothyronine (free T(3)), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) before and after treatment.

- **Results**: With treatment, brain size decreased by 6,329–31,183 mm(3) in the hyperthyroid group and increased by 2,599–48,825 mm(3) in the hypothyroid group. Conversely, with treatment, ventricular size increased by 325–6,279 mm(3) in the hyperthyroid group and decreased by 760–2,376 mm(3) in the hypothyroid group. There was a highly significant correlation between the reduction in brain size and reduction in T(4), as well as between the increase in ventricular size and reduction in T(4). There was a significant correlation between reduction in ventricular size and reduction in free T(3). There were highly significant correlations between reduced levels of TSH and increase in brain size, as well as between increased levels of TSH and increase in ventricular size.

- **Conclusion**: In thyroid disease, the size of the brain and ventricles changes significantly following treatment and is related to levels of thyroid hormones.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^114Rd3NV]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

The hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis coordinates brain development and post-developmental function. Thyroid hormone (TH) variations, even within the normal range, have been associated with the risk of developing common psychiatric disorders, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

- **Methods**: To gain new insights into the potentially shared mechanisms underlying thyroid dysfunction and psychiatric disorders, we performed a comprehensive analysis of multiple phenotypic and genotypic databases. We investigated the relationship of thyroid disorders with depression, bipolar disorder (BIP), and anxiety disorders (ANX) in 497,726 subjects from the U.K. Biobank. We subsequently examined genetic correlations between thyroid disorders, thyrotropin (TSH), and free thyroxine (fT4) levels with the genome-wide factors that predispose individuals to psychiatric disorders. Finally, the observed global genetic correlations were pinpointed to specific local genomic regions.

- **Results**: Hypothyroidism was positively associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder (MDD; OR = 1.31, p = 5.29 × 10⁻⁸⁹), BIP (OR = 1.55, p = 0.0038), and ANX (OR = 1.16, p = 6.22 × 10⁻⁸). Hyperthyroidism was associated with MDD (OR = 1.11, p = 0.0034) and ANX (OR = 1.34, p = 5.99 × 10⁻⁶). Genetically, strong coheritability was observed between thyroid disease and both major depressive disorder (r g = 0.17, p = 2.7 × 10⁻⁴) and ANX (r g = 0.17, p = 6.7 × 10⁻⁶). This genetic correlation was particularly strong at the major histocompatibility complex locus on chromosome 6.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^112kwiXT]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The following covariates were examined for their effect on the CIF:

- **Treatment**: Using lithium as the reference, binary dummy variables were created for the non-lithium treatments.
- **Age at treatment**: Accounts for the higher risk of hypothyroidism among older patients.
- **Sex**: Accounts for the higher risk of hypothyroidism among female patients.
- **Patient visit days in the year preceding monotherapy**: A proxy for engagement with the health care system before monotherapy.
- **Whether thyroid testing was performed in the 14 days preceding monotherapy**: Accounts for observation bias — patients who tested positive for hypothyroidism were excluded since patients receiving lithium are more likely to be tested pretreatment than patients receiving other therapies.
- **Nonparametric thyroid testing rank during monotherapy**: Used to adjust for observation bias — hypothyroidism should not be diagnosed without a thyroid test, and not all treatments have comparable thyroid testing. We used the following SNOMED-CT procedure concepts and their descendants to count thyroid tests: thyroid-stimulating hormone measurement (61167004), thyroid hormone measurement (390780008), thyrotropin-releasing hormone test (252219000), thyroid panel (35650009), and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins measurement (104972000).

To account for different observation times, covariates were calculated as follows. For each patient (p), we found the competition rank of p's number of thyroid tests among the smallest time interval centered around p's treatment time that included at least 50 patients, and normalized it to (0

### Hyperthyroidism presenting as mixed affective state: A case report [^112ZRy5Y]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Thyroid disorders have long been associated with psychiatric illnesses, commonly mood disorders. In bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism is a quite common abnormality. Little is known about the association of thyroid disorders and mixed affective states. We present a case of hyperthyroidism presenting as a mixed affective state and the successful resolution of psychiatric symptoms with antithyroid medication along with a mood-stabilizing agent.

Regarding the medical management of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders, specifically in the context of hyperthyroidism, the 2018 ETA guidelines recommend initiating oral corticosteroids as first-line therapy in patients with type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis with moderate-to-severe symptoms. The decision to treat milder or subclinical forms should be based on the underlying cardiac conditions, in close consultation with a specialist cardiologist.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^111UNv7k]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

In the study, we systematically analyzed the role of common genetic variants in the complex relationships between thyroid function, autoimmunity, and three common psychiatric disorders. We found strong genetic correlations between autoimmune hypothyroidism, major depressive disorder (MDD), and anxiety disorders (ANXs). Despite higher SNP-heritability estimates for thyroid function (TSH and fT4), there were no significant genetic correlations between TSH and fT4 and any of these psychiatric disorders. This may suggest that the genetically determined relationship between hypothyroidism and mood/ANXs is not mediated through thyroid hormones (THs) directly, but rather through pathways that underpin disease pathogenesis, such as general autoimmunity. This was further supported by our regional genetic correlation analyses, in which the top locus was the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune hypothyroidism.

It has been known for a long time that inflammatory pathways play a central role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hypothyroidism. However, in the last decade, various studies have shown that inflammatory pathways also play a key role in the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders. Notably, studies on inflammatory biomarkers have been unable to detect markers that are specific for any particular psychiatric disorder, thereby suggesting genetic variation in autoimmunity to be a more general underlying phenomenon. Various biological treatment regimes, including pharmacotherapy and noninvasive brain stimulation with electroconvulsive therapy, indeed led to a reduc

### Medically not yet explained symptoms in hypothyroidism [^116VLyiW]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2024). Low credibility.

Persistent symptoms are common in the general population and even more so in people with hypothyroidism. When symptoms are unexplained and brought to medical attention, they can be referred to as medically not yet explained symptoms (MNYES), a term preferred by patients, caregivers, and experts. MNYES might be neglected by endocrinologists or misattributed to hypothyroidism. Awareness of MNYES could lead to more effective and less harmful interventions for patients presenting with unexplained symptoms than costly over-investigations and overtreatment with thyroid hormones such as levothyroxine and liothyronine.

The role of the endocrinologist is to recognize and acknowledge that MNYES could be underlying a patient's presentation. It involves communicating effectively with the patient and others involved in their care, applying a 'two-track approach' in management by paying equal attention to physical and psychosocial contributors, and collaborating with other relevant health professionals. Categorization of patients into levels of risk for symptom deterioration helps in selecting suitable therapies. Effective management of MNYES demands time, training, expertise, and resources.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^113eJzW1]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Large-scale administrative claims data provide the opportunity to obtain estimates of adverse medication effects in large populations across a range of geographical regions in "real-world" health care settings and often over long periods of exposure. Such data capture a substantial amount of heterogeneity in disease severity and treatment response over the disease course, whereas most clinical trials enroll a homogeneous cohort followed over relatively short time periods.

However, the advantages of claims data can be offset by their observational nature and inconsistency in collection, coding, and recording. As such, treatment biases and confounding factors require specific attention and have been addressed in our analyses.

The objective of this study was to determine the comparative risk of hypothyroidism with lithium monotherapy versus eight of the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants and second-generation antipsychotics used to treat patients with bipolar disorder (BD). The study is innovative in that it comprehensively utilizes medical claims data on over a million patients with BD in a competing risk survival analysis framework. It is also the first to compare all of the above-mentioned therapies head to head in a single study.

### Graves' disease presenting with hypomania and paranoia to the acute psychiatry service [^111eV5Nt]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

- **Patient's perspective**: Psychosis can occur as a significant or presenting feature in both thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism.

- **Learning points**:
	- In the assessment of patients with either newly diagnosed psychosis or a relapse of a psychiatric condition, inquire about symptoms of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism.
	- When screening patients with agitation, delirium, or psychotic symptoms for organic disease, include a thyroid function test.
	- Patients with psychiatric complications of thyrotoxicosis may be managed without antipsychotic medication. Treatment with a thionamide and beta-blocker may be sufficient, but this requires careful assessment on a case-by-case basis in close liaison with the psychiatry team.

### The relation between thyroid dysregulation and impaired cognition/behaviour: An integrative review [^114yT8du]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

Despite decades of research on the relation between thyroid diseases and cognition, the nature of this relationship remains elusive. An increasing prevalence of cognitive impairment and thyroid dysfunction has been consistently observed with ageing, and there appears to be an association between thyroid disorders and cognitive decline. Given the increasing global burden of dementia, elucidating the relationship between thyroid disorders as a potentially modifiable risk factor of cognitive impairment was the main goal of this review.

We summarize the literature examining the relationship between thyroid hormonal dysregulation and cognition or behaviour. We present the available imaging and pathological findings related to structural and functional brain changes related to thyroid hormonal dysregulation. We also propose potential mechanisms of interaction between thyroid hormones, autoantibodies, and cognition/behaviour. Effects of gender, ethnicity, and environmental factors are also briefly discussed.

This review highlights the need for long-term prospective studies to capture the course of brain functional changes associated with the incidence and progression of thyroid dysregulations, along with the confounding effects of non-modifiable risk factors such as gender and ethnicity. Moreover, double-blind controlled clinical trials are necessary to devise appropriate treatment plans to prevent the cognitive consequences of over or undertreatment of thyroid disorders.

### The association between depression, anxiety, and thyroid disease: A UK Biobank prospective cohort study [^111SAeAh]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Low credibility.

Thyroid disorder is a broad-spectrum dysfunction involving thyroid hormones and morphological changes, prevalent globally at a rate of 1.3%, with an annual incidence of 51 cases per 100,000 individuals. Thyroid hormones play a pivotal role in regulating growth and metabolism throughout life, with noted sex differences. Dysfunction in thyroid hormones is often associated with an increased risk of psychiatric illnesses, particularly anxiety and depression. Despite increased awareness of thyroid illnesses and improved diagnosis through sensitive laboratory tests, many cases remain undiagnosed or untreated due to complex clinical manifestations, leading to severe consequences.

Depression and anxiety are prevalent mental health illnesses that significantly impair social and psychological functioning and reduce quality of life, with prevalences of 6% and 18%, respectively. Studies indicate frequent comorbidity between depression, anxiety, and thyroid disorders, such as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune thyroid diseases. For instance, most individuals with depression are found to have thyroid function abnormalities. One recent study showed elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in 1,718 first-episode and drug-naïve major depressive disorder patients; another study conducted with 9,471 participants indicated additional insights into this comorbidity.

### Are we restoring thyroid hormone signaling in levothyroxine-treated patients with residual symptoms of hypothyroidism [^111jJi9V]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) at doses that maintain serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels within the normal range constitutes the standard of care for the treatment of hypothyroidism. After a few months, this eliminates the signs and symptoms of overt hypothyroidism in the majority of patients, owing to the endogenous activation of thyroxine to triiodothyronine, the biologically active thyroid hormone. Still, a small percentage of the patients (10%-20%) exhibit residual symptoms, despite having normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. These symptoms include cognitive, mood, and metabolic deficits, with significant impairment in psychological well-being and quality of life.

- **Objective**: To provide a summary of progress in the approach of patients with hypothyroidism that exhibit residual symptoms despite treatment.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the literature and focused on the mechanisms leading to a deficiency of T3 in some LT4-treated patients, the role of residual thyroid tissue, and the rationale for combination therapy with LT4 + liothyronine (LT3).

- **Results**: Clinical trials comparing therapy with LT4 versus LT4 + LT3 concluded that both are safe and equally effective; however, these trials failed to recruit a sufficiently large number of patients with residual symptoms. New clinical trials that considered LT4-treated symptomatic patients revealed that such patients benefit from and prefer therapy containing LT4 + LT3; desiccated thyroid extract has also been used with similar results.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients undergoing treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical issue in endocrinology practice. The most frequent cause of this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone medication. However, in compliant patients, multiple etiologies are possible. A methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will invariably identify a cause or at least a resolution.

### Association of thyroid dysfunction with cognitive function: An individual participant data analysis [^1156weVT]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction is considered a potentially reversible cause of cognitive decline; hence, thyroid function screening tests are described in guidelines as an essential component of the workup for the diagnosis of dementia. Thyroid dysfunction is frequently observed in individuals with suspected dementia. However, the outcomes of treatment for overt hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and subclinical hyperthyroidism on cognitive function are not fully clarified. For subclinical hypothyroidism, four of five recent randomized clinical trials and a meta-analysis on levothyroxine treatment did not find evidence for an improvement in cognitive function. Moreover, meta-analyses of observational studies have yielded inconsistent results on associations of subclinical and overt thyroid dysfunction with cognitive impairment and risk of dementia. An individual participant data analysis of cohort studies might help clarify the conflicting results of previous studies, as it allows for uniform definitions of thyroid dysfunction and can assess the differential associations by age groups, sex, and thyroid medication in subgroup analyses. In the present study, we investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of thyroid dysfunction with cognitive function and dementia in an individual participant data analysis of multiple cohorts.

### Free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone in severe mental disorders: A naturalistic study with focus on antipsychotic medication [^114LgJ8u]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Disturbances in thyroid function have been associated with the use of psychotropic drugs, including antipsychotics. However, thyroid function in relation to commonly prescribed antipsychotic drugs and polypharmacy is not fully known. We investigated thyroid function associated with the use of antipsychotics in patients with psychotic disorders compared to healthy controls.

- **Methods**: We included 1,345 patients and 989 healthy controls from the Thematically Organized Psychosis (TOP) study, recruiting participants between 18 and 65 years of age in the Oslo area. All patients underwent a thorough clinical investigation and assessment of medication data. Thyroid function was determined from plasma levels of free thyroxin (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between thyroid parameters and the use of antipsychotics. Monotherapy users of olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, or risperidone (N = 473) were investigated separately.

- **Results**: We found lower levels of fT4 (median 13.70 vs. 14.00, p < 0.001) in patients compared to healthy controls, with a prevalence of 12.9% of previously undiagnosed deviant thyroid states in the patient group. Lower fT4 levels were associated with the use of antipsychotics in general (p = 0.001), and quetiapine (p = 0.003) and olanzapine (p = 0.018) in particular, while the associations with TSH were non-significant. Using antipsychotics in combination with other psychotropic drugs, and with antidepressants in particular, was associated with lower fT4 level (p < 0.001).

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: A clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials, which could alter practice.

- **Practice**: Guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

- **Recommendation**: The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

- **How this guideline was created**: A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

- **The evidence**: The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^113CQiSD]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroid abnormalities occur with high frequency in patients with bipolar disorder regardless of treatment. Therefore, patients should be regularly tested for clinical or subclinical thyroid abnormalities on all therapies and treated as indicated to prevent adverse effects of hormone imbalances on mood. Since hypothyroidism occurs under all treatments, more emphasis should be placed on understanding the role of thyroid disorders in bipolar disorder. Future work should investigate hypothyroidism risk in untreated patients and patients on polypharmacy.

### Gender differences in thyroid system function: Relevance to bipolar disorder and its treatment [^112QDf5f]. Bipolar Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormones play a critical role in the functioning of the adult brain, and thyroid diseases impair both mood and cognition. This paper reviews gender differences in thyroid system function that are relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: The study comprised a comprehensive literature review of gender differences in thyroid disease that are pertinent to mood disorders.

- **Results**: The prevalence of thyroid disease was found to be much higher in females than males, and to increase with age. The most commonly detected abnormality was subclinical hypothyroidism, which was found to occur in up to 20% of postmenopausal women. Females also had higher rates of thyroid autoimmunity. Individuals at risk for thyroid disease, such as adult females, may have had less ability to compensate for additional challenges to thyroid metabolism, including lithium treatment. Thyroid abnormalities were associated with a poorer response to standard treatments for mood disorders. Females with treatment-resistant mood disorders may have responded better than males to adjunctive therapy with thyroid hormones.

- **Conclusions**: Disturbances of thyroid system function, which occur commonly in females, may complicate the diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders. In particular, this is clinically relevant during lithium treatment because lithium may impair vital thyroid metabolic pathways secondary to its anti-thyroid activity.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^114Am5fB]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

As a sample of people of the United Kingdom, both the U.K. biobank and genome-wide data used in this report are mostly representative of the European ancestry, specifically those self-reported and genetically clustered as "white British" populations. Due to this, caution must be taken with regard to the generalizability of our results to other ancestries, and further diversification of future works is warranted. For the genetic correlation analyses, genome-wide summary statistics were used, so we don't have access to individual-level data. Lack of access to in-depth individual-level GWAS data is a limitation of our work.

In conclusion, our results indicate that, rather than thyroid hormone (TH) itself, other explanations (such as autoimmunity) play a key role in the genetically determined relationships between hypothyroidism and mood/anxiety disorders. These findings provide valuable clinical insights into the potential benefits of treating milder forms of thyroid dysfunction. They warrant further research into the autoimmune mechanisms underpinning these common coexisting diseases, which may lead to a shift in personalizing treatment in the future.

### Brain fog in hypothyroidism: What is it, how is it measured, and what can be done about it [^111TVLJu]. Thyroid (2022). Low credibility.

Some levothyroxine (LT4)-treated hypothyroid patients report a constellation of persistent and distressing cognitive symptoms that has been termed brain fog. This narrative review focuses on attempts to define and measure hypothyroid-associated brain fog, summarize possible etiologies and contributing factors, present treatment options, and propose avenues for future research.

Methods: Published literature was reviewed to summarize available information on patient-reported symptoms associated with brain fog in hypothyroidism, as well as objective evidence of impairment based on neurocognitive testing and functional imaging studies. Given the limited information specific to hypothyroid-associated brain fog, relevant data from other medical conditions associated with brain fog were also reviewed and incorporated into recommendations for clinical care and future research areas.

Results: Hypothyroid-associated brain fog has not been well defined or quantitated, and the underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Symptoms vary among patients but commonly include fatigue, depressed mood, and cognitive difficulties in the areas of memory and executive function. Symptoms often predate the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and the magnitude of cognitive impairment can range from mild to severe. Regardless of severity, these symptoms are associated with impaired quality of life and cause dissatisfaction with treatment, often leading to requests for alternate therapies. Disease-specific and psychological factors impact the experience of brain fog in complex ways.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^116zs8V6]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, specifically in terms of thyroid replacement therapy (choice of agent and dosing), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend against using desiccated thyroid hormone, tiratricol, or combinations of levothyroxine and T3 for the treatment of hypothyroidism.

### Individualized therapy for hypothyroidism: Is T4 enough for everyone [^111MZC9u]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that some hypothyroid patients on levothyroxine (LT4) remain symptomatic, but why patients are susceptible to this condition, why symptoms persist, and what is the role of combination therapy with LT4 and liothyronine (LT3), are questions that remain unclear. Here, we explore evidence of abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) metabolism in LT4-treated patients and offer a rationale for why some patients perceive LT4 therapy as a failure.

- **Evidence acquisition**: This review is based on a collection of primary and review literature gathered from a PubMed search of "hypothyroidism", "levothyroxine", "liothyronine", and "desiccated thyroid extract", among other keywords. PubMed searches were supplemented by Google Scholar and the authors' prior knowledge of the subject.

- **Evidence synthesis**: In most LT4-treated patients, normalization of serum thyrotropin levels results in decreased serum T3/T4 ratio, with relatively lower serum T3 levels; in at least 15% of the cases, serum T3 levels are below normal. These changes can lead to a reduction in TH action, which would explain the slower rate of metabolism and elevated serum cholesterol levels. A small percentage of patients might also experience persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism, with impaired cognition and tiredness. We propose that such patients carry a key clinical factor, for example, specific genetic and/or immunologic makeup, that is well compensated while the thyroid function is normal but might become apparent when compounded with relatively lower serum T3 levels.

- **Conclusions**: After excluding other factors, it remains essential to consider these potential reasons for the perceived inadequacy of LT4 therapy in some patients.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113m2fbv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid replacement therapy, the Endocrine Society's 2016 guidelines recommend adjusting levothyroxine doses to avoid low or elevated free T4 levels. This is important to prevent the potential long-term cardiovascular risks associated with insufficient or excessive thyroid hormone treatment. It is advised not to use serum TSH levels to adjust thyroid replacement dosing in patients with central hypothyroidism.

### Effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on thyroid function in depressed patients with primary hypothyroidism or normal thyroid function [^112XSKE8]. Thyroid (2009). Low credibility.

Several studies with ambiguous results have examined the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on thyroid function. This study aimed to establish the effects of fluoxetine and sertraline treatments on thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity in patients with major depression and primary hypothyroidism, as well as in patients with major depression and normal thyroid function.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, controlled, intervention study involving 67 subjects: 28 patients with major depression and hypothyroidism on adequate levothyroxine therapy were randomized for treatment with fluoxetine (n = 13) or sertraline (n = 15); 29 patients with major depression and normal thyroid function were treated with fluoxetine (n = 15) or sertraline (n = 14), and 10 control patients with hypothyroidism on adequate levothyroxine therapy without depression. Main outcome measures included thyrotropin, thyroxine (T(4)), free thyroxine, triiodothyronine (T(3)), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and Hamilton depression (HAM-D) rating scale.

- **Results**: Patients with normal thyroid function who were treated with fluoxetine demonstrated a significant reduction of T(3) after 15 and 30 days of treatment (p = 0.034 and p = 0.011) and a significant reduction of T(4) throughout the intervention period (p = 0.04 after 15 days; p = 0.015 after 30 days; and p = 0.029 after 90 days). However, all thyroid parameters remained within the euthyroid range. No changes were observed among hypothyroid patients on levothyroxine replacement therapy who were treated with either SSRI.

### Supraphysiologic doses of levothyroxine as adjunctive therapy in bipolar depression: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111uUiyv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Suboptimal availability of circulating thyroid hormones may contribute to the high rate of treatment failures in bipolar disorder. This study tested the efficacy of adjunctive treatment with supraphysiologic doses of levothyroxine in patients with bipolar depression, exploring the hypothesis that women would display a better outcome compared to men.

The aims of this multicenter, 6-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled fixed-dose (300 μg/d) trial, conducted from 2004 to 2009, were to assess the efficacy and tolerability of levothyroxine adjunctive to continuing treatment with mood stabilizers and/or antidepressant medication for patients with bipolar I or II disorder, currently depressed (DSM-IV). Additionally, it aimed to investigate gender differences in treatment response. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score.

Of the 74 patients enrolled in the study, 62 (35 with bipolar I; mean age = 44.9 years) were randomized. The mean change in HDRS score from randomization to week 6 was larger in the levothyroxine group compared to the placebo group, with a 2.7-point difference (decline of -7.8 [38.3%] vs -5.1 [25.5%]; last-observation-carried-forward analysis). The course of HDRS scores over time from randomization to week 6 was significantly different between groups at week 4 (P = 0.046) but not at the end of the placebo-controlled phase (P = 0.198). The secondary analysis of women (n = 32) revealed a significant difference between groups in mean change in HDRS score (-16.6% placebo vs -42.4% levothyroxine, P = 0.018).

### Small changes in thyroxine dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life: Results of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial [^115a5BfG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

In patients with primary hypothyroidism, anecdotal evidence suggests that well-being is optimized by fine adjustment of T(4) dosage, aiming for a serum TSH concentration in the lower reference range. This has not been tested in a clinical trial.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to test whether adjustment of T(4) dosage aiming for a serum TSH concentration less than 2 mU/liter improves well-being compared with a serum TSH concentration in the upper reference range.

- **Design**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial with a crossover design.

- **Participants**: Fifty-six subjects (52 females) with primary hypothyroidism taking T(4) (≥ 100 microg/d) with baseline serum TSH 0.1–4.8 mU/liter participated.

- **Interventions**: Each subject received three T(4) doses (low, middle, and high in 25-microg increments) in random order.

- **Outcome measures**: Outcome measures included visual analog scales assessing well-being (the primary endpoint) and hypothyroid symptoms, quality of life instruments (General Health Questionnaire 28, Short Form 36, and Thyroid Symptom Questionnaire), cognitive function tests, and treatment preference.

- **Results**: Mean (± SEM) serum TSH concentrations were 2.8 ± 0.4, 1.0 ± 0.2, and 0.3 ± 0.1 mU/liter for the three treatments. There were no significant treatment effects on any of the instruments assessing well-being, symptoms, quality of life, or cognitive function and no significant treatment preference.

- **Conclusions**: Small changes in T(4) dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life, despite previous anecdotal evidence.

### The thyroid — too much and too little across the ages. The consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common and more prevalent than overt hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction, which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but they do not always indicate underlying thyroid disease.

There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality, and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities. Once identified, there are questions about whether to treat or monitor and, if so, how?

Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction, including short-term and long-term outcomes. A small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^1117tFt3]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent global health problem that can substantially affect patients' wellbeing. Lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone (replacement therapy) is needed when the diagnosis of persistent thyroid hormone deficiency is confirmed; consequently, levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Western countries, and this is likely to increase further in the foreseeable future.

Long term adverse health outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction and treatment targets to optimize these outcomes are generally monitored by serial measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). These have been extensively investigated. In particular, the cardiovascular effect of thyroid dysfunction and the negative ramifications of clinical (overt) thyroid hypofunction — mediated by changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis — are well documented. One of the targets for treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is to reverse such adverse effects. Guidelines in Europe and the US recommend that replacement therapy should aim at resolving symptoms and achieving "normalization" of TSH. However, no specific optimal target for TSH exists in the context of thyroid hormone replacement. This uncertainty is reflected in the guidelines proposed by the American Thyroid Association Task Force and the statement issued by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, which suggest a wide range for TSH, 0.4–4.0 mIU/L, as an indication for optimal replacement, after emphasizing the sca…

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large us cohort [^115dLJ5C]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Inclusion criteria were: (i) two or more diagnoses of BD at any time in the patient history; (ii) age at start of treatment ≥ 18 years; (iii) a minimum of one year of no prior drug treatment for BD and no hypothyroid diagnosis or treatment; (iv) followed by monotherapy for BD and at least one thyroid test during monotherapy. Results are contrasted with cohort subsets on 3+ (n = 15,430) and 6+ (n = 10,594) months of monotherapy to account for patients with pre-existing cases of hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly after treatment.

Nine monotherapeutic exposures were considered: lithium carbonate (RxNorm ingredient: 42351), aripiprazole (89013), carbamazepine (2002), lamotrigine (28439), olanzapine (61381), oxcarbazepine (32624), quetiapine (51272), risperidone (35636), and valproate (40254). We required that drug exposures had no gaps of 30 days or longer to increase the likelihood that prescriptions were not only filled but also continuously taken by the patients.

The duration of observation ranged from 1 day to 3,255 days (8.9 years), with a mean of 269 days and a median of 142 days. We report results up to four years from the start of monotherapy due to the paucity of longer-term observations.

The outcome was the cumulative incidence of clinically relevant hypothyroidism, as indicated by diagnosis codes (SNOMED: 40930008 and descendants) and filled hypothyroidism prescriptions: thyroxine (RxNorm: 10582 and descendants), desiccated thyroid (10572), triiodothyronine (10814), and thyroglobulin (10565).

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have provided guidance on how and when to use thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for detecting thyroid dysfunction. Recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction due to a lack of proven benefit and the potential harm of treating those with subclinical thyroid dysfunction. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the nonspecific nature of thyroid-associated symptoms, appropriate diagnosis requires biochemical confirmation.

- **White paper objective**:
	- The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE highlights the difference between screening and case-based testing in clinical practice. Thyroid dysfunction should be considered as a potential cause for many nonspecific complaints faced by physicians daily. Successful intervention relies on accurate diagnosis, hence we advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach to identify individuals likely to benefit from treatment.

### Influence of preexisting psychiatric morbidity on liothyronine use in hypothyroidism: A Swedish nationwide cohort study [^113fds5T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder affecting 1–2% of the population in iodine-sufficient areas. While levothyroxine is standard treatment, a substantial number of patients report persistent symptoms despite adequate treatment. The use of liothyronine as an adjunct to levothyroxine therapy has increased. However, the psychiatric characteristics of patients receiving liothyronine remain largely unknown. This study examines the association between preexisting psychiatric morbidity and subsequent liothyronine use in autoimmune hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: This nationwide retrospective cohort study includes all adults in Sweden with autoimmune hypothyroidism and treatment initiation with thyroid hormones between 2006 and 2020. Data were obtained from the National Patient Register and the National Prescribed Drug Register. Psychiatric morbidity prior to diagnosis was identified using ICD-10 codes and ATC codes for psychiatric medications. Logistic models estimated associations, adjusting for sex, age, and region.

- **Results**: Among 353,708 patients, 44.8% had a history of psychiatric morbidity. These patients were more likely to receive liothyronine (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.90, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.83–1.97, p < 0.001) compared to those without a psychiatric history. This was most evident among individuals with affective or anxiety morbidity (aOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.84–1.98, p < 0.001). No association was found for psychotic morbidity (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 0.98–1.19, p = 0.11).

- **Conclusion**: Patients with a psychiatric history before autoimmune hypothyroidism onset are more likely to receive liothyronine.

### Thyroxine treatment in patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism but thyroid function tests within the reference range: Randomised double blind placebo controlled crossover trial [^114ZEZLn]. BMJ (2001). Low credibility.

To determine whether thyroxine treatment is effective in patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism but with thyroid function tests within the reference range, and to investigate the effect of thyroxine treatment on psychological and physical well-being in healthy participants, a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted.

The study was set in an outpatient clinic in a general hospital and involved 25 patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism who had thyroid function tests within the reference range, as well as 19 controls. Participants were given thyroxine 100 micrograms or a placebo to take once a day for 12 weeks, with a washout period of six weeks. They were then given the other treatment for another 12 weeks. All participants were assessed physiologically and psychologically at baseline and upon completion of each phase.

- **Main outcome measures**: Thyroid function tests, measures of cognitive function, and assessments of psychological and physical well-being.

Results indicated that 22 patients and 19 healthy controls completed the study. At baseline, patients' scores on 9 out of 15 psychological measures were impaired compared to controls. Patients showed a significantly greater response to placebo than controls in 3 out of 15 psychological measures. Healthy participants had significantly lower scores for vitality when taking thyroxine compared to placebo (mean (SD) 60 (17) vs. 73 (16), P < 0.01). However, patients' scores from psychological tests when taking thyroxine were no different from those when taking a placebo, except for a poorer performance on one visual reproduction test.

### Risk of psychiatric disorders in patients with Graves' disease: A nationwide population-based analysis [^111qZNGk]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune hyperthyroidism associated with various psychiatric symptoms, such as irritability, mood changes, and insomnia. However, the epidemiological risk of psychiatric disorders among individuals with GD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether a diagnosis of GD is associated with an increased incidence of various psychiatric disorders at a nationwide level.

- **Methods**: This study was a retrospective cohort study using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Claims database. We identified 20,851 patients with newly diagnosed GD and 46,008 age- and sex-matched controls. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of incident psychiatric disorders in patients with GD compared to controls. We further analyzed the hazard ratios (HRs) by follow-up period (< 2 years, ≥ 2 years) since the diagnosis of GD.

- **Results**: Patients with GD exhibited a higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders compared to controls. The risk for incident depression (HR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.24–1.44), bipolar disorder (HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.31–1.89), anxiety disorder (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.43–1.63), and sleep disorder (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.32–1.58) was significantly elevated. This increased risk for various psychiatric disorders, except schizophrenia, persisted even two years after the GD diagnosis. The association between GD and schizophrenia was not statistically significant.

- **Conclusions**: This large-scale, population-based study demonstrates a significant association between GD and an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders, further underscoring the need for careful monitoring and management of psychiatric symptoms in patients with GD.
