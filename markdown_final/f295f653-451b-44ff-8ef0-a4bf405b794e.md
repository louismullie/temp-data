## Question

Sodium 132

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage a serum sodium of 132 mmol/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should verify tonicity and classify the hyponatremia by severity. Next, I will assess volume status and likely etiologies using urine studies. After that, I need to evaluate symptoms and chronicity to determine urgency. Finally, I will outline management by etiology, set correction limits, and specify monitoring and follow-up, while keeping special populations in mind [^112ofLR1].

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and exclude pseudohyponatremia or analytical error; a single sodium value of 132 mmol/L meets the definition of hyponatremia (< 135 mmol/L), but I should double-check for hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, or paraproteinemia, and repeat the sodium using the same laboratory method to avoid preanalytical or administrative errors before labeling the diagnosis definitively [^111fLWER] [^1156N96o].

> Wait, let me verify tonicity next because management hinges on whether this is hypotonic hyponatremia; I need a measured serum osmolality, and if it is less than about 275 mOsm/kg, that supports hypotonic hyponatremia, whereas normal or high osmolality suggests pseudohyponatremia or translocational hyponatremia from hyperglycemia or exogenous solutes like mannitol, which require different management pathways [^111ABycK] [^117MABxk].

> I should classify severity now; 132 mmol/L falls into the mild category (130–135 mmol/L), but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — severity informs risk and monitoring, not necessarily aggressive therapy, and even mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with increased falls, cognitive impairment, and mortality, so I need to keep clinical context front and center [^11556QFp] [^114hmeK4].

> Next, I will assess volume status and likely etiology using bedside examination and urine studies; I need a spot urine sodium and osmolality, and if urine osmolality is greater than 100 mOsm/kg, I should interpret urine sodium with serum sodium in hand — urine sodium ≤ 30 mmol/L suggests hypovolemia, whereas > 30 mmol/L suggests euvolemic SIADH or diuretic use, and if urine osmolality is ≤ 100 mOsm/kg, I should consider primary polydipsia or low solute intake; I should also review medications, heart failure, liver disease, endocrine causes, and recent surgery or pain that could drive SIADH [^1122iXCQ] [^112g3Tem] [^115Bfw9m] [^1121fSgV] [^111fLWER].

> I need to check symptom burden and chronicity carefully; mild hyponatremia is often asymptomatic or manifests with nonspecific findings like fatigue or mild cognitive slowing, but if there are severe neurologic symptoms or acute onset (< 48 hours), that changes urgency and treatment thresholds, so I should ask about onset, recent illnesses, procedures, and medication changes to estimate chronicity and guide safe correction limits [^114hmeK4].

> For asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chronic mild hyponatremia, I should prioritize treating the underlying cause rather than aggressively correcting sodium; fluid restriction to about 800–1,000 mL/day is reasonable first-line for SIADH, salt tablets or urea can be considered if restriction fails, and loop diuretics with oral salt can be used in hypervolemic states like heart failure or cirrhosis; I should avoid hypertonic saline in this scenario unless there is an acute indication, and I must remember that vasopressin antagonists like tolvaptan are options for persistent SIADH or hypervolemic hyponatremia but carry risks of overly rapid correction and thirst, so I need to ensure close monitoring if used [^113PdLtM] [^115EBSx5] [^114hmeK4] [^116gof4Q].

> But wait, what if the patient is hypovolemic; in that case, isotonic saline is appropriate because it restores effective arterial volume and suppresses ADH, thereby allowing free water excretion and gradual sodium correction; I should confirm hemodynamic stability and tailor the infusion rate to clinical status, and if the patient is unstable, I should prioritize resuscitation over concerns about a rapid sodium rise, with frequent monitoring to avoid overshooting correction limits [^111WyraN] [^112NDPcb].

> Hold on, I should verify correction limits to prevent osmotic demyelination; for chronic hyponatremia, I should not exceed about 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours and no more than 8 mmol/L in each subsequent 24 hours, and if I inadvertently overcorrect, I should promptly stop active therapies and consider relowering sodium with desmopressin and free water; in acute symptomatic cases, a small, controlled 4–6 mmol/L rise with hypertonic saline may be lifesaving, but I must still respect the 24-hour limits [^114Xdtdc] [^11621z9d] [^114oqYXZ].

> I will now examine special populations where a sodium of 132 mmol/L carries added risk; in cirrhosis, even mild hyponatremia signals worse prognosis and higher risks of encephalopathy, HRS, and SBP, so I should consider early transplant evaluation and manage with fluid restriction and careful diuretic use; in heart failure, hyponatremia correlates with worse outcomes, and sodium trends matter; in pediatrics, hospital-acquired hyponatremia is a recognized harm signal, so I should avoid hypotonic IV fluids; in neurosurgical patients, I should distinguish CSW from SIADH because fluid restriction worsens CSW; in exercise-associated hyponatremia, I must avoid hypotonic fluids early and use small hypertonic boluses if encephalopathy is present [^114NVLhP] [^111S5vcZ] [^115oxMZN] [^112Vb4tm] [^116oJfFF] [^113cFjnz].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence; for stable mild hyponatremia, repeating sodium every 24 hours initially is reasonable, but if I initiate active therapy or the patient is symptomatic, I should increase frequency to every 4–6 hours, and if using hypertonic saline, I should check sodium about 20 minutes after each bolus and continue frequent checks until stable; I also need to ensure the same laboratory method is used for serial comparisons to avoid misinterpretation [^114Mqs3L] [^114jzD4z] [^115WbE1C] [^1156N96o].

> Let me reconsider the overall risk and prognosis; even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stay, and neurocognitive deficits, and population data show a U-shaped relationship between sodium and mortality with the lowest risk around 139–144 mmol/L, so a sodium of 132 mmol/L is a clinically meaningful signal that warrants evaluation and follow-up even if the patient feels well today [^114hmeK4] [^113GqHGB].

> In summary, a sodium of 132 mmol/L is mild, hypotonic hyponatremia that requires confirmation, tonicity assessment, volume-status classification, and etiologic workup; management should be cause-directed with fluid restriction for SIADH, isotonic saline for hypovolemia, and disease-specific therapy for heart failure or cirrhosis, all while respecting correction limits and monitoring closely to prevent osmotic demyelination and to address reversible contributors promptly [^11556QFp] [^112ofLR1].

---

A sodium level of 132 mmol/L is **mild hyponatremia** [^11556QFp] and is generally not dangerous on its own, but it signals an underlying issue that needs evaluation [^111WyraN]. Most patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms (nausea, headache, confusion) [^111WyraN]; however, even mild hyponatremia is linked to **increased mortality, longer hospital stay, and cognitive impairment** [^113nG35Z] [^111fLWER] [^115mevFa]. Management focuses on identifying and treating the cause, with fluid restriction or isotonic saline as first-line therapy depending on volume status [^115evmgn] [^116F8M1C]. Rapid correction is risky due to osmotic demyelination [^113aETX4], so sodium should not rise by more than 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours [^114Xdtdc] [^114C7k4P]. Monitor sodium every 6–12 hours initially, and escalate care if symptoms develop or sodium falls below 125 mmol/L [^114Mqs3L] [^117Nardw].

---

## Clinical significance of sodium 132 mmol/L

Hyponatremia is defined as serum sodium **< 135 mmol/L**; therefore, 132 mmol/L represents mild hyponatremia [^111fLWER]. Although mild, it is **clinically significant** because of its association with increased mortality, longer hospital stays, and cognitive impairment [^113nG35Z] [^111fLWER] [^115mevFa].

---

## Symptoms and clinical manifestations

Patients with sodium 132 mmol/L may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, including:

- Nausea
- Headache
- Confusion
- Fatigue
- Muscle cramps

Severe symptoms — such as seizures, coma, or respiratory arrest — are **unlikely at this level** unless the decline is rapid or other factors are present [^114hmeK4].

---

## Causes of mild hyponatremia

Common causes of mild hyponatremia include:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Hypovolemic | - Diuretics <br/> - Gastrointestinal losses <br/> - Adrenal insufficiency [^111fLWER] |
| Euvolemic | - SIADH <br/> - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Polydipsia <br/> - SSRIs <br/> - NSAIDs [^111fLWER] |
| Hypervolemic | - Heart failure <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Nephrotic syndrome [^116Dh6zX] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **systematic approach** is essential to identify the cause and guide management:

- **Confirm hyponatremia**: Repeat sodium measurement and assess for pseudohyponatremia (hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperproteinemia) [^111ABycK].
- **Measure serum osmolality**: Differentiate hypotonic from non-hypotonic hyponatremia [^111ABycK].
- **Assess volume status**: Clinical examination to determine hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic state [^116Zh6gJ].
- **Urine studies**: Urine sodium and osmolality to help differentiate causes [^1122iXCQ] [^112g3Tem].
- **Laboratory tests**: Thyroid function, cortisol, renal function, liver function, and electrolytes [^116F8M1C].

---

## Management strategies

Management of mild hyponatremia focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause, with fluid restriction or isotonic saline as first-line therapy depending on volume status [^115evmgn]. Hypertonic saline is **not indicated** unless severe symptoms are present [^114hmeK4]. Avoid rapid correction (> 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours) to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome [^114Xdtdc] [^114C7k4P].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of serum sodium is essential to ensure **safe correction** and detect recurrence. Initial monitoring every 6–12 hours is recommended until sodium stabilizes, then the frequency can be reduced [^117Nardw].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

If left untreated, mild hyponatremia can lead to:

- Cognitive impairment
- Increased risk of falls and fractures
- Progression to severe hyponatremia with neurological complications
- Increased mortality [^114hmeK4]

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of mild hyponatremia depends on the underlying cause, patient comorbidities, and adherence to treatment. With appropriate management, the prognosis is **generally favorable**, but persistent hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality and morbidity [^113GqHGB].

---

A sodium level of 132 mmol/L represents mild hyponatremia, which, while not immediately dangerous, **requires careful evaluation and management** to prevent complications and address underlying causes [^111fLWER].

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/l, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. It can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, from subtle to severe or even life threatening, and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay in patients presenting with a range of conditions. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in widely different conditions and the fact that hyponatraemia is managed by clinicians with a broad variety of backgrounds have fostered diverse institution- and speciality-based approaches to diagnosis and treatment. To obtain a common and holistic view, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) and the European Renal Association - European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA), represented by European Renal Best Practice (ERBP), have developed the Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia. In addition to a rigorous approach to methodology and evaluation, we were keen to ensure that the document focused on patient-important outcomes and included utility for clinicians involved in everyday practice.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

Approaches to diagnostic strategies for hyponatremia

Seven guidance documents covered diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hyponatremia. Table 2 shows the key recommendations. The key areas addressed included the threshold for initiating diagnostic workup, confirmation and classification of hypotonic hyponatremia, and identification of the underlying disorder.

Summary of recommendations for approaches to diagnosis of hyponatremia by included guidance documents

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Guidance documents differed somewhat in their recommended threshold for starting diagnostic assessment. Six recommended starting diagnostic assessment when the serum sodium concentration dropped below 135 mmol/L and to confirm hypotonicity through a measured serum or plasma osmolality < 275 to 285 mOsm/kg. Two others set lower thresholds of serum sodium concentration at < 131 mmol/L and < 130 mmol/L. Six guidance documents advised classifying hypotonic hyponatremia into categories of hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia to aid differential diagnosis and guide treatment. Most guidance documents recommended a clinical assessment of hydration status and a urinary sodium concentration as well as a urinary osmolality measurement, although specific criteria, thresholds, and algorithms differed.

Most guidance documents proposed additional laboratory tests that could be of value to identify the underlying disorder, but they varied substantially regarding which tests to use in what situation and which reference values to use. Only two explicitly recommended taking a history of drug intake and symptoms as part of the assessment. Four presented an algorithm to guide differential diagnosis.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients, adequate response to initial management, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to limit the increase in serum sodium concentration to a total of 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and an additional 8 mmol/L during every 24 hours thereafter until the serum sodium concentration reaches 130 mmol/L.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to urine sodium, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to measure urine sodium concentration on a spot urine sample (obtained and interpreted with concomitant serum sodium concentration) in patients with urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^115sKws8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Dialysate sodium concentration (CPG 5.3) — High concentrations of sodium in dialysate reduce sodium removal during dialysis and ultrafiltration; historically, treatments lasting 6 hours used 135 mmol/L, but with shorter schedules (3 times per week for ≤ 4 hours per treatment) dialysate sodium was increased to the region of ≥ 140 mmol/L, which can aggravate thirst, fluid gain, and hypertension. Sodium profiling increases dialysate sodium early (eg, 145 to 155 mmol/L) with a progressive decrease to 135 to 140 mmol/L at the end of dialysis; reviews show sodium profiling is of uncertain benefit. The patient's postdialysis serum sodium concentration is a function of the time-averaged dialysate level, not the terminal level of sodium in dialysate. Some investigators had satisfactory experiences with a dialysate sodium concentration of 138 mmol/L, and during these studies the dosage of antihypertensive medications often had to be decreased or discontinued.

### Impact of serum sodium concentrations, and effect modifiers on mortality in the Irish health system [^113GqHGB]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum sodium and all-cause mortality

Over a median follow up time of 5.45 (3.90–6.33) years 5,114 patients (15.7%) died. Crude mortality rates were highest for hypernatraemia (131 per 1,000 person years) and lowest for normonatraemia (30 per 1,000 person years). Kaplan–Meier (S 1 Fig.) curves and Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed significantly higher all-cause mortality for patients classified as hyponatraemic and hypernatraemic at baseline compared to patients with serum sodium concentrations in the normal range. After adjusting for confounding variables, hyponatraemia [hazard ratio (95% CI): 1.31 (1.21–1.43)] and hypernatraemia [HR (95% CI): 1.45 (1.17–1.79)] from baseline serum sodium levels were associated with all-cause mortality. The multivariable time-dependent models further confirmed significantly higher mortality risks for patients classified as hyponatraemic [(HR (95% CI):1.80 (1.67–1.94)] and hypernatraemic [(HR (95%CI): 2.43 (2.06–2.88)] and these estimates were of greater magnitude than those estimated by single baseline sodium values (Table 2, Table S 3).

Table 2
Associations between Serum sodium, all-cause and cause-specific in time-varying Cox Models

Final model was adjusted for demographic factors (baseline age, sex), clinical indicators (haemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum albumin, serum potassium, serum calcium, white blood cell count, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and clinical setting at baseline

When serum sodium was modelled as a continuous time-dependent repeated measure using penalised spline models, a non-linear U-shaped association was observed with mortality (p-value for test of linearity < 0.001) (Fig. 2). This U‐shaped association persisted after adjusting for confounding. The optimal threshold values for serum sodium associated with the lowest mortality were determined to lie between 139 mmol/L [HR 1.03 (1.01–1.05)] and 144 mmol/L [HR 1.14 (1.05–1.24)]. Serum sodium values beyond this range were associated with increased mortality risk compared to a referent value of 140 mmol/L.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Cross-sectional positive association of serum lipids and blood pressure with serum sodium within the normal reference range of 135–145 mmol / L [^116c3gnA]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Serum sodium concentration is maintained by osmoregulation within normal range of 135 to 145 mmol/L. Previous analysis of data from the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) showed association of serum sodium with the 10-year risk scores of coronary heart disease and stroke. Current study evaluated the association of within-normal-range serum sodium with cardiovascular risk factors.

Approach and Results

Only participants who did not take cholesterol or blood pressure medications and had sodium within normal 135 to 145 mmol/L range were included (n = 8615), and the cohort was stratified based on race, sex, and smoking status. Multiple linear regression analysis of data from ARIC study was performed, with adjustment for age, blood glucose, insulin, glomerular filtration rate, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, and calorie intake. The analysis showed positive associations with sodium of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio; apolipoprotein B; and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Increases in lipids and blood pressure associated with 10 mmol/L increase in sodium are similar to the increases associated with 7 to 10 years of aging. Analysis of sodium measurements made 3 years apart demonstrated that it is stable within 2 to 3 mmol/L, explaining its association with long-term health outcomes. Furthermore, elevated sodium promoted lipid accumulation in cultured adipocytes, suggesting direct causative effects on lipid metabolism.

Conclusions

Serum sodium concentration is a cardiovascular risk factor even within the normal reference range. Thus, decreasing sodium to the lower end of the normal range by modification of water and salt intake is a personalizable strategy for decreasing cardiovascular risks.

### Derivation of outcome-based pediatric critical values [^115DXonH]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is currently a lack of an outcomes-based definition of critical values for the pediatric population. This has contributed to a highly heterogeneous critical value reporting practice between laboratories.

Methods

Anonymized results were extracted from a laboratory information system for 10 biochemistry tests. The probability of high-dependency/intensive care unit admission (as a proxy for adverse outcomes) for each individual laboratory concentration was calculated and adjusted to fit using a polynomial function to model the probability trend. The laboratory value that intersected the 90% probability trend line was considered the critical value threshold.

Results

The critical value thresholds for the serum analytes were sodium (mmol/L: < 131, > 148), potassium (mmol/L: < 2.4, > 6.4), bicarbonate (mmol/L: < 13, > 37), chloride (mmol/L: < 91, > 115), urea (mmol/L: > 12), creatinine (μmol/L: > 129), glucose (mmol/L: > 17.2), total calcium (mmol/L: < 1.9), magnesium (mmol/L: < 0.6, > 1.2), and phosphate (mmol/L: < 0.4, > 2.6).

Conclusions

This study described an approach to derive contemporary pediatric critical value thresholds.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^1174Gy8M]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### Admission serum sodium and potassium levels predict survival among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: a cohort study [^112RkQdy]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study had comprehensively explored the normal range and independent or synergistic prognostic effects of admission serum sodium and potassium levels among AKI patients. The normal range of serum sodium and potassium levels were 136.0–144.9 mmol/L and 3.7–4.7 mmol/L, respectively, through fitting smooth curve. We found that both lower and higher admission serum sodium or potassium levels were associated with excess mortality. Across different sodium strata, a higher admission serum potassium level was associated with increased risk of mortality among patients with lower sodium levels.

Normal ranges of serum sodium and potassium levels using in clinical sittings are determined mainly based on healthy subjects, whether these values are applicable to AKI patients with complex comorbidities is still unknown. Our proposed cut-offs level for serum sodium (136.0–144.9 mmol/L) is generally in line with clinically accepted normal range (135.0–145.0 mmol/L); whereas for potassium, the clinically accepted normal range is 3.5–5.0 mmol/l, but we observed excess mortality out of a narrow range of 3.7–4.7 mmol/L. This indicates that the excess mortality in AKI patients with so-called normal potassium levels were considerable. This finding shows that the risk for mortality is higher not only for those with clinically abnormal potassium levels, but also for those with potassium levels in the normal range of 3.5–3.7 mmol/L and 4.8–5.0 mmol/L. In addition, significant interaction was observed between admission serum sodium and potassium levels, which attract the attention that clinicians should not only concern the abnormal serum sodium and potassium levels independently associated with the poor prognosis, but also take into account that interaction of them predicts higher risk of mortality.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115evmgn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Utility and limitations of the traditional diagnostic approach to hyponatremia: a diagnostic study [^1148TKvF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis of hyponatremia is often challenging because of its association with multiple underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, diseases, and treatment options. Several algorithms are available to guide the diagnostic approach to hyponatremia, but their diagnostic and clinical utility has never been evaluated. We aimed to assess in detail the diagnostic utility as well as the limitations of the existing approaches to hyponatremia.

Methods

Each of the 121 consecutive subjects presenting with hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mmoL/L) underwent 3 different and independent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches: inexperienced doctor applying an established Algorithm, intensive care senior physicians acting as Senior Physician, and senior endocrinologist serving as Reference Standard.

Results

The overall diagnostic agreement between Algorithm and Reference Standard was 71% (respective Cohen's kappa and delta values were 0.64 and 0.70), the overall diagnostic agreement between Senior Physician and Reference Standard was 32% (0.20 and 0.19, respectively). Regarding the therapeutic consequences, the diagnostic accuracy of the Algorithm was 86% (0.70 and 0.72, respectively) and of the Senior Physician was 48% (0.01 and 0.04, respectively). In retrospect, by disregarding the patient's extracellular fluid volume and assessing the effective arterial blood volume by determination of the fractional urate excretion, the Algorithm improved its diagnostic accuracy to 95%.

Conclusion

Although the Algorithm performed reasonably well, several shortcomings became apparent, rendering it difficult to apply the Algorithm without reservation. Whether some modifications may enhance its diagnostic accuracy and simplify the management of hyponatremia needs to be determined.

### Investigation and management of moderate to severe inpatient hyponatraemia in an Australian tertiary hospital [^113nG35Z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatraemia is defined by a serum sodium (Na) concentration < 135 mmol/L. It is the most common electrolyte disturbance amongst hospitalised patients at a rate of 15–30%. A prospective cohort study of 98,411 hospitalised patients demonstrated that even mild hyponatraemia (Na 130–134 mmol/L) is associated with increased mortality in hospital (OR 1.37), at 1 year (OR 1.35) and at 5 years post discharge (OR 1.24).

Traditionally, hyponatraemia is classified clinically by volume status into hypovolaemic, euvolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia. The most common cause of euvolaemic hyponatraemia is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which is characterized by dysregulated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and water retention, despite low serum Na and osmolality. Diagnostic criteria include: euvolaemic state, normal thyroid hormone and cortisol levels, serum Na < 135 mmol/L, reduced serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/Kg and urine Na > 30 mmol/L.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^114pdHWw]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Study limitations

This study had some limitations. First, this was a single-center retrospective study with a small sample size of 56 patients. Some patients with chronic profound hyponatremia may have been admitted to the general ward and treated by general physicians, without the involvement of nephrologists. Second, the definition of overcorrection varies among studies. Finally, we ourselves designed the algorithm used in hyponatremia treatment. The protocol basically complied with international guideline recommendations for the treatment of chronic profound hyponatremia, although we did employ an exceptionally aggressive strategy involving continuous administration of 3% hypertonic saline in some situations to avoid under-treatment. In addition, the purpose of this standardized algorithm was not to recommend our treatment protocol to other institutions, but to make our results comparable to other studies. The appropriateness of applying diagnostic algorithms to treat hyponatremia remains to be studied, and physiology-based treatment must always be kept in mind. Our data should be interpreted in the light of these limitations.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111juAgh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — oral sodium suppression test: Individuals are instructed to consume 4–5 g of sodium per day for 3–4 days, then collect a 24-h urine on the final day of high sodium intake, measuring urinary aldosterone, sodium, and creatinine. Adequacy targets include 24-h urine sodium should ideally be > 200 mEq/ 24 hours, and 24-h urine creatinine is used to assess adequacy of urine collection. Oral sodium can be provided via sodium chloride tablets or sodium rich foods, and because hypokalemia may cause false-negative interpretations, serum potassium should be normalized before the study protocol.

### Evaluation of serum and whole blood sodium critical values [^1141AeWJ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Laboratories are required to have a critical values policy as a patient safety measure. Serum sodium commonly is included in critical results lists, but a wide range of values are used. We studied all critical serum and whole blood sodium results called to clinicians during a 6-month period. Patients' electronic medical records were reviewed for clinical responses and patient outcomes. Of the 111,545 sodium results occurring during the study, 615 (0.6%) were critical. By using criteria of 120 mEq/L (120 mmol/L) or less and 155 mEq/L (155 mmol/L) or more, we found 166 critically low results and 447 critically high results. In hypernatremic and hyponatremic patients, the lengths of stay were increased above our average, and clinicians responded to more than 50% of results within 4 hours. The mortality rates of hyponatremic and hypernatremic inpatients were 19% and 48%, respectively. Disease severity as measured by length of stay and mortality indicated these critical limits should not be broadened.

### Association between small decrease in serum sodium concentration within the normal range and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in elderly adults over 5 Years [^113t9VtJ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the importance of a decrease in serum sodium concentration within the normal range in elderly adults.

Design

Prospective cohort.

Setting

The Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging.

Participants

Randomly selected, community-based elderly population with a corrected serum sodium level between 135.0 and 145.0 mEq/L (N = 949).

Measurements

Survival status was determined during 63.3 ± 16.6 months of follow-up.

Results

Participants were divided into corrected sodium groups as follows: 73 (7.7%) in Group 1 (sodium 135.0–138.0 mEq/L), 635 (66.9%) in Group 2 (sodium 138.1–142.0 mEq/L), and 241 (25.4%) in Group 3 (sodium 142.1.0–145.0 mEq/L). There were 34 (46.6%) deaths in Group 1, 124 (19.5%) in Group 2, and 52 (21.6%) in Group 3 (P < .001). In a Cox proportional hazards analysis, a 2-mEq/L higher sodium level reduced the risk of death by 14.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.1–27.4%, P = 0.048). Group 1 had risk of mortality that was 2.7 times as high as that of Group 2 (95% CI = 1.76–4.11, P < .001). Participants with a measured sodium level of 138.0 mEq/L or less and a corrected sodium level greater than 138.0 mEq/L had a better survival rate than those with a measured sodium level of 138.0 mEq/L or less and a corrected sodium level of 138.0 mEq/L or less.

Conclusion

A slightly lower serum sodium concentration within the normal range was a major risk factor for mortality in elderly adults. Sodium level corrected according to serum glucose concentration was a more meaningful risk factor than measured sodium level.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

Wilderness Medical Society exercise-associated hyponatremia definitions — This table standardizes key terms and thresholds relevant to exercise and heat illness. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is defined as "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L⁻¹ that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity", while the severe variant with encephalopathy is "A severe form of exercise-associated hyponatremia associated with neurologic changes resulting from cerebral edema". Exercise-associated hypernatremia is "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration > 145 mmol·L⁻¹ that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity". Heat stroke is "A core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with altered mental status and generally divided into 2 categories: classic heat stroke… and exertional heat stroke". Hypohydration during exercise is described as "hypohydration during exercise with > 2% of body mass can occur from sweat loss during exercise and high environmental temperatures and is usually characterized as hyperosmotic hypovolemia". Hypertonic saline is "Any crystalloid solution containing more than 0.9% sodium chloride (ie, 3% sodium chloride)". Overhydration is "Excessive oral intake of hypotonic fluids (eg, water and sport electrolyte drinks) resulting in the amount of salt and other electrolytes in the body becoming diluted (ie, hyponatremia)", and hyponatremic encephalopathy occurs when "serum sodium rapidly decreases (eg, exercise-associated hyponatremia), there is an osmotic shift of fluid into the intracellular spaces, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure".

### Serum sodium in relation to various domains of cognitive function in the elderly US population [^115mevFa]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a cross-sectional study of the United States population sampled from the 2010–2011 and 2013–2014 NHANES, serum sodium levels were positively associated with cognitive test scores in the elderly. Log-transformed serum sodium levels were significantly associated with quintiles of CERAD WLT scores. In addition, compared to normal sodium levels, hyponatremia was associated with lower CERAD WLT (memory sub-domain) and AFT (executive function) scores. In short, serum sodium levels were significantly associated with the memory sub-domain assessed by the CERAD WLT and executive function assessed by the AFT, but not with processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory evaluated by the DSST.

In line with the results of our study, previous studies have reported an association between low sodium levels and cognitive function; however, these studies have only examined single domains of cognitive function (i.e. attention), or have assessed multiple domains grouped as a single variable. A case-control study performed in a general hospital in Brussels reported that individuals with low serum sodium levels (n = 122, range: 115–132 mmol/L, mean ± standard deviation [SD] = 126 ± 5 mmol/L) were associated with a higher odds of falling (odds ratio [OR] = 67.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.48–607.42) and significantly slower mean response times in the attention tests (difference: 58 milliseconds, P < 0.001) compared to individuals with normal sodium levels (n = 244, mean ± SD = 139 ± 2 mmol/L). Eight different visual and auditory attention tests were included in the battery of attentional tests. A cross-sectional study from the Hunter Community Study, a population-based prospective cohort study in Australia, revealed that standardized ARCS scores were significantly higher (mean = 4.67 units, 95% CI = 1.56–7.79, p = 0.01) for subjects with serum sodium levels equal to 135 mmol/L than those with serum sodium levels of 130 mmol/L. The ARCS scores is a vague tool which reflects a wide range of cognitive domains. A recent study from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men study, revealed that men with sodium levels of 126–140 mmol/L were associated with a 1.30 odds (95% CI = 1.06–1.61) of cognitive impairment, compared to individuals with sodium levels of 141–142 mmol/L. In this study, cognitive impairment was defined as a modified Mini-Mental Status score less than 84 or a Trail Making Test Part B time greater than 233 s. In addition, a study conducted in 150 patients aged 70 years and older from the University Hospital Cologne, showed that resolution of hyponatremia (< 130 mmol/L) by > 5 mmol/L was significantly associated with an increase in MMSE scores (ΔMMSE: 1.8 ± 3.0 vs. 0.7 ± 1.9; p = 0.002). Reversibility has also been reported in previous animal studies mentioned below.

### Evidence-based incorporation of serum sodium concentration into MELD [^1168ccFV]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Serum sodium (Na) concentrations have been suggested as a useful predictor of mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease awaiting liver transplantation.

Methods

We evaluated methods to incorporate Na into model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), using a prospective, multicenter database specifically created for validation and refinement of MELD. Adult, primary liver transplant candidates with end-stage liver disease were enrolled.

Results

Complete data were available in 753 patients, in whom the median MELD score was 10.8 and sodium was 137 mEq/L. Low Na (< 130 mEq/L) was present in 8% of patients, of whom 90% had ascites. During the study period, 67 patients (9%) died, 243 (32%) underwent transplantation, 73 (10%) were withdrawn, and 370 were still waiting. MELD score and Na, at listing, were significant (both, P < .01) predictors of death within 6 months. After adjustment for MELD score and center, there was a linear increase in the risk of death as Na decreased between 135 and 120 mEq/L. A new score to incorporate Na into MELD was developed: "MELD-Na" = MELD + 1.59 (135 - Na) with maximum and minimum Na of 135 and 120 mEq/L, respectively. In this cohort, "MELD-Na" scores of 20, 30, and 40 were associated with 6%, 16%, and 37% of risk of death within 6 months of listing, respectively. If this new score were used to allocate grafts, it would affect 27% of the transplant recipients.

Conclusions

We demonstrate an evidence-based method to incorporate Na into MELD, which provides more accurate survival prediction than MELD alone.

### Dehydration is how you define it: comparison of 318 blood and urine athlete spot checks [^116LxNrL]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Investigations assessing relationships between urine concentrations versus plasma osmolality (tonicity) in athletes fail to demonstrate statistical significance that would support the utility of using urine indices as a (more practical) surrogate measure of cellular hydration. The lack of diagnostic utility in using urine indices to predict intracellular dehydration has also been verified in a large sampling of 313 older people in a clinical setting. While plasma osmolality remains the hallmark measure of both tonicity and water balance, derangements in serum [Na +] represent extreme clinical manifestations of fluid imbalance that require emergent treatment. Accordingly, athlete deaths from underhydration have been associated with hypernatremia (serum [Na +] > 145 mmol/L), while deaths from overhydration have been associated with hyponatremia (serum [Na +] < 135 mmol/L).

The primary aim of this study is to compare blood and urine indices using two common urine-based definitions of dehydration. Additionally, we chose serum [Na +] (instead of plasma osmolality) as our main outcome measure of blood tonicity to more critically reflect the clinical consequences documented in exercise-associated fatalities at the extremes of fluid imbalance. The practical importance of clarifying the sport (urine) versus clinical (blood) definition of dehydration distills down to one simple — yet hotly debated — question: how much should we drink? Our hypothesis is that dehydration — and utility of using thirst as a guide to prevent dehydration — is highly dependent on the criterion used as the main outcome measure.

### Hyponatremia in cirrhosis: results of a patient population survey [^117CAZaW]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Low serum sodium concentration is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with cirrhosis, but its prevalence and clinical significance is unclear. To evaluate prospectively the prevalence of low serum sodium concentration and the association between serum sodium levels and severity of ascites and complications of cirrhosis, prospective data were collected on 997 consecutive patients from 28 centers in Europe, North and South America, and Asia for a period of 28 days. The prevalence of low serum sodium concentration as defined by a serum sodium concentration ≤ 135 mmol/L, ≤ 130 mmol/L, ≤ 125 mmol/L, and ≤ 120 mmol/L was 49.4%, 21.6%, 5.7%, and 1.2%, respectively. The prevalence of low serum sodium levels (< 135 mmol/L) was high in both inpatients and outpatients (57% and 40%, respectively). The existence of serum sodium < 135 mmol/L was associated with severe ascites, as indicated by high prevalence of refractory ascites, large fluid accumulation rate, frequent use of large-volume paracentesis, and impaired renal function, compared with normal serum sodium levels. Moreover, low serum sodium levels were also associated with greater frequency of hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome, but not gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with serum sodium < 130 mmol/L had the greatest frequency of these complications, but the frequency was also increased in patients with mild reduction in serum sodium levels (131–135 mmol/L). In conclusion, low serum sodium levels in cirrhosis are associated with severe ascites and high frequency of hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome.

### Does intravenous lactated Ringer's solution raise serum lactate? [^116yU1AB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Serum lactate increases in states of severe sepsis and shock, but its interpretation may be subject to confounders. Lactated Ringer's solution (LR) is used in the resuscitation of septic patients and contains 28 mmol/L of sodium lactate.

Objectives

We sought to determine if a bolus of 30 mL/kg of LR increases serum lactate levels.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 30 volunteers were assigned to receive either 30 mL/kg of intravenous LR or normal saline (NS). Serum lactate was measured before and after the fluid bolus. The primary outcome was the difference in the change in lactate between the LR and NS groups. Secondarily, we assessed the change in pH, bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride in each group.

Results

After 30 mL/kg of intravenous LR, the mean serum lactate level increased by 0.93 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.42–1.44 mmol/L). However, there was also a small increase in the mean serum lactate level in the NS group of 0.37 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -0.26 mmol/L to 1.00 mmol/L), such that there was not a statistically significant difference in the change in lactate when comparing the LR group to the NS group (p = 0.2). The NS group saw larger declines in pH and bicarbonate and greater increases in chloride compared with the LR group.

Conclusion

In healthy individuals, a modest but significant rise in mean serum lactate was seen after a 30 cc/kg LR bolus. There was no difference in mean serum lactate when comparing a 30 mL/kg bolus of NS to LR.

### Cerebral correlates of hyponatremia [^112MJJXr]. Neurocritical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium concentration ([Na+]) less than 135 mEq/L, is commonly caused by elevated levels of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), which causes water retention. The principal organ affected by disease-related morbidity is the brain. The neurologic complications associated with hyponatremia are attributable to cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure, caused by the osmotically driven movement of water from the extracellular compartment into brain cells. Although neurologic symptoms induced by hyponatremia are limited by an adaptive brain mechanism known as "regulatory volume decrease", an overly rapid correction of serum [Na+] before the reversal of this adaptive response can also produce neurologic damage. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hyponatremia related to central nervous system disorders, neurosurgery, or the use of psychoactive drugs. Fluid restriction is the standard of care for patients with SIADH who are asymptomatic or who have only mild symptoms, but patients with severe or symptomatic hyponatremia require more aggressive therapy. Infusion of hypertonic saline is the usual approach to the treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia, but patients require frequent monitoring. Pharmacologic agents such as demeclocycline and lithium may be effective in some patients but are associated with undesirable adverse events. The AVPreceptor antagonists are a new therapeutic class for the treatment of hyponatremia. The first agent in this class approved for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients is conivaptan. Two other agents, tolvaptan and lixivaptan, are being evaluated in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The AVP-receptor antagonists block the effects of elevated AVP and promote aquaresis, the electrolyte-sparing excretion of water, resulting in the correction of serum [Na+]. These agents may also have intrinsic neuroprotective effects.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^113Bvx9Y]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Hypertonic sodium solution administration — acute kidney injury (AKI) risk mitigation recommendations are as follows: We suggest that severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia during treatment with hypertonic sodium solutions should be avoided due to the association with acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). An upper serum sodium range of 155–160 mEq/L and a serum chloride range of 110–115 mEq/L may be reasonable to decrease the risk of acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Clinicians should routinely monitor both sodium and chloride serum concentrations to assess risk of AKI related to elevated concentrations (good practice statement), and renal function should be monitored closely in patients receiving hypertonic sodium solutions due to the risk of AKI with hyperosmolar therapy (good practice statement). For monitoring frequency, clinicians should use patient-specific factors with ranging from twice daily to every 2 h based on rapidity of change to interventions.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Impact of change in serum sodium concentration on mortality in patients hospitalized with heart failure and hyponatremia [^115oxMZN]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality among patients hospitalized with heart failure and it is a marker for increased short-term and long-term mortality. However, little is known about the time course of hyponatremia and whether changes in serum sodium levels affect clinical outcomes.

Methods and Results

Patients (n = 322) hospitalized with decompensated heart failure and serum sodium < 135 mmol/L were evaluated. After hospital discharge, the first sodium value obtained within a 60- to 270-day period was recorded, and patients were classified into 3 groups, based on whether the serum sodium value increased (≥ 2 mmol/L), decreased (≤ 2 mmol/L), or remained unchanged (± 1 mmol/L) relative to the baseline value. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to illustrate mortality as a function of change in sodium concentration over time, and a Cox-proportional hazards model was constructed to determine if change in serum sodium concentration predicted mortality after adjusting for relevant covariates. The mean age of the population was 66 years, 45% were women, and 55% were white. The mean baseline sodium level was 131 mmol/L and the mean ejection fraction was 32.5%. Two hundred twenty-two patients (68.9%) exhibited an increase in sodium during follow-up; in 57 patients (17.7%) the level was unchanged and in 43 patients (13.4%) there was a decrease in sodium level. During a median follow-up of 610 days, there was a strong positive association between change in sodium level and survival (P for trend < 0.001); that is, increased sodium was associated with decreased mortality. In multivariable analysis, change in sodium concentration and higher blood urea nitrogen were the strongest predictors of mortality (both P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Among patients hospitalized with heart failure and hyponatremia, change in serum sodium concentration over time is a strong predictor of long-term survival.

Primary aldosteronism — screening test parameters and pretest conditions: The combined interpretation of the plasma aldosterone concentration, renin activity, and aldosterone to renin activity ratio is currently the most accurate and reliable means of screening. Patients typically have suppressed renin activity (< 1 ng/mL/h), and most data support that the plasma aldosterone concentration should be at least 10 ng/dL to interpret the test as positive. The most commonly used cutoff value for the aldosterone to renin activity ratio is 30 when aldosterone is reported in ng/dL and plasma renin activity in ng/mL/h, with some data supporting alternative thresholds (20 or 40). Patients should have unrestricted salt intake, serum potassium in the normal range, and ideally MRA withdrawn for at least 4 weeks before testing.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^115pq4RC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subsequently, several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. – Excluding case series on the basis of patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are presented in Table 1. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varied widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

Table 1
Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies of patients with serum sodium concentrations ≤ 120 mmol/L

When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia, and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated, regardless of outcome. Data on 56 patients obtained from 40 medical centers confirmed that outcomes depend on the chronicity of hyponatremia, as previously defined: While none of the 18 patients with acute hyponatremia suffered complications, regardless of correction rate, 14 of 28 patients with chronic hyponatremia corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours developed post-therapeutic neurologic complications; in most, the clinical course was consistent with CPM (a delayed onset of neurologic symptoms beginning 2–6 days after initial improvement), but only three had CPM documented by imaging. The amount of correction over 48 hours was also associated with post-therapeutic complications: 14 of 27 chronic patients (52%) corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours were affected. All patients corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours had also been corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours, and all but one corrected by < 12 mmol/L in 24 hours were corrected by < 18 mmol/L in 48 hours.

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^112Vb4tm]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Maintenance intravenous fluids (IVFs) in children — hyponatremia risk with hypotonic solutions is increased across settings, with risk persisting regardless of age, medical versus surgical status, and intensive care versus general pediatric ward setting. Mild and moderate hyponatremia were defined as serum sodium concentration < 135 mEq/L and < 130 mEq/L, with relative risks > 2 and > 5, respectively. Increased hyponatremia occurred in children with normal sodium at baseline (hospital-acquired hyponatremia) and those with low sodium concentration at baseline (hospital-aggravated hyponatremia), and the association was found when using both 0.2% saline (sodium 34 mEq/L) and 0.45% saline (sodium 77 mEq/L), including in patients receiving fluid at a restricted rate. A sensitivity analysis excluding the Shamim et al study revealed an overall estimated relative risk 0.43 (95% CI, 0.35–0.53) versus 0.46 (95% CI, 0.37–0.57) when all studies were included. In clinical trials assessing mechanism, elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) concentration was found to play a putative role. Although some may argue that mild hyponatremia (plasma sodium 130–134 mEq/L) and moderate hyponatremia (plasma sodium 125–129 mEq/L) may not be clinically significant or constitute harm, the subcommittee believes that hyponatremia is an appropriate indicator of potential harm.

### Hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients: clinical guidelines development [^116oJfFF]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Neurosurgical patients have a high risk of hyponatremia and associated complications. We critically evaluated the existing literature to identify the determinants for the development of hyponatremia and which management strategies provided the best outcomes.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel in the areas of neurosurgery, nephrology, critical care medicine, endocrinology, pharmacy, and nursing summarized and classified hyponatremia literature scientific studies published in English from 1950 through 2008. The panel's recommendations were used to create an evaluation and treatment protocol for hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients at the University of Florida.

Results

Hyponatremia should be further investigated and treated when the serum sodium level is less than 131 mmol/L (class II). Evaluation of hyponatremia should include a combination of physical examination findings, basic laboratory studies, and invasive monitoring when available (class III). Obtaining levels of hormones such as antidiuretic hormone and natriuretic peptides is not supported by the literature (class III). Treatment of hyponatremia should be based on severity of symptoms (class III). The serum sodium level should not be corrected by more than 10 mmol/L/d (class III). Cerebral salt wasting should be treated with replacement of serum sodium and intravenous fluids (class III). Fludrocortisone may be considered in the treatment of hyponatremia in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients at risk of vasospasm (class I). Hydrocortisone may be used to prevent natriuresis in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients (class I). Hyponatremia in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients at risk of vasospasm should not be treated with fluid restriction (class II). Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone may be treated with urea, diuretics, lithium, demeclocycline, and/or fluid restriction (class III).

Conclusion

The summarized literature on the evaluation and treatment of hyponatremia was used to develop practice management recommendations for hyponatremia in the neurosurgical population. However, the practice management recommendations relied heavily on expert opinion because of a paucity of class I evidence literature on hyponatremia.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L⁻¹ and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Redefining diagnostic cut-offs for the indirect water deprivation test [^117Df1tz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

An incorrect diagnosis of arginine vasopressin deficiency and resistance (AVP-D and AVP-R) results in the potentially dangerous use of desmopressin in healthy individuals. The water deprivation test is a central diagnostic test in patients with polydipsia polyuria syndrome (PPS). This study aims to determine the effectiveness of the current interpretation of reference ranges.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of 135 patients who underwent a water deprivation test between August 2014 and August 2023. All patient diagnoses were reviewed, and variability and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were determined for serum osmolality, serum sodium and urine osmolality.

Results

Serum sodium demonstrated reduced variability compared with serum osmolality (0.72% vs. 1.16%, respectively, 37.5% reduction; p < 0.001). The standard serum osmolality cut-off value of ≥ 300mOsm/kg in diagnosing AVP-D, AVP-R, and primary polydipsia (PP) achieved a sensitivity of 76.19% and specificity of 76.92%. A serum sodium cut-off value of ≥ 148mmol/L demonstrated 100% specificity in excluding PP. This cut-off was used alongside urine osmolality cut-off values of > 630mOsm/kg (for PP) and < 383mOsm/kg (for AVP-D/AVP-R). Review of post-desmopressin urine osmolality and clinical monitoring was performed in equivocal diagnostic cases (n = 6), achieving 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity within the study sample.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that a serum sodium cut-off of ≥ 148mmol/L in tandem with urine osmolality yields the best diagnostic accuracy to differentiate between AVP-D, AVP-R, and PP. Serum sodium may be more reliable than serum osmolality in the investigation of patients with PPS, demonstrating lower biological and analytical variability.

### Urban heat and burden of hyponatremia [^114kftK4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outcome Variable

The primary outcome of interest for this analysis was the daily number of patients who experienced hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium level less than 135 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0). Hyponatremia was further categorized by its severity using the following cutoffs: sodium level 130 to 135 mEq/L for mild hyponatremia, sodium level 125 to 129 mEq/L for moderate hyponatremia, and sodium level less than 125 mEq/L for severe hyponatremia. Furthermore, cases of pseudohyponatremia due to hyperglycemia were corrected.

The sodium level of some patients was measured multiple times throughout the same day. For those hospitalized over several days, hyponatremia status was reevaluated daily when a sodium measurement was available. To avoid inflated rates from repeated daily measurements, we considered the lowest recorded value for each day as relevant for risk assessment purposes.

### Serum sodium concentration and tonicity in hyperglycemic crises: major influences and treatment implications [^117MABxk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Serum Hypertonicity as an Exclusive Consequence of Development of Hyperglycemia

When solutes with extracellular distribution, other than sodium salts, do not exceed their normal concentration, the expression 2×[Na] S represents approximately 98% of serum tonicity. Solutes distributed in total body water, such as urea, ethanol, methanol, or propyl alcohol, increase osmolality but do not change this relationship between [Na] S and tonicity because they do not affect the volume of cells. In contrast, gain of solutes restricted in the extracellular compartment, other than sodium salts, causes hypertonicity resulting in osmotic fluid exit from the intracellular compartment and decrease in [Na] S. In this case, [Na] S alone does not indicate the state of tonicity. Hypertonicity may result from gain of exogenous solutes with extracellular distribution, for example, mannitol or low‐molecular‐weight radiographic contrast agents. However, hyperglycemia is the major clinical condition that creates hypertonicity challenges from gain of extracellular solutes other than sodium salts. 17

Glucose infused as a bolus is distributed in the extracellular compartment. 18, 19, 20 After glucose enters the cells, it is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water or compounds with negligible osmotic activity (eg, glycogen). Consequently, regarding internal solute balance, glucose is considered an extracellular solute that contributes to the tonicity of body fluids. 5, 6, 7, 21, 22 Gains in glucose raise the effective extracellular solute and result in hypertonicity. 21 Serum tonicity in patients with hyperglycemia is calculated as the sum of 2×[Na] S plus the serum glucose concentration ([Glu] S) in mmol/L. 21

Correction of hypertonicity constitutes one of the main aims and challenges of managing hyperglycemic crises. 22 Correction of hyperglycemia results in loss of effective extracellular solute 23 and osmotic transfer of extracellular water into the cells, leading to a rise in [Na] S. 24 Serum tonicity decreases during correction of hyperglycemia because the decrease in osmolarity secondary to the decrease in [Glu] S (Δ[Glu] S) is greater than the corresponding increase in osmolarity secondary to the rise in [Na] S (Δ[Na] S). 24 The magnitude of the change in tonicity due to the level of correction of hyperglycemia must be accurately predicted because hyperglycemia causes a second major increase in body fluid tonicity through osmotic diuresis that requires additional measures for its correction. 7 This second hyperglycemic influence on tonicity will be addressed later in this report.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^115EBSx5]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of tolvaptan vs placebo in raising serum sodium was established in the SALT-1 and SALT-2 trials. These studies recruited 448 participants with a mean age of 61 years. The 2 trials had an identical design (1 conducted at 50 international sites and the other at 42 US sites), enrolling patients with chronic mild-to-moderate hyponatremia, mean baseline serum sodium 129 mmol/L (SD 4.1), who were electively admitted to the hospital for trial initiation. Euvolemic and hypervolemic patients both were enrolled — 30.8% had heart failure, 26.8% had cirrhosis, 24.6% had SIAD, and 17.8% "other". These trials compared 30 days of tolvaptan or placebo in addition to standard care (fluid intake recommendations as per treating clinician: no protocolized FR). Both trials demonstrated greater improvement in their primary end point of serum sodium area under the curve (AUC) with tolvaptan by day 4 (∼ 4 mmol/L) than with placebo (∼ 1 mmol/L). The initial dose of tolvaptan was 15 mg daily, with uptitration to 30 mg or 60 mg daily if there was limited response (< 5 mmol/L increase in pNa). Participants with pNa less than 120 mmol/L "in association with neurological impairment" were excluded. Adverse effect rates were similar between the 2 groups, the most common being thirst, dry mouth, weakness, nausea, dizziness, and urinary frequency.

Tolvaptan was approved in the United States and Europe in 2009; then Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2010; Canada, China, Indonesia, and Korea in 2011; and Australia in 2012. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, which formed a template for many other regions, was for treatment of clinically significant hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium less than 125 mmol/L, or hyponatremia that is symptomatic and has resisted correction with FR. The sodium threshold from the FDA approval is not evidence based, but instead based on expert opinion regarding which patients with hyponatremia are likely to benefit from treatment in general. In Europe and Taiwan, tolvaptan is approved for euvolemic hyponatremia caused by SIAD only. In Japan, tolvaptan is approved but for use in heart failure, and it is mozavaptan that is approved in SIAD.

Conclusions

Improving both the accuracy of diagnosis and the appropriate management of hyponatraemia are important goals given the morbidity and mortality associated with this common electrolyte disorder. A greater consistency in future clinical practice guidelines would represent a significant educational achievement and, crucially, would help clinicians to pick the best options for patients with hyponatraemia.

### Predialysis serum sodium level, dialysate sodium, and mortality in maintenance hemodialysis patients: the dialysis outcomes and practice patterns study (DOPPS) [^1129y74g]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Predialysis serum sodium concentrations recently have been linked to patient characteristics and outcomes in hemodialysis patients and may have implications for the dialysate sodium prescription.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Participants

11,555 patients from 12 countries in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS), phases I (1996–2001) and III (2005–2008).

Predictors

Demographics, comorbid conditions, laboratory measurements (model 1); mean serum sodium level, dialysate sodium concentration (model 2).

Outcomes

Serum sodium level, using adjusted linear mixed models (model 1); all-cause mortality, using Cox proportional hazards models (model 2).

Results

Median follow-up was 12 months, with 1,727 deaths (15%) occurring during the study period (12,274 patient-years). Mean serum sodium level in the DOPPS countries was 138.5 ± 2.8 mEq/L. Japan had the highest (139.1 ± 2.6 mEq/L) and Australia/New Zealand had the lowest mean serum sodium level (137.4 ± 2.8 mEq/L). Serum sodium level was associated positively with male sex, black race, body mass index, serum albumin level, and creatinine level and negatively with neurologic and psychiatric disease, white blood cell count, and intradialytic weight loss (0.16 mEq/L lower per 1% loss). Higher serum sodium level was associated with lower adjusted all-cause mortality in a continuous model (HR, 0.95 per 1 mEq/L higher; 95% CI, 0.93–0.97). Dialysate sodium prescription was not associated with serum sodium level. Mortality analyses restricted to the serum sodium tertile with the highest mortality (serum sodium < 137 mEq/L) showed lower mortality risk in patients with dialysate sodium prescriptions > 140 mEq/L.

Limitations

Causality cannot be established in this observational study, which does not consider potential effects of dialysate sodium level on postdialysis thirst, dietary salt and water intake, interdialytic weight gain, and cardiovascular stability.

Conclusions

Lower serum sodium levels are associated with certain hemodialysis patient characteristics and higher adjusted risk of death. The lower mortality observed in our adjusted analyses in patients with serum sodium levels < 137 mEq/L dialyzed against dialysate sodium prescriptions > 140 mEq/L is intriguing, may be related to intradialytic cardiovascular stability, and deserves further study.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Prognostic significance of baseline serum sodium in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113mYwnj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We analyzed serum sodium both as a continuous and then as a categorical variable. To examine the nonlinear relationship between baseline sodium as a continuous variable and mortality and hospitalization outcomes, we developed macros to fit cubic splines with 6 equally distributed knots to crude and multivariable proportional hazards regression and generalized estimating equation–based negative binomial regression models with a sodium value of 139.00 mmol/dL as the reference. Because of instability and low frequency among extreme values, all sodium values < 125.00 mmol/dL and > 150.00 mmol/dL were winsorized. Five baseline serum sodium categories were determined based on the shape and inflection points of the cubic spline plots, the distribution and quantiles of serum sodium values, and generally established clinical ranges. These categories were used for all proceeding regression analyses. We also compared these results to an a priori decile‐based analysis. We built our models based on a priori knowledge of risk factors and examination of confounders, starting with crude models, then age‐adjusted, parsimonious (age, sex, race), and finally multivariable adjusted. Given that the results of the parsimonious model were similar to the age‐adjusted and multivariable models, we will not present those results. No automated variable selection process was used (eg, stepwise). Subjects entered the analysis at the time of their first sodium measurement, using a counting process approach 22, 23 and person‐time accrued from baseline sodium measurement until the occurrence of death, last VA visit, or the end of follow‐up (December 31, 2014). As expected, the association between sodium and mortality did not meet the proportional hazards assumption, leading us to do a piecewise Cox proportional hazard analysis, with the first time interval covering the first 30 days and the second covering the post–30‐day period. Subjects entered the model at different times within the initial 30‐day period, and we expected them to be less clinically stable during that period, thus having different hazard rates than at later time points. Further assessment of nonproportionality of hazards showed no meaningful deviations. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each period for serum sodium categories, relative to the referent group. We also examined whether the relationship between baseline serum sodium and mortality varied by age. We stratified the analysis by age, categorized as < 65, 65 to 75, and > 75 years.

### Prognostic significance of baseline serum sodium in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114LjguU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between serum sodium at the time of diagnosis and long term clinical outcomes in a large national cohort of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Methods and Results

We studied 25 440 patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction treated at Veterans Affairs medical centers across the United States between 2002 and 2012. Serum sodium at the time of heart failure diagnosis was analyzed as a continuous variable and in categories as follows: low (115.00–134.99 mmol/L), low‐normal (135.00–137.99 mmol/L), referent group (138.00–140.99 mmol/L), high normal (141.00–143.99 mmol/L), and high (144.00–160.00 mmol/L). Multivariable Cox regression and negative binomial regression were performed to estimate hazard ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) and incidence density ratios (95%) for the associations of serum sodium with mortality and hospitalizations (heart failure and all‐cause), respectively. The average age of patients was 70.8 years, 96.2% were male, and 14% were black. Compared with the referent group, low, low‐normal, and high sodium values were associated with 36% (95%, 28%–44%), 6% (95% CI, 1%–12%), and 9% (95% CI, 1%–17%) higher risk of all‐cause mortality, respectively. Low and low‐normal serum sodium were associated with 48% (95%, 10%–100%) and 38% (95% CI, 8%–77%) higher risk of number of days of heart failure hospitalizations per year, and with 44% (95%, 32%–56%) and 18% (95% CI, 10%–27%) higher risk of number of days of all‐cause hospitalizations per year, respectively.

Conclusions

Both elevated and reduced serum sodium, including values currently considered within normal range, are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

### Reduction of dietary sodium to less than 100 mmol in heart failure (SODIUM-HF): an international, open-label, randomised, controlled trial [^1163FC53]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study SODIUM-HF was published by Justin A Ezekowitz and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the SODIUM-HF study, the trial question was: what is the role of dietary intervention to reduce sodium intake in patients with HF? In the SODIUM-HF study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SODIUM-HF study, the population was: 806 patients (268 female, 538 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with chronic HF receiving optimally tolerated medical treatment. The key exclusion criteria were average dietary intake of sodium < 1,500 mg/day; serum sodium < 130 mmol/L; renal failure; hepatic failure; uncontrolled thyroid disorder; uncontrolled AF; hospitalization due to cardiovascular causes in the previous month. In the SODIUM-HF study, the interventions were: n = 397 reduced sodium intake (sodium intake < 1,500 mg/day) n = 409 usual sodium intake (usual care according to local guidelines). In the SODIUM-HF study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in a composite of admission to hospital for cardiovascular causes, emergency department visit for cardiovascular causes, or death from all causes at 12 months (15% vs. 17%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.26). In the SODIUM-HF study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from all causes (6% vs. 4%; HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.6) No significant difference in hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (10% vs. 12%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.24) No significant difference in cardiovascular-related emergency department visits (4% vs. 4%; HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.41). In the SODIUM-HF study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with chronic HF receiving optimally tolerated medical treatment, reduced sodium intake was not superior to usual sodium intake with respect to a composite of admission to hospital for cardiovascular causes, emergency department visit for cardiovascular causes, or death from all causes at 12 months.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^113MJDb8]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Current management practices for hyponatremia (HN) are incompletely understood. The HN Registry has recorded diagnostic measures, utilization, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for eu- or hypervolemic HN. To better understand current practices, we analyzed data from 3087 adjudicated adult patients in the registry with serum sodium concentration of 130mEq/l or less from 225 sites in the United States and European Union. Common initial monotherapy treatments were fluid restriction (35%), administration of isotonic (15%) or hypertonic saline (2%), and tolvaptan (5%); 17% received no active agent. Median (interquartile range) mEq/l serum sodium increases during the first day were as follows: no treatment, 1.0 (0.0–4.0); fluid restriction, 2.0 (0.0–4.0); isotonic saline, 3.0 (0.0–5.0); hypertonic saline, 5.0 (1.0–9.0); and tolvaptan, 4.0 (2.0–9.0). Adjusting for initial serum sodium concentration with logistic regression, the relative likelihoods for correction by 5mEq/l or more (referent, fluid restriction) were 1.60 for hypertonic saline and 2.55 for tolvaptan. At discharge, serum sodium concentration was under 135mEq/l in 78% of patients and 130mEq/l or less in 49%. Overly rapid correction occurred in 7.9%. Thus, initial HN treatment often uses maneuvers of limited efficacy. Despite an association with poor outcomes and availability of effective therapy, most patients with HN are discharged from hospital still hyponatremic. Studies to assess short- and long-term benefits of correction of HN with effective therapies are needed.

### Association between an increase in serum sodium and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients [^113Coo3A]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions

To assess the change of serum sodium during the first 48 hours of ICU admission, we calculated Δ48 hr-[Na], that is, the difference between the mean of serum sodium measurements 24–48 hours after ICU admission (mean-[Na] 24–48 hr) and the first serum sodium measurement at ICU admission ([Na] first) (Δ48 hr-[Na] = mean-[Na] 24–48 hr –[Na] first). Δ48 hr-[Na] was categorized as follows: Δ48 hr-[Na] < –10 mmol/L, Δ48 hr-[Na] ≥ –10 and < –5 mmol/L, Δ48 hr-[Na] ≥ –5 and < 5 mmol/L, Δ48 hr-[Na] ≥ 5 and < 10 mmol/L, and Δ48 hr-[Na] ≥ 10 mmol/L. All sodium definitions are provided in Table 1. If Δ48 hr-[Na] was a positive number, serum sodium had increased during the first 48 hours of ICU admission, and if the Δ48 hr-[Na] was negative, serum sodium had decreased during the first 48 hours of ICU admission. Furthermore, patients were categorized according to their serum sodium at admission [Na] first as severe hyponatremia ([Na] first < 125 mmol/L), mild hyponatremia ([Na] first ≥ 125 and < 135 mmol/L), normonatremia ([Na] first ≥ 135 and < 145 mmol/L), and hypernatremia ([Na] first ≥ 145 mmol/L). To explore the possibility that the association of Δ48 hr-[Na] with in-hospital mortality could be influenced by too rapid change in serum sodium, we assessed velocity of change in serum sodium in the first 48 hours of ICU admission (V max -Δ[Na]). V max -Δ[Na] was defined as the highest velocity of change in serum sodium between [Na] first and any sodium measurement obtained within 48 hours of admission and at least 2 hours after the first serum sodium. V max -Δ[Na] was categorized as follows: < –5.0 mmol/L/24 hr, ≥ –5.0 and < –2.5 mmol/L/24 hr, ≥ –2.5 and < 2.5 mmol/L/24 hr, ≥ 2.5 and < 5.0 mmol/L/24 hr, ≥ 5.0 and < 7.5 mmol/L/24 hr, ≥ 7.5 and < 10.0 mmol/L/24 hr, and ≥ 10.0 mmol/L/24 hr.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — screening test interpretation and patient preparation — relies on combined interpretation of plasma aldosterone concentration, renin activity, and the aldosterone to renin activity ratio as the most accurate and reliable screening approach. Patients with primary aldosteronism typically have suppressed renin activity (< 1 ng/mL/h), most data support that the plasma aldosterone concentration should be at least 10 ng/dL to interpret the test as positive, and the most commonly used aldosterone to renin activity ratio cutoff is 30 (with plasma aldosterone in ng/dL and plasma renin activity in ng/mL/h), although some data support alternative thresholds (20 or 40). Patients should have unrestricted salt intake, serum potassium in the normal range, and ideally, MRA (eg, spironolactone or eplerenone) withdrawn for at least 4 weeks before testing, and additional evaluation may be indicated if the renin activity is suppressed; low screening rates may be due to barriers such as older medication-withdrawal guidance, which has since been disputed by growing evidence supporting screening despite treatment with most medications.

Sodium imbalances are a common occurrence in the emergency department. Although recognition and diagnosis are relatively straightforward, discovering the cause and management should be approached systematically. The most important history items to ascertain is if the patient has symptoms and how long this imbalance has taken to develop. Treatment rapidity depends on severity of symptoms with the most rapid treatment occurring in only the severely symptomatic. Overcorrection has dire consequences and must be approached in a careful and systematic fashion in order to prevent these devastating consequences.

Hyponatremia in cirrhosis — severity and risks — is graded as mild (126–135 mEq/L), moderate (120–125 mEq/L), and severe (< 120 mEq/L). Patients with cirrhosis and serum Na ≤ 130 mEq/L are at increased risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy (odds ratio, 3.4), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS; odds ratio, 3.5), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP; odds ratio, 2.4), with higher in-hospital and waitlist mortality; even patients with modest hyponatremia (serum Na 131–135 mEq/L) may be at increased risk. Mild hyponatremia often does not require specific management apart from monitoring and water restriction, whereas symptomatic hyponatremia, moderate or severe hyponatremia, and imminent liver transplantation (LT) may require specific management.

### Transient alterations in plasma sodium concentrations with NER1006 bowel preparation: an analysis of three phase III, randomized clinical trials [^1134CjX5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current pooled analysis of three phase III, randomized trials indicated that mean and median sodium electrolyte levels were increased in 214 of 1028 (20.8%) patients on the day of colonoscopy (visit 2) following the use of the NER1006 bowel preparation in a variety of administration regimens. However, observed increases in sodium concentration were transient, returning to normal levels within 1 to 3 days post-colonoscopy. The transient increases from baseline in sodium concentrations were small (~ 5 mmol/L) and not considered clinically significant. It is also important to consider baseline sodium levels in order to put these findings into clinical context. In the NOCT trial, more than half of the patients had baseline sodium concentrations above 142 mmol/L, thus requiring only a small increase in sodium concentration to exceed the ULN. However, none of the patients in the NOCT trial with increased sodium levels after NER1006 administration required treatment directed at these modest increases in sodium levels. In all three trials, increased sodium concentrations in the overall populations were not considered to be clinically meaningful.

The minor, transient changes in sodium levels that may occur in some patients treated with NER1006 are considered to be related to the higher quantity of sodium in the second dose versus the first dose of preparation (i.e. 297.6 mmol [3.2 g] vs. 160.9 mmol [2 g]) and not related to patient volume status or dehydration. Of importance to note, elderly patients may be more susceptible to adverse reactions due to electrolyte imbalances. Also, patients with renal impairment or who are receiving concomitant therapies that affect renal function should be advised on the importance of adequate hydration before, during, and after administration of NER1006, and testing for electrolytes may be considered in this population. Although sodium levels increased at ≥ 1 post-baseline visit in 214 patients with normal baseline sodium levels across the three trials, AEs involving hypernatremia were uncommon (0.4%).

- speed of increase in serum sodium concentration

- history of alcohol abuse and/or liver disease

- use of thiazide or antidepressant medications.

Primary aldosteronism — screening methodology and thresholds — relies on the combined interpretation of the plasma aldosterone concentration, renin activity, and aldosterone to renin activity ratio, which is currently the most accurate and reliable means of screening. Patients with primary aldosteronism typically have suppressed renin activity (< 1 ng/mL/h), and most data support that the plasma aldosterone concentration should be at least 10 ng/dL to interpret the test as positive. The most commonly used cutoff value for the aldosterone to renin activity ratio is 30 when plasma aldosterone concentration is reported in ng/dL and plasma renin activity in ng/mL/h, although some data support alternative thresholds (20 or 40). Patients should have unrestricted salt intake, serum potassium in the normal range, and ideally mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy withdrawn for at least 4 weeks before testing.
