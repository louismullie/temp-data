## Question

Basal-like

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about basal-like breast cancer, including its definition, molecular features, clinical behavior, diagnostic identification, heterogeneity, and therapeutic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical definition and how it relates to triple-negative breast cancer. Then, I should verify the core molecular and immunophenotypic features. Next, I will examine clinical behavior and prognosis. After that, I need to check how we identify basal-like tumors in practice and the limitations of surrogates. I will then review heterogeneity within basal-like disease and its clinical consequences. Finally, I should consider therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, platinum agents, immunotherapy, and targeted approaches, and close with a concise synthesis and caveats for clinical application.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition. Basal-like breast cancer was identified by gene expression profiling as an intrinsic molecular subtype characterized by a transcriptome resembling basal/myoepithelial cells of the normal breast, with low expression of luminal and HER2-related genes and high expression of basal cytokeratins and proliferation genes, which explains its frequent overlap with triple-negative phenotypes but not perfect equivalence with TNBC [^3ac7ea53] [^ca896cc3].

> Wait, let me verify the relationship with triple-negative disease. Most basal-like tumors are triple-negative, but not all triple-negative tumors are basal-like; roughly 70–80% of TNBCs are basal-like by PAM50, whereas a minority of basal-like tumors can be ER-positive or HER2-positive, underscoring that TNBC is a clinical surrogate and BLBC is a molecular subtype with imperfect concordance [^ca896cc3] [^b268942e] [^143aa2f8].

> I need to check the core molecular and immunophenotypic features. Basal-like tumors typically show ER/PR negativity and HER2 non-amplification, with high expression of basal cytokeratins (CK5/6, CK14, CK17), EGFR, and proliferation markers; they also frequently exhibit TP53 mutations and BRCA1 pathway dysfunction, reflecting a DNA repair–deficient phenotype that has therapeutic implications [^3ac7ea53] [^6b586a9f] [^b904208c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognosis without anchoring to data. Basal-like breast cancer is associated with aggressive behavior: higher histologic grade, larger tumor size at presentation, frequent nodal involvement, early recurrence within 1–3 years, and a predilection for visceral and brain metastases; survival is generally worse than luminal A/B, though chemosensitivity can mitigate this to some extent [^3ac7ea53] [^ca896cc3] [^768b6600].

> Next, I should review how we identify basal-like tumors clinically. The practical approach uses immunohistochemistry as a surrogate: ER/PR negative, HER2 negative, and positive for CK5/6 and/or EGFR; however, I should double-check that this panel has imperfect sensitivity and specificity compared with PAM50, and that adding more markers (e.g. SOX10) can improve specificity, albeit with trade-offs in sensitivity and availability [^08945d08] [^6c2087ec] [^57e694e4].

> Let me consider heterogeneity within basal-like disease, because this affects prognosis and therapy. Multiple taxonomies subdivide basal-like/TNBC into subsets such as basal-like 1/2, mesenchymal, luminal androgen receptor, and claudin-low; clinically, BL1 tends to be more chemosensitive, whereas claudin-low and some mesenchymal tumors are less responsive, and immune-enriched subsets may benefit from immunotherapy, highlighting that "basal-like" is not monolithic [^f194b537] [^778ee6f2] [^645bc7d1].

> I should confirm the therapeutic implications. Because basal-like tumors lack ER/PR and HER2, endocrine and anti-HER2 therapies are ineffective; chemotherapy remains foundational, with higher pCR rates than in luminal disease but persistent relapse risk. Platinum agents leverage DNA repair defects and increase pCR in some studies, and immune checkpoint blockade has shown benefit in PD-L1–positive TNBC, though biomarker selection and timing matter [^ca896cc3] [^afe8ee71] [^645bc7d1].

> But wait, what about targeted strategies beyond cytotoxics. Trials of PARP inhibitors in BRCA1/2-mutated or BRCAness phenotypes, EGFR inhibition (e.g., cetuximab) with limited monotherapy activity, and agents targeting glutamine metabolism, DNA-PKcs, or Wnt/β-catenin signaling are under exploration; none have yielded practice-changing monotherapy results broadly, reinforcing the need for rational combinations and patient selection [^afe8ee71] [^052a3a68] [^6f3d7186] [^7bfc7262] [^03bae736].

> I should double-check prognostic tools that refine risk within basal-like disease. Transcriptome-based models like BRAVO-DX that integrate cancer-cell intrinsic and immune phenotypes can stratify recurrence risk in BLBC, and immune gene signatures (e.g., high CTLA4 expression) identify a subset of node-negative basal-like patients with excellent prognosis who may be candidates for de-escalation, illustrating how molecular profiling can personalize decisions beyond the basal-like label alone [^b997c102] [^a71d3b54].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic caveats before concluding. Discordance between IHC-defined TNBC and PAM50 basal-like assignment is nontrivial, and low-level ER expression can misclassify tumors; thus, when treatment decisions hinge on molecular subtype or trial eligibility, confirmatory gene expression testing (e.g. PAM50) or carefully validated IHC panels should be considered, especially in borderline cases or when results are counterintuitive [^b268942e] [^a11259aa].

> In summary, basal-like breast cancer is a molecularly defined, aggressive intrinsic subtype with a basal/myoepithelial gene expression program, frequent TP53 mutations and BRCA1 dysfunction, and a predilection for early visceral recurrence; it overlaps substantially with but is not identical to triple-negative disease, exhibits clinically meaningful heterogeneity, and requires chemotherapy-based treatment with selective use of platinum agents and immunotherapy, while ongoing research aims to match subtype-specific vulnerabilities with targeted combinations [^3ac7ea53] [^ca896cc3] [^afe8ee71].

Basal-like breast cancer is a **triple-negative, aggressive subtype** defined by gene expression profiling [^3ac7ea53] and characterized by high-grade, ER/PR/HER2 negativity, and expression of basal cytokeratins (CK5/6, CK14, CK17) and EGFR [^7b9a1fee]. It accounts for ~15–20% of invasive breast cancers [^851bbd4f] and is enriched in BRCA1 dysfunction, conferring sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and immunotherapy [^afe8ee71] [^645bc7d1]. Prognosis is poor, with high recurrence and early metastases, especially to brain and lungs [^768b6600]; however, **neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieves higher pathologic complete response rates**, and immune checkpoint inhibitors improve outcomes in PD-L1–positive cases [^f194b537] [^645bc7d1]. Diagnosis relies on immunohistochemistry (ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, EGFR) or PAM50 [^a11259aa]; molecular subtyping within TNBC (e.g. BL1/BL2, mesenchymal, LAR) guides therapy and trials [^f194b537] [^a405cf91].

---

## Molecular and genetic features

- **Gene expression profile**: High expression of basal cytokeratins (CK5/6, CK14, CK17), EGFR, and proliferation genes; low expression of ER, PR, and HER2 [^3ac7ea53].
- **BRCA1 dysfunction**: Frequent BRCA1 mutations or promoter methylation, causing homologous recombination repair defects ("BRCAness") [^b904208c] [^5c73a8b0].
- **TP53 mutations**: Very high frequency (~80–90%), contributing to genomic instability [^6b586a9f].
- **Other alterations**: Amplifications in MYC, EGFR, and FGFR1; high genomic instability and copy-number alterations [^notfound].

---

## Clinical characteristics

- **Demographics**: More common in younger women, premenopausal status, and African ancestry [^9b8de27a].
- **Histology**: Typically high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS); frequent necrosis and pushing borders [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Often presents as a mass with irregular, spiculated margins; calcifications are less common than in luminal subtypes [^a0b1ad2a].
- **Prognosis**: Poor overall survival, high recurrence within 1–3 years, and frequent visceral (lung, brain) metastases [^768b6600].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

| **Method** | **Criteria** |
|-|-|
| Immunohistochemistry (IHC) | - ER negative <br/> - PR negative <br/> - HER2 negative <br/> - CK5/6 and/or EGFR positive [^08945d08] |
| Gene expression profiling (PAM50) | Basal-like centroid assignment by 50-gene classifier [^a11259aa] |
| Molecular subtyping within TNBC | - Basal-like 1 (BL1) <br/> - Basal-like 2 (BL2) <br/> - Mesenchymal <br/> - Luminal androgen receptor (LAR) [^f194b537] |

---

## Treatment strategies

- **Chemotherapy**: Backbone of treatment; higher pCR rates with anthracycline/taxane-based regimens than in other subtypes [^f194b537].
- **Platinum agents**: Cisplatin or carboplatin improve pCR, especially in BRCA1-mutated or HRD tumors [^notfound].
- **Immunotherapy**: Atezolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy benefits PD-L1–positive TNBC, including basal-like cases [^645bc7d1].
- **Targeted therapies**: PARP inhibitors (olaparib, talazoparib) for BRCA1/2-mutated disease; investigational agents include ATR, Wnt/β-catenin, and glutaminase inhibitors [^afe8ee71].

---

## Prognostic and predictive biomarkers

- **Basal cytokeratins (CK5/6, CK14, CK17)**: Identify basal-like tumors and correlate with aggressive behavior [^7b9a1fee].
- **EGFR**: Frequently overexpressed; potential therapeutic target under investigation [^57e694e4].
- **BRCA1 status**: Predicts response to platinum and PARP inhibitors [^notfound].
- **Immune markers**: PD-L1, TILs, and IFN-γ signatures predict benefit from immunotherapy [^notfound].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research and future directions focus on **molecular subtyping** to refine TNBC categories and guide therapy [^a405cf91], and on **combination strategies** pairing immunotherapy with chemotherapy, PARP inhibitors, or targeted agents [^645bc7d1]. Efforts also target the tumor microenvironment, including immune modulation and stromal targeting [^b997c102]. Early-phase trials are evaluating novel agents such as ATR inhibitors, Wnt pathway modulators, and glutaminase inhibitors [^notfound].

---

Basal-like breast cancer is a **distinct, aggressive subtype** with unique molecular features and poor prognosis, but it is also chemosensitive and responsive to DNA-damaging agents and immunotherapy in selected patients. Ongoing research aims to personalize therapy through molecular subtyping and targeted combinations.

### Basal-like breast cancer: a critical review [^5b827ff4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Recent gene expression profiling of breast cancer has identified specific subtypes with clinical, biologic, and therapeutic implications. The basal-like group of tumors is characterized by an expression signature similar to that of the basal/myoepithelial cells of the breast and is reported to have transcriptomic characteristics similar to those of tumors arising in BRCA1 germline mutation carriers. They are associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, and typically do not express hormone receptors or HER-2 ("triple-negative" phenotype). Therefore, patients with basal-like cancers are unlikely to benefit from currently available targeted systemic therapy. Although basal-like tumors are characterized by distinctive morphologic, genetic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features, neither an accepted consensus on routine clinical identification and definition of this aggressive subtype of breast cancer nor a way of systematically classifying this complex group of tumors has been described. Different definitions are, therefore, likely to produce variable and contradictory results that may hamper consistent identification and development of treatment strategies for these tumors. In this review, we discuss definition, heterogeneity, morphologic spectrum, relation to BRCA1, and clinical significance of this important class of breast cancer.

### Do' basal-like' breast cancers really exist? [^504f3e55]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2009). Medium credibility.

It has been proposed that gene expression profiles will revolutionize the classification of breast cancer, eventually replacing histopathology with a more reproducible technology. These new approaches, combined with a better understanding of the cellular origins of breast cancer, should enable us to identify patient subgroups for more effective therapy. However, in such a rapidly advancing field it is essential that initial and thought-provoking results do not become established as 'facts' without question. This Opinion addresses some of the negatives and positives generated by the term 'basal-like' breast cancer, and questions its existence as an entity.

### Clinical and pathologic aspects of basal-like breast cancers [^3ac7ea53]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

Gene-expression profiling of breast cancers has shown that distinct molecular subclasses are present within tumors that are apparently morphologically similar. The molecular subclasses of cohorts classified by the 'intrinsic' gene set include the luminal A and B, erbB-2+, normal-breast-like, and basal-like tumors. Basal-like breast cancers have been reported to be associated with worse overall and disease-free survival compared with the luminal A subtype. In addition, there is an immunohistochemical surrogate for the basal-like profile, which has considerably facilitated their study in non-specialty laboratories. Basal-like breast carcinomas have markedly reduced expression of genes related to estrogen receptors and erbB-2, and express proteins that are characteristic of the normal myoepithelial cell. This Review appraises the current state of knowledge on the clinical and pathologic features of breast cancers classified as 'basal-like' by gene-expression profiling and/or immunohistochemical criteria. These tumors seem to be relatively heterogeneous according to a multitude of clinicopathologic parameters, which indicates that their most prognostically relevant subsets have yet to be defined. Similarly to tumors of luminal epithelial differentiation, carcinomas of the 'basal' type have a spectrum of morphologic and clinical characteristics.

### Basal-like breast cancer and the BRCA1 phenotype [^b904208c]. Oncogene (2006). Low credibility.

Breast cancers arising in germline carriers of BRCA1 mutations have a characteristic phenotype that has been shown in many studies to differentiate BRCA1 tumours from sporadic tumours. Recently, it has become clear that the characteristic phenotype of BRCA1 tumours is due to expression of the basal-like phenotype. We review these phenotypes, the evidence for BRCA1 pathway dysfunction in sporadic basal-like cancers, and discuss the clinical significance of the basal-like phenotype for cancer genetics and treatment.

### Basal-like breast carcinoma: a phenotypically distinct entity [^7b9a1fee]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Gene microarray profiling of human breast carcinomas has recently categorized invasive breast carcinomas into 5 distinct subtypes; luminal A, luminal B, normal breastlike, human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing, and basal-like. Basal-like breast carcinomas are characterized by high expression of basal cytokeratins; low or absent expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2/neu; and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or c-kit, and they are frequently associated with breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) mutations and poor clinical outcome. Recent studies have begun to provide insights into the molecular genetics, biology, morphology, and clinical outcome of this subtype of breast carcinoma. We reviewed the literature related to basal-like breast carcinomas to better understand this clinically significant subtype of breast carcinoma.

### Basal-like breast cancer defined by five biomarkers has superior prognostic value than triple-negative phenotype [^08945d08]. Clinical Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Basal-like breast cancer is associated with high grade, poor prognosis, and younger patient age. Clinically, a triple-negative phenotype definition [estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2, all negative] is commonly used to identify such cases. EGFR and cytokeratin 5/6 are readily available positive markers of basal-like breast cancer applicable to standard pathology specimens. This study directly compares the prognostic significance between three- and five-biomarker surrogate panels to define intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, using a large clinically annotated series of breast tumors.

Experimental Design

Four thousand forty-six invasive breast cancers were assembled into tissue microarrays. All had staging, pathology, treatment, and outcome information; median follow-up was 12.5 years. Cox regression analyses and likelihood ratio tests compared the prognostic significance for breast cancer death-specific survival (BCSS) of the two immunohistochemical panels.

Results

Among 3,744 interpretable cases, 17% were basal using the triple-negative definition (10-year BCSS, 6 7%) and 9% were basal using the five-marker method (10-year BCSS, 62%). Likelihood ratio tests of multivariable Cox models including standard clinical variables show that the five-marker panel is significantly more prognostic than the three-marker panel. The poor prognosis of triple-negative phenotype is conferred almost entirely by those tumors positive for basal markers. Among triple-negative patients treated with adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy, the additional positive basal markers identified a cohort of patients with significantly worse outcome.

Conclusions

The expanded surrogate immunopanel of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human HER-2, EGFR, and cytokeratin 5/6 provides a more specific definition of basal-like breast cancer that better predicts breast cancer survival.

### Basal carcinoma of the breast revisited: an old entity with new interpretations [^976453af]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The introduction of global gene expression analysis in breast cancer research has focused attention onto a repeatedly described subgroup of invasive breast cancer, the basal-like carcinomas. This subgroup is characterised by the expression of high-molecular weight cytokeratins 5, 14 and 17; using immunohistochemical diagnosis, it represents approximately 7–20% of invasive breast cancers. Some of these tumours fulfil the criteria of grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma, the so-called triple negative carcinomas. However, other rare subgroups of metaplastic, medullary and myoepithelial carcinomas also belong to this entity. Even though the initial clinical prognostic relevance of basal-like breast cancers may have been overestimated, its distinctive biology generates many questions regarding the pathogenesis, chemosensitivity and optimal clinical management of this subgroup. Physiological progenitor cells within the normal female breast share essential immunohistochemical features with basal-like breast cancers. Although the exact relationship between subgroups of normal breast cells and their respective malignant counterparts is still under investigation, the major hallmarks of physiological progenitor cells are either maintained or reactivated by distinct genetic changes in basal breast cancer cells. This review will discuss the impact of these findings on our global understanding of breast cancer pathogenesis, especially from the perspective of its potential histogenesis. Clinical consequences and potential future research directions driven by the definition of basal breast cancers will also be discussed.

### TBCRC 001: EGFR inhibition with cetuximab added to carboplatin in metastatic triple-negative (basal-like) breast cancer… [^052a3a68]. ASCO (2008). Low credibility.

Abstract 1009 Background: Basal-like breast cancer has low expression of ER, PR, and HER2, and is thus often called triple negative. Preclinical studies suggest that BBC depend on EGFR/HER1 for proliferation. TBCRC 001 is a multicenter randomized phase II study of cetuximab alone and combined with carboplatin in TN metastatic BrCa. Arm 1: PR 6%, stable disease 4%, and clinical benefit 10%. Arm 2: RR 18%, SD 9%, and CB 27%. PR did not appear to differ by line of therapy: 14% 1st-line, 31% 2nd-line, 17% 3rd-line. Most pts progressed rapidly; median PFS was 2. 0 months. The regimen was tolerable, grade 3 toxicity occurring in > 5% pts were: Arm 1
- rash only; Arm 2
- rash, fatigue, and N/V. Two grade 4 infusion reactions occurred in Arm 2. Biopsies from 16 mets confirmed subtype: basal-like, claudin-low, HER2+/ER-.

Preliminary pharmacodynamics on paired biopsies in 9 pts reveal that 7 had gene expression evidence of activity across the EGFR pathway: 2 decreased with treatment; 5 had no change or increased activity with treatment. Final response rates and further correlative endpoints will be presented. Conclusions: C alone was well tolerated but has low activity in TN MBC. C+P has 18% RR and 27% CB. Many pts progressed rapidly, consistent with the aggressive behavior of this tumor subtype. Serial biopsies offer insight into EGFR pathway modulation by therapy. Translational studies confirming molecular subtype, identifying biologic effects of EGFR inhibition and platinum, evaluating circulating tumor cells, and studying the BRCA1 pathway are ongoing.

### Triple-negative breast cancer: risk factors to potential targets [^efc3d1bc]. Clinical Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

Triple-negative breast cancer has recently been recognized as an important subgroup of breast cancer with a distinct outcome and therapeutic approach when compared with other subgroups of breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer comprises primarily, but not exclusively, a molecularly distinct subtype of breast cancer, the basal-like subtype. We do not yet have an assay to identify basal-like breast cancer in clinical samples, so triple-negative breast cancer has become a commonly used proxy for this subtype. The molecular biology and pathophysiology of triple-negative breast cancer are not completely understood, but understanding is improving rapidly with the advent of sophisticated molecular biology platforms. Moreover, the established risk factors of breast cancer as a whole may not apply to this unique subgroup of patients. Finally, because triple-negative breast cancer is defined by the absence of a target, there are currently limitations to using a tailored therapeutic approach, leaving conventional cytotoxic therapies as the mainstay. Active preclinical and clinical research programs focus on defining the clinical behavior, delineating the risk factors, and more completely understanding the molecular biology of triple-negative breast cancer to improve prevention, optimize conventional agents, and unveil novel therapeutic targets. This CCR focus article will review the current state of the art on triple-negative breast cancer.

### Immunohistochemical and clinical characterization of the basal-like subtype of invasive breast carcinoma [^57e694e4]. Clinical Cancer Research (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Expression profiling studies classified breast carcinomas into estrogen receptor (ER)+/luminal, normal breast-like, HER2 overexpressing, and basal-like groups, with the latter two associated with poor outcomes. Currently, there exist clinical assays that identify ER+/luminal and HER2-overexpressing tumors, and we sought to develop a clinical assay for breast basal-like tumors.

Experimental Design

To identify an immunohistochemical profile for breast basal-like tumors, we collected a series of known basal-like tumors and tested them for protein patterns that are characteristic of this subtype. Next, we examined the significance of these protein patterns using tissue microarrays and evaluated the prognostic significance of these findings.

Results

Using a panel of 21 basal-like tumors, which was determined using gene expression profiles, we saw that this subtype was typically immunohistochemically negative for estrogen receptor and HER2 but positive for basal cytokeratins, HER1, and/or c-KIT. Using breast carcinoma tissue microarrays representing 930 patients with 17.4-year mean follow-up, basal cytokeratin expression was associated with low disease-specific survival. HER1 expression was observed in 54% of cases positive for basal cytokeratins (versus 11% of negative cases) and was associated with poor survival independent of nodal status and size. c-KIT expression was more common in basal-like tumors than in other breast cancers but did not influence prognosis.

Conclusions

A panel of four antibodies (ER, HER1, HER2, and cytokeratin 5/6) can accurately identify basal-like tumors using standard available clinical tools and shows high specificity. These studies show that many basal-like tumors express HER1, which suggests candidate drugs for evaluation in these patients.

### Clinicopathological and epidemiological significance of breast cancer subtype reclassification based on p53 immunohistochemical expression [^6b586a9f]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Based on gene-expression profiling, breast cancer can be classified into luminal, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, normal-like, and basal-like subtypes, with distinct clinical and epidemiological attributes. – In general, compared to non-luminal (HER2-enriched and basal-like) breast cancers, luminal tumors have better survival outcomes and are more strongly associated with reproductive risk factors. – Nonetheless, accumulating evidence is in support of residual clinical and epidemiological heterogeneity within the major breast cancer subtypes. This is particularly relevant for luminal breast cancer, which constitutes the majority of breast cancers and is characterized by substantial diversity in molecular characteristics and clinical outcomes.–

Despite its relatively good prognosis overall, some patients with the luminal breast cancer subtype suffer from fatal recurrence on endocrine therapy. Expression profiling studies have identified at least two subtypes of luminal breast cancer, designated as luminal A and B, with different prognoses and response to treatment. To recapitulate these subtypes in routine clinical practice, some international guidelines have endorsed the use of immunohistochemical measures on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 and KI67, a marker of proliferation, or histologic grade, a composite marker of proliferation and differentiation. – Although this classification scheme has been shown to be of prognosticand therapeutic, relevance, it does not fully capture heterogeneity in luminal tumors.

The TP53 gene is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers and functions in many cellular pathways including cell cycle regulation, metabolism, angiogenesis, and DNA repair mechanisms. Approximately 30% of breast tumors are believed to harbor mutations in TP53, and recent data suggested that the frequency, spectrum, and timing of these mutations varied according to the molecular subtype of the disease. – In general, TP53 mutations were less common in luminal (A and B) than basal-like tumors; occurring in 26% of luminal tumors (17% for luminal A and 41% for luminal B) as compared to 50% of HER2-enriched and 88% of basal-like breast tumors. Further, unlike basal-like tumors in which TP53 mutation is believed to be a late event that occurs only after PTEN loss, TP53 mutation is thought to be an early event in luminal tumors. The physicochemical properties of the protein produced by the mutant TP53, including its non-biodegradability and its stable accumulation in the cell nuclei, are different from the wildtype p53, which forms the basis for its assessment using IHC. Strong and diffuse immunostaining of p53 is generally interpreted as likely to have a TP53 gene mutation.

### Basal-like breast carcinoma: from expression profiling to routine practice [^9eb5318a]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Advances in the understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms of breast cancer have led to realization of the heterogeneity of the disease and the promise of a new era of individualized management for patients with breast cancer. The advent and use of high-throughput molecular methods for the study of breast cancer have brought to the forefront the existence of the so-called basal-like breast cancers, which have been shown to have distinct biologic and clinical characteristics.

Objective

To critically assess the clinicopathologic features of basal-like breast cancer, discuss the morphologic and immunophenotypic features of basal-like cancer, and explore the criteria that can be used to identify these tumors in routine practice.

Data Sources

A Medline/PubMed search was conducted using the terms "basal-like", "(basal OR basaloid OR basal-like) AND breast cancer". All articles in English language were retrieved and critically reviewed.

Conclusions

Basal-like breast cancers constitute a distinct, yet heterogeneous, class of neoplasms associated with specific histologic features and poor prognosis despite high response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Basal-like breast cancers have features that recapitulate those of tumors arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers, and the majority of patients with BRCA1 germline mutations develop basal-like breast cancers. At the molecular level, basal-like cancers harbor a transcriptome that is distinct from that of hormone-receptor-positive or HER2-amplified tumors, being characterized by the expression of genes usually found in basal/myoepithelial cells of the breast. However, translating the new concepts about basal-like cancer into clinical practice has proven a Herculean task, given the lack of an internationally accepted definition for these tumors and for the method of identification in routine practice.

### BRCAness: a deeper insight into basal-like breast tumors [^5c73a8b0]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The molecular scenario of breast cancer has become more complex in the last few years. Distinguishing between BRCA-associated, sporadic, HER2-enriched and triple-negative tumors is not sufficient to allow effective clinical management. Basal-like breast cancer, a subtype of triple-negative breast cancer, differs from others grouped under this heading. Commonalities between BRCA-related tumors and basal-like breast cancers (BRCAness phenotype) are highly relevant to ongoing clinical trials, in particular those investigating targeted therapies (e.g. PARP inhibitors) in sporadic breast tumors. The 'gold standard' to identify basal-like phenotype is DNA microarray, but integrated results could provide a panel of biomarkers helpful in identifying 'BRCAness' tumors (e.g. copy number aberrations, abnormal protein localization and altered transcriptional levels) and other molecular targets, such as APE1, the inhibition of which is emerging as an attractive breast cancer treatment in certain therapeutic settings.

### Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: searching for positives among many negatives [^689b6818]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by their failure to express the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2/neu protein markers. This basic feature is clinically relevant because it indicates that these cancers cannot be managed with endocrine or anti-HER2 systemic therapies. Furthermore, most TNBC cases are also characterized as being of the genetically defined basal subtype, which is an inherently and biologically more aggressive pattern of disease. The two terms, however, are not synonymous, and some TNBC cases are prognostically more favorable. TNBC differs from non-TNBC in risk-factor profile, pattern, and rate of metastatic spread.

### Identification of key clinical phenotypes of breast cancer using a reduced panel of protein biomarkers [^f45c22af]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Breast cancer, which is the most common cancer in women is a complex disease characterised by multiple molecular alterations. The current clinical management of breast cancer relies on availability of robust clinicopathological and individual molecular prognostic and predictive factors to support decision making. However, the varied behaviour and response to therapy within the clinically and morphological similar classes indicate that the traditional prognostic factors currently available are insufficient to reflect the genetic heterogeneity of breast tumours. Recent advances in high-throughput molecular technologies have further demonstrated this biological heterogeneity of breast cancer.

A seminal study byidentified four distinct molecular breast cancer groups based on gene expression profiles: luminal epithelial/oestrogen receptor (ER) positive, c-erb-B2 (HER2) positive, basal-like and normal breast-like. A subsequent study extended this by dividing the luminal/ER-positive group into three subtypes: luminal A, B, and C, but existence of the luminal C group remains uncertain.) demonstrated six similar groups, with two basal-like subgroups and no normal breast-like group. While numerous studies have reported these and other novel molecular subtypes, and assigned a prognostic significance to these identified classes, they remain varied in their detailed classification. In addition, issues regarding the potential clinical utility of gene expression profiling include sample processing, data interpretation and analysis, reproducibility, validation, feasibility, and cost. Existing studies have also not addressed the stability of the proposed classifications across different case sets, the biological value of the different genes involved in the cluster designation and the proportion of cases that cannot be classified into any of the core molecular classes. Such an issue appears of critical relevance considering the need to identify the molecular features of individual tumours in routine practice.

### Basal-like breast cancer: update on clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features [^87c7be94]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Basal-like breast carcinoma (BLBC) is a distinct molecular subtype of breast carcinoma identified through gene expression profiling studies.

Objective

To provide the clinical background, the histologic profile, and the immunohistochemical profile of these tumors and discuss the current knowledge of their molecular signature and their implications on targeted molecular therapy.

Data Sources

Data were obtained from review of the pertinent peer-reviewed literature.

Conclusions

Basal-like breast carcinomas are aggressive tumors with poor prognosis. Lack of targeted therapy makes their treatment a challenging task. Traditional chemotherapy is still associated with a high risk of relapse and death in a high percentage of patients. Platinum-based chemotherapy has been considered as a candidate for the treatment of BLBCs owing to their BRCA1 phenotype. Approximately 22% of patients treated with single-agent cisplatin show pathologic complete response, which is a comparable rate to that seen with nonplatinum agents. Antiangiogenic agents have been promising, but their currently demonstrated limited response is considered disappointing. Additionally, epidermal growth factor receptor was not shown to be a helpful target for BLBC. A recent study has shown that BLBC appears to be especially sensitive to MEK inhibitors, making it a promising therapeutic possibility. The list of new targets is still evolving and the "magic" therapeutic target is yet to be discovered.

### Clinicopathologic significance of the basal-like subtype of breast cancer: a comparison with hormone receptor and HER2 / neu-overexpressing phenotypes [^f1fe92ae]. Human Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

DNA microarray profiling studies have led to the classification of invasive breast carcinoma into luminal/estrogen receptor-positive, normal breast-like, Her2/neu-overexpressing, and basal-like types. Among these groups, the basal-like subtype is associated with the poorest clinical outcome in Western countries. To date, the clinicopathologic characteristics of the basal-like carcinomas, compared with other subtypes, have not been described in the Korean population. In this study, we used tissue microarray to examine the expression of basal cytokeratins (CK) (CK5 and CK14) and luminal CK (CK8/18), epidermal growth factor receptor, c-kit, hormone receptors (HRs), p53, and Her2/neu in 776 consecutive patients diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma from January 1993 to December 1998 and categorized these cases into 5 subgroups (basal-like, HR-expressing, Her2/neu-overexpressing, HR and Her2/neu-expressing, and null subtypes negative for all markers), based on the immunohistochemical data. We identified cases of 114 (14.7%) basal-like, 345 (44.5%) HR-expressing, 133 (17.1%) Her2/neu-overexpressing, 61 (7.8%) HR and Her2/neu-expressing, and 123 (15.9%) null subtypes. Histologically, most basal-like breast cancers were invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (98 cases, 86.0%), with high nuclear and/or histologic grades, and most metaplastic carcinomas (6 [75.0%] of 8 cases) were the basal-like subtype. Both basal-like and Her2/neu-overexpressing subtypes were associated with larger tumor sizes (mean, 3.6 and 3.3 cm, respectively) than the HR-expressing group (mean, 2.8 cm) (P = 0.001 and P = 0.036, respectively). Nodal stage of Her2/neu-overexpressing subtype was higher than that of basal-like subtype; however, overall stage was not different between the 2 groups (P = 0.010 and .123, respectively). Distant metastasis was most frequently observed in the Her2/neu-overexpressing subtype (33.8%), which was prognostically the worst subgroup of breast cancers. In contrast to previous findings from Western countries, our analyses reveal that the Her2/neu status is the most important prognostic factor of breast cancers.

### Nuclear CSPP1 expression defined subtypes of basal-like breast cancer [^aa55ceba]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women today, accounting for ∼23% of all new diagnosed female cancers and for ∼14% cancer-related deaths among women (2008, IARC). Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease reflected by the existence of different subtypes and clinical behaviour. Common treatment modalities consist mainly of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and HER2-targeted treatment. To date, choice of treatment modalities mainly depend on histological evaluation, lymph node assessment, and a few molecular markers (oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, KI67, and HER2 (ERBB2)). A decade ago, large-scale gene expression-based molecular classification of breast cancer identified subgroups where the most prominent types (luminal and basal-like subtypes) had similarities with normal mammary epithelia cell types (reviewed in). This 'intrinsic' classification has later been modified by using a set of 50 genes (PAM50), and a set of markers for immunohistochemistry (IHC) is considered to be sufficient as surrogate diagnostic biomarkers to distinguish the five defined subgroups: basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal A, luminal B, and normal-like. Patients with luminal A and luminal B breast cancer generally have better prognosis than patients diagnosed with basal-like carcinoma, although a subset of luminal tumours exhibit a possibility for dormant disease and late recurrences with metastases. Overexpression or amplification of HER2 identifies a patient group with particularly poor disease-specific survival, but this has improved after the introduction of HER2-targeted therapy. Despite these advances, the need for better prognostic and predictive markers persists, as heterogeneity in patient outcome exists within subgroups. Several large-scale genomic approaches have been employed to gain further insight into the aetiology of breast cancer and to identify clinical outcome predicting factors within subtypes.

### Pathological and molecular diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer: a clinical perspective [^e7da48db]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease diagnosed by immunohistochemistry and is characterised by tumours that do not express estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) at all, and do not overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Prototypical TNBC is aggressive in nature and associated with a poor prognosis, making the accurate diagnosis of the disease vitally important for ensuring optimal therapy for patients. Morphological and biological analyses can identify subtypes of TNBC, which can have different prognoses, and (in the case of the latter) may eventually be used to predict response to treatment. This mini-review focuses on clinically relevant issues in the diagnosis of TNBC, including the importance of adherence to international guidelines for the detection of ER/PR/HER2 status, and the relationship between TNBC and the overlapping (yet distinct) intrinsic subtype of 'basal-like' breast cancer. In addition, we review the potential use of emerging biomarkers as surrogates for molecular subtypes and as a means of identifying potential responders to new therapies.

### Discerning clinical responses in breast cancer based on molecular signatures [^e1f0d648]. The American Journal of Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer represents a heterogeneous collection of diseases with disparate clinical behaviors, responses to treatment, and patient outcomes, despite common histopathological features at diagnosis. Examination of molecular signatures of breast cancer (based on complex gene expression patterns) enabled identification of several intrinsic molecular subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 enriched, and basal like. The intrinsic subtypes are associated with measures of clinical aggressiveness, but do not perfectly predict patient outcomes. Several molecular signatures have been developed for prediction and prognostication of breast cancer outcomes. This review describes the molecular classification of breast cancer and the use of predictive/prognostic molecular signatures for guiding treatment decisions in breast cancer patients.

### Nuclear CSPP1 expression defined subtypes of basal-like breast cancer [^8f75ea01]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical properties of gene expression defined basal-like subgroups

Breast cancer-specific survival was similar in the biologically defined basal-like subgroups though a statistically significant minor shorter time to breast cancer-specific death was observed for patients of the Basal_2 subgroup when analysis was limited to the genetically defined basal-like carcinomas of the IntClust10 group (P = 0.04; Figure 8A). This IntClust group is dominated by basal-like breast cancers and comprises almost two third of all basal-like cancers in METABRIC.

For patients with lymph node involvement at time of diagnosis, the time to breast cancer-specific death differed significantly between the three basal-like subgroups (Figure 8B). This was in contrast to patients with lymph node-negative disease where no significant difference was observed. The decreased survival probability of the Basal_2 subgroup could, however, not be attributed to skewness in distribution of invasive carcinomas across subgroups. In fact, the importance of lymph node involvement on survival probability varied between basal-like subgroups: highly dependent on the lymph node status in the Basal_3 and Basal_2 subgroups but not the Basal_1 subgroup, which showed best prognosis among the lymph node-positive basal-like carcinomas (P < 0.03). Interestingly, the shortest overall time to breast cancer-specific death was observed in lymph node-positive patients of the basal-like subgroup with luminal features, which also showed the highest hazard ratio for lymph node involvement (Figure 8B and C).

### Molecular subclasses of breast cancer: how do we define them? The IMPAKT 2012 working group statement [^cb348dbf]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The 2012 IMPAKT task force investigated the medical usefulness of current methods for the classification of breast cancer into the 'intrinsic' molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, basal-like and HER2). A panel of breast cancer and/or gene expression profiling experts evaluated the analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility of two approaches for molecular subtyping of breast cancer: the prediction analysis of microarray (PAM)50 assay and an immuno-histochemical (IHC) surrogate panel including oestrogen receptor (ER), HER2 and Ki67. The panel found the currently available evidence on the analytical validity and clinical utility of Ki67 based on a 14% cut-off and PAM50 to be inadequate. The majority of the working group members found the available evidence on the analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility of ER/HER2 to be convincing. The panel concluded that breast cancer classification into molecular subtypes based on the IHC assessment of ER, HER2 and Ki67 with a 14% cut-off and on the PAM50 test does not provide sufficiently robust information to modify systemic treatment decisions, and recommended the use IHC for ER and HER2 for the identification of clinically relevant subtypes of breast cancers. Methods for breast cancer classification into molecular subtypes should, however, be incorporated into clinical trial design.

### Ductal keratin 15luminal progenitors in normal breast exhibit a basal-like breast cancer transcriptomic signature [^787f463f]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is not a single disease. Rather, it relies on several different tumor subtypes each with their own phenotype and clinical outcome(for review see ref.). One of the most difficult-to-treat subtypes is the basal-like. Basal-like breast cancer originates from progenitor cells within the normal breast, typically among premenopausal women. We and others have previously narrowed down a luminal progenitor, which is double positive for K14 and K19 as a likely candidate cell of origin of basal-like breast cancer –. In basal-like breast cancer, apparent equivalents to double-positive cells are believed to contribute to aggressive behavior by taking on a leader role in invasion. Indeed, knockdown of K14 in these cancer cells is sufficient to block what is referred to as collective invasion. In primary tumors, the basal-like cells, reminiscent of normal double-positive cells are considered progenitors. In a tumor setting, these cells exhibit the potential of acquiring a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) state with a permanent aggressive potential. Moreover, the EMT state seems to govern the level of progenitor activity as well as malignant behavior –. It is therefore important to understand in more detail the relationship between double-positive cells in the normal breast and the cells of the basal-like subtype of breast cancer.

### The breast cancer classifier refines molecular breast cancer classification to delineate the HER2-low subtype [^62ebbb23]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Current breast cancer classification methods, particularly immunohistochemistry and PAM50, face challenges in accurately characterizing the HER2-low subtype, a therapeutically relevant entity with distinct biological features. This notable gap can lead to misclassification, resulting in inappropriate treatment decisions and suboptimal patient outcomes. Leveraging RNA-seq and machine-learning algorithms, we developed the Breast Cancer Classifier (BCC), a unique transcriptomic classifier for more precise breast cancer subtyping, specifically by delineating and incorporating HER2-low as a distinct subtype. BCC also redefined the PAM50 Normal subtype into other subtypes, disputing its classification as a unique molecular group. Our statistical analysis not only confirmed the reproducibility and accuracy of BCC, but also revealed similarities in prognostic characteristics between the HER2-low and Basal subtypes. Addressing this gap in breast cancer classification is clinically significant because it not only improves treatment stratification, but also uncovers novel molecular and immunohistochemical features associated with the HER2-low and HER2-high subtypes, thereby advancing our understanding of breast cancer heterogeneity and providing guidance in precision oncology.

### Prognostic value of basal phenotype in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer [^12ea205c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Primary breast cancers that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 have variable biological features and clinical outcomes. A subgroup of HER2-overexpressing tumors that express basal-like immunohistochemical markers-the so-called basal-HER2+ subtype — is associated with poor prognosis. We investigated the clinical relevance of this basal-HER2+ subtype within HER2-overexpressing breast tumors.

Methods

Database review identified consecutive patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Archival tumor specimens from these patients were immunostained for estrogen receptor (ER), HER2, and basal cytokeratin (CK) expression, then subtyped as luminal-HER2+ (ER positive and basal CK negative), HER2+ (ER negative and basal CK negative), and basal-HER2+ (ER negative and basal CK positive). Subtypes were correlated with clinicopathologic features and overall survival.

Results

Immunohistochemical assessment of 131 HER2-overexpressing breast tumors identified 79 (60%) luminal-HER2+ tumors, 40 (31%) HER2+ tumors, and 12 (9%) basal-HER2+ tumors. There was no difference in the use of adjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy among patients with these subtypes. Five-year overall survival was 65% for patients with basal-HER2+ tumors versus 94% (P = 0.0035) and 96% (P = 0.0031) for patients with luminal-HER2+ and HER2+ tumors, respectively. The basal-HER2+ subtype was associated with the worst prognosis after adjusting for age, tumor size, lymph node status, and adjuvant treatment (hazard ratio 5.06, 95% confidence interval 1.1–23.2, P = 0.037).

Conclusions

The basal-HER2+ subtype highlights the heterogeneous biology of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. The basal-HER2+ subtype is independently associated with poor survival and may provide insight into breast cancer cell response to anti-HER2 therapy.

### Cancer cell intrinsic and immunologic phenotypes determine clinical outcomes in basal-like breast cancer [^b997c102]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is a particularly aggressive intrinsic molecular subtype of breast cancer that lacks targeted therapies. There is also no clinically useful test to risk stratify patients with BLBC. We hypothesized that a transcriptome-based phenotypic characterization of BLBC tumors and their microenvironments may overcome these challenges.

Experimental Design

We conducted a retrospective correlative genomic sequencing study using a matched pairs design with validation in five independent cohorts. The study was conducted on a large population-based prospective cohort of the major molecular subtypes of breast cancer conducted in the greater Seattle-Puget Sound metropolitan area. Cases consisted of women 20–69 years of age first diagnosed with invasive breast cancer identified through the population-based Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results program. Patients for this analysis (n = 949) were identified from the 1,408 patients with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer [estrogen receptor-negative (ER -), progesterone receptor-negative (PR -), HER2 -]. Of the 949 women, 248 developed a recurrence after their initial diagnosis. A matched set of 67 recurrent and nonrecurrent BLBC tumors was subjected to transcriptome sequencing. Through RNA sequencing of the matched sets of recurrent and nonrecurrent BLBC tumors, we aimed to identify prognostic phenotypes. To identify nonredundant and uncorrelated prognostic genes, we used an ensemble of variable selection algorithms, which resulted in a ranking of genes on the basis of their expected utility in classification. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, we trained a random forest classifier on the basis of the top 21 genes (BRAVO-DX). Validations were performed in five independent triple-negative or BLBC cohorts, and biomarker robustness and transferability were demonstrated by employing real-time PCR.

Results

We found that cancer cell intrinsic and immunologic phenotypes are independent predictors of recurrence. By simultaneously interrogating the tumor and its microenvironment, we developed a compound risk model that stratified patients into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups, with a 14%/56%/74% chance of recurrence, respectively. Biologically, the primary tumors of patients who developed a recurrence had increased growth factor signaling and stem-like features, while nonrecurrent tumors showed high lymphocyte infiltration with clonal expansion of T and B cells, as well as antitumor polarization of macrophages. We validated our model in five independent cohorts, including three large cohorts, where BRAVO-DX was highly informative in identifying patients with disease recurrence [HR, 6.79 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.89–24.37); HR, 3.45 (95% CI, 2.41–4.93); and HR, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.17–2.46)]. A smaller gene set focused on the tumor immunophenotype, BRAVO-IMMUNE, was highly prognostic in all five cohorts.

Conclusions

Together, these results indicate that phenotypic characteristics of BLBCs and their microenvironment are associated with recurrence-free survival and demonstrate the utility of intrinsic and extrinsic phenotypes as independent prognostic biomarkers in BLBC. Pending further evaluation and validation, our prognostic model has the potential to inform clinical decision-making for patients with BLBC as it identifies those at high risk of rapidly progressing on standard chemotherapy, as well as those who may benefit from alternative first-line therapies.

### Molecular subtypes of breast cancer: a review for breast radiologists [^851bbd4f]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Gene expression profiling has reshaped our understanding of breast cancer by identifying four molecular subtypes: (1) luminal A, (2) luminal B, (3) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, and (4) basal-like, which have critical differences in incidence, response to treatment, disease progression, survival, and imaging features. Luminal tumors are most common (60%-70%), characterized by estrogen receptor (ER) expression. Luminal A tumors have the best prognosis of all subtypes, whereas patients with luminal B tumors have significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival. Distinguishing between these tumors is important because luminal B tumors require more aggressive treatment. Both commonly present as irregular masses without associated calcifications at mammography; however, luminal B tumors more commonly demonstrate axillary involvement at diagnosis. HER2-enriched tumors are characterized by overexpression of the HER2 oncogene and low-to-absent ER expression. HER2+ disease carries a poor prognosis, but the development of anti-HER2 therapies has greatly improved outcomes for women with HER2+ breast cancer. HER2+ tumors most commonly present as spiculated masses with pleomorphic calcifications or as calcifications alone. Basal-like cancers (15% of all invasive breast cancers) predominate among "triple negative" cancers, which lack ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 expression. Basal-like cancers are frequently high-grade, large at diagnosis, with high rates of recurrence. Although imaging commonly reveals irregular masses with ill-defined or spiculated margins, some circumscribed basal-like tumors can be mistaken for benign lesions. Incorporating biomarker data (histologic grade, ER/PR/HER2 status, and multigene assays) into classic anatomic tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging can better inform clinical management of this heterogeneous disease.

### Luminal B breast cancer: molecular characterization, clinical management, and future perspectives [^820c844b]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Gene expression profiling has reshaped our understanding of breast cancer by defining and characterizing four main intrinsic molecular subtypes: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched, basal-like, luminal A, and luminal B subtypes. Luminal B breast cancer has been reported to have lower expression of hormone receptors, higher expression of proliferation markers, and higher histologic grade than luminal A. It also exhibits worse prognosis and has a distinct profile of response to hormone therapy and chemotherapy. Although luminal cancers share similarities, the studies conducted in recent years using next-generation sequencing technology show that luminal A and B breast cancers should be perceived as distinct entities, with specific oncogenic drivers, rather than more proliferative varieties of luminal tumors. This review discusses the definition and molecular characterization of luminal B breast cancer and presents the available clinical evidence for chemotherapy and endocrine therapy patterns of response. It also provides an overview of ongoing research on molecularly targeted agents for this disease.

### Basal-like breast cancer: a critical review… [^86d109ee]. ASCO (2008). Low credibility.

Abstract Recent gene expression profiling of breast cancer has identified specific subtypes with clinical, biologic, and therapeutic implications. The basal-like group of tumors is characterized by an expression signature similar to that of the basal/myoepithelial cells of the breast and is reported to have transcriptomic characteristics similar to those of tumors arising in. BRCA1germline mutation carriers. They are associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, and typically do not express hormone receptors or HER-2. Therefore, patients with basal-like cancers are unlikely to benefit from currently available targeted systemic therapy.

Although basal-like tumors are characterized by distinctive morphologic, genetic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features, neither an accepted consensus on routine clinical identification and definition of this aggressive subtype of breast cancer nor a way of systematically classifying this complex group of tumors has been described. Different definitions are, therefore, likely to produce variable and contradictory results that may hamper consistent identification and development of treatment strategies for these tumors. In this review, we discuss definition, heterogeneity, morphologic spectrum, relation to BRCA1, and clinical significance of this important class of breast cancer.

### Re-definition of claudin-low as a breast cancer phenotype [^778ee6f2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The claudin-low breast cancer subtype is defined by gene expression characteristics and encompasses a remarkably diverse range of breast tumors. Here, we investigate genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical features of claudin-low breast tumors. We show that claudin-low is not simply a subtype analogous to the intrinsic subtypes (basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal A, luminal B and normal-like) as previously portrayed, but is a complex additional phenotype which may permeate breast tumors of various intrinsic subtypes. Claudin-low tumors are distinguished by low genomic instability, mutational burden and proliferation levels, and high levels of immune and stromal cell infiltration. In other aspects, claudin-low tumors reflect characteristics of their intrinsic subtype. Finally, we explore an alternative method for identifying claudin-low tumors and thereby uncover potential weaknesses in the established claudin-low classifier. In sum, these findings elucidate the heterogeneity in claudin-low breast tumors, and substantiate a re-definition of claudin-low as a cancer phenotype.

### Triple-negative breast cancer with brain metastases: a comparison between basal-like and non-basal-like biological subtypes [^07a86de0]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Triple-negative breast cancer with brain metastases is a highly selected type of cancer with very poor prognosis. The recurrence of the disease occurs within 2 years and overall survival is less than 3 years. Basal-like and non-basal-like subgroups of patients with brain metastases did not differ significantly with regards to clinical features and survival except for the pattern of metastatic spread. Factors influencing survival from brain metastases were KPS and the status of the extracranial disease. Age at the detection of brain lesions was of borderline significance. Searching for other biological markers responsible for metastatic spread to the brain is of special value.

### Proteomic analysis of archival breast cancer clinical specimens identifies biological subtypes with distinct survival outcomes [^e8258952]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Despite advances in genomic classification of breast cancer, current clinical tests and treatment decisions are commonly based on protein level information. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens with extended clinical outcomes are widely available. Here, we perform comprehensive proteomic profiling of 300 FFPE breast cancer surgical specimens, 75 of each PAM50 subtype, from patients diagnosed in 2008–2013 (n = 178) and 1986–1992 (n = 122) with linked clinical outcomes. These two cohorts are analyzed separately, and we quantify 4214 proteins across all 300 samples. Within the aggressive PAM50-classified basal-like cases, proteomic profiling reveals two groups with one having characteristic immune hot expression features and highly favorable survival. Her2-Enriched cases separate into heterogeneous groups differing by extracellular matrix, lipid metabolism, and immune-response features. Within 88 triple-negative breast cancers, four proteomic clusters display features of basal-immune hot, basal-immune cold, mesenchymal, and luminal with disparate survival outcomes. Our proteomic analysis characterizes the heterogeneity of breast cancer in a clinically-applicable manner, identifies potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and provides a resource for clinical breast cancer classification.

### The breast cancer classifier refines molecular breast cancer classification to delineate the HER2-low subtype [^1cac3e79]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The evolution of the molecular classification of breast cancer witnessed a paradigm shift with the introduction of the PAM50 classifier, a pioneering assay that emerged from the seminal work by Perou et al. This study revealed the possibility of segregating breast cancers into intrinsic subtypes through hierarchical clustering of gene expression. Based on the expression profiles of certain genes, the PAM50 molecular breast classification led to the identification of five subtypes: Luminal A (LumA), Luminal B (LumB), HER2-enriched, Basal, and Normal-like –. These subtypes have demonstrated prognostic significance across varying patient cohorts, both untreated and treated, thus showcasing their potential in risk stratification –. The Prosigna test emerged as a consequential extension of this classification, aiding in clinical management and identification of intrinsic subtypes indicative of recurrence tendencies. However, despite its clinical assimilation, glaring limitations in molecular breast cancer expression profile classification still remain, including low concordance between subtypes, a blurred border between Luminal and Normal-like subtypes, and heterogeneity of the HER2-enriched and Basal subtypes –. These deficiencies are especially apparent in the identification of HER2-low breast cancers, consequently hindering the progress in treatment options for this aggressive cancer.

Recent publications have also delineated the need for more nuanced classifications. In a transformative approach to breast cancer classification, Mathews et al. introduced a reclassification of breast tumors into seven distinct classes using interpretable mRNA signatures within the PAM50 gene set. This evolution in understanding breast cancer subtypes is further enriched by studies focusing on the claudin-low subtype –. These studies described the claudin-low subtype of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as distinct in gene expression patterns related to cell adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, indicating its potential divergence in origin and evolution when compared to other breast cancer subtypes.

Considerable work has gone into classifying TNBC. The Burstein classification system divides TNBC into four distinct subtypes: basal-like immunosuppressed (BLIS), basal-like immune-activated (BLIA), luminal androgen receptor (LAR), and mesenchymal (MES). This system revealed the LAR and MES subtypes to be predominantly found in non-Basal tumors of TNBC. Furthermore, certain TNBC subtypes have characteristics similar to non-TNBC tumors but display different clinical features –.

### Heterogeneity of luminal breast cancer characterised by immunohistochemical expression of basal markers [^9ddda918]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Experimental and clinical studies suggest more complex layers of heterogeneity within major breast cancer subtypes. In particular, luminal cancers demonstrated substantial variability in molecular characteristics and clinical behaviour, including responsiveness to endocrine treatment. In line with this, in a recent large pooled analysis including > 10 000 invasive breast cancer cases, showed that luminal A tumours expressing basal markers ((CK5 or CK5/6) or EGFR, luminal A basal-positive) had worse prognosis than luminal A tumours that were negative for basal markers (luminal A basal-negative). However, to our knowledge, there have been no reports on etiological heterogeneity within luminal A tumours so far.

To assess whether luminal A basal-positive tumours (ER+ or PR+/HER2−/basal markers+) represent a distinct disease entity from an etiologic perspective, we pooled individual data for 5040 luminal A breast cancer cases contributed by eight studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), with risk factor information and expression status for ER, PR, HER2, and basal markers. The goal of this study was to examine whether tumour characteristics and risk factors of luminal A basal-positive tumours are different from those of luminal A basal-negative tumours (ER+ or PR+/HER2−/basal markers−).

### Molecular features and survival outcomes of the intrinsic subtypes within HER2-positive breast cancer [^7df9548f]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical impact of the biological heterogeneity within HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is not fully understood. Here, we evaluated the molecular features and survival outcomes of the intrinsic subtypes within HER2+ breast cancer.

Methods

We interrogated The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 495) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) datasets (n = 1730) of primary breast cancers for molecular data derived from DNA, RNA and protein, and determined intrinsic subtype. Clinical HER2 status was defined according to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines or DNA copy-number aberration by single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Cox models tested the prognostic significance of each variable in patients not treated with trastuzumab (n = 1711).

Results

Compared with clinically HER2 (cHER2)-negative breast cancer, cHER2+ breast cancer had a higher frequency of the HER2-enriched (HER2E) subtype (47.0% vs 7.1%) and a lower frequency of Luminal A (10.7% vs 39.0%) and Basal-like (14.1% vs 23.4%) subtypes. The likelihood of cHER2-positivity in HER2E, Luminal B, Basal-like and Luminal A subtypes was 64.6%, 20.0%, 14.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Within each subtype, only 0.3% to 3.9% of genes were found differentially expressed between cHER2+ and cHER2-negative tumors. Within cHER2+ tumors, HER2 gene and protein expression was statistically significantly higher in the HER2E and Basal-like subtypes than either luminal subtype. Neither cHER2 status nor the new 10-subtype copy number-based classification system (IntClust) added independent prognostic value to intrinsic subtype.

Conclusions

When the intrinsic subtypes are taken into account, cHER2-positivity does not translate into large changes in the expression of downstream signaling pathways, nor does it affect patient survival in the absence of HER2 targeting.

### Comprehensive characterization of claudin-low breast tumors reflects the impact of the cell-of-origin on cancer evolution [^3fe6a7e2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous group of diseases with variable biological and clinical behaviors. Providing early insights into this diversity, gene-expression profiling analyses initially resulted in the identification of four clinically relevant molecular subtypes, known as intrinsic subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like, according to the PAM50 classification) mostly corresponding to hormone receptor and HER2 status, and a normal breast-like group –. Among these intrinsic subtypes, the basal-like subtype appears to be the most distinct, as it is characterized by the unique expression of cytokeratins typically expressed by the basal layer of the skin and a very low level of expression of luminal-related genes. This observation led to the hypothesis that breast cancers may arise from the transformation of two distinct cell types of origin or developmental stages of mammary epithelial cell development, one generating basal-like tumors and the other non-basal-like malignancies. Although appealing in its simplicity, this model overlooks the potential reprogramming of lineage-restricted populations initiated by an oncogenic event or a microenvironmental signal over the course of tumor development –. Moreover, it does not account for the intrinsic diversity of each breast cancer subtype, notably basal-like tumors known for their great heterogeneity –. An additional intrinsic subtype of breast cancers, known as claudin-low, has recently been identified in human and mouse tumors and in breast cancer cell lines, showing several common features with basal-like tumors and reflecting the diversity of tumors with a low luminal differentiation status. Basal-like and claudin-low tumors form the majority of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), an aggressive subgroup of breast malignancies defined as tumors lacking expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2. A hallmark of the claudin-low subtype is the low expression level of critical cell–cell adhesion molecules, including claudins 3, 4, and 7, occludin, and E-cadherin. Tumors of this subtype are highly enriched in mesenchymal traits and stem cell features and are therefore considered as the most primitive breast cancers. Although in vivo preclinical data suggested that basal-like tumors arise from the transformation of a luminal progenitor (LP), the putative cell-of-origin of claudin-low tumors remains unknown. The prevailing hypothesis is that, over the course of tumor progression, basal cancer cells undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to acquired oncogenic events and/or microenvironmental signals, thereby gaining mesenchymal and stemness features –. An alternative hypothesis is that claudin-low tumors originate from an early epithelial precursor with inherent stemness features. To gain further insight into the developmental origin of claudin-low tumors, we first sought to analyze their genomic architecture. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that, whereas the oncogene-driven transformation of mature luminal (mL) cells and progenitor luminal cells triggers massive oncogene-induced DNA damage and an early onset of chromosomal instability (CIN), normal human mammary stem cells (MaSCs) can withstand an aberrant mitogenic activity. The endogenous expression of the ZEB1 EMT-inducing transcription factor prevents replication and oxidative stress, leading to a process of malignant transformation in the absence of exacerbated genomic instability. As basal-like breast cancers generally exhibit numerous genomic aberrations, we thus speculated that the extent of genomic aberrations might be used as a molecular indicator of the developmental origin of claudin-low breast cancers.

### The mammographic correlations with basal-like phenotype of invasive breast cancer [^a0b1ad2a]. Academic Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Mammography contributes to the improvement of breast carcinoma survival through early detection and treatment of breast lesions. The basal-like phenotype has been found to be an independent poor prognostic factor for breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the mammographic correlates of the basal-like phenotype of invasive breast cancer, and to more precisely predict patient outcome and those individuals who will be responsive to a specific therapeutic regimen.

Materials and Methods

The mammographic findings in 267 patients with operable breast cancer were correlated with the basal-like subtype identified using immunohistochemical assessment of breast cancer cases, including estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2/neu status, cytokeratin (CK5/6), and epidermal growth factor receptor.

Results

Of the 267 invasive breast cancers, 40 (15%) were of the basal-like phenotype. Basal-phenotype tumors were significantly more likely to manifest as a mass (P = 0.002), most of which were indistinct margin (P = 0.035), at mammography, and architecture distortion at mammography (P = 0.002).

Conclusion

The mammographic appearances of basal-like tumors, more mass and architecture distortion, suggest more rapid carcinogenesis. Additional studies are warranted to further refine prognosis, and to optimize treatment in patients with basal-like breast cancer.

### Triple negative tumours: a critical review [^148c2cf4]. Histopathology (2008). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that encompasses several distinct entities with remarkably different biological characteristics and clinical behaviour. Currently, breast cancer patients are managed according to algorithms based on a constellation of clinical and histopathological parameters in conjunction with assessment of hormone receptor (oestrogen and progesterone receptor) status and HER2 overexpression/gene amplification. Although effective tailored therapies have been developed for patients with hormone receptor-positive or HER2+ disease, chemotherapy is the only modality of systemic therapy for patients with breast cancers lacking the expression of these markers (triple-negative cancers). Recent microarray expression profiling analyses have demonstrated that breast cancers can be systematically characterized into biologically and clinically meaningful groups. These studies have led to the re-discovery of basal-like breast cancers, which preferentially show a triple-negative phenotype. Both triple-negative and basal-like cancers preferentially affect young and African-American women, are of high histological grade and have more aggressive clinical behaviour. Furthermore, a significant overlap between the biological and clinical characteristics of sporadic triple-negative and basal-like cancers and breast carcinomas arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers has been repeatedly demonstrated. In this review, we critically address the characteristics of basal-like and triple-negative cancers, their similarities and differences, their response to chemotherapy as well as strategies for the development of novel therapeutic targets for these aggressive types of breast cancer. In addition, the possible mechanisms are discussed leading to BRCA1 pathway dysfunction in sporadic triple-negative and basal-like cancers and animal models for these tumour types.

### Molecular characterization of basal-like and non-basal-like triple-negative breast cancer [^143aa2f8]. The Oncologist (2013). Low credibility.

Triple-negative (TN) and basal-like (BL) breast cancer definitions have been used interchangeably to identify breast cancers that lack expression of the hormone receptors and overexpression and/or amplification of HER2. However, both classifications show substantial discordance rates when compared to each other. Here, we molecularly characterize TN tumors and BL tumors, comparing and contrasting the results in terms of common patterns and distinct patterns for each. In total, when testing 412 TN and 473 BL tumors, 21.4% and 31.5% were identified as non-BL and non-TN, respectively. TN tumors identified as luminal or HER2-enriched (HER2E) showed undistinguishable overall gene expression profiles when compared versus luminal or HER2E tumors that were not TN. Similar findings were observed within BL tumors regardless of their TN status, which suggests that molecular subtype is preserved regardless of individual marker results. Interestingly, most TN tumors identified as HER2E showed low HER2 expression and lacked HER2 amplification, despite the similar overall gene expression profiles to HER2E tumors that were clinically HER2-positive. Lastly, additional genomic classifications were examined within TN and BL cancers, most of which were highly concordant with tumor intrinsic subtype. These results suggest that future clinical trials focused on TN disease should consider stratifying patients based upon BL versus non-BL gene expression profiles, which appears to be the main biological difference seen in patients with TN breast cancer.

### Triple-negative breast cancer with brain metastases: a comparison between basal-like and non-basal-like biological subtypes [^768b6600]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Triple-negative breast cancer represents a distinct subset of breast cancer that exhibits a more aggressive course as compared to other biological subtypes of cancer. The aggressiveness of the disease is best illustrated by the fact that the peak risk of recurrence of the disease is between the first and third year following diagnosis, and that survival after recurrence is significantly shorter than that observed in patients with non-triple-negative controls. Surprisingly, patients who did not have a recurrence of the disease within the first 8 years after the diagnosis did not subsequently relapse. However, in other subtypes of breast cancer, the risk of recurrence keeps rising as time progresses. The recurrence pattern of triple-negative breast cancer also differs from other biological subtypes of cancer. In addition, the most characteristic sites of metastases include the brain and lungs.

From a biological point of view, triple-negative breast cancer remains a heterogeneous group with difficult-to-define subtypes. Gene expression studies have shown that ER-negative and HER2-negative tumors are clustered into at least three distinct molecular classes: basal-like, normal-like and claudin-negative breast cancer. Most of triple-negative tumors show basal-like phenotype which can be subdivided into pure variant and myoepithelial variant. Many "immunohistochemical (IHC) signatures" have been described as a surrogate of microarray, but the panel proposed by Nielsen et al. seems to be the best example of the classification to date. In this classification, basal-like cancers are defined as those lacking ER and HER2 expression and expressing cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6) and/or Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR or HER1). This panel has 100% specificity and 76% sensitivity for identification of basal-like cancers.

Patients with triple-negative breast cancer and brain metastases have the poorest prognosis out of all biological subtypes of breast cancer after dissemination to the brain. It is not known whether such a short survival depends on clinical features (performance status, dissemination of the disease to other organs), or the affiliation to the specific biological subset, which can be selected by molecular markers, for example basal cytokeratins.

The aim of the present study was to analyze clinical features and survival of triple-negative breast cancer patients with brain metastases and to compare basal-like and non-basal-like subtypes in order to establish the clinical value of basal biological markers differentiating these subtypes.

### High tumor expression of CTLA4 identifies lymph node-negative basal-like breast cancer patients with excellent prognosis [^a71d3b54]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Perou and colleagues introduced the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer in 2000, based on microarray analyses of tumor expression of 8000 genes. The main subtypes, Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like, display differences in biology, clinical behavior, and response to treatment –. Parker and colleaguesshowed that reproducible prediction of the intrinsic subtypes can be performed by expression analysis of 50 genes, known as the PAM50 classifier. While tumor gene expression analyses have become widely available only in recent years, routine immunohistochemistry (IHC) evaluation of the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 has been universally adopted to assess susceptibility to endocrine and HER2-directed treatment. As most basal-like tumors are triple-negative by IHC, triple-negative disease has been used as a surrogate marker for the basal-like subtype, guiding treatment decisions as well as enrollment and stratification in clinical trials. However, 14% of triple-negative tumors are classified as non-basal by PAM50, and tumors of all intrinsic subtypes can be found within the triple-negative category. Central properties of the intrinsic subtypes are retained regardless of receptor status. This diversity within TNBC may explain some of the difficulties in identifying robust prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Addressing this challenge, we performed patient selection by intrinsic subtype for the primary analyses in the current study.

While the presence of immune activation in breast tumors and its correlation with treatment outcome have been known for more than a century, this prognostic information has not been generally implemented to guide treatment decisions. Quantification of TILs by histopathological evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides represents an affordable option. However, the standardization of such methods remains challenging for implementation in the clinical setting. In the current study, we retrospectively analyzed the expression of a curated set of 753 immune-related genes in basal-like tumors from a prospective study of patients with early-stage BC, with available PAM50-based intrinsic subtype information and known clinical and histopathological risk factors. The aim of the study was to investigate whether immune gene expression patterns can identify patients with low risk of disease recurrence and death, who could benefit from de-escalation or omission of adjuvant chemotherapy.

We show that a high tumor expression of the immune checkpoint gene CTLA4 is associated with an excellent prognosis and high TIL scores in patients with lymph node-negative, basal-like breast cancer in the Oslo1 study. The correlation of CTLA4 expression with prognosis is also demonstrated in two independent validation cohorts, SCAN-B and METABRIC.

### Triple-negative breast cancer: disease entity or title of convenience? [^9b8de27a]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

This Review outlines the understanding and management of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC shares morphological and genetic abnormalities with basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), a subgroup of breast cancer defined by gene-expression profiling. However, TNBC and BLBC tumors are heterogeneous and overlap is incomplete. Breast cancers found in BRCA1 mutation carriers are also frequently triple negative and basal like. TNBC and BLBC occur most frequently in young women, especially African Americans, and tend to exhibit aggressive, metastatic behavior. These tumors respond to conventional chemotherapy but relapse more frequently than hormone receptor-positive, luminal subtypes and have a worse prognosis. New systemic therapies are urgently needed as most patients with TNBC and/or BLBC relapse with distant metastases, and hormonal therapies and HER2-targeted agents are ineffective in this group of tumors. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, EGFR-targeted agents, and src kinase and mTOR inhibitors are among the therapeutic agents being actively investigated in clinical trials in patients with TNBC and/or BRCA1-associated tumors. Increased understanding of the genetic abnormalities involved in the pathogenesis of TNBC, BLBC and BRCA1-associated tumors is opening up new therapeutic possibilities for these hard-to-treat breast cancers.

### Molecular characterization and classification of HER2-Positive breast cancer inform tailored therapeutic strategies [^5dacc69c]. Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

HER2-positive breast cancer is an aggressive subtype that accounts for 15% to 20% of all breast cancers. Recent studies have suggested that HER2-positive breast cancer is a group of heterogeneous diseases with different sensitivities to standard treatment regimens. Revealing the molecular heterogeneity of HER2-positive breast cancer could potentially enable more precise treatment strategies. In this study, we performed multiomics profiling on a HER2-positive breast cancer cohort and identified four transcriptome-based subtypes. The classical HER2 (HER2-CLA) subtype comprised 28.3% of the samples and displayed high ERBB2 activation and significant benefit from anti-HER2 therapy. The immunomodulatory (HER2-IM) subtype (20%) featured an immune-activated microenvironment, potentially suitable for de-escalated treatment and immunotherapy. The luminal-like (HER2-LUM) subtype (30.6%) possessed similar molecular features of hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer, suggesting endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy. Lastly, the basal/mesenchymal-like (HER2-BM) subtype (21.1%) had a poor response to current dual HER2-targeted therapy and could potentially benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The molecular characteristics and clinical features of the subtypes were further explored across multiple cohorts, and the feasibility of the proposed treatment strategies was validated in patient-derived organoid and patient-derived tumor fragment models. This study elucidates the molecular heterogeneity of HER2-positive breast cancer and paves the way for a more tailored treatment. Significance: Illumination of the inherent heterogeneity within HER2-positive breast cancers through the delineation of distinct molecular subtypes lays the groundwork for developing more personalized treatment strategies based on specific patient characteristics.

### Effect of ASCO / CAP guidelines for determining ER status on molecular subtype [^25e39ccb]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Determination of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is standard for predicting prognosis and determining treatment options for patients with breast cancer. In 2010, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and College of American Pathologists (CAP) issued guidelines that tumors with ≥ 1% positively staining cells should be considered ER positive. Here, we determined how this cutoff relates to molecular subtype.

Methods

Clinicopathological characteristics were compared between ER-negative, ER-positive, and low-ER-staining (1–10%) tumors using chi-square analysis with P < 0.05 defining statistical significance. Gene expression data were generated for 26 low-ER-staining tumors, and their intrinsic subtype determined. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-defined surrogate subtypes, using the threshold of positivity defined by ASCO/CAP guidelines, were compared with molecular subtypes.

Results

Low-ER-staining tumors were clinicopathologically more similar to ER-negative than to ER-positive tumors; 88% of low-staining tumors were basal like or HER2 enriched. Only those tumors expressing 10% ER-positive cells were classified as luminal A subtype.

Conclusions

Under ASCO/CAP guidelines, tumors with 1–10% ER staining would be classified as ER positive, yet most are basal like or HER2 enriched and have pathological features similar to ER-negative tumors. Clinical trials seeking to treat tumors of ER-negative basal-like and/or HER2-enriched subtypes should thus not preclude enrollment based solely on results of ER immunohistochemistry. As ER status is a critical element in the choice of treatments for patients with breast cancer, it is imperative that the most effective method for classifying tumors be developed.

### Response and survival of breast cancer intrinsic subtypes following multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^2be4a603]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

During the last decade, it has become apparent that gene expression-based data in breast cancer can provide useful biological, prognostic, and predictive information. For example, the main intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like) are biologically and prognostically relevant and have been associated with anthracycline and tamoxifen benefit in the adjuvant setting. Importantly, the intrinsic subtypes are not fully recapitulated by the combined determination of pathology-based biomarkers such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Ki67, and HER2, all of which are currently being used in the clinical setting. Thus, from a clinical perspective, there is a need to understand the value of identifying the intrinsic subtypes, as well as other gene expression-based classifications, beyond clinicopathological variables.

We have previously shown that all the intrinsic subtypes can be identified within various clinically-defined groups, albeit with different proportions. For example, although the Basal-like subtype predominates within triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), all the intrinsic subtypes can be identified in TNBC, and identification of the 'Basal-like versus not' classification within TNBC might be clinically relevant. Beyond the main subtypes of breast cancer, we have also reported the Claudin-low subtype characterized by the low to absent expression of luminal differentiation markers, and by the high enrichment for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, immune response genes, and cancer stem cell-like features. In a previous report, Claudin-low tumors showed an intermediate pathological complete response (pCR) rate compared to Basal-like tumors in a cohort of 133 patients with TNBC and non-TNBC tumors treated with anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy.

### Breast cancer molecular subtypes in patients with locally advanced disease: impact on prognosis, patterns of recurrence, and response to therapy [^683b2c62]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Gene expression profiling has led to the discovery of 4 distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer: luminal A, luminal B, basal like, and HER2 enriched. Investigation of these subtypes in women with breast cancer has given insight into the heterogeneous biology and outcomes in patients with locally advanced disease. These subtypes have been found to be predictors for survival, response to systemic therapy, and locoregional recurrence. This review discusses the biology of locally advanced breast cancer and the available data on how molecular subtype may provide information regarding response to treatment and prognosis of women with locally advanced breast cancer.

### Clinicopathological and epidemiological significance of breast cancer subtype reclassification based on p53 immunohistochemical expression [^741e56dc]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Several reports have documented molecular and clinical heterogeneity within subtypes of breast cancer, which is most notable for the luminal-like subtype.– Although proliferation markers (KI67, histologic grade) have been used to further stratify luminal-like breast cancer into 'pure' A-like, B-like/HER2−, and B-like/HER2+ subtypes, data from recent molecular profiling studies suggest that luminal A tumors were still comprised of prognostically distinct subgroups. In line with this, a previous study reported that the combination of p53/KI67 provided better prognostic stratification than when KI67 was used alone. In keeping with this notion, we found evidence in support of differences in the clinicopathological features of luminal A-like/p53+ vs. A-like/p53− tumors. We observed that compared with luminal A-like/p53− tumors, A-like/p53+ tumors tended to occur among younger women, to be of higher grade, to have higher levels of proliferation, and to more frequently express basal markers. The precise clinical relevance of this finding remains to be determined, but it is highly suggestive of a role for p53 IHC in further refining luminal A-like breast cancer classification into subgroups with prognostic and, probably, therapeutic implications.

In addition to differences in clinical outcomes, breast cancer subtypes are etiologically heterogeneous. Results from epidemiological studies have shown that reproductive and hormonal risk factors were more consistently associated with the risk of luminal than non-luminal tumors. Interestingly, accumulating evidence is in support of within-subtype heterogeneity according to other clinically relevant tumor characteristics. – In this study, we found p53 expression to identify a phenotype of luminal A-like breast cancer that may also be etiologically relevant given its association with parity and breastfeeding. It is unclear why parity/breastfeeding was associated with p53 expression only in luminal A-like tumors. One possible explanation may have to do with differences in the timing of TP53 mutations in different breast cancer subtypes. Limited evidence from one study on BRCA1 mutated breast tumors suggested that in contrast to basal-like tumors in which TP53 mutations occur late, TP53 mutations may occur early in the development of luminal A tumors. Nonetheless, the relatively small number of p53− cases in the other subtypes may have led to reduced power to detect significant differences.

### Breast ductal carcinoma study-NCI-national cancer institute… [^d215ca65]. NCI (2018). Low credibility.

What is breast cancer. This cancer starts in the tissues of the breast. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second cause of cancer deaths in women. In 2010, 207, 090 women were estimated to have been diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the United States and approximately 40, 000 women were estimated to have died of their disease. 1 Men can also have breast cancer, although male breast cancer is rare. In 2010, 1, 970 American men were estimated to have been diagnosed and 390 were estimated to have died of breast cancer. 1 Due to early detection through use of mammograms and improvements in treatment, breast cancer deaths have steadily decreased since the 1990s. Additional information on breast cancer. TCGA focused mainly on two types of invasive breast cancer: ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer.

It comprises about 65–85% of all breast cancer and develops in the milk ducts of the breast. About 10% of all cases of advanced breast cancer. 2 are invasive lobular breast carcinoma. This cancer develops in the breast milk-producing lobules or glands. What have TCGA researchers learned about breast cancer.
- The cancer can be categorized into four molecular subtypes: HER2-enriched, Luminal A, Luminal B, and Basal-like. Each subtype is associated with a unique panel of mutated genes.
- Basal-like subtype shares many genetic features with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, suggesting that the cancers have a common molecular origin and may share therapeutic opportunities, such as:

- A drug that inhibits blood vessel growth, cutting off the blood supply to the tumor.
- Bioreductive drugs, which are inactive drugs that become toxic to cancer cells under low oxygen conditions.

### Contrasting DCIS and invasive breast cancer by subtype suggests basal-like DCIS as distinct lesions [^5775472b]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

During tumor evolution, transition from DCIS to an invasive stage may represent an evolutionary bottleneck which may also impact tumor subtype. To study subtype evolution and plasticity during tumor progression and invasion, we would need consecutive biopsies from the same patients. Nonetheless, our study includes sufficient number of samples to be able to compare subtype characteristics between DCIS and IBC as groups for each subtype, separately. We show that the difference between DCIS and IBC is greater for the basal-like subtype compared with all other subtypes. Despite that the intrinsic subtypes were defined in IBC, we believe that basal-like DCIS are truly basal-like since firstly, the PAM50 subtyping showed that they correlate the most to the basal-like centroid, albeit to a lower degree than IBC. Secondly, several genomic features of basal-like tumors are also present in basal-like DCIS, including low degree of differentiation, high expression of basal keratins, low expression of luminal genes and expression of genes indicative of immune cell infiltration. Despite these similarities, basal-like DCIS may not be precursors to basal-like IBC. Basal-like breast cancer is an aggressive disease that develops rapidly. Especially the core basal tumors have an aggressive phenotype with poorer prognosis than non-core basal tumors. Although all core basal invasive tumors at some point must have progressed from an intraductal stage, the transition from DCIS to IBC may occur so rapidly that the probability of "capturing" such tumors as DCIS is very small, as also proposed by Kurbel. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that basal-like invasive breast tumors have fewer concurrent DCIS lesions compared with other subtypes. Our results indicate that DCIS in general possesses characteristics that resemble those of invasive tumors of the same subtype. It is therefore uncontroversial to hypothesize that a DCIS with basal-like characteristics will progress to a basal-like cancer with its well-known characteristics. However, our results indicate that many basal-like DCIS resemble the less aggressive non-core basal invasive tumors and hence, we therefore speculate that patients diagnosed with basal-like DCIS do not carry high-risk tumors. Potentially may they be slow-growing tumors that never progress to an invasive tumor in the life-time of the patient. This may have profound impact on how we perceive DCIS and not least, how they should be treated.

### Tumor size and survival in breast cancer – a reappraisal [^18ae5753]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

The size of a breast cancer at diagnosis has conventionally been thought of as a fundamental and critical determinant of clinical outcome. However, the tendency of some subtypes of breast cancer to behave aggressively, despite being small (≤ 1 cm in diameter), questions the premise that cancer size should always be considered in treatment decisions. Although there is an association between tumor size and lymph-node involvement for most tumor types, this pattern is not invariable. We speculate that the uncoupling of tumor size, lymph-node status and prognosis in some subtypes of breast cancers might reflect an underlying disproportionate relationship between the number of cancer cells with metastatic potential and the size of the cancer. Alternatively, some small cancers might harbor cells that are inherently aggressive and are likely to metastasize. These observations have implications for the screening and treatment of breast cancers, particularly for women with basal-like and BRCA1-related breast cancers.

### Triple-negative breast cancer: the importance of molecular and histologic subtyping, and recognition of low-grade variants [^a484e720]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Definition of TNBC

The term TNBC was first used in 2005 (ref.) to refer to a subset of breast cancer patients for whom chemotherapy was the only treatment available, given that patients with TN disease lack ER, PR, and HER2 and, therefore, are not eligible to receive hormonal therapy or anti-HER2 agents. From a scientific and translational research standpoint, the TN phenotype was also of interest, given that it was initially perceived as a potential surrogate for basal-like breast cancers, one of the 'intrinsic gene' subtypes of the disease characterized by lack of ER and HER2 mRNA expression, but expressing genes usually found in basal/ myoepithelial cells of the normal breast. Currently, TNBCs should be defined as invasive breast cancers lacking ER and PR expression and HER2 overexpression/ HER2 gene amplification according to the definitions put forward in the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines for the assessment of ER, PR, and HER2, as these definitions refer to a subset of breast cancer patients who are not eligible for endocrine and anti-HER2 therapies.

### Contrasting DCIS and invasive breast cancer by subtype suggests basal-like DCIS as distinct lesions [^ac80dc7b]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-invasive type of breast cancer with highly variable potential of becoming invasive and affecting mortality. Currently, many patients with DCIS are overtreated due to the lack of specific biomarkers that distinguish low risk lesions from those with a higher risk of progression. In this study, we analyzed 57 pure DCIS and 313 invasive breast cancers (IBC) from different patients. Three levels of genomic data were obtained; gene expression, DNA methylation, and DNA copy number. We performed subtype stratified analyses and identified key differences between DCIS and IBC that suggest subtype specific progression. Prominent differences were found in tumors of the basal-like subtype: Basal-like DCIS were less proliferative and showed a higher degree of differentiation than basal-like IBC. Also, core basal tumors (characterized by high correlation to the basal-like centroid) were not identified amongst DCIS as opposed to IBC. At the copy number level, basal-like DCIS exhibited fewer copy number aberrations compared with basal-like IBC. An intriguing finding through analysis of the methylome was hypermethylation of multiple protocadherin genes in basal-like IBC compared with basal-like DCIS and normal tissue, possibly caused by long range epigenetic silencing. This points to silencing of cell adhesion-related genes specifically in IBC of the basal-like subtype. Our work confirms that subtype stratification is essential when studying progression from DCIS to IBC, and we provide evidence that basal-like DCIS show less aggressive characteristics and question the assumption that basal-like DCIS is a direct precursor of basal-like invasive breast cancer.

### Breast cancer molecular stratification: from intrinsic subtypes to integrative clusters [^ff59638a]. The American Journal of Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast carcinomas can be stratified into different entities based on clinical behavior, histologic features, and/or by biological properties. A classification of breast cancer should be based on underlying biology, which we know must be determined by the somatic genomic landscape of mutations. Moreover, because the latest generations of anticancer agents are founded on biological mechanisms, a detailed molecular stratification is a requirement for appropriate clinical management. Such stratification, based on genomic drivers, will be important for selecting patients for clinical trials. It will also facilitate the discovery of novel drivers, the study of tumor evolution, and the identification of mechanisms of treatment resistance. Assays for risk stratification have focused mainly on response prediction to existing treatment regimens. Molecular stratification based on gene expression profiling revealed that breast cancers could be classified in so-called intrinsic subtypes (luminal A and B, HER2-enriched, basal-like, and normal-like), which mostly corresponded to hormone receptor and HER2 status, and further stratified luminal tumors based on proliferation. The realization that a significant proportion of the gene expression landscape is determined by the somatic copy number alterations that drive expression in cis led to the newer classification of breast cancers into integrative clusters. This stratification of breast cancers into integrative clusters reveals prototypical patterns of single-nucleotide variants and is associated with distinct clinical courses and response to therapy.

### In vitro and in vivo analysis of B-myb in basal-like breast cancer [^97075b78]. Oncogene (2009). Low credibility.

A defining feature of basal-like breast cancer, a breast cancer subtype with poor clinical prognosis, is the high expression of 'proliferation signature' genes. We identified B-Myb, a MYB family transcription factor that is often amplified and overexpressed in many tumor types, as being highly expressed in the proliferation signature. However, the roles of B-Myb in disease progression, and its mammary-specific transcriptional targets, are poorly understood. Here, we showed that B-Myb expression is a significant predictor of survival and pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. We also identified a significant association between the G/G genotype of a nonsynonymous B-Myb germline variant (rs2070235, S427G) and an increased risk of basal-like breast cancer [OR 2.0, 95% CI (1.1–3.8)]. In immortalized, human mammary epithelial cell lines, but not in basal-like tumor lines, cells ectopically expressing wild-type B-Myb or the S427G variant showed increased sensitivity to two DNA topoisomerase IIalpha inhibitors, but not to other chemotherapeutics. In addition, microarray analyses identified many G2/M genes as being induced in B-Myb overexpressing cells. These results confirm that B-Myb is involved in cell cycle control, and that its dysregulation may contribute to increased sensitivity to a specific class of chemotherapeutic agents. These data provide insight into the influence of B-Myb in human breast cancer, which is of potential clinical importance for determining disease risk and for guiding treatment.

### Breast cancer molecular profiling with single sample predictors: a retrospective analysis [^a11259aa]. The Lancet: Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

Background

Microarray expression profiling classifies breast cancer into five molecular subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, HER2, and normal breast-like. Three microarray-based single sample predictors (SSPs) have been used to define molecular classification of individual samples. We aimed to establish agreement between these SSPs for identification of breast cancer molecular subtypes.

Methods

Previously described microarray-based SSPs were applied to one in-house (n = 53) and three publicly available (n = 779) breast cancer datasets. Agreement was analysed between SSPs for the whole classification system and for the five molecular subtypes individually in each cohort.

Findings

Fair-to-substantial agreement between every pair of SSPs in each cohort was recorded (kappa = 0.238–0.740). Of the five molecular subtypes, only basal-like cancers consistently showed almost-perfect agreement (kappa > 0.812). The proportion of cases classified as basal-like in each cohort was consistent irrespective of the SSP used; however, the proportion of each remaining molecular subtype varied substantially. Assignment of individual cases to luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and normal breast-like subtypes was dependent on the SSP used. The significance of associations with outcome of each molecular subtype, other than basal-like and luminal A, varied depending on SSP used. However, different SSPs produced broadly similar survival curves.

Interpretation

Although every SSP identifies molecular subtypes with similar survival, they do not reliably assign the same patients to the same molecular subtypes. For molecular subtype classification to be incorporated into routine clinical practice and treatment decision making, stringent standardisation of methodologies and definitions for identification of breast cancer molecular subtypes is needed.

### The therapeutic response of ER + / HER2-breast cancers differs according to the molecular basal or luminal subtype [^99fbabf5]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, we also report the first comparative analysis of large-scale molecular profiles of ER+/HER2− Basal versus Luminal subtypes. Only one gene (TP53) was differentially mutated, whereas important differences existed at the mRNA and protein levels. Five percent of genes tested were differentially expressed, including many immune genes upregulated in Basal samples. Thirty-nine percent of 226 proteins/phosphoproteins tested were differentially expressed, including therapeutic targets of drugs under development in ER+/HER2− BC such as PARP1, AR and Bcl-2. Inclusion of the ER− Basal subtype showed a gradient between the three subtypes from the ER+/HER2− Luminal subtype to the ER− Basal subtype in terms of clinicopathological correlations and transcriptional profiles. However, the ER+/HER2− Basal subtype was closer to the ER− Basal subtype than to the ER+/HER2− Luminal subtype in terms of response/probability of response to systemic therapies. The extent of differences between subtypes was also suggested by the mammary stem cell signatures, which could suggest a different cell-of-origin. Strikingly, the ER+/HER2− Basal samples were closer to the mammary stem cells than were the ER− Basal samples, warranting further investigations.

In conclusion, our results reinforce the potential clinical value of the different molecular classifications in ER+/HER2− BCs: the Basal and Luminal subtypes are so different with respect to therapeutic response/vulnerability, metastatic risk and cell-of-origin that they cannot continue to be assimilated and treated as a unique homogeneous ER+/HER2− group. Validation in prospective clinical trials is warranted, and caution is required in the interpretation of ongoing trials and the design of future trials.

### Prognostic value of intrinsic subtypes in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer treated with letrozole with or without lapatinib [^cde2ccac]. JAMA Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The value of the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer (luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [currently known as ERBB2, but referred to as HER2 in this study]-enriched, and basal-like) in the metastatic setting is currently unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the association of the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer with outcome and/or benefit in hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Unplanned retrospective analysis of 821 tumor samples (85.7% primary and 14.3% metastatic) from the EGF30008 phase 3 clinical trial (NCT00073528), in which postmenopausal women with HR-positive invasive breast cancer and no prior therapy for advanced or metastatic disease were randomized to letrozole with or without lapatinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tumor samples were classified into each subtype using the research-based PAM50 classifier. Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant antiestrogen therapy was allowed. Patients with extensive symptomatic visceral disease were excluded. Treatment effects were evaluated using interaction tests.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary and secondary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival.

Results

The median (range) age was 62 (31–94) years. Intrinsic subtype was the strongest prognostic factor independently associated with progression-free survival and overall survival in all patients, and in patients with HER2-negative (n = 644) or HER2-positive (n = 157) diseases. Median progression-free survival differed across the intrinsic subtypes of clinically HER2-negative disease: luminal A (16.9 [95% CI, 14.1–19.9] months), luminal B (11.0 [95% CI, 9.6–13.6] months), HER2-enriched (4.7 [95% CI, 2.7–10.8] months), and basal-like (4.1 [95% CI, 2.5–13.8] months). Median OS also differed across the intrinsic subtypes: luminal A (45 [95% CI, 41-not applicable {NA}] months), luminal B (37 [95% CI, 31–42] months), HER2-enriched (16 [95% CI, 10-NA] months), and basal-like (23 [95% CI, 12-NA] months). Patients with HER2-negative/HER2-enriched disease benefited from lapatinib therapy (median PFS, 6.49 vs 2.60 months; progression-free survival hazard ratio,0.238 [95% CI, 0.066–0.863]; interaction P = 0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

This is the first study to reveal an association between intrinsic subtype and outcome in first-line HR-positive metastatic breast cancer. Patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative disease with a HER2-enriched profile may benefit from lapatinib in combination with endocrine therapy. The clinical value of intrinsic subtyping in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer warrants further investigation, but patients with luminal A/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer might be good candidates for letrozole monotherapy in the first-line setting regardless of visceral disease and number of metastases.

### Predicting response and survival in chemotherapy-treated triple-negative breast cancer [^8f7008b6]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterised by the absence of the therapeutically targetable hormone receptors and HER2 protein overexpression. For this reason, both adjuvant treatment and palliative therapy for metastatic TNBC is limited to chemotherapy. Although TNBC typically has higher rates of chemosensitivity compared with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, it has a poor overall prognosis and there is no predictive biomarker of response or survival to allow tailored therapy for these patients.

Over the years, studies based on global gene expression analyses have identified five main intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer known as luminal A, luminal B, HER2 enriched, basal like and claudin low. Among them, the basal-like subtype (BLBC) comprises the majority of TNBC; however, the other 20–30% of TNBCs fall into other subtypes. Thus, significant molecular heterogeneity exists within TNBC and it is likely that improving clinical outcome and tailoring therapy will require further stratification by biologic subtype.

In this study, we used gene expression data to classify multiple independent cohorts of patients from cooperative group trials and large multi-institution data sets into the main intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer and then we evaluated the ability of various published gene expression profiles to predict response and/or survival following chemotherapy in TNBC and/or BLBC.

### Proteomics-derived basal biomarker DNA-PKcs is associated with intrinsic subtype and long-term clinical outcomes in breast cancer [^7bfc7262]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Precise biomarkers are needed to guide better diagnostics and therapeutics for basal-like breast cancer, for which DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) has been recently reported by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium as the most specific biomarker. We evaluated DNA-PKcs expression in clinically-annotated breast cancer tissue microarrays and correlated results with immune biomarkers (training set: n = 300; validation set: n = 2401). Following a pre-specified study design per REMARK criteria, we found that high expression of DNA-PKcs was significantly associated with stromal and CD8+tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Within the basal-like subtype, tumors with low DNA-PKcs and high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes displayed the most favourable survival. DNA-PKcs expression by immunohistochemistry identified estrogen receptor-positive cases with a basal-like gene expression subtype. Non-silent mutations in PRKDC were significantly associated with poor outcomes. Integrating DNA-PKcs expression with validated immune biomarkers could guide patient selection for DNA-PKcs targeting strategies, DNA-damaging agents, and their combination with an immune-checkpoint blockade.

### Proteomic maps of breast cancer subtypes [^bec04508]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer has been extensively studied at the genomic and transcriptomic levels to attain novel cancer classification that can alter therapeutic regimens. The three main classical subtypes are defined by expression of the oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR; ERPR positive breast cancer) and the epidermal growth factor receptor ErbB2/Her2 (Her2 positive). The triple negative (TN) form (where none of the three markers is expressed) has an especially poor prognosis. More recently, unbiased approaches such as messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene copy number variation analyses identified novel classes based on the entire molecular profile. Initially, Perou et al. profiled gene expression patterns of dozens of breast tumours and identified the so called 'intrinsic subtypes' of breast cancer, which have been reinforced in multiple studies with some modifications. These subtypes matured into four accepted subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, Her2-enriched and basal-like breast cancer. While they do not perfectly reflect the clinical subtypes, most luminal tumours are ER/PR-positive, most Her2-enriched ones harbour the gene amplification, and most basal tumours are triple negative. Recently a large scale, integrated genomic-transcriptomic study further divided these subtypes into 10 clusters, however, these have not yet been clinically accepted.

### Atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin in metastatic TNBC… [^645bc7d1]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Forest plot shows the hazard ratios. Between variable cutoffs on each arm stratified by TNBC type, DNA mutation, and multiplex immunofluorescence markers. BL1 indicates basal-like 1; BL2, basal-like 2; M, mesenchymal; LAR, luminal androgen receptor; TMB, tumor mutation burden; CPS, combined positive score. Forest plot shows the hazard ratio for the progression of patients between variable cutoffs on each arm stratified by TNBC type, DNA mutation, and multiplex immunofluorescence markers. BL1 indicates basal-like 1; BL2, basal-like 2; M, mesenchymal; LAR, luminal androgen receptor; TMB, tumor mutation burden; CPS, combined positive score. TNBC subtyping was performed on RNA sequencing from 102 pretreatment biopsies, which resulted in 25% basal-like 1, 26% mesenchymal, 33% basal-like 2, and 15% luminal androgen receptor.

This distribution in metastatic disease differs from primary TNBC in the Cancer Genome Atlas and likely reflects the reduction of the chemosensitive BL1 subtype from prior chemotherapy treatments. 17, 18 All subtypes tended to benefit more with the addition of atezolizumab, except for the LAR subtype. Because variants generate neoantigens, we performed whole genome DNA sequencing on pretreatment tumor tissues to identify somatic variants. The median nonsynonymous mutation rate ranged from 9. 1–371. 0 mutations/megabase with a median of
15. 7 mut/Mb. Changes in blood glucose levels in fasting-mimicking diets profoundly affect peripheral blood cell composition by reducing immunosuppressive myeloid and regulatory T-cell compartments.

31 Patients with obesity with elevated blood glucose levels may have more immunosuppressive immune cells upon which anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapies can act. Future studies are needed to validate these findings and delineate the effects of blood glucose and obesity.

### Defining breast cancer intrinsic subtypes by quantitative receptor expression [^b268942e]. The Oncologist (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine intrinsic breast cancer subtypes represented within categories defined by quantitative hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 expression.

Methods

We merged 1,557 cases from three randomized phase III trials into a single data set. These breast tumors were centrally reviewed in each trial for quantitative ER, PR, and HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain and by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), with intrinsic subtyping by research-based PAM50 RT-qPCR assay.

Results

Among 283 HER2-negative tumors with < 1% HR expression by IHC, 207 (73%) were basal-like; other subtypes, particularly HER2-enriched (48, 17%), were present. Among the 1,298 HER2-negative tumors, borderline HR (1%-9% staining) was uncommon (n = 39), and these tumors were heterogeneous: 17 (44%) luminal A/B, 12 (31%) HER2-enriched, and only 7 (18%) basal-like. Including them in the definition of triple-negative breast cancer significantly diminished enrichment for basal-like cancer (p < .05). Among 106 HER2-positive tumors with < 1% HR expression by IHC, the HER2-enriched subtype was the most frequent (87, 82%), whereas among 127 HER2-positive tumors with strong HR (> 10%) expression, only 69 (54%) were HER2-enriched and 55 (43%) were luminal (39 luminal B, 16 luminal A). Quantitative HR expression by RT-qPCR gave similar results. Regardless of methodology, basal-like cases seldom expressed ER/ESR1 or PR/PGR and were associated with the lowest expression level of HER2/ERBB2 relative to other subtypes.

Conclusion

Significant discordance remains between clinical assay-defined subsets and intrinsic subtype. For identifying basal-like breast cancer, the optimal HR IHC cut point was < 1%, matching the American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists guidelines. Tumors with borderline HR staining are molecularly diverse and may require additional assays to clarify underlying biology.

b In most patients, several lines of chemotherapy were used

Table 2
Differences in clinical features between patients with basal-like (ER/PgR/HER2-negative, CK5/6-positive and/or HER1-positive) and non-basal-like (ER/PgR/HER2-negative, CK5/6-negative and HER1-negative) biological subtypes of triple-negative breast cancer (75 patients)

DFS, OS and survival from brain metastases in triple-negative, basal-like and non-basal-like subsets are presented in Table 3. In the entire group of 111 triple-negative breast cancer patients with brain metastases, median DFS, OS and survival from brain metastases were 20, 29 and 4 months, respectively. In 75 patients with known basal markers, median DFS, OS and survival from brain metastases were 18, 26 and 3.2 months, respectively. In the basal-like subtype, they were 15, 26 and 3 months, respectively, and in the non-basal-like subtype they were 20, 30 and 2.8 months, respectively. No statistically significant differences in DFS, OS and survival from brain metastases were detected between basal-like and non-basal-like biological subtypes.

Table 3

The analysis of factors influencing survival from brain metastases in triple-negative breast cancer patients with brain metastases, including clinical and biological factors was assessed in univariate and multivariate analysis. The results of univariate analysis of the group of 111 patients are presented in Table 4. The results of Cox multivariate analysis (final model) is presented in Table 5. Multivariate analysis revealed that clinical, and not biological factors influenced survival from brain metastases. They included KPS and the status of extracranial metastases. Patients with good performance status and those with controlled extracranial disease lived longer. Age at the detection of brain metastases was a factor of borderline significance; younger patients lived longer. None of three analyzed basal markers (CK 5/6, HER1, c-KIT) had any influence on survival from brain metastases.

### Identification of key clinical phenotypes of breast cancer using a reduced panel of protein biomarkers [^993cf4af]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background:

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterised by complex molecular alterations underlying the varied behaviour and response to therapy. However, translation of cancer genetic profiling for use in routine clinical practice remains elusive or prohibitively expensive. As an alternative, immunohistochemical analysis applied to routinely processed tissue samples could be used to identify distinct biological classes of breast cancer.

Methods:

In this study, 1073 archival breast tumours previously assessed for 25 key breast cancer biomarkers using immunohistochemistry and classified using clustering algorithms were further refined using naïve Bayes classification performance. Criteria for class membership were defined using the expression of a reduced panel of 10 proteins able to identify key molecular classes. We examined the association between these breast cancer classes with clinicopathological factors and patient outcome.

Results:

We confirm patient classification similar to established genotypic biological classes of breast cancer in addition to novel sub-divisions of luminal and basal tumours. Correlations between classes and clinicopathological parameters were in line with expectations and showed highly significant association with patient outcome. Furthermore, our novel biological class stratification provides additional prognostic information to the Nottingham Prognostic Index.

Conclusion:

This study confirms that distinct molecular phenotypes of breast cancer can be identified using robust and routinely available techniques and both the luminal and basal breast cancer phenotypes are heterogeneous and contain distinct subgroups.

### Multidimensional quantitative phenotypic and molecular analysis reveals neomorphic behaviors of p53 missense mutants [^bb099d8c]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is heterogeneous, comprising different subtypes with characteristic molecular features, prognoses, and therapy responses, broadly classified into basal-like, HER2 overexpressing and luminal types. The basal-like subtype is typically ER, PR and HER2 receptor-negative, hence, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and displays high grade, mitotic, aggressive, metastatic behavior, relapse with distant metastasis, and consequently has shorter time to progression and worse disease-free survival with the fewest treatment options –. TNBC is highly heterogeneous and in turn consists of six more subtypes, with prevalent TP53 mutations and somatic mutations in other genes, variable between and within tumors. Somatic mutations in TP53 are known to occur early in breast cancerand Ductal Carcinoma In-Situ (DCIS), preceding invasion, and the mutation frequency increases with the grade of DCIS tumors. More than 100 different TP53 missense mutations are found in 30% of all breast tumorsand occurs in 88% of basal-like, 26% of luminal, and 50% of HER2+ subtypes. TP53 mutations are also more prevalent in recurring tumors compared to primary breast tumors (41% and 23%, respectively), indicating the importance of TP53 mutations for breast tumor progression. However, the clinical significance of different missense mutations in breast cancer progression remains unclear.

### The relevance of breast cancer subtypes in the outcome of neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^aa300873]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Besides the histological subtypes, gene-expression profiling has led to the identification of five different molecular breast cancer subtypes (i.e. luminal A, luminal B, basal and HER2 subtype, and normal-like subtypes). To a degree, these molecular subtypes can be also be distinguished using immunohistochemistry. Subtyping of breast cancer by immunohistochemistry assays for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), yields three broad groups: (1) ER-positive tumors, when ER is positive and HER2 is not amplified; (2) triple-negative tumors when ER, PR, and HER2 are all negative, and (3) HER2-positive tumors, which may be ER-positive or ER-negative; The molecular subtypes have been associated with prognosis. The luminal A subtype has been shown to have a better prognosis compared with the other subtypes and the basal subgroup has the worst prognosis. Comparably, triple-negative tumors have a worse prognosis than ER-positive tumors. Research increasingly suggests that the molecular subtypes are associated with chemosensitivity. The basal and triple-negative subtypes has been shown to be more sensitive to chemotherapy than the luminal and ER-positive breast cancer.–

The aim of this manuscript was to analyze differences in the outcome of neoadjuvant chemotherapy between both histological and receptor-based subtypes. Primary outcome measures were the increase in breast-conserving therapy and pathological complete remission.

### The expression of cytokeratin 5 / 6 in invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast: evidence of a basal-like subset? [^9b294bc7]. Human Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Analysis of gene expression profiling data on breast cancers has revealed "molecular subclasses" that may have prognostic significance. The "basal-like" breast cancers, one of these molecular subclasses, have been associated with a significantly worse overall and disease-free survival as compared with most of the other subclasses. Previous studies on basal-like cancers have been performed predominantly on the ductal histotype. This study was designed to evaluate the significance of the expression of cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, a commonly used surrogate marker for the basal-like phenotype, in invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs). The immunohistochemical expression of CK5/6, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2/neu, and E-cadherin was determined in a group of 82 consecutive archived ILCs diagnosed in 82 women (age range, 29–73 years; mean, 51.9 years). All cases were E-cadherin negative. CK5/6 was positive in 14 (17%) of 82 cases and was entirely negative in the remaining 68 cases (83%). In 8 of the 14 CK5/6[+] cases, staining was diffuse and intense. In the remaining 6 cases, staining was patchy (> 1 low-power field between positive areas) but still of high intensity. CK5/6[+] cases were significantly more likely than CK5/6[-] cases to be ER[-] (43% versus 0%, respectively, P < .0001). CK5/6[+] cases were also significantly more frequently of modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson histologic grade 3, as 7 (50%) of the 14 CK5/6[+] cases were of histologic grade 3, as compared with only 6 (8.8%) of 68 of the CK5/6[-] cases (P = 0.0009). Notably, the average mitotic index in the CK5/6[+] group was 11/10 high-power fields, as compared with 7/10 high-power fields in the CK5/6[-] group (P = 0.07). Overall, there were no distinct morphological differences between the 2 groups, and both displayed the well-characterized architectural and cytologic features of ILCs. CK5/6[+] and CK5/6[-] cases did not significantly differ with respect to patient age, frequency of PR expression, tumor size, rate of axillary node involvement, or HER2/neu overexpression. In summary, the present study demonstrated that 17% of ILCs express CK5/6, and that CK5/6[+] cases are more likely to be ER[-] and have a high modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson histologic grade. Because these findings are a characteristic of ductal basal-like breast cancers, our results suggest that there is a basal-like subset for ILCs with potentially distinct clinicopathologic characteristics. Future studies are required to define the prognostic significance of CK5/6 expression in ILCs.

### A perspective on the development and lack of interchangeability of the breast cancer intrinsic subtypes [^555c3bca]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2010, a research-based study using microarray data showed that different single sample predictor (SSP) assays based on specific intrinsic gene lists presented only low to moderate IS concordance, with only Basal-like cancers consistently showing an almost-perfect agreement. This led the authors to conclude that IS are inconsistent biomarkers that could not be incorporated into clinical practice. Although none of the training sets and gene lists analyzed were specifically designed to be concordant at the individual-sample level, as we also highlighted elsewhere, many research studies had used them interchangeably. At the same time, as also observed with a different approach by Haibe-Kains et al. a certain discordance remains across several subtype classifiers, including PAM50. Again, the Basal-like subtype was consistently identified independently of the classifier used, while Luminal and HER2-Enriched subtypes were more difficult to classify. An explanation of the discordance observed with several IS predictors in discriminating between Luminal subtypes is that the major biological difference between Luminal A and B tumors resides in their differential expression of proliferation-related genes, which exhibit a continuum of expression levels. Hence different cut-offs distinguishing between a high and low proliferation level may impact on a single sample classification when different IS predictors are used. Conversely, the distinct features of the Basal-like subtype (i.e. high expression of basal cytokeratins, lack of expression of estrogen- and HER2-related genes)are likely responsible for the high levels of agreement in Basal-like identification among different IS classifiers.

### Wnt / β-catenin pathway activation is enriched in basal-like breast cancers and predicts poor outcome [^03bae736]. The American Journal of Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Although Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation has been implicated in mouse models of breast cancer, there is contradictory evidence regarding its importance in human breast cancer. In this study, invasive and in situ breast cancer tissue microarrays containing luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)(+)/ER(-) and basal-like breast cancers were analyzed for beta-catenin subcellular localization. We demonstrate that nuclear and cytosolic accumulation of beta-catenin, a read-out of Wnt pathway activation, was enriched in basal-like breast cancers. In contrast, membrane-associated beta-catenin was observed in all breast cancer subtypes, and its expression decreased with tumor progression. Moreover, nuclear and cytosolic localization of beta-catenin was associated with other markers of the basal-like phenotype, including nuclear hormone receptor and HER2 negativity, cytokeratin 5/6 and vimentin expression, and stem cell enrichment. Importantly, this subcellular localization of beta-catenin was associated with a poor outcome and is more frequently observed in tumors from black patients. In addition, beta-catenin accumulation was more often observed in basal-like in situ carcinomas than other in situ subtypes, suggesting that activation of this pathway might be an early event in basal-like tumor development. Collectively, these data indicate that Wnt/beta-catenin activation is an important feature of basal-like breast cancers and is predictive of worse overall survival, suggesting that it may be an attractive pharmacological target for this aggressive breast cancer subtype.

### Basal-HER2 phenotype shows poorer survival than basal-like phenotype in hormone receptor-negative invasive breast cancers [^37d07211]. Human Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown conflicting results on prognostic significance of basal-like breast tumors, but hormone receptor is a confusing factor in most of the prognostic evaluations. We aimed to characterize the prognostic features of basal-like tumors without the influence of hormone receptor status in a series of hormone receptor-negative breast tumors. Using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry methods, according to the expression of HER2 and basal markers (CK5/6, CK14, EGFR), we categorized 713 consecutive hormone receptor-negative invasive breast cancers into 3 subtypes: HER2 (HER2+), basal-like (HER2-, any basal marker+), and null (HER2-, all basal markers-). The HER2 phenotype was subdivided into pure-HER2 (HER2+, all basal markers-) and basal-HER2 (HER2+, any basal marker+) subgroups. Expression of p53, p63, vimentin, and BRCA1 was assessed immunochemically. Basal-like tumors showed significantly higher grade, more frequent recurrence, and higher expression of vimentin and p63 than HER2 and null phenotypes. Basal-HER2 phenotype had significantly younger mean age and expressed a higher level of p53 and vimentin like basal-like and/or HER2 phenotypes. However, unlike all the other hormone receptor-negative phenotypes, they highly expressed BRCA1. No significant difference was found in 5-year survival among basal-like and the other hormone receptor-negative phenotypes, except for basal-HER2, which showed poorer 5-year overall survival than basal-like tumors. In conclusion, although basal-like breast tumors have distinct clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features, they have similar 5-year survival compared with the other hormone receptor-negative tumors including HER2 and null phenotypes. However, there exists a small group of hormone receptor-negative tumors expressing HER2 and basal markers simultaneously. This small group of tumors showed significantly poorer 5-year overall survival than basal-like breast tumors and might require different treatment strategy.

### Triple-negative breast cancer with brain metastases: a comparison between basal-like and non-basal-like biological subtypes [^d4962c26]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

In the present study, a very homogenous group of triple-negative breast cancer patients with brain metastases was assessed. This group had the worst prognosis out of all breast cancer patients because of the poorest biological subtype and the poorest site of dissemination. We did not show statistically significant differences in DFS, OS and survival from brain metastases which could depend on the expression of basal markers. Cox multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of death from brain metastases depends on well-known clinical features, but not on biological factors. These results are in agreement with some published data. The role of KPS and the status of extracranial disease has been confirmed in our and other studies. It is possible that, in the group with such poor outcome, molecular markers are less important than strong clinical prognostic factors. However, the small number of patients was a serious limitation of our study and that is why our results require confirmation by other authors.

### Clinical significance of CD151 overexpression in subtypes of invasive breast cancer [^feff85d7]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Based on the association of α 6 β 4 integrin in mammary tumourigenesis, the relevance of CD151 in breast cancer was also hypothesised. Indeed, showed that CD151 expression is elevated in breast cancer, with even more upregulation in high-grade and oestrogen-negative subtypes including basal-like breast cancer. Moreover, it was demonstrated that loss of CD151 decreased the integrin-mediated cell migration, spreading, invasion, and signalling (through FAK, Rac1, and lck) of basal-like mammary cell lines with the effect on the subcellular distribution of α 6 integrins. The delayed breast cancer progression by CD151 ablation was also shown in mouse xenograft models established using basal-like cell line, suggesting that CD151 may be a novel therapeutic target in certain breast cancer subtypes. High expression of CD151 in high-grade breast cancer was also confirmed in the recent study by). Furthermore, in the same study, CD151 overexpression was shown to correlate with decreased survival of patients with breast cancer when assessed in 56 cases. However, the association of CD151 expression with clinical outcome as well as its significance as prognostic factor in breast cancer patients is still unclear. Moreover, a systematic approach examining the incidence of CD151 expression and the significance of CD151 on clinical outcomes in breast cancer subtypes has not been undertaken. In order to select the appropriate breast cancer patients for targeted therapy, a detailed analysis using marker-driven subtyping in patient populations is critical. Therefore, to define the prognostic impact of CD151 expression in breast cancer subtypes, we divided 886 patients with breast cancer into five subtypes and assessed the relationship of CD151 expression with clinical outcome including overall survival (OS) and disease-free progression survival in each subtype.

### Perturbation and stability of PAM50 subtyping in population-based primary invasive breast cancer [^f3cbeae9]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

An improved understanding of the commonly used PAM50 subtyping scheme in breast cancer and systematic illustrations of correlation interplay such as those presented here will aid the interpretation of tumors with seemingly disparate classifications, like clinically defined ERpHER2n tumors that are subtyped as PAM50 Basal NC, and whether these represent true biological entities. Moreover, the trends we observed in overall survival in ROR groups for the combination of PAM50 NC and PAM50 NC_2nd subtypes, as well as the demonstrated prognostic differences based on gene set perturbation, and the demonstrated potential to refine PAM50 subtyping based on tumors stable to gene set perturbations may be of interest for future clinical management. Importantly, studies such as this one challenge the conception that PAM50 subtypes are individual discrete classes and call for a shift in the way we approach the results of this classification.

### Analysis of integrin beta4 expression in human breast cancer: association with basal-like tumors and prognostic significance [^eeac701e]. Clinical Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The beta4 integrin has been implicated in functions associated with the genesis and progression of carcinomas based on data obtained from cell lines and mouse models. Data on its expression and relevance to human carcinomas, however, are relatively scant. The aim of this study was to assess its expression and prognostic significance in human breast carcinomas.

Experimental Design

We integrated data on beta4 expression from multiple gene profiling studies of breast tumors of known clinical outcome with immunohistochemical analysis of 105 breast carcinomas, and we identified genes whose expression correlates with that of beta4.

Results

The expression of both beta4 mRNA and protein is not homogeneous in breast cancer and it associates most significantly with the "basal-like" subtype of breast tumors (P = 0.008). No association between beta4 and HER2 expression was evident from either gene profiling or immunohistochemical analysis. To gain insight into the relevance of beta4 expression to human breast carcinomas, we generated a 65-gene "beta4 signature" based on integration of four published gene profiling studies that included the top 0.1% of genes that correlated with beta4, either positively or negatively. This beta4 signature predicted decreased time to tumor recurrence and survival of patients when applied to four data sets including two independent ones.

Conclusions

These observations indicate that beta4 expression in human breast cancer is restricted and associated with basal-like cancers, and they support the hypothesis that beta4 may function in concert with a discrete set of proteins to facilitate the aggressive behavior of a subset of tumors.

### Age-specific changes in intrinsic breast cancer subtypes: a focus on older women [^3ce2653f]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Breast cancer (BC) is a disease of aging and the number of older BC patients in the U.S. is rising. Immunohistochemical data show that with increasing age, the incidence of hormone receptor-positive tumors increases, whereas the incidence of triple-negative tumors decreases. Few data exist on the frequency of molecular subtypes in older women. Here, we characterize the incidence and outcomes of BC patients by molecular subtypes and age.

Patients and Methods

Data from 3,947 patients were pooled from publicly available clinical and gene expression microarray data sets. The PAM50 algorithm was used to classify tumors into five BC intrinsic subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like, and normal-like. The association of age and subtype with recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival, and disease-specific survival (DSS) was assessed.

Results

The incidence of luminal (A, B, and A+B) tumors increased with age (p < .01, p < .0001, and p < .0001, respectively), whereas the percentage of basal-like tumors decreased (p < .0001). Among patients 70 years and older, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like tumors were found at a frequency of 32%, 11%, and 9%, respectively. In older women, luminal subtypes had better outcomes than basal-like and HER2-enriched subtypes. After controlling for subtype, treatment, tumor size, nodal status, and grade, increasing age had no impact on RFS or DSS.

Conclusion

More favorable BC subtypes increase with age, but older patients still have a substantial percentage of high-risk tumor subtypes. After accounting for tumor subtypes, age at diagnosis is not an independent prognostic factor for outcome.

### Basal-like breast carcinomas: clinical outcome and response to chemotherapy [^04928720]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Grade-III invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type (IDCs-NST) constitute a heterogeneous group of tumours with different clinical behaviour and response to chemotherapy. As many as 25% of all grade-III IDCs-NST are known to harbour a basal-like phenotype, as defined by gene expression profiling or immunohistochemistry for basal cytokeratins. Patients with basal-like breast carcinomas (BLBC) are reported to have a shorter disease-free and overall survival.

Material and Methods

A retrospective analysis of 49 patients with BLBC (as defined by basal cytokeratin expression) and 49 controls matched for age, nodal status and grade was carried out. Histological features, immunohistochemical findings for oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and HER2, and clinical outcome and survival after adjuvant chemotherapy were compared between the two groups.

Results

It was more likely for patients with BLBCs to be found negative for ER (p < 0.0001), PgR (p < 0.0001) and HER2 (p < 0.01) than controls. Patients with BLBCs were found to have a significantly higher recurrence rate (p < 0.05) and were associated with significantly shorter disease-free and overall survival (both p < 0.05). In the group of patients who received anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy (BLBC group, n = 47; controls, n = 49), both disease-free and overall survival were found to be significantly shorter in the BLBC group (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

BLBCs are a distinct clinical and pathological entity, characterised by high nuclear grade, lack of hormone receptors and HER2 expression and a more aggressive clinical course. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy seems to be less effective in these tumours and new therapeutic approaches are indicated.

### Identification of key clinical phenotypes of breast cancer using a reduced panel of protein biomarkers [^c67dedee]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterised by complex molecular alterations underlying the varied behaviour and response to therapy. However, translation of cancer genetic profiling for use in routine clinical practice remains elusive or prohibitively expensive. As an alternative, immunohistochemical analysis applied to routinely processed tissue samples could be used to identify distinct biological classes of breast cancer.

Methods

In this study, 1073 archival breast tumours previously assessed for 25 key breast cancer biomarkers using immunohistochemistry and classified using clustering algorithms were further refined using naïve Bayes classification performance. Criteria for class membership were defined using the expression of a reduced panel of 10 proteins able to identify key molecular classes. We examined the association between these breast cancer classes with clinicopathological factors and patient outcome.

Results

We confirm patient classification similar to established genotypic biological classes of breast cancer in addition to novel sub-divisions of luminal and basal tumours. Correlations between classes and clinicopathological parameters were in line with expectations and showed highly significant association with patient outcome. Furthermore, our novel biological class stratification provides additional prognostic information to the Nottingham Prognostic Index.

Conclusion

This study confirms that distinct molecular phenotypes of breast cancer can be identified using robust and routinely available techniques and both the luminal and basal breast cancer phenotypes are heterogeneous and contain distinct subgroups.

### Triple-negative breast cancer: distinguishing between basal and nonbasal subtypes [^25f3ef15]. Clinical Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Triple-negative (TN; estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2 negative) cancer and basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) are associated with poor outcome and lack the benefit of targeted therapy. It is widely perceived that BLBC and TN tumors are synonymous and BLBC can be defined using a TN definition without the need for the expression of basal markers.

Experimental Design

We have used two well-defined cohorts of breast cancers with a large panel of biomarkers, BRCA1 mutation status, and follow-up data to compare the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of TN tumors expressing one or more of the specific basal markers (CK5/6, CK17, CK14, and epidermal growth factor receptor; BLBC) with those TN tumors that express none of these markers (TN3BKE-).

Results

Here, we show that although the morphologic features of BLBC are not significantly different from that of TN3BKE- tumors, BLBC showed distinct clinical and immunophenotypic differences. BLBC showed a statistically significant association with the expression of the hypoxia-associated factor (CA9), neuroendocrine markers, and other markers of poor prognosis such as p53. A difference in the expression of cell cycle-associated proteins and biomarkers involved in the immunologic portrait of tumors was seen. Compared with TN3BKE- tumors, BLBC was positively associated with BRCA1 mutation status and showed a unique pattern of distant metastasis, better response to chemotherapy, and shorter survival.

Conclusion

TN breast cancers encompass a remarkably heterogeneous group of tumors. Expression of basal markers identifies a biologically and clinically distinct subgroup of TN tumors, justifying the use of basal markers (in TN tumors) to define BLBC.

### Predicting response and survival in chemotherapy-treated triple-negative breast cancer [^5653fde9]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background:

In this study, we evaluated the ability of gene expression profiles to predict chemotherapy response and survival in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

Methods:

Gene expression and clinical–pathological data were evaluated in five independent cohorts, including three randomised clinical trials for a total of 1055 patients with TNBC, basal-like disease (BLBC) or both. Previously defined intrinsic molecular subtype and a proliferation signature were determined and tested. Each signature was tested using multivariable logistic regression models (for pCR (pathological complete response)) and Cox models (for survival). Within TNBC, interactions between each signature and the basal-like subtype (vs other subtypes) for predicting either pCR or survival were investigated.

Results:

Within TNBC, all intrinsic subtypes were identified but BLBC predominated (55–81%). Significant associations between genomic signatures and response and survival after chemotherapy were only identified within BLBC and not within TNBC as a whole. In particular, high expression of a previously identified proliferation signature, or low expression of the luminal A signature, was found independently associated with pCR and improved survival following chemotherapy across different cohorts. Significant interaction tests were only obtained between each signature and the BLBC subtype for prediction of chemotherapy response or survival.

Conclusions:

The proliferation signature predicts response and improved survival after chemotherapy, but only within BLBC. This highlights the clinical implications of TNBC heterogeneity, and suggests that future clinical trials focused on this phenotypic subtype should consider stratifying patients as having BLBC or not.

### ESR1 mutant breast cancers show elevated basal cytokeratins and immune activation [^2495b746]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, originally identified through the use of immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling. Broadly, molecular subtypes can be grouped into luminal (luminal A and luminal B), HER2-enriched and basal-like tumors, primarily driven by expression of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67. Tumors with different molecular subtypes show distinguishing clinical features and therapeutic responses, including metastatic spread and immune profiles.

The basal-like subtype, which represents 15–25% of all cases and overlaps with triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), is characterized by a unique gene expression profile similar to that of myoepithelial normal mammary cells. Basal-like breast cancers are more aggressive and patients suffer from shorter metastases-free survival compared to those with luminal subtypes. Mechanisms underlying increased invasive properties of basal-like tumors include deregulation of the CCL5/CCR5 axis, amplified EGFRkinase signaling and activation of TGF-β signaling. Despite multiple signaling aberrations providing challenges for efficient therapeutic strategies, recent studies have unveiled unique vulnerabilities of basal-like breast cancers, such as higher levels of PD-L1 expression along with constitutive IFNγ signaling activation, in line with higher immune-infiltration scores. While the FDA has granted an accelerated approval for atezolizumab, a monoclonal antibody drug targeting PD-L1, plus chemotherapy for the treatment of TNBC, the potential application of immune therapies for patients with luminal breast cancer remains largely unknown.

Among the four intrinsic subtypes, basal and luminal subtypes show opposite histochemical features and notable differences in prognosis, however there is increasing evidence that these subtypes are on a continuum of "luminal-ness" and "basal-ness" features. Models of breast cancer lineage evolution describe that basal and luminal progenitor cells are derived from the same bipotential progenitors, indicating the potential of lineage reprogramming during cancer progression. Such subtype switching during tumor evolution has been described and is critical for implementation of precision therapeutics –. A recent study by Bi et al. reported loss of luminal and gain of basal markers in endocrine resistant breast tumors. Mechanisms underlying the intrinsic subtype plasticity are largely unknown, with some exceptions. JARID1B and ARID1A have been described as essential luminal lineage driver genes and their mutations result in luminal-to-basal subtypes switches. In addition, enhancer reprogramming at GATA3 and AP1 binding sites has been highlighted as a pivotal epigenetic mechanism allowing lineage plasticity.

### Rare subtypes of triple negative breast cancer: current understanding and future directions [^71eb22bf]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes an operational term describing a heterogenous group of tumors that are unified only by their shared lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and lack of HER2 overexpression and/or HER2 gene amplification. Molecular subtyping with gene expression profiles such as PAM50 have demonstrated the majority of TNBC cancers are of the basal subtype, which typify the biologically aggressive phenotype associated with TNBC. However, within this large group of TNBC tumors are an important subgroup of histologically rare tumors which display significant histologic and clinical heterogeneity. These rare TNBC tumors collectively represent a sizeable portion of TNBCs, accounting for 7% of TNBCs in one recent series. Rare TNBCs carry a wide range of prognoses with a corresponding wide range of potential treatment options. The study of rare TNBCs has been confounded by factors including small numbers of cases, the use of overlapping or potentially related diagnoses, and variability in histologic interpretation. Contemporary tools, such as molecular classification of tumors, virtual pathology and big data, however, hold promise for advancing our knowledge about these understudied neoplasms. Here we review molecular and clinical features and treatment of more commonly encountered rare forms of TNBC, discuss how newer biomarker tools might facilitate disease management, and, finally, assess how contemporary research tools may provide disease-specific information for patients with these rare cancer types.

### Calpain system protein expression in basal-like and triple-negative invasive breast cancer [^f66e9bdd]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

introduction

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that displays a range of phenotypes with different clinical characteristics including altered clinical outcome, varying prognostic characteristics and differential response to treatment. The triple-negative and basal-like subgroups of breast cancer are of considerable clinical interest as they exhibit an aggressive phenotype and a higher metastatic potential. Triple-negative breast cancer lacks expression of both oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) and do not overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2); this subgroup accounts for 10–24% of invasive breast cancers. Although basal differentiation of breast cancer was shown in 1971, the molecular classification of distinct classes of breast cancer, including basal-like, was shown by microarray analysis in 2000 by Perou and colleagues; the results of which have been verified in subsequent studies. There is a substantial overlap between the two groups; however, not all basal-like breast cancers are triple-negative. There are currently no specific therapies for either triple-negative or basal-like breast cancer. A number of biomarkers have emerged, which show an association with clinical outcome in basal-like or triple-negative disease, including solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (OATP2) and fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7), and forkhead box protein C1 (FOXC1) in basal-like cancers. In triple-negative disease, a number of biomarkers are associated with clinical outcome including p53 and DNA repair proteins — ERCC4 (XPF), MAP kinase-activated protein-2 (pMK2), DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1 (MLH1), fanconi anaemia complementation group D2 (FANCD2) and high-molecular weight cytokeratin (34betaE12). There is a need to identify additional prognostic biomarkers to aid stratification of breast cancer patients diagnosed with triple-negative and basal-like disease, and that could potentially identify novel treatment regimens.

### Identification of a basal-like subtype of breast ductal carcinoma in situ [^204f7c7a]. Human Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Microarray profiling of invasive breast carcinomas has identified subtypes including luminal A, luminal B, HER2-overexpressing, and basal-like. The poor-prognosis, basal-like tumors have been immunohistochemically characterized as estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, HER2/neu-negative, and cytokeratin 5/6-positive and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of basal-like ductal carcinoma in situ in a population-based series of cases using immunohistochemical surrogates. A total of 245 pure ductal carcinoma in situ cases from a population-based, case-control study were evaluated for histologic characteristics and immunostained for ER, HER2/neu, EGFR, cytokeratin 5/6, p53, and Ki-67. The subtypes were defined as: luminal A (ER+, HER2-), luminal B (ER+, HER2+), HER2 positive (ER-, HER2+), and basal-like (ER-, HER2-, EGFR+, and/or cytokeratin 5/6+). The prevalence of breast cancer subtypes was basal-like (n = 19 [8%]); luminal A, n = 149 (61%); luminal B, n = 23 (9%); and HER2+/ER-, n = 38 (16%). Sixteen tumors (6%) were unclassified (negative for all 4 defining markers). The basal-like subtype was associated with unfavorable prognostic variables including high-grade nuclei (P < .0001), p53 overexpression (P < .0001), and elevated Ki-67 index (P < .0001). These studies demonstrate the presence of a basal-like in situ carcinoma, a potential precursor lesion to invasive basal-like carcinoma.

### Predicting response and survival in chemotherapy-treated triple-negative breast cancer [^0ae0c746]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In this study, we evaluated the ability of gene expression profiles to predict chemotherapy response and survival in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

Methods

Gene expression and clinical-pathological data were evaluated in five independent cohorts, including three randomised clinical trials for a total of 1055 patients with TNBC, basal-like disease (BLBC) or both. Previously defined intrinsic molecular subtype and a proliferation signature were determined and tested. Each signature was tested using multivariable logistic regression models (for pCR (pathological complete response)) and Cox models (for survival). Within TNBC, interactions between each signature and the basal-like subtype (vs other subtypes) for predicting either pCR or survival were investigated.

Results

Within TNBC, all intrinsic subtypes were identified but BLBC predominated (55–81%). Significant associations between genomic signatures and response and survival after chemotherapy were only identified within BLBC and not within TNBC as a whole. In particular, high expression of a previously identified proliferation signature, or low expression of the luminal A signature, was found independently associated with pCR and improved survival following chemotherapy across different cohorts. Significant interaction tests were only obtained between each signature and the BLBC subtype for prediction of chemotherapy response or survival.

Conclusions

The proliferation signature predicts response and improved survival after chemotherapy, but only within BLBC. This highlights the clinical implications of TNBC heterogeneity, and suggests that future clinical trials focused on this phenotypic subtype should consider stratifying patients as having BLBC or not.

### Practical classification of triple-negative breast cancer: intratumoral heterogeneity, mechanisms of drug resistance, and novel therapies [^634846e4]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to a subgroup of breast cancer (BC) defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Accounting for 15–20% of all BCs, TNBC is more prevalent in younger women, African and Hispanic descents and carriers of deleterious germline mutations in BC susceptibility genes.

Pivotal microarray profiling studies categorized BC into five intrinsic subtypes. Although the TNBC subgroup is considered a single entity based on immunohistochemistry (IHC), molecular profiling has revealed an unexpectedly level of heterogeneity. 50–75% of TNBCs have basal-like phenotype (BLBC), being characterized by the expression of genes of normal basal and myoepithelial cells. Similarly, ∼80% of BLBCs are ER-negative and HER2-negative. Even if the terms "TNBC" and "BLBC" are often used interchangeably, not all BLBCs determined by gene expression profiling (GEP) lack ER, PgR and HER2 and, conversely, not all TNBCs show a basal-like phenotype –. Moreover, another intrinsic subtype, namely claudin-low, was identified and characterized by a brisk stromal infiltration and expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and immune-response genes, while the study that provided this information included a limited number of TNBC samples. Recently, claudin-low tumors were described as enriched in metaplastic histology variants, with lower levels of genomic instability, mutational burden, and targetable driver aberrations. Although the latter study identified claudin-low subtype to be associated with poor prognosis, the heterogeneity among these studies requires further evidence to fully elucidate if the claudin low subtype can be intrinsically prognostic.

Further evidence demonstrated that TNBC is not a unique disease, encompassing multiple entities with pronounced histopathological, transcriptomic and genomic heterogeneity. Nonetheless, TNBC has been uniformly treated with chemotherapy. Exploiting TNBC diversity may help identifying new targetable pathways. Despite several efforts, these molecular classifications have remained merely theoretic and out of the clinical practice. Interestingly, potential targetable alterations have been identified across TNBC subtypes. Herein, we summarize the main evidence that defined transcriptomic and genomic heterogeneity of TNBC. Furthermore, we point out current and emerging biomarker-driven treatments for TNBC subtypes and describe the most common mechanisms of drug resistance for approved therapies in TNBC. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and possible future directions in the implementation of a biomarker-driven drug development in TNBC, potentially resulting in a practical classification of this BC subtype.

### ASCT2 / SLC1A5 controls glutamine uptake and tumour growth in triple-negative basal-like breast cancer [^6f3d7186]. Oncogene (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite being a highly heterogenous disease, the breast cancer therapeutic strategy is dictated largely by tumoral expression of only three cell surface markers: oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Tumours that lack clinically detectable expression of all three receptors are classified as triple-negative (TN) and, in the absence of any targeted therapies, rely largely on surgery, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy for their management.TN breast cancers generally display distinct features on gene expression analysis, with the PAM50 classification, and subsequent molecular profilingshowing enrichment of genes associated with proliferation, hypoxia and stem-like features. As a result, TN breast cancers have poorer prognosis overall, and are usually associated with increased recurrence and death compared with other subtypes. Attempts to stratify this generally poor-prognosis subtype into clinically useful subgroups have revealed at least seven different molecular subtypes of TN breast cancer, highlighting the need for novel and effective targeted therapies for these patients. Because glutamine dependence is increased in proliferative subtypes of breast cancer, we hypothesized that highly proliferative TN tumours may be uniquely sensitive to inhibitors of glutamine uptake.

### Antiprogestins in breast cancer treatment: are we ready? [^18f83567]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in females worldwide. It is accepted that breast cancer is not a single disease, but instead constitutes a spectrum of tumor subtypes with distinct cellular origins, somatic changes, and etiologies. Molecular gene expression studies have divided breast cancer into several categories, i.e. basal-like, ErbB2 enriched, normal breast-like (adipose tissue gene signature), luminal subtype A, luminal subtype B, and claudin-low. Chances are that as our knowledge increases, each of these types will also be subclassified. More than 66% of breast carcinomas express estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and respond to antiestrogen therapies. Most of these ER+ tumors also express progesterone receptors (PRs), the expression of which has been considered as a reliable marker of a functional ER. In this paper we will review the evidence suggesting that PRs are valid targets for breast cancer therapy. Experimental data suggest that both PR isoforms (A and B) have different roles in breast cancer cell growth, and antiprogestins have already been clinically used in patients who have failed to other therapies. We hypothesize that antiprogestin therapy may be suitable for patients with high levels of PR-A. This paper will go over the experimental evidence of our laboratory and others supporting the use of antiprogestins in selected breast cancer patients.

### Estrogen and progesterone receptor testing in breast cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology / college of American pathologists guideline update [^8d80e2db]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Nielson, Clinical Cancer Research, 2010 — PAM50 intrinsic subtyping using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays for 50 genes was completed on 786 specimens with clinical data (median follow-up, 11.7 years) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Despite clinical estrogen receptor positivity, 10% of cases were assigned to nonluminal subtypes. qRT-PCR proliferation signatures gave more prognostic information than clinical assays for hormone receptors or Ki67. In Cox models incorporating standard prognostic variables, hazard ratios for breast cancer disease-specific survival over the first 5 years of follow-up relative to luminal A were 1.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–3.64) for luminal B, 3.65 (95% CI, 1.64–8.16) for HER2-enriched subtype, and 17.71 (95% CI, 1.71–183.33) for the basal-like.

### SRY-box transcription factor 10 is a highly specific biomarker of basal-like breast cancer [^6c2087ec]. Histopathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Basal-like breast cancer is an aggressive molecular subtype associated with younger age and early relapse. Most cases lack expression of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, limiting targeted therapeutic options. Basal-like breast cancer is defined by the expression of genes in the outer/basally located epithelial layer of mammary glands, including those encoding cytokeratin (CK) 5 and CK14, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). SRY-box transcription factor 10 (SOX10), for which there is a readily available immunohistochemical stain, is expressed in a subset of breast cancers, particularly triple-negative carcinomas. In this study, we sought to: (i) assess the association between SOX10 expression and intrinsic molecular subtypes as defined by Prediction Analysis of Microarray 50 (PAM50) gene expression; and (ii) compare the performance of SOX10 with that of other surrogate markers of the basal-like subtype, including CK5, EGFR, nestin, and inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B).

Methods and Results

SOX10 immunostaining was performed on tissue microarrays constructed from a contemporary series enriched for ER-negative and weakly ER-positive cancers that had also undergone PAM50 gene profiling. A total of 211 cases were informative for both SOX10 immunohistochemistry and PAM50 subtype, including 103 basal-like cancers. Staining for SOX10 was positive in 73 of 103 basal-like cancers and in only two of 108 cancers of other subtypes (P < 0.001), resulting in a sensitivity of 70.9% and a specificity of 98.1%. SOX10 was more specific than the other tested basal markers, and the results were independent of ER status.

Conclusions

SOX10 is a moderately sensitive, but highly specific, immunohistochemical biomarker for the basal-like intrinsic subtype of breast cancer, which, unlike other commonly used immunohistochemical biomarkers, is independent of hormone receptor status.

### Insights into molecular classifications of triple-negative breast cancer: improving patient selection for treatment [^a405cf91]. Cancer Discovery (2019). Medium credibility.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains the most challenging breast cancer subtype to treat. To date, therapies directed to specific molecular targets have rarely achieved clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes of patients with TNBC, and chemotherapy remains the standard of care. Here, we seek to review the most recent efforts to classify TNBC based on the comprehensive profiling of tumors for cellular composition and molecular features. Technologic advances allow for tumor characterization at ever-increasing depth, generating data that, if integrated with clinical-pathologic features, may help improve risk stratification of patients, guide treatment decisions and surveillance, and help identify new targets for drug development. SIGNIFICANCE: TNBC is characterized by higher rates of relapse, greater metastatic potential, and shorter overall survival compared with other major breast cancer subtypes. The identification of biomarkers that can help guide treatment decisions in TNBC remains a clinically unmet need. Understanding the mechanisms that drive resistance is key to the design of novel therapeutic strategies to help prevent the development of metastatic disease and, ultimately, to improve survival in this patient population.

### Overexpression of E2F-5 correlates with a pathological basal phenotype and a worse clinical outcome [^57e9dc09]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

In contrast to ER-positive or HER2-positive breast cancers, mechanisms of cell proliferation and differentiation in breast cancers lacking ER and HER2 (ER(−)/HER2(−)) have not been well characterised. A hierarchical clustering study of gene expression by, showed that breast cancers can be clustered into four subtypes: luminal, HER2-positive, basal-like, and normal breast-like, based on their expression patterns of ER, HER2, cytokeratin (CK)5/6, and other markers. The basal-like subtype is characterised by an absence of detectable ER and HER2 expression combined with positive expression of vimentin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), CK8/18, and CK5/6. Tough 'basal-like subtype' was an originally genotypic concept; increasing studies have refined the 'basal-like subtype' as breast cancers with immunophenotype of ER/progesterone receptor (PgR)/HER2-negative breast cancers (triple-negative breast cancer; TNBC) and also positive for EGFR and/or CK5/6 expression. On the other hand, TNBC expresses a basal phenotype in 56.0% of cases compared with non-TNBC (11.5%). Thus, the relationship between breast cancers with a basal phenotype and TNBC has been identified. However, it is not fully understood how carcinoma cells can proliferate independent from ER or HER2 signalling pathways. This study focused on identifying molecules associated with cell proliferation or differentiation in ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers using oligonucleotide microarrays, quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR (qRT–PCR), and genetic alteration studies including mutation analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH).

### Differential response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy among 7 triple-negative breast cancer molecular subtypes [^f194b537]. Clinical Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The clinical relevancy of the 7-subtype classification of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) reported by Lehmann and colleagues is unknown. We investigated the clinical relevancy of TNBC heterogeneity by determining pathologic complete response (pCR) rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, based on TNBC subtypes.

Experimental Design

We revalidated the Lehmann and colleagues experiments using Affymetrix CEL files from public datasets. We applied these methods to 146 patients with TNBC with gene expression microarrays obtained from June 2000 to March 2010 at our institution. Of those, 130 had received standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had evaluable pathologic response data. We classified the TNBC samples by subtype and then correlated subtype and pCR status using Fisher exact test and a logistic regression model. We also assessed survival and compared the subtypes with PAM50 intrinsic subtypes and residual cancer burden (RCB) index.

Results

TNBC subtype and pCR status were significantly associated (P = 0.04379). The basal-like 1 (BL1) subtype had the highest pCR rate (52%); basal-like 2 (BL2) and luminal androgen receptor had the lowest (0% and 10%, respectively). TNBC subtype was an independent predictor of pCR status (P = 0.022) by a likelihood ratio test. The subtypes better predicted pCR status than did the PAM50 intrinsic subtypes (basal-like vs. non basal-like).

Conclusions

Classifying TNBC by 7 subtypes predicts high versus low pCR rate. We confirm the clinical relevancy of the 7 subtypes of TNBC. We need to prospectively validate whether the pCR rate differences translate into long-term outcome differences. The 7-subtype classification may spur innovative personalized medicine strategies for patients with TNBC.

Results

Among all 7857 invasive breast cancer cases in the 8 studies, 63.3% (n = 4490) and 7.8% (n = 550) were classified as luminal A basal-negative and luminal A basal-positive subtype, respectively (Table 1). Mean age at diagnosis was not significantly different between the two subtypes, although women with luminal A basal-positive tumours were diagnosed less frequently after 60 years compared with the women with luminal A basal-negative tumours (Table 2). Compared with the luminal A basal-negative tumours, basal-positive tumours were more likely to be smaller (OR > 2 cm vs ≤ 2 cm = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.67–1.03; P = 0.09; I² = 0%) and negative for axillary nodes (OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.67–1.02; P = 0.08; I² = 0%), however, the differences were not statistically significant. The association with tumour grade did not follow a logical trend, with luminal A basal-positive tumours showing a lower frequency of moderately differentiated tumours (OR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.60–0.94; P = 0.01), but a higher frequency of poorly differentiated tumours (OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 0.85–1.50; P = 0.42) compared with luminal A basal-negative tumours (Table 2). Study heterogeneity was not significant in the former (I 2 = 10.2% P = 0.35) but was significant in the latter association (I 2 = 63.2% P = 0.01).

### Molecular alterations in triple-negative breast cancer-the road to new treatment strategies [^afe8ee71]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Triple-negative breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and specific therapies have not been available for a long time. Therefore, conventional chemotherapy is still considered the clinical state of the art. Different subgroups of triple-negative breast cancer have been identified on the basis of protein expression, mRNA signatures, and genomic alterations. Important elements of triple-negative breast cancer biology include high proliferative activity, an increased immunological infiltrate, a basal-like and a mesenchymal phenotype, and deficiency in homologous recombination, which is in part associated with loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 function. A minority of triple-negative tumours express luminal markers, such as androgen receptors, and have a lower proliferative activity. These biological subgroups are overlapping and currently cannot be combined into a unified model of triple-negative breast cancer biology. Nevertheless, the molecular analysis of this disease has identified potential options for targeted therapeutic intervention. This has led to promising clinical strategies, including modified chemotherapy approaches targeting the DNA damage response, angiogenesis inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, or even anti-androgens, all of which are being evaluated in phase 1–3 clinical studies. This Series paper focuses on the most relevant clinical questions, summarises the results of recent clinical trials, and gives an overview of ongoing studies and trial concepts that will lead to a more refined therapy for this tumour type.

### Recent insights into the effects of metabolism on breast cancer cell dormancy [^3e3771da]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite advances in early diagnostics, anti-cancer therapeutics and improved patient outcomes, breast cancer (BC) remains a clinical problem. The charity Breast Cancer Now estimates that the number of women dying from BC each year in the UK is set to rise in 2022, with BC currently proving fatal for nearly 1000 women in the UK each month. BC is a highly multifaceted disease, with patients presenting with a variety of different physiological and morphological phenotypes. Thereby, clinical emphasis is directed at the molecular classification of BC subtypes, namely luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) enriched and basal like, each exhibiting their own prognostic implications (see Table 1).

Metastasis formation is responsible for the majority of BC mortality. BC's ability to metastasise to distant sites early on in disease progression is a key determining factor for patients. Once engrafted, BC cells (BCCs) have the capacity to remain in a state of dormancy at these distant sites, either maintained as cancer stem cells (CSCs) or existing as disseminated tumour cells (DTCs), often remaining in this dormant state for decades before growing out into aggressive macrometastatic lesions. This phenomenon of dormancy allows the BCCs to evade primary treatment(s), eventually initiating a relapse diagnosis, complicating patient treatment. Unfortunately, 20–30% of BC patients may develop metastasis after diagnosis and primary tumour treatment, with approximately 90% of BC-related fatalities attributable to metastasis, thereby further fortifying BC as a clinical issue.

### Molecular characteristics of screen-detected vs symptomatic breast cancers and their impact on survival [^1943c456]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

In recent years, microarray-based technology has resulted in the identification of clinically relevant molecular subtypes of breast cancer, providing insights into the molecular heterogeneity of the disease. Five distinct breast cancer subtypes have been identified based on gene expression signatures: luminal A, luminal B, HER2 overexpressing, basal-like and normal breast tissue-like. The differences in gene expression patterns among the subtypes reflect basic alterations in the cell biology of the tumours and have been associated with significant variation in clinical outcome. Luminal A tumours have been associated with the best prognosis whereas basal-like and HER2-overexpressing tumours show shorter disease-free intervals and worse overall survival.

Protein expression profiling using immunohistochemistry has been used to describe a similar molecular taxonomy of the disease. Luminal A and luminal B breast cancers express the oestrogen receptor (ER) and are also frequently progesterone receptor (PR) positive. HER2 expression is associated with the HER2-overexpressing and luminal B subtypes. Basal-like cancers are characteristically negative for ER, PR and HER2 expression (i.e. triple negative) but may express basal cytokeratins (CK5-6 and CK14) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this context, immunohistochemistry can be used to identify distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer, contributing to our understanding of the biological diversity of the disease.

It is currently not known whether variation in the molecular characteristics of screen-detected vs symptomatic breast cancers contributes to the differences seen in prognosis between these two groups. The aims of the present study were to examine the molecular characteristics of screen-detected vs symptomatic breast cancers and to identify if differences in tumour biology may explain some of the survival benefit conferred by screen detection.

### Management of breast cancer with targeted agents: importance of heterogeneity [^82bab6a4]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on breast cancer:

- Definition: Breast cancer is a malignant tumor arising from breast cells. The two primary types of breast cancer include ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma, originating in the milk-transporting ducts and the milk-producing lobules, respectively. It is classified as either noninvasive (carcinoma in situ) or invasive (infiltrating). Invasive breast cancer is further categorized into early breast cancer, locally advanced breast cancer, and advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Based on the expression of hormone receptors and HER2, tumors are classified into three main groups: HR-positive (luminal tumors), HER2-positive, and the remaining subtypes being collectively referred to as triple-negative breast cancer (including basal-like and claudin-low tumors).
- **Pathophysiology**: High-penetrance genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with an increased predisposition to breast cancer. Mutations in these genes increase the risk of both breast and ovarian cancers. TP53 is another critical gene associated with breast cancer risk, often correlated with more aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Additionally, several single nucleotide polymorphisms, including FGFR2, TNRC9, MAP3K1, LSP1, and CASP8, have been identified as associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
- **Epidemiology**: Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, both in women and overall, with an estimated incidence rate of 119.2 per 100,000 woman-years in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for breast cancer include age, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, genetic mutations such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, history of breast atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma in situ, increased mammographic density, prior radiation exposure, and certain lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, obesity, and lack of physical activity.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, breast cancer may present with a palpable breast mass, nipple discharge, skin changes such as erythema, peau d'orange, and ulceration, and asymmetric thickening or nodularity. Focal breast pain and axillary mass may also be present.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of breast cancer is influenced by the stage at diagnosis, with early-stage cancers generally having a better prognosis than late-stage cancers. The specific molecular characteristics of the tumor, such as hormone receptor status and HER2 status, also play a significant role in determining prognosis. Basal-like breast cancer, which is often triple-negative, is associated with a poor prognosis. The 5-year age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rate in the US is estimated at 19.6 per 100,000 female-years.

### Triple-negative breast cancer with brain metastases: a comparison between basal-like and non-basal-like biological subtypes [^106e64d1]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

There are few data in the literature concerning differences between basal-like and non-basal-like subtypes of triple-negative breast cancer according to clinical features and survival. To our knowledge, the present study is the first one analyzing such relationships in patients with brain metastases. We did not observe statistically significant differences between basal-like and non-basal-like subtypes apart from the pattern of distant metastases. Rakha et al. compared the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of triple-negative tumors depending on the expression of specific basal markers. The authors did not show any difference in morphological features between both subtypes, but basal-like breast cancer showed distinct immunophenotypical differences with the expression of several markers of poor prognosis. In addition, the authors observed a unique pattern of distant metastases of the basal-like subtype with more frequent metastasis to brain and lung. Such observations were similar to our observations. In the present study, in 35% of patients with the basal-like phenotype, the brain was the first site of distant metastasis. The high propensity of the basal-like phenotype to metastasize to the brain as the first site of distant recurrence is worth further molecular investigation. It is possible that some molecular markers allow anchor cancer cells into the brain (theory of "soil and seed"). If we knew such a molecular marker, we would be able to select a group of breast cancer patients with high risk of brain metastases in order to take preventive or screening activities.
