## Question

A 2900-g (6.4-lb) male newborn is delivered at term to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. His mother had no routine prenatal care. She reports that the pregnancy was uncomplicated apart from a 2-week episode of a low-grade fever and swollen lymph nodes during her early pregnancy. She has avoided all routine vaccinations because she believes that "natural immunity is better". The newborn is at the 35th percentile for height, 15th percentile for weight, and 3rd percentile for head circumference. Fundoscopic examination shows inflammation of the choroid and the retina in both eyes. A CT scan of the head shows diffuse intracranial calcifications and mild ventriculomegaly. Prenatal avoidance of which of the following would have most likely prevented this newborn's condition?
A. Exposure to unvaccinated children
B. Undercooked pork
C. Unprotected sexual intercourse
D. Mosquito bites

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which prenatal exposure avoidance would have most likely prevented this newborn's condition, given the clinical presentation of chorioretinitis, intracranial calcifications, and ventriculomegaly, alongside maternal early-pregnancy lymphadenopathy and fever. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which congenital infection best fits this triad. Then, I should verify the principal transmission routes for that pathogen. Next, I will compare each answer choice against those routes and the maternal history. Finally, I will select the single best preventive exposure to avoid and briefly justify why the alternatives are less likely or incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. Chorioretinitis, intracranial calcifications, and ventriculomegaly/hydrocephalus are classic manifestations of congenital toxoplasmosis, and maternal primary infection in early gestation often presents with low-grade fever and lymphadenopathy, which matches the mother's history and the neonatal findings, so congenital toxoplasmosis is the leading diagnosis here [^fc751a1c] [^859856f5] [^9b18c7db].

> Wait, let me verify the transmission routes before jumping to conclusions. Toxoplasma gondii is acquired primarily by ingestion of tissue cysts in undercooked or raw meat, by ingestion of environmentally resilient oocysts from cat feces contaminating food, water, or soil, and rarely by transfusion or organ transplantation; importantly, it is not transmitted by person-to-person contact, sexual intercourse, or mosquito bites, which helps eliminate several distractors [^9b18c7db] [^406fa49f] [^97d41eed].

> I will now examine each option against these routes. Option A, exposure to unvaccinated children, does not transmit Toxoplasma; person-to-person spread is not a recognized route, so this would not prevent congenital toxoplasmosis, even though avoiding unvaccinated contacts is important for other infections like measles or varicella [^9b18c7db]. Option B, undercooked pork, is a major source of T. gondii tissue cysts; cooking meat thoroughly and avoiding undercooked meat are cornerstone prenatal prevention messages to reduce risk of maternal acquisition and thus congenital infection, so avoiding undercooked pork directly addresses a key transmission route [^9b18c7db] [^c56faccf]. Option C, unprotected sexual intercourse, is not a route for Toxoplasma transmission, so this would not prevent this case; while important for other STIs, it is irrelevant here [^9b18c7db]. Option D, mosquito bites, relates to vector-borne diseases like Zika or malaria, not Toxoplasma, so avoiding bites would not prevent congenital toxoplasmosis in this scenario [^9b18c7db].

> Hold on, I should double-check that I'm not missing a nuance. Could the maternal illness reflect another TORCH agent with overlapping features, like CMV or Zika, that might change the best preventive answer? CMV can cause calcifications and hearing loss but is not linked to undercooked meat exposure, and Zika is vector-borne with a different epidemiology; neither would make "undercooked pork" less correct for toxoplasmosis prevention, reinforcing that the most targeted, evidence-based answer remains avoidance of undercooked meat [^9b18c7db] [^2b5096e1].

> Therefore, the most likely preventable exposure that, if avoided, would have reduced the risk of this newborn's congenital toxoplasmosis is undercooked pork, corresponding to option B [^9b18c7db] [^c56faccf].

The newborn's findings — chorioretinitis, intracranial calcifications, and ventriculomegaly — are classic for **congenital toxoplasmosis** [^fc751a1c], which is most strongly linked to maternal ingestion of **undercooked meat** (especially pork) during pregnancy [^9b18c7db] [^406fa49f]. The mother's early-pregnancy fever and lymphadenopathy fit primary Toxoplasma infection, and her lack of prenatal care increased the risk of untreated maternal infection and vertical transmission [^da387d7b]. Avoiding undercooked pork is the most effective prenatal measure to prevent this outcome, whereas exposure to unvaccinated children, unprotected sex, and mosquito bites are not established routes of Toxoplasma transmission [^9b18c7db].

---

## Clinical manifestations and diagnosis

- **Chorioretinitis**: Inflammation of the choroid and retina, often bilateral, is a hallmark of congenital toxoplasmosis and can lead to visual impairment or blindness [^fc751a1c].

- **Intracranial calcifications**: Diffuse intracranial calcifications, particularly in the basal ganglia and periventricular regions, are characteristic of congenital toxoplasmosis [^fc751a1c].

- **Ventriculomegaly**: Enlargement of the cerebral ventricles, often due to hydrocephalus, is a common neurological complication [^fc751a1c].

- **Maternal history**: The mother's report of low-grade fever and swollen lymph nodes during early pregnancy is consistent with primary Toxoplasma infection, which poses a significant risk of vertical transmission to the fetus [^9b18c7db].

## Transmission routes of toxoplasma gondii

Toxoplasma gondii is transmitted to humans primarily through the following routes:

| **Transmission route** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Undercooked meat | Consumption of raw or undercooked meat, particularly pork, lamb, and venison, containing Toxoplasma cysts [^9b18c7db] [^406fa49f] |
| Cat feces | Contact with cat litter or soil contaminated with oocysts from cat feces [^9b18c7db] [^97d41eed] |
| Contaminated water or food | Ingestion of contaminated water or unwashed fruits and vegetables [^9b18c7db] [^406fa49f] |
| Mother-to-child transmission | Vertical transmission from mother to fetus during pregnancy, particularly if the mother acquires primary infection during gestation [^9b18c7db] [^da387d7b] |

---

## Analysis of answer choices

- **A. Exposure to unvaccinated children**: There is no established link between exposure to unvaccinated children and congenital toxoplasmosis. This option is not supported by current evidence.

- **B. Undercooked pork**: Consumption of undercooked pork is a well-documented risk factor for Toxoplasma infection. Avoiding undercooked meat, particularly pork, is a key preventive measure during pregnancy [^9b18c7db] [^c56faccf].

- **C. Unprotected sexual intercourse**: Sexual transmission of Toxoplasma gondii is not a recognized route of infection. This option is incorrect.

- **D. Mosquito bites**: Toxoplasma gondii is not transmitted through mosquito bites. This option is irrelevant.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely preventable exposure that could have prevented this newborn's condition is **undercooked pork**. Pregnant women should be counseled to avoid consuming raw or undercooked meat, particularly pork, to reduce the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis [^9b18c7db] [^c56faccf]. Additionally, proper hand hygiene, thorough washing of fruits and vegetables, and avoidance of contact with cat litter are essential preventive measures [^c56faccf].

Congenital toxoplasmosis — predictors of chorioretinitis — Risk decreased by 3% for each additional gestational week at maternal primary infection (OR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.93–1.00 per week; P = 0.04), and was estimated to be 2.1 times higher when maternal primary infection occurred before versus after 20 weeks. Independent predictors included delay in maternal treatment of more than 8 weeks after maternal seroconversion and intracranial calcifications at birth (HRs [95% CIs]: 2.54 [1.14–5.65] and 4.3 [1.9–10], respectively). The risk was 3.6 times higher if the infant had additional clinical manifestations of CT at birth (head ultrasonographic abnormalities, serious neurologic findings, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly).

Congenital toxoplasmosis occurs following transplacental transfer of Toxoplasma gondii Irrespective of symptom status at birth, infants with congenital infection may develop serious long-term sequelae, including learning disability, seizures, hydrocephalus, motor and hearing deficits, chorioretinitis and retinal scarring with impaired vision. Timely diagnosis facilitates early initiation of therapy, aimed at prevention or amelioration of adverse clinical consequences. Diagnosis can be difficult, however, since acutely infected mothers are often asymptomatic and laboratory testing can be complex. Moreover, any decision to start treatment in the newborn must include careful consideration of the benefits and risks. This paper outlines a structured approach for managing an infant born to a woman with possible or confirmed T. gondii infection during pregnancy, including key aspects of the antenatal history, interpretation and timing of investigations, treatment and appropriate follow-up. Our recommendations are based on current evidence in the literature, consensus from two UK paediatric infectious disease centres and the UK specialist Toxoplasma Reference Unit.

### Newborn screening for congenital infectious diseases [^fc751a1c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Toxoplasmosis infection during pregnancy can cause congenital infection and manifestations, such as mental retardation and blindness. Hydrocephalus, intracranial calcification, and retinochoroiditis are the most common manifestations of tissue damage from congenital toxoplasmosis. However, the effect of prenatal treatment on these outcomes is unclear, and the best method for preventing and controlling congenital toxoplasmosis is controversial. A neonatal screening program based on detecting immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii alone would identify 70%–80% of congenital toxoplasmosis cases. Moreover, prenatal screening has indicated neither the natural history of toxoplasmosis nor the efficacy of antiparasite treatment during pregnancy. A study by Guerina et al. showed a prevalence of congenital toxoplasmosis of 1 per 10,000 live births in the United States, where 85% of women of childbearing age are susceptible to acute infection with T. gondii.

Congenital Chagas disease has been reported, mostly in Latin America, where approximately 20 million persons are affected; 90 million others are at risk of being infected by the parasite. The high prevalence of the disease has been demonstrated in several Latin American countries. The evolution of the congenital and reactive forms of the disease has yet to be determined. The vertical transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi cannot be prevented, but early detection and treatment of congenital infection achieve cure rates close to 100%. Persons infected by T. cruzi can be successfully treated with nifurtimox or benzonidazole.

Cytomegalovirus is the most common congenital virus infection in the world. Both primary and recurrent infection can result in fetal infection. The birth prevalence of congenital cytomegalovirus infection varies from 0.3% to 2.4%, and at least 90% of congenitally infected infants have no clinical signs. The disease causes illnesses ranging from no clinical signs to prematurity, encephalitis, deafness, hematologic disorders, and death. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is described in 30,000 to 40,000 newborns each year in the United States; approximately 9,000 of these children have permanent neurologic sequelae. The death rate of symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection is approximately 30%. The value of vaccination against congenital cytomegalovirus infection is not known, and screening of newborn infants has been recommended to indicate infants at high risk for deafness and to make early rehabilitation possible.

Pregnancy surveillance for suspected T. gondii infection — In cases of suspect primary or symptomatic reactivation during pregnancy, detailed ultrasound examination of the fetus specifically evaluating for hydrocephalus, cerebral calcifications, and growth restriction should be done monthly regardless of gestational age at the time of diagnosis (AIII), and patients should undergo an amniocentesis with PCR testing for T. gondii DNA in the amniotic fluid; amniocentesis does not appear to increase the risk of perinatal HIV transmission, particularly in people receiving ARV therapy, and PCR of amniotic fluid can be considered during gestation in pregnant women on ARV therapy with serologic evidence of recently acquired Toxoplasma infection, women suspected to have reactivated their Toxoplasma latent infection during pregnancy, and those with ultrasound findings suggestive of fetal T. gondii infection (BIII); to minimize false-negative results, amniotic fluid testing for T. gondii PCR should be avoided at less than 18-week gestation.

Toxoplasma gondii in pregnancy — diagnostic evaluation for HIV-infected women emphasizes that detailed ultrasound examination of the fetus specifically evaluating for hydrocephalus, cerebral calcifications, and growth restriction should be done for HIV-infected women with suspected primary or symptomatic reactivation of T. gondii during pregnancy (AIII). Prenatal diagnosis requires an amniocentesis with PCR testing for T. gondii DNA in the amniotic fluid, and amniocentesis does not appear to increase the risk of perinatal HIV transmission, particularly in women receiving HAART. PCR of amniotic fluid can be considered during gestation in pregnant women on ART with serologic evidence of recently acquired infection, women suspected to have reactivated their toxoplasma latent infection during pregnancy, and those with ultrasound findings suggestive of fetal T. gondii infection (BIII). Amniotic fluid testing for T. gondii PCR should be avoided at less than 18-week gestation, and because the risk for transmission with chronic infection that does not reactivate during gestation appears to be low, routine fetal evaluation for infection with amniocentesis is not indicated. Pediatric-care providers should be informed about HIV-infected mothers who have suspected or confirmed T. gondii infection to allow evaluation of their neonates for evidence of congenital infection (AIII).

Congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) — severity among referred U.S. cases and symptomatic rates indicates that 85% of 164 infants identified over a period of 15 years were severely affected, with 92% having chorioretinitis, 80% intracranial calcifications, 68% hydrocephalus, and 62% having all these manifestations; these cases were not population based. In the New England Newborn Screening Program (1986–1992), symptomatic CT was 40% (25% with eye disease at birth or follow-up and 29% with central nervous system [CNS] disease).

### Efficacy of amniotic fluid, blood and urine samples for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in pregnant women candidates for amniocentesis using serological and molecular techniques [^d3e59f4f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

An abnormally low birth weight, swollen lymph nodes, bruises, jaundice, anemia, enlarged liver or spleen, retinal damage, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, intellectual disabilities, seizures, developmental delays, hearing loss and even fetal death are the main clinical manifestations of congenital toxoplasmosis while primary contamination can occur throughout pregnancy. However, early diagnosis of the disease in the mother and fetus and followed by appropriate anti-parasitic treatment, can largely decrease the risk of transmission and prevent the occurrence of these symptoms.

The detection of anti- Toxoplasma antibodies through serological tests is a common laboratory diagnostic method used in clinical practice to analyze blood samples for Toxoplasma infection. However, because of the low sensitivity of serological tests and the lack of determining the acute form of the disease, the confirmation of these findings necessitates the detection of T. gondii DNA in the amniotic fluid through the utilization of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Molecular tests conducted on amniotic fluid demonstrate a positive predictive value and specificity of 100%, while the negative predictive value and sensitivity are reported as 88% and 64%, respectively. Despite the satisfactory outcomes demonstrated by molecular techniques, it is crucial to highlight that amniocentesis stands out as a highly invasive sampling procedure in pregnancy, with a documented miscarriage rate of 1.4%. Hence, an alternative sample method that is secure, low-risk, and sensitive could potentially substitute the invasive technique of amniocentesis. Prior research has demonstrated that toxoplasmosis diagnosis can be achieved through the utilization of semi-invasive and risk-free samples like blood, urine, and tear specimens. These alternative samples have yielded satisfactory outcomes in certain previous studies.

Various molecular diagnostic techniques, such as PCR, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), microsatellite PCR, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), nested PCR (nPCR), and the more recent quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) method, are employed for the identification of the T. gondii parasite. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of T. gondii infection in various clinical samples, including invasive (amniotic fluid, buffy coat and plasma) and non-invasive (urine) specimens, using serological and molecular techniques. The study focused on pregnant women who were candidates for amniocentesis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^859856f5]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Clinical manifestations — congenital and postnatal toxoplasmosis in children are described as follows: In studies of non-immunocompromised infants with congenital toxoplasmosis, most infants (70%–90%) are asymptomatic at birth, yet most asymptomatic children develop late sequelae with onset ranging from several months to years after birth; presentations include generalized disease or predominantly neurologic disease, with symptoms such as maculopapular rash, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, hematologic abnormalities including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, and substantial central nervous system (CNS) disease including hydrocephalus, intracerebral calcification, microcephaly, chorioretinitis, and seizures. Toxoplasmosis acquired after birth most often is initially asymptomatic, and when symptoms occur they are frequently nonspecific and can include malaise, fever, sore throat, myalgia, cervical lymphadenopathy, and a mononucleosis-like syndrome with a maculopapular rash and hepatosplenomegaly; Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) should be considered in all HIV-infected children with new neurologic findings, but especially those with severe immunosuppression.

### A 12-day-old male newborn with extensive vesicles and fever [^a0ac50c5]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Neonatal varicella infection is a rare condition since vaccine introduction. The authors report the case of a 12-day-old male who presented with a fever and generalised vesicular eruption. The patient's mother had varicella infection 1 day before delivery without treatment. The neonate initially did not receive prophylaxis or treatment. He subsequently was started on intravenous acyclovir and recovered without further complications or sequelae. Prompt diagnosis and treatment for maternal prenatal varicella infection is necessary to prevent infection in the newborn, and healthcare provider awareness to avoid nosocomial transmission.

Congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) — first‑trimester fetal outcomes with antepartum treatment indicate that among fetuses infected in the first trimester with normal fetal ultrasonograms, 97% (35 of 36) were either completely asymptomatic (78% [28 of 36]) or only slightly affected at birth (19% [7 of 36] with chorioretinitis and/or moderate ventricular dilatation), and all mothers received antepartum treatment; population data described a fetal loss rate of 0.9% (N = 18) and a pregnancy termination rate of 1% (N = 21), with a similar reported fetal death rate in the SYROCOT consortium (~2%; 22 terminations of pregnancy [1%] and 13 fetal deaths [0.7%] among the 1745 pregnant women with primary T gondii infections from 26 international cohorts).

Congenital toxoplasmosis — defer postnatal treatment criteria for U.S. newborns: Cautious use of this "defer treatment" strategy is advised, and according to PAMF-TSL all of the following should be fulfilled before deciding to defer treatment: acute primary maternal infection most likely acquired in the first or second trimester; negative amniotic fluid (AF) PCR assay result at ≥ 18 weeks; no laboratory evidence of congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) in the newborn with positive neonatal Toxoplasma IgG at lower titers than maternal IgG but negative Toxoplasma IgM and IgA; and no clinical signs or symptoms of CT at birth after a complete clinical and radiologic evaluation (head ultrasonography may be used). The negative predictive value (NPV) of a negative AF PCR for infections acquired in the first and second trimester is described as nearly 100%, and when all criteria are met, the risk of fetal T gondii infection is nearly zero; however, if maternal primary infection occurred in the third trimester, even a negative AF PCR cannot completely exclude fetal infection, and because the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and fetal infection increases steeply with advancing gestational age, the decision to defer treatment should be carefully discussed with parents in those settings.

### A multicenter survey on toxoplasmosis knowledge among pregnant women in Poland (the TOWER study) [^a7eef49e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Regarding the question about the transmission route of T. gondii, 84.5% of women responded that it was transmitted via a domestic cat, and 46.7% pointed at eating raw or undercooked meat. Only 0.6% of the participants thought the parasite was spread through insect bites and 5.2% did not have knowledge on the subject.

The total of 84.3% of the surveyed did not know toxoplasmosis symptoms, and 12.0% stated that they did not present any symptoms of the disease. The pregnant women reported that the symptoms of toxoplasmosis included enlarged lymph nodes (3.4%), diarrhea (1.3%), and constipation (0.4%).

Among the preventative measures against toxoplasmosis, the respondents most frequently enumerated: avoiding contact with cats (83.9%), personal hygiene (46.0%), avoiding consumption of raw meat (45.8%), avoiding sandy beaches (4.9%), and avoiding contact with previously infected patients (0.4%).

In general, 83.2% of the participants believed that toxoplasmosis might be dangerous during pregnancy and according to 49.9% infection with the parasite could cause premature labor or miscarriage. When asked whether toxoplasmosis was a cause of any developmental defects in children (epilepsy, hypopigmentation, cataract, hydrocephalus, or heart defects), the vast majority of respondents (84.7%) reported no knowledge; 13.1% indicated heart defects as a potential consequence of toxoplasmosis, 11.4% pointed at hydrocephalus, 3.9% at epilepsy, and 1.3% at smallpox.

In the studied group, 83% did not know which trimester of pregnancy was associated with the greatest fetal risk related to the disease, whereas 17% indicated the first trimester.

### Management of toxoplasma gondii infection during pregnancy [^8195f0de]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Acute infection with Toxoplasma gondii during pregnancy and its potentially tragic outcome for the fetus and newborn continue to occur in the United States, as well as worldwide, despite the fact that it can be prevented. The infection can be acquired through ingestion of infected, undercooked meat or contaminated food or water. Transmission to the fetus occurs almost solely in women who acquire their primary infection during gestation and can result in visual and hearing loss, mental and psychomotor retardation, seizures, hematological abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, or death. Systematic education and serological screening of pregnant women are the most reliable and currently available strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and early treatment of the infection in the offspring; this is largely because toxoplasmosis in pregnant women most often goes unrecognized. Treatment of the infection in the fetus and infant during the first year of life has been demonstrated to significantly improve the clinical outcome.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis in the United States [^08f3fdc9]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

European cohorts — antepartum treatment exposure and analytic constraints are described. In the analyzed European cohorts, only 18% of the pregnant women (307 of 1745) across the 26 cohorts were untreated, and only one-third (164 of 550) of the infants with CT were born to mothers who had not received antepartum treatment. This finding might have limited the study power to detect statistically significant differences between prenatal treatment and no treatment on clinical manifestations of CT, and epidemiologic studies that excluded severe cases and attempted to estimate the risk of symptomatic disease in groups of treated infants with CT reported only a weak effect for antepartum treatment.

### Congenital lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus: when to consider the diagnosis [^c6807e0d]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is a rodent-borne arenavirus that can cause congenital infection affecting the developing central nervous system. When the infection occurs during pregnancy, the virus targets the fetal brain and retina, potentially causing ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. It has been previously suggested that lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus be added to the list of congenital infections currently included in the TORCH acronym (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes, and syphilis). We present 2 neonates with antenatally known ventriculomegaly that were diagnosed with congenital lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection after birth. In addition to ventriculomegaly, one had nonimmune hydrops fetalis and the other had intracranial hemorrhage. In view of the seroprevalence of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (4.7%-10%), our findings suggest that screening for congenital lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection should be considered in fetuses and newborns with ventriculomegaly as well as other abnormal neuroimaging findings such as intracranial hemorrhage.

Toxoplasmosis in pregnancy and newborns — management and empiric therapy: Pregnant women with suspected or confirmed primary toxoplasmosis and newborns with possible or documented congenital toxoplasmosis should be managed in consultation with an appropriate infectious disease specialist, and although controversy exists, most experts would recommend such therapy for pregnant women who have acute toxoplasmosis in an attempt to prevent infection of the fetus (BII). Empiric therapy should be strongly considered for newborns of HIV-infected mothers who had symptomatic or asymptomatic primary Toxoplasma infection during pregnancy, regardless of whether treatment was administered during pregnancy (BIII).

Congenital toxoplasmosis — diagnostic criteria and infant evaluation — states that infants with suspected/proven congenital toxoplasmosis may need management in consultation with reference centers; diagnostic criteria include any of the following: persistence of positive Toxoplasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies beyond 12 months of age, positive Toxoplasma IgG with positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) and/or immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies, positive Toxoplasma PCR from amniotic fluid, peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, or other body fluids, or positive neonatal Toxoplasma IgG with negative IgM and IgA plus serologic evidence of acute maternal T gondii infection during pregnancy and compatible clinical manifestations. Evaluation at the National Reference Laboratory for Toxoplasmosis and the Toxoplasmosis Center includes detailed physical, neurologic, ophthalmologic (preferably by a retinal specialist), and brainstem auditory testing, with imaging by computed tomography of the head (or head ultrasonography) and abdominal ultrasonography. If congenital toxoplasmosis has not been confirmed but also has not been ruled out, serial IgG antibody titers are obtained every 4 to 6 weeks after birth until complete disappearance of Toxoplasma IgG antibodies; treatment of infants with suspected congenital toxoplasmosis is continued for 12 months.

Effect of antepartum treatment on the risk of symptomatic congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) — multicenter European data — shows an association with reduced severe outcomes. An analysis of "293 infants with CT from 14 European centers in 6 countries" found antepartum treatment "associated with lower odds of severe neurologic sequelae or death (SNSD; OR adjusted for gestational age at maternal seroconversion: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.07–0.71; 10 cases of SNSD per 104 untreated CT cases versus 13 SNSD per 189 treated CT cases)", though "the study included only 23 such very severely affected cases of CT, and of these, there were 9 pregnancy terminations". The composite SNSD outcome "included the following outcomes: pediatric report at any age of microcephaly; insertion of intraventricular shunt, an abnormal or suspicious neurodevelopmental examination…; severe bilateral visual impairment in both eyes assessed after 3 years; cerebral palsy; or death from any cause before 2 years of age, including termination of pregnancy".

### Risk factors for toxoplasma gondii infection in mothers of infants with congenital toxoplasmosis: implications for prenatal management and screening [^3ea98fbf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether demographic characteristics, history of exposure to recognized transmission vehicles, or illness that was compatible with acute toxoplasmosis during gestation identified most mothers of infants with congenital toxoplasmosis.

Study Design

Mothers of 131 infants and children who were referred to a national study of treatment for congenital toxoplasmosis were characterized demographically and questioned concerning exposure to recognized risk factors or illness.

Results

No broad demographic features identified populations that were at risk. Only 48% of mothers recognized epidemiologic risk factors (direct or indirect exposure to raw/undercooked meat or to cat excrement) or gestational illnesses that were compatible with acute acquired toxoplasmosis during pregnancy.

Conclusion

Maternal risk factors or compatible illnesses were recognized in retrospect by fewer than one half of North American mothers of infants with toxoplasmosis. Educational programs might have prevented acquisition of Toxoplasma gondii by those mothers who had clear exposure risks. However, only systematic serologic screening of all pregnant women at prenatal visits or of all newborn infants at birth would prevent or detect a higher proportion of these congenital infections.

Additionally, only 49% of mothers of infants with CT with serologically documented acute T gondii infection acquired from oocysts reported significant exposure risk factors, and tests to detect antibodies to sporozoite-specific antigens are performed only in research laboratories.

### Prenatal toxoplasma gondii [^6c408b51]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

As the authors have concluded in this fascinating and thought-provoking study, "only systematic screening of pregnant women and/or a vaccine have the potential to prevent the fetal disease caused by acquisition of T. gondii during gestation by pregnant women in North America" [1]. Years ago, the French medical and public health authorities accepted the concept of perinatal screening and treatment to reduce the incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis. The current state of screening technology has evolved, and the economic argument against widespread screening appears to be dated. In the United States, can future mothers and their offspring afford to wait years for additional data to be accumulated from long-term, well-designed randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of both perinatal screening and treatment? Can this society afford the cost of funding these studies along with the additional financial and social burden of life-long support for those individuals who experience the major sequelae of congenital toxoplasmosis? It is time for these concepts to be seriously and carefully revisited in the United States.

### Chorioretinal dysplasia, hydranencephaly, and intracranial calcifications: pseudo-TORCH or a new syndrome? [^af1afd0c]. Eye (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the association of severe chorioretinal dysplasia, hydranencephaly, microcephaly, and intracranial calcification in children with no evidence of intrauterine infections.

Methods

Two unrelated female infants with visually inattentive behaviour, hydranencephaly, and intracranial calcification were referred for an ophthalmological opinion.

Results

The fundus examination and computerised tomograms (CT scans) of head were similar in both children. There was bilateral extensive chorioretinal dysplasia, intracranial calcifications, and hydranencephaly. Serology was negative for acquired intrauterine congenital infections.

Conclusions

We report two cases that may represent a new syndrome or the more severe end of the spectrum of the pseudo-TORCH (toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex) syndrome. The association of chorioretinal dysplasia with the pseudo-TORCH syndrome has not been reported previously.

### Two infants with presumed congenital zika syndrome, brownsville, Texas, USA, 2016–2017 [^4f868885]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Making a diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome is challenging, despite testing and imaging available in a well-resourced area, such as the United States, which emphasizes the role of clinical and epidemiologic circumstances as critical pieces for a presumptive diagnosis. Diagnosis is needed not only epidemiologically, but also longitudinally for follow-up of associated problems with congenital Zika virus infection, which have been reported as a constellation of malformations and clinical symptoms involving the brain, craniofacial defects, nervous system, eyes, and limbs (, –, –).

Both infants reported in our case series had findings of congenital Zika syndrome (Figures 1, 2). Results of neuroimaging performed prenatally for both infants were consistent with the presence and degree of microcephaly observed postnatally. Calcifications identified prenatally in case-patient 1 had consistent postnatal distribution at the subcortical white matter–gray matter junction. Case-patient 2 had changes in the presence of calcifications seen during prenatal ultrasonography that were not present by postnatal imaging. In addition, prenatal diagnosis of arthrogryposis was not made because of spontaneous movement of all extremities on prenatal ultrasonographic images. This limitation illustrates that the spectrum of congenital Zika syndrome cannot be fully assessed until further postnatal assessment and highlights the need for advanced neuroimaging.

However, despite the neonatal diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome, results for maternal testing were not consistent. The first case-patient had maternal laboratory findings of probable flavivirus infection that was not identified until the third trimester. The first IgM screening (at 28 weeks' gestation) might have shown a false-negative result, or the infection might have occurred later. However, even without definitive evidence of maternal Zika virus infection at the time of delivery, the neonate showed a positive result for Zika IgM in serum, and a subsequent placental test showed a positive result, which confirmed maternal infection.

Maternal diagnosis for case-patient 2 was confirmed with positive PCR results for serum at 23 weeks' gestation. However, despite this newborn displaying more severe features of congenital Zika syndrome postnatally (redundant scalp skin, bilateral upper arm arthrogryposis, smaller head size, and extrapyramidal symptoms), results of serum testing for Zika virus infection were negative.

In conclusion, results for these 2 case-patients indicate the complexity and challenges of screening and diagnostic testing for congenital Zika syndrome and illustrate the need for clinical findings and epidemiologic history. We advise a high index of suspicion for congenital Zika syndrome for at-risk populations on the basis of current limitations of testing.

### Imaging of congenital zika virus infection: the route to identification of prognostic factors [^327bfd82]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as a novel teratogenic agent associated with severe neurological complications. The risk associated with maternal infection remains to be exactly defined but appears to be significant. Like other TORCH agents (toxoplasmosis, other agents, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex), it is unlikely that all affected fetuses will be symptomatic at birth. It is therefore urgent to better define the spectrum of anomalies observed in infected fetuses to provide adequate parental counseling. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of major cases described to date and highlight specific prenatal and postnatal radiological findings of congenital ZIKV infection. A total of 19 reports were included in our analysis. ZIKV seemed to harbor a specific tropism for the central nervous system, and anomalies were mostly limited to the brain. Major radiological findings were ventriculomegaly, diffuse calcifications and signs of abnormal gyration as well as cortical development. In addition, a significant number of fetuses suffered from intra uterine growth restriction. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations for adequate radiological monitoring of at-risk pregnancies. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Global seroprevalence of toxoplasma gondii in pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^97d41eed]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Toxoplasmosis is an infectious-parasitic disease in humans and animals, caused by Toxoplasma gondii (TG). Felines are the only definitive hosts of this parasite and other vertebrates are considered intermediate hosts. TG infection is transmitted through the presence of oocytes in water and food or soil (contaminated with cat feces), raw meat, organ transplantation, blood transfusion, and also placenta to fetus transfer during pregnancy.

Toxoplasmosis can affect healthy and immunocompromised individuals and can also be a life-threatening disease in immunosuppressed individuals. The parasite is transmitted through raw meat containing TG cysts or water containing oocysts from cat feces. Although felines are the only definitive host, TG can infect and replicate in almost any nucleated vertebrate cell. The life cycle TG has an asexual phase that occurs in nucleated cells and a sexual phase in the digestive tract of cats. Fertilized gametes from sexual reproduction are produced in the cat's small intestine, and excreted oocysts can persist in the environment for up to 18 months. Both waterborne and foodborne transmission have been reported.

This pathology is demonstrated in three forms of acute, latent, or cutaneous. Although TG infection is often asymptomatic, the acute type of TG infection is resembling the Influenza symptoms such as fever, sore throat, weakness, inflamed lymph nodes, and muscle pain. However, Toxoplasmosis is more severe in immunocompromised individuals with detrimental effects on the fetus.

Toxoplasmosis is often self-limiting in people with healthy immune systems, but it is a significant risk in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women. Acute TP is associated with many complications for the fetus and pregnant mother. The risk of vertical transmission of TG from the placenta to the fetus increases from 25% in the first to 65% in the third trimesters followed by more severe complications such as miscarriage, premature birth, congenital-related Toxoplasmosis, retinopathy, neuropathy, homeopathy, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, and cerebral calcification. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of acute Toxoplasmosis in pregnant women are necessary to reduce the severity of complications.

### Recent advances in the prevention and treatment of congenital cytomegalovirus infections [^ed585951]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Continued but slow progress has led to recent advances in our understanding that congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has occurred. We understand that the most severe congenital disease occurs following a primary maternal infection during pregnancy. We now have the ability to accurately diagnosis a primary maternal infection using serologic studies of single serum sample. For pregnant women with young children, we know that child-to-mother CMV transmission can probably be prevented by hygienic intervention, and that for pregnant women who have acquired a primary CMV infection, mother-to-fetal transmission is probably preventable using CMV hyperimmune globulin. Although additional studies are needed, treatment of congenitally infected fetuses or newborns should be possible using either CMV hyperimmune globulin or antiviral agents such as ganciclovir or its derivates. Finally, recent evidence indicates that CMV replicates in the placenta, impairs development, and causes inflammation and dysfunction. This plus the reversibility of many manifestations of congenital infection in the fetus and newborn indicate that congenital CMV disease is in part a syndrome of placental insufficiency.

### Association between preterm-birth phenotypes and differential morbidity, growth, and neurodevelopment at age 2 years: results from the INTERBIO-21st newborn study [^5420f1db]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

In this study, the dominant pathologic characteristics in the remaining phenotypes (3 maternal, 3 fetal, and 1 placental)commonly occurred with complications and comorbidities (particularly extrauterine infection, chorioamnionitis, and perinatal sepsis) that were associated with the dominant condition and preterm birth (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Nevertheless, there are sufficient data to justify targeting the main putative conditions for the prevention and clinical management of these preterm-birth phenotypes.

The present study is distinct because (1) it has a firm conceptual basis; (2) it was designed to explore a priori hypotheses associated with the heterogeneity of preterm birth; (3) it accurately estimated gestational age in all newborns; (4) it oversampled newborns with low gestational ages to maximize the number of subgroups considered very high risk; (5) it achieved a 1:4 ratio for enrolled preterm and term newborns, substantially exceeding the 1:1 target; (6) it monitored growth, morbidity, and neurodevelopment from birth to age 2 years using standardized data collection systems; and (7) it assessed neurodevelopment compared with international normative values using a validated psychometric tool.

The study's results have implications for research and clinical practice. Preterm birth is a distinct syndrome in the medical field because it is defined by time (ie, gestational age at birth rather than etiologic, clinical, nutritional, or laboratory characteristics, as with other syndromes). Hence, it is important to estimate the gestational age as accurately as possible, consistent with the 2016 WHO guidelines, and to avoid the use of low birth weight (ie, < 2500 g regardless of gestational age) as a factor. It has been asserted that low birth weight is a necessary factor to include because, in many regions of the world, gestational age cannot be reliably estimated. However, actions to minimize the incidence of preterm birth may nonetheless be taken and are warranted for a syndrome that occurs in at least 10% to 12% of all births worldwide and has serious implications for human developmental capacity. Governments, international organizations, and donors can work to improve antenatal care so that every woman receives adequate evaluation early in pregnancy.

### Effectiveness of prenatal treatment for congenital toxoplasmosis: a meta-analysis of individual patients' data [^388cfc5f]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite three decades of prenatal screening for congenital toxoplasmosis in some European countries, uncertainty remains about the effectiveness of prenatal treatment.

Methods

We did a systematic review of cohort studies based on universal screening for congenital toxoplasmosis. We did a meta-analysis using individual patients' data to assess the effect of timing and type of prenatal treatment on mother-to-child transmission of infection and clinical manifestations before age 1 year. Analyses were adjusted for gestational age at maternal seroconversion and other covariates.

Findings

We included 26 cohorts in the review. In 1438 treated mothers identified by prenatal screening, we found weak evidence that treatment started within 3 weeks of seroconversion reduced mother-to-child transmission compared with treatment started after 8 or more weeks (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% CI 0.28–0.80; p = 0.05). In 550 infected liveborn infants identified by prenatal or neonatal screening, we found no evidence that prenatal treatment significantly reduced the risk of clinical manifestations (adjusted OR for treated vs not treated 1.11, 95% CI 0.61–2.02). Increasing gestational age at seroconversion was strongly associated with increased risk of mother-to-child transmission (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.12–1.17) and decreased risk of intracranial lesions (0.91, 0.87–0.95), but not with eye lesions (0.97, 0.93–1.00).

Interpretation

We found weak evidence for an association between early treatment and reduced risk of congenital toxoplasmosis. Further evidence from observational studies is unlikely to change these results and would not distinguish whether the association is due to treatment or to biases caused by confounding. Only a large randomised controlled clinical trial would provide clinicians and patients with valid evidence of the potential benefit of prenatal treatment.

### Case report of a neonate with ocular toxoplasmosis due to congenital infection: estimation of the percentage of ocular toxoplasmosis in Greece caused by congenital or acquired infection [^78d567eb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

In order to prevent maternal infection and congenital toxoplasmosis, pregnant women should be informed of the risks of infection with T. gondii during pregnancy. They should avoid eating raw or undercooked meat, raw shellfish, and unwashed vegetables, and avoid drinking untreated water. The tissue cysts of T. gondii can be killed by heating meat. An internal temperature of meat of 56°C must be reached for at least 10 minutes. Freezing can also kill the tissue cysts of T. gondii. Freezing is needed for at least 2 days at temperatures below −12°C. Pregnant women should also avoid exposure to litters of kittens.

The incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis in Greece is low, but on the other hand congenital toxoplasmosis can cause potentially severe complications during pregnancy or after birth. Prenatal screening is important in identifying the pregnant women who are infected during pregnancy. These women in most centers receive treatment with spiramycin. Newborns with congenital toxoplasmosis in most centers are treated with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin for 1 year in order to have a better prognosis. There is no evidence, though, that prenatal or postnatal treatment has a protective effect on ocular disease. Long-term follow-up is needed for children with congenital toxoplasmosis. The overall functional prognosis of congenital toxoplasmosis in Europe and North America is good. More than 90% of children with chorioretinitis have normal vision in their best eye, and severe bilateral impairment is rare.–

### Disaster preparedness in neonatal intensive care units [^18087f76]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious epidemics (H1N1 pandemic influenza, Ebola virus disease, and other emerging infections) — pregnant women, fetuses, newborn and critically ill infants — are described as uniquely and disproportionately affected, with the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality in otherwise healthy pregnant women and their infants; experts also identified a potential risk of transmission from infected health care workers, family members, and mothers of high-risk newborn infants. Zika virus has been associated with significant congenital central nervous system abnormalities, including microcephaly, in some newborn infants of women infected during pregnancy. Other emerging infections, such as Ebola, are rare but can have severe effects; viral hemorrhagic fevers pose significant mortality risks to pregnant, laboring, and postpartum women, who may experience substantial bleeding and multiorgan system failure, and the survival of newborn infants delivered to women with confirmed Ebola virus disease is poor, with most infants stillborn or dying in the early neonatal period. Adherence to infection control practices and the use of protective personnel equipment are critical for the safety of patients, family members, hospital staff, and the community.

Other manifestations and complications in infants born to mothers infected with Zika virus during pregnancy will be described through close follow-up of these children. The government of Brazil plans to expand the support system for affected children. Further studies will define the proportion of congenital defects according to the gestational age of infection and describe the clinical outcomes.

### Guidelines for vaccinating pregnant women… [^c2574872]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Influenza
- Live attenuated influenza vaccine is contraindicated for use during pregnancy.
- Because of the theoretical risk to the fetus when MMR vaccine is administered during pregnancy, patients should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after receipt of MMR vaccine. If the vaccine is inadvertently administered during pregnancy or a pregnancy occurs within 28 days of vaccination, the patient should be counseled about the theoretical risk to the fetus. MMR vaccination during pregnancy should not be considered a reason to terminate pregnancy.
- Wild-type varicella poses a low risk to the fetus. Because the virulence of the attenuated virus used in the vaccine is less than that of the wild-type virus, the risk to the fetus, if any, should be even lower.
- Routine pregnancy testing of women of childbearing age before administering varicella vaccine is not recommended.

If a pregnant woman is inadvertently vaccinated or becomes pregnant within 4 weeks after varicella vaccination, she should be counseled about the theoretical basis of concern for the fetus; however, varicella vaccination during pregnancy should not be considered a reason to terminate pregnancy.
- Pregnant women who have had a definite exposure to smallpox virus and are, therefore, at high risk for contracting the disease, should be vaccinated. Smallpox infection among pregnant women has been reported to result in a more severe infection than among nonpregnant women. Therefore, the risks to the mother and fetus from experiencing clinical smallpox substantially outweigh any potential risks regarding vaccination. In addition, vaccinia virus has not been documented to be teratogenic, and the incidence of fetal vaccinia is low.

Although rubella vaccine virus might be excreted in human milk, the virus usually does not infect the infant. If infection does occur, it is well tolerated because the virus is attenuated. Inactivated, recombinant, subunit, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines, as well as toxoids, pose no risk for mothers who are breastfeeding or for their infants".
- " Breastfeeding is a contraindication for smallpox vaccination of the motherbecause of the theoretical risk for contact transmission from mother to infant. Yellow fever vaccine should be avoided in breastfeeding women. However, when nursing mothers cannot avoid or postpone travel to areas endemic for yellow fever in which risk for acquisition is high, these women should be vaccinated".

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^7ed395cb]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Pregnant women — Q fever in relation to pregnancy is characterized by adverse outcomes and specific management considerations: infections that occur shortly before conception or during pregnancy might result in miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation, or low birthweight, and reports describing outcomes of infected pregnant women note that none have documented an increased risk for congenital malformations because of infection; a woman with a previous infection (> 30 days before conception) with no evidence of progression to chronic disease does not require treatment during pregnancy, whereas a Q fever infection during pregnancy requires antibiotic treatment and health-care providers should consider several factors to determine the best treatment approach, with careful assessment of serologic results because the phase II antibody response is increased in patients with an acute infection but decreases during convalescence as the phase I antibody response increases; risks are highest when an acute infection occurs during the first trimester, with untreated infection in the first trimester more likely to result in miscarriage and infection later in pregnancy more likely to cause premature delivery; women infected with acute Q fever during pregnancy might be at risk for recrudescent infection during subsequent pregnancies, and pregnant women with a history of Q fever infection during a previous pregnancy should be monitored closely for recrudescent infection in all subsequent pregnancies; health-care providers should educate women of child-bearing age who receive a diagnosis of acute Q fever of potential risks to the fetus, and these women should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 1 month after diagnosis and treatment and should receive a pregnancy test to determine whether long-term antibiotic treatment is needed.

### Prenatal toxoplasma gondii [^a1602e0f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

(See the article by Boyer et al, on pages.)

One of the first lessons regarding congenital infections taught to third-year medical students on obstetrics and reinforced during their pediatric rotations are the variety and pathogenesis of perinatal viral and parasitic infections that can affect pregnant women and their fetuses. From the time of their residency training, obstetricians have been instructed to counsel their patients about strategies to reduce the risk of acquiring these infections. Ideally, these discussions should occur during visits focused on prepregnancy counseling. However, it is the standard of care to provide this information to pregnant women during early prenatal care visits.

Obstetricians focus on the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii because of the concern that maternal exposure, which is often asymptomatic, could lead to fetal infection resulting in congenital toxoplasmosis and the devastating neurologic and ocular sequelae that may occur in the affected child. Patients are counseled that avoidance of fecal contamination from cats and consumption of undercooked meat and meat products can significantly reduce the risk of exposure to this parasite. Strict avoidance strategies have been demonstrated by European investigators to be effective in reducing the rate of maternal toxoplasmosis infection.

To further reduce the disease burden of toxoplasmosis infection, the concept of prenatal serologic screening and treatment has been investigated by a number of researchers but is currently the source of significant controversy. Epidemiologic studies in Europe have supported the use of widespread serologic screening and treatment to avoid congenital toxoplasmosis. However, well-designed randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of both perinatal screening and treatment are currently lacking.

Routine prenatal screening and treatment has been the standard practice in France for many years. Currently, screening recommendations from respected authorities and professional societies in the United States, such as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, do not recommend routine serologic screening during pregnancy except in immunocompromised patients, such as human immunodeficiency virus–infected women. These US recommendations have been supported by the lack of strong scientific evidence establishing the value of more aggressive screening strategies in pregnancy and the fact that the rate of toxoplasmosis is much higher in France and Latin America than in North America.

### Clinical features and neuroimaging (CT and MRI) findings in presumed zika virus related congenital infection and microcephaly: retrospective case series study [^2b5096e1]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The main agents of congenital infections that cause brain calcifications and microcephaly (cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella, and syphilis) were investigated with paired serology (IgM and IgG antibodies to Zika virus) of both mother and newborn. If IgG antibodies to cytomegalovirus were present in both, polymerase chain reaction was conducted on urine samples. We excluded from the study those children with known causes of microcephaly other than Zika virus. Cerebrospinal fluid samples from six children were tested by IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (the new specific test for Zika virus), following the protocol of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Genetic testing is not included in the Brazilian government's protocol, and differential diagnosis is performed based on family history and imaging findings, as is done with all metabolic diseases. Other causes of microcephaly, such as prenatal and perinatal complications and exposure to licit and illicit drugs, toxic substances, and ionising radiation were excluded in the children.

Children included in this report had microcephaly or craniofacial disproportion (diagnosed by ultrasound examination during pregnancy or at birth), or both; brain imaging suggestive of congenital infection; and negative test results for other known infectious causes of microcephaly (eg, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, rubella, syphilis, and HIV).

HIV in pregnancy and congenital toxoplasmosis — risk and management thresholds are detailed: reactivations were more likely to occur if the maternal CD4+ T-lymphocyte count decreased below 200 cells/mm3 in the absence of effective anti-Toxoplasma prophylaxis, yet CT has been documented even when mothers were not severely immunosuppressed, with 6 of 10 CT cases in HIV-exposed infants occurring with maternal CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts > 200/mm3 and 1 CT case with a maternal CD4+ T-lymphocyte count > 500/mm3. In the absence of clinical trial information, the following recommendations have been made by PAMF-TSL: if the mother's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count decreases below 200 cells per mm3 in the absence of clinical manifestations of toxoplasmosis, prophylaxis with agents known to be effective against Toxoplasma (eg, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole) should be instituted; for mothers with clinical manifestations of toxoplasmosis, anti-Toxoplasma treatment with effective regimens (eg, P/S and folinic acid) should be initiated as soon as possible; and if the mother's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count remains at ≥ 200 cells per mm3, as a cautionary measure, spiramycin should be continued throughout pregnancy.

### Association between congenital toxoplasmosis and parent-reported developmental outcomes, concerns, and impairments, in 3 year old children [^a94984f9]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The purpose of prenatal and neonatal screening is to reduce the risk of functional impairment. Apart from visual impairment, we found no evidence for adverse effects of congenital toxoplasmosis on developmental outcomes, behavior, or specific impairments by three years of age. On average, infected children were no worse off, and there was no evidence that this was because they received prenatal treatment. However, we could not examine the possibility that postnatal treatment ameliorated any differences in function as all infected children were treated in infancy. In addition, we cannot rule out the possibility that we failed to detect more subtle differences that would become apparent later in childhood. Finally, clinicians need to explore ways for reducing the adverse effects of diagnosis and follow up on parental anxiety. One approach is to review whether they are being sufficiently optimistic when counseling parents about prognosis.

### Population-based surveillance for congenital zika virus syndrome: a latent class analysis of recorded cases from 2015–2018 [^08228675]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

After a cluster of microcephaly cases was first reported in Northeast Brazil in 2015, a causal relationship with Zika virus (ZIKV) was suspected, and the Brazilian Ministry of Health used the Public Health Events Register (RESP) to record data on all suspected cases of this new condition, later called Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). One of the first objectives of RESP was to provide a rapid assessment of the magnitude and geographical distribution of the epidemic and enable an early understanding of the clinical spectrum of the syndrome. For these reasons, the early notification criteria were broad to capture as many cases as possible. As with any new condition, establishing a classification based on clinical-epidemiological criteria is challenging before acquiring knowledge on the natural history of the disease and given the early limitations of diagnostic/testing capacity. The classification of suspected cases relied initially on clinical observation and imaging. The criteria were refined several times during the epidemic as knowledge gaps were filled, and many cases notified as suspected were subsequently reviewed.

Recorded suspected cases were thus later classified as (a) Confirmed cases due to aetiological identification (laboratory confirmation for ZIKV in a molecular or serological test of a sample from the mother, fetus, or newborn) or imaging and clinical examination. (b) Probable cases were those with signs or symptoms compatible with the condition but whose mothers did not report symptoms during pregnancy and had a negative or inconclusive result for a specific laboratory test for ZIKV. (c) Unconfirmed cases. Suspected cases were unconfirmed for a variety of reasons: they could have received a different diagnosis (other congenital infections, e.g. syphilis, toxoplasmosis), congenital genetic malformations, foetal alcoholic syndrome, etc. They could also have been unconfirmed because the criteria used to define microcephaly/CZS became stricter and they no longer met the criteria, or because further investigation did not find imaging results consistent with what was then perceived to be characteristic of CZS.

### The multiple negative randomized controlled trials in perinatology – why? [^5f943a15]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Many of the multicenter trials in perinatal medicine have been negative in that they have shown no benefit for the intervention relative to the control. Although a negative trial can improve patient care by the avoidance of an unnecessary treatment, most trials are designed with the intent of the intervention improving outcomes. We selectively reviewed a number of recent trials in order to identify why the trials were negative. In general, the preliminary information on which the trials were based, which was a small trial or a meta-analysis of multiple small trials, was not robust or predictive. The weak preliminary information together with limited numbers of patients, problematic primary outcomes and a poor understanding of the biology of neonatal diseases has limited the ability to reliably design trials with positive outcomes.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in pregnancy — therapies, prophylaxis, and monitoring: The effectiveness of valganciclovir treatment in the reduction of long-term neurologic sequelae remains unknown, and its use in routine clinical care is not recommended, although treatment has been reported to improve hearing and neurodevelopmental measures at age 6 months among congenitally infected neonates. CMV-specific hyperimmune globulin is not recommended for the prevention of congenital CMV infection outside of a research protocol. In cases of known maternal CMV infection, referral to a maternal–fetal medicine or infectious disease specialist may be warranted, and typically serial ultrasonographic surveillance that includes assessment of fetal anatomy (eg, the cerebral ventricles) and growth is performed. A recombinant glycoprotein, adjuvant vaccine demonstrated 50% efficacy in preventing CMV infection at 1 year in a phase II trial of seronegative women, but efficacy was not sustained and Phase III studies are needed to demonstrate efficacy and safety.

### Valacyclovir [^ce68cdf4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Clinical data over several decades with valacyclovir and its metabolite, acyclovir, in pregnant women, have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects. There are insufficient data on the use of valacyclovir regarding miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the fetus associated with untreated herpes simplex during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations).

In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with valacyclovir when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at system exposures (AUC) 4 (rats) and 7 (rabbits) times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: The risk of neonatal HSV infection varies from 30% to 50% for genital HSV acquired in late pregnancy (third trimester), whereas with HSV acquisition in early pregnancy, the risk of neonatal infection is about 1%. A primary herpes occurrence during the first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with neonatal chorioretinitis, microcephaly, and, in rare cases, skin lesions. In very rare cases, transplacental transmission can occur resulting in congenital infection, including microcephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, intrauterine growth restriction, and stillbirth. Co-infection with HSV increases the risk of perinatal HIV transmission in women who had a clinical diagnosis of genital herpes during pregnancy.

Congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) — mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) risk by timing and maternal factors is described with very low transmission when acute infection occurs very early in pregnancy and much higher later in gestation; in screened and treated cohorts, MTCT was < 5% after an acute primary maternal infection very early in pregnancy, but 15%, 44%, and 71% after maternal seroconversions at 13, 26, and 37 weeks of gestation, respectively. The risk of MTCT in untreated women may be higher, and factors associated with increased risk include acute T gondii infection during pregnancy, immunocompromising conditions, lack of antepartum treatment, high T gondii strain virulence, and high parasite load.

### Non-malarial infectious diseases of antenatal care in pregnant women in franceville, Gabon [^27633df3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. In pregnant women, although 29% of congenital T. gondii infections are usually asymptomatic, the infection can be delayed or become potentially severe once it manifests. Transmission of T. gondii from mother to the fetus depends on parasitaemia, the mother's cellular immunity as well as the stage of placental development. Congenital toxoplasmosis can lead to several symptoms including mild chorioretinitis, an inflammation of the choroid (a thin pigmented vascular coat) and the eye retina, which can persist in the child many years after birth and can cause miscarriage, intellectual disability, micro cephaly, hydrocephalus and seizures.

Rubella, also known as German measles, is an infection caused by the rubella virus. In pregnancy, this infection poses a high risk for abnormal fetal formation when it occurs in the first 11 weeks of gestation. This risk seems to be nonexistent after the18th week of pregnancy. Rubella in pregnant women has been associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital abnormalities such as cataracts, heart defects and sensorineural deafness. Permanent abnormalities such as heart defects, pulmonary artery stenosis, hypoplasia, eye defects, intellectual and psychomotor disabilities, and speech defects have also been linked to rubella infection. Other outcomes of rubella during pregnancy include transient abnormalities in newborns and infants, developmental and late-onset abnormalities. Retardation of intrauterine growth seems to be the only consequence of infection in the third trimester of pregnancy.

INTRODUCTION

In 1939, Wolf et al. reported for the first time that the intracellular protozoan parasitewas a pathogen for humans and that it was capable of causing congenital disease as well. Following this major discovery, it was promptly recognized that the clinical spectrum of fetuses, newborns, and children congenitally infected withcould range widely from complete apparent normality to severe neurological and ocular disease and even death. It is now well accepted that congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) has a worldwide distribution; recently, the global annual incidence of CT was estimated to be 190,000 cases (95% confidence interval [CI] 179,000 to 206,300), translating into an enormous disease burden of 1.20 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.90) per annum. However, the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease is preventable, treatable, and reversible.

Effective anti-treatment, when instituted as early as in utero during the gestational period, has been shown to significantly decrease mother to child transmission as well as to improve clinical outcomes. Thus, it is imperative that laboratory tests employed for the diagnosis of CT be sensitive, specific, and exhibit high predictive values in order to promptly identify fetuses and newborns that are likely to significantly benefit from treatment interventions. Here, we review serological tests that are currently available to clinicians for the diagnosis of CT. Additional methods, such PCR, histological stains, isolation of the parasite in mice, and brain imaging studies, and other general laboratory abnormalities associated with the disease are mentioned but are not reviewed in detail since they are beyond the scope of this review. In addition, the relevance of maternal history (e.g. gestational age at which the mother was infected and whether the mother received anti-treatment or not) is incorporated in a diagnostic algorithm.

### Will we miss specific IgA detection for the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis? A French retrospective monocenter study on 483 infants [^0caa092c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In France since 1992, pregnant women benefit from monthly serological monitoring if they are seronegative, as well as information on hygienic and dietary measures to avoid infection. The objective is to detect and treat maternal infection as soon as possible, to prevent fetal infection and, if it occurs, decrease the severity of congenital disease.

In France, prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis is proposed to women who experienced Toxoplasma infection or with strong suspicion of recent infection documented by serological findings (IgG seroconversion or positive IgM associated with low-avidity IgG), with or without ultrasound abnormalities. It relies on Toxoplasma DNA detection in amniotic fluid sampled after 18 weeks of gestation and at least 4 weeks after the estimated date of infection. However, a negative result cannot rule out congenital infection, as the sensitivity of prenatal diagnosis is around 90%. Besides, it is rarely done when maternal infection occurs beyond 35 weeks of gestation, at a stage of pregnancy with high transmission risk. For this reason, post-natal screening of newborns is necessary to confirm or exclude congenital toxoplasmosis and guide newborn treatment. The biological tools used for decades include Toxoplasma PCR on placenta, cord blood, and more recently on amniotic fluid at birth, and serological follow-up of the newborn based on the monitoring of specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies. The presence of IgG and IgM neosynthesized by the infant can be confirmed by comparative Western blotting (WB), showing a different pattern from that of the mother.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis in the United States [^50d2a81c]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Key considerations — maternal screening and testing in pregnancy emphasize that further studies understanding the benefits and limits of routine antepartum screening of all pregnant women in the United States for toxoplasmosis should be conducted, and that the cost estimates for universal CT prenatal screening per the French model appear to be unrealistic in the current American health care system. Performing serologic screening only in pregnant women with known risk factors for T gondii infection or only in women with symptoms will fail to identify up to 50% of primary T gondii–infected women who are at risk of transmitting T gondii infection to their fetuses. Large-scale observational studies support the benefit of early diagnosis and treatment of primary T gondii infection during pregnancy, and observational studies support the benefit of postnatal treatment of infants with CT. The time of initiation of antepartum treatment after acute maternal primary infection is critical and supports iterative screening. According to the literature, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FDA, and PAMF-TSL state that maternal serologic test results suggestive of acute T gondii infection in a pregnant woman (eg, positive IgM test result) should be confirmed in reference laboratories for toxoplasmosis because false-positive test results in nonreference laboratories are not uncommon, and serologic testing of women with clinical suspicion of acute toxoplasmosis during pregnancy should be performed at a reference laboratory for toxoplasmosis to avoid unnecessary delays in the establishment of diagnosis and initiation of treatment that can affect the risk of MTCT and the risk of severe clinical manifestations of CT.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^c1a24a9b]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Tuberculosis disease evaluation and maternal–fetal risks in pregnancy with HIV — During pregnancy, the diagnostic evaluation for TB disease is the same as for other adults with HIV. It is important to recognize that standard symptom screens have lower sensitivity in pregnant women than in non-pregnant populations and that some TB symptoms may be masked by common symptoms of pregnancy. In addition to standard sputum testing, chest radiographs with abdominal shielding are recommended and result in minimal fetal radiation exposure. An increase in pregnancy complications — including preterm birth, low birthweight, and fetal growth restriction — can be seen among pregnant women with either pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB not confined to the lymph nodes, especially when TB treatment is delayed until late in pregnancy. Congenital TB infection has been reported, although it appears relatively uncommon; history of maternal infertility and acid-fast bacilli from placenta or endometrial biopsy may be found with this rare diagnosis. While rare, congenital TB might be more common among children born to mothers with TB/HIV coinfection, especially when those children also have perinatally acquired HIV.

Pseudo‐syndromes

Pseudo‐TORCH syndromes are genetic disorders, mostly autosomal recessive, that exhibit clinical and neuroimaging features similar to TORCH infections but test negative for infectious pathogens. These syndromes are characterized by microcephaly, seizures, developmental delay, and intracranial calcification.

Aicardi–Goutières syndrome is a type I interferonopathy that causes early‐onset progressive encephalopathy, which is characterized in its most severe form by cerebral atrophy, microcephaly, leukodystrophy, intracranial calcification, chronic CSF lymphocytosis, and increased interferon alpha in the CSF. Aicardi–Goutières syndrome is genetically heterogeneous, with severe disease most commonly associated with pathogenic variants in TREX1, RNASEH2C, and RNASEH2A. Aicardi–Goutières syndrome can present as either neonatal or infantile onset. The neonatal form resembles congenital infection, which is characterized by fever, seizures, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia. The more common infantile form follows a period of typical development, leading to subacute severe encephalopathy with irritability, feeding difficulties, and loss of skills. Epilepsy, chilblains, and aseptic febrile episodes are common. Symptoms can last several months before stabilizing, resulting in acquired microcephaly, spasticity, or dystonic posturing as static sequelae. Neuroimaging (Figure 17) shows intracranial calcification (especially in the basal ganglia and white matter), cystic leukodystrophy (predominantly frontotemporal), and cortico‐subcortical atrophy, along with atrophy of the corpus callosum, brainstem, and cerebellum.

Although congenital microcephaly is a reportable birth defect and should be included in hospital reports to the Registry, because of concerns about timeliness and completeness of routine reporting, a query was sent to all 154 New York birth hospitals. Hospitals were asked to report all newborns who had a diagnosis code specifying microcephaly (ICD-9-CM code 742.1 or ICD-10-CM code Q02), born during 2013–2015 to women who resided in New York at the time of delivery. All birth hospitals responded, and 83 (54%) identified suspected cases of microcephaly. The SPARCS database was also queried for ICD-9-CM code 742.1 or ICD-10-CM code Q02. Charts were obtained for all newborns with suspected microcephaly and were reviewed by trained clinicians who abstracted birth measurements (head circumference, length, and weight), demographic information, and prespecified infant clinical characteristics, maternal conditions, and maternal/fetal exposures that might have associations with birth defects. Maternal conditions included preeclampsia, eclampsia, hypertension, and gestational diabetes. Prenatal exposures included in utero and perinatal infections (including infections with Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Treponema pallidum, and varicella, dengue, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses), maternal consumption of alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs and certain teratogenic medications (warfarin, retinoic acid, anticonvulsants, and angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors), and environmental exposures (i.e. radiation, lead, and mercury). Information also was abstracted on any documented genetic anomalies such as trisomy, gene deletions or duplications, and genomic imprinting, and on family history of birth defects, and parental consanguinity.

Toxoplasmosis — organism, transmission, clinical features, and fetal risk in pregnancy: Toxoplasmosis is caused by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T gondii), which exists as a trophozoite (invasive form) and as latent cyst or oocyst. Human infection is acquired by consumption of cysts in undercooked meat, insect-contaminated food, contact with oocysts from the feces of infected cats, or contact with infected materials or insects in soil. Infection is usually asymptomatic after an incubation period of 5–18 days, with symptoms occurring in only 10–20% of infected adults, most often presenting as asymptomatic cervical lymphadenopathy. Parasitemia can seed the placenta in pregnancy and cause fetal infection. Without treatment, the overall risk of congenital toxoplasmosis ranges from 20% to 50%, and vertical transmission increases from 10% to 15% in the first trimester, to 25% in the second trimester, and to more than 60% in the third trimester. The severity of fetal infection depends on gestational age at transmission, with earlier infection being more severe. Most infected infants lack clinical signs at birth, but as many as 90% will develop sequelae.

CONGENITAL INFECTIONS AND THE GENETIC DISORDERS THAT MIMIC THEM

infections

The acronym 'TORCH' refers to a group of congenital infections that share similar clinical characteristics, including a variable combination of intrauterine growth restriction, and involvement of the reticuloendothelial system, CNS, and eye, among other organs. TORCH stands for toxoplasmosis, other agents (classically referring to syphilis), rubella, CMV, and herpes simplex virus. While the acronym is widely accepted for congenital infections overall, an increasing number of agents causing mother‐to‐child transmission, such as parvovirus, varicella zoster virus, and Zika virus, are not included.

The end‐organ effects of TORCH infections are variable, leading to a range of foetal and neonatal clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic to more or less severe symptomatic infections. CNS involvement influences the risk of long‐term neurological sequelae. TORCH infections can have two types of effects on the developing brain. First, the microorganism or the accompanying immune and inflammatory response can lead to tissue destruction. Additionally, if this destruction occurs in the early stages of pregnancy, it can interfere with normal cell organization and differentiation, resulting in dysplastic changes. Inflammatory and destructive changes include LSV, SEPCs, ventriculomegaly, calcifications, and white matter injury. Typical TORCH‐related brain developmental disorders are malformations of cortical development and cerebellar hypoplasia.

Congenital toxoplasmosis — interpretation of declining neonatal Toxoplasma IgG titers: A decrease in neonatal Toxoplasma IgG below detection during serial follow-up after birth every 4 to 6 weeks can exclude CT only in infants who have not received postnatal treatment; decreases below detection during postnatal therapy cannot be used to indicate the infant was not congenitally infected because titers may become negative during therapy but can rebound after therapy discontinuation in infants with CT.

Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii) — exposure routes, clinical features, and special populations are noted: Toxoplasmosis is a common cause of foodborne infection globally, and travelers can be at risk by ingesting contaminated food, soil, water, raw or undercooked meat, or shellfish. T. gondii can also be transmitted congenitally if a woman is infected during or shortly before pregnancy. Symptoms are typically influenza-like with prolonged fever, elevated liver enzymes, lymphadenopathy, and lymphocytosis, and infants with congenital toxoplasmosis can display visual and cognitive impairments.

Viral infections in low-income countries such as Brazil pose a significant challenge for medical authorities, with epidemics such as Zika virus infection having lasting effects. The increase in microcephaly among newborns has prompted investigations into the association between Zika virus and this congenital syndrome. The severity and prevalence of microcephaly led to the declaration of national and international emergencies. Extensive research has been conducted to understand the teratogenic effects of Zika virus, particularly its impact on neural progenitor cells in the fetal brain. Various pre- and postnatal imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and postnatal computed tomography (CT), have played crucial roles in diagnosing and monitoring malformations linked to congenital Zika virus infection in the central nervous system (CNS). These modalities can detect brain parenchymal abnormalities, calcifications, cerebral atrophy, and callosal anomalies. Additionally, three-dimensional ultrasound and fetal MRI provide detailed anatomical images, while CT can identify calcifications that are not easily detected by other methods. Despite advancements in imaging, there are still unanswered questions and ongoing challenges in comprehending the long-term effects and developmental impairments in children affected by Zika virus. Radiologists continue to play a crucial role in diagnosing and assisting in the management of these cases.
