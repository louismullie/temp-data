## Question

A 23-year-old female presents to the emergency department complaining of a worsening headache. The patient reports that the headache started one month ago. It is constant and "all over" but gets worse when she is lying down or in the setting of bright lights. Review of systems is significant for low-grade fever, night sweats, cough, malaise, poor appetite, and unintentional weight loss of 12 pounds in the last two months. The patient is sexually active with multiple male partners and reports inconsistent condom use. She has a history of intravenous drug use, and has not been to a doctor in the last two years. The patient's temperature is 100.4°F (38.0°C), blood pressure is 110/78 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% O2 on room air. On physical exam, pain is elicited upon passive flexion of the patient's neck. A CT scan shows ventricular enlargement. A CD4+ count is 57 cells/µL blood. A lumbar puncture is performed with the following findings:\\n\\nCerebrospinal fluid:\\nOpening pressure: 210 mmH2O\\nGlucose: 32 mg/dL\\nProtein: 204 mg/dL\\nIndia ink stain: Positive\\n\\nLeukocyte count and differential:\\nLeukocyte count: 200/mm³\\nLymphocytes: 100%\\nRed blood cell count: 2\\n\\nWhat is the next best step in therapy?
A. Administer fluconazole
B. Administer amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine
C. Administer acyclovir
D. Administer dexamethasone

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the next best step in therapy for a 23-year-old woman with advanced HIV and cryptococcal meningitis, given her CSF findings and elevated opening pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and the severity of intracranial pressure. Then, I should verify the first-line antifungal regimen and whether fluconazole monotherapy is appropriate. Next, I will review intracranial pressure management and whether steroids are indicated. Finally, I should consider ART timing and monitoring plans, and then select the option that best aligns with guideline-based care.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and clinical severity. The patient has advanced HIV with a CD4 count of 57 cells/µL, a subacute headache with photophobia and neck stiffness, and CSF showing lymphocytic pleocytosis, low glucose, high protein, and a positive India ink with an opening pressure of 210 mm H2O, which is approximately 21 cm H2O and therefore elevated beyond 20 cm H2O, consistent with cryptococcal meningitis and increased intracranial pressure in this immunocompromised host [^115vfGMe] [^114NhHPm].

> Wait, let me verify the implications of that opening pressure before jumping to treatment choices. Elevated CSF opening pressure is common in cryptococcal meningitis and is tightly linked to early mortality; guidelines emphasize measuring opening pressure at diagnosis and promptly managing it because persistent elevation can cause clinical deterioration even when antifungal therapy is working, so I need to ensure we address pressure control alongside antifungal therapy [^114NhHPm] [^116BCvfJ].

> Now, I should review the induction antifungal regimen. My first instinct is to consider high-dose fluconazole because it crosses the blood–brain barrier, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, standard-of-care induction is amphotericin B plus flucytosine for at least 2 weeks, followed by fluconazole consolidation, and fluconazole monotherapy is not appropriate for induction in this setting [^notfound].

> I will now examine the role of intracranial pressure management, because that will influence the immediate next steps. Guidelines recommend serial therapeutic lumbar punctures to reduce pressure by about 50% or to less than 20 cm H2O, repeated daily until symptoms and opening pressure normalize; if repeated LPs are not tolerated or fail, CSF shunting is considered, and importantly, corticosteroids are not recommended for routine ICP management in cryptococcal meningitis because they do not improve survival and may worsen outcomes [^114NhHPm] [^115gtQNp].

> But wait, what about dexamethasone as an option here? I should double-check that. Dexamethasone is not recommended for induction therapy in cryptococcal meningitis; randomized data showed no survival benefit and more adverse events with steroids during induction, so steroids should be avoided unless there is a specific indication such as paradoxical IRIS later in the course, which is not the immediate issue here [^115gtQNp].

> Next, I should review ART timing, even though it is not the immediate therapy choice in the stem. I need to ensure we do not start ART too early. For cryptococcal meningitis, ART should be delayed until after 2 to 4 weeks of antifungal therapy, with closer to 2 weeks if ICP is controlled, cultures are negative, and close monitoring is feasible; earlier ART increases the risk of IRIS and is not advised immediately in this scenario [^111pRz2U].

> Let me synthesize and confirm the best immediate therapeutic step. Given confirmed cryptococcal meningitis with elevated opening pressure, the next best step is to initiate induction therapy with amphotericin B plus flucytosine and concurrently manage intracranial pressure with therapeutic lumbar puncture, while avoiding fluconazole monotherapy and avoiding corticosteroids during induction; this aligns with current HIV opportunistic infection guidelines and cryptococcal management recommendations [^114NhHPm] [^115gtQNp].

> Final answer: B. Administer amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine, with immediate attention to intracranial pressure control via therapeutic lumbar puncture; fluconazole monotherapy is inappropriate for induction and dexamethasone is not recommended in this context [^116BCvfJ] [^114NhHPm] [^115gtQNp].

---

The next best step is to **start amphotericin B plus flucytosine** [^117K5Lap] for cryptococcal meningitis in this HIV patient with a very low CD4 count and classic CSF findings [^115vfGMe]. This regimen is first-line induction therapy and should begin **promptly** [^116BCvfJ] to reduce mortality and improve outcomes. Fluconazole monotherapy is inadequate for induction [^notfound], and dexamethasone is not recommended [^115gtQNp] unless there is immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Acyclovir is for herpesviruses, not Cryptococcus [^notfound]. Immediate antifungal therapy is critical given the patient's immunocompromised state and elevated intracranial pressure [^116X1vtS].

---

## Clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis

The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are **highly suggestive of cryptococcal meningitis** [^115vfGMe], an opportunistic infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as those with advanced HIV infection [^111Hixtf]. The following features support this diagnosis:

- **Immunocompromised state**: The patient has a CD4+ count of 57 cells/µL, indicating advanced HIV infection and a high risk for opportunistic infections [^111Hixtf].

- **Clinical symptoms**: Subacute headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and malaise are classic symptoms of cryptococcal meningitis [^111Hixtf].

- **CSF findings**: Elevated opening pressure (210 mmH2O), lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, low glucose, and positive India ink stain are characteristic of cryptococcal meningitis [^1132BTUv].

- **Imaging**: Ventricular enlargement on CT scan is consistent with elevated intracranial pressure, a common complication of cryptococcal meningitis [^1132BTUv].

Given these findings, the **most likely diagnosis is cryptococcal meningitis** [^115vfGMe]. Alternative diagnoses such as bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, or tuberculous meningitis are less likely given the clinical and laboratory context [^112MZVs1].

---

## Recommended treatment guidelines

According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines, the **recommended induction therapy** for cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients is amphotericin B combined with flucytosine for at least 2 weeks, followed by fluconazole consolidation therapy [^117K5Lap] [^116BCvfJ]. This regimen has been shown to significantly reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes in patients with cryptococcal meningitis [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for choosing amphotericin B and flucytosine

Amphotericin B is a potent antifungal agent that **effectively targets Cryptococcus neoformans** by binding to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, causing cell death. Flucytosine, a synergistic partner, is converted within fungal cells to 5-fluorouracil, disrupting DNA and protein synthesis. Together, they provide rapid fungal clearance and reduce mortality in cryptococcal meningitis [^notfound].

---

## Consequences of delayed or inappropriate treatment

Delayed or inappropriate treatment of cryptococcal meningitis can lead to **severe complications**, including:

- **Increased mortality**: Untreated or inadequately treated cryptococcal meningitis has a high mortality rate, particularly in immunocompromised patients [^111Hixtf].

- **Neurological sequelae**: Persistent elevated intracranial pressure, visual impairment, hearing loss, and cognitive deficits are common complications [^notfound].

- **Relapse**: Inadequate induction therapy increases the risk of relapse and chronic infection [^115gtQNp].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

During treatment, **close monitoring** is essential, including serial lumbar punctures to manage elevated intracranial pressure, regular assessment of renal function due to amphotericin B nephrotoxicity, and monitoring for adverse effects of flucytosine, such as bone marrow suppression and hepatotoxicity [^114NhHPm] [^115gtQNp].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The next best step in therapy for this patient is to **initiate amphotericin B and flucytosine** as induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis [^115gtQNp]. This regimen is supported by current clinical guidelines and has been shown to significantly improve outcomes in HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis [^115gtQNp]. Prompt initiation of this therapy is critical to reduce mortality and prevent severe neurological complications [^115rktuN].

Cryptococcal meningitis in people with HIV — elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) risk and early therapeutic lumbar puncture: Elevated ICP can cause clinical deterioration despite a microbiologic response, and complications are more likely when the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lumbar opening pressure is ≥ 25 cm CSF in the lateral decubitus position. Increased ICP was associated with 92% of deaths during the first 2 weeks of antifungal therapy. In a clinical trial, people with HIV who received at least one therapeutic lumbar puncture within 7 days after diagnosis (median time of 3 days) had a 69% relative reduction in the risk of death through 11 days, regardless of initial opening pressure. Those with symptoms and signs of increased ICP require immediate clinical intervention to reduce ICP.

Diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis is typically aided through CSF analysis obtained via lumbar puncture (LP), revealing elevated WBCs, increased protein, decreased glucose, and increased opening pressure. While CSF culture confirms the diagnosis, it takes days, prompting reliance on these adjuncts. AIDS from Human Immunodeficiency Virus is less commonly diagnosed in the emergency setting due to advances in testing and treatment. This case highlights fungal meningitis in an undiagnosed AIDS patient, where positive CSF cryptococcal antigen enabled timely diagnosis despite normal CSF findings, emphasizing the importance of rapid diagnostic tests in high-risk patients even when CSF results appear normal. A 30-year-old male with no prior medical history presented with 3.5 weeks of nausea, vomiting, headache, and back pain. He showed signs of cachexia, photophobia, and neck stiffness. Initial CSF analyses were within normal limits for glucose, WBC, and protein, but cryptococcal antigen was positive. He was treated with amphotericin B and flucytosine. CSF cultures confirmed C. neoformans, and serial LPs monitored elevated opening pressures, requiring a VP shunt. The patient was diagnosed with AIDS (CD4 6 cells/mm³). This case underscores that C. neoformans can present with normal CSF studies, delaying diagnosis and treatment, highlighted by the fact that this patient went undiagnosed in the preceding 3.5 weeks. CSF cryptococcal antigen and opening pressure are critical diagnostic tools, enabling timely antifungal therapy. Given the high mortality rate, early empirical treatment is essential, especially in high-risk patients, even when CSF findings seem normal.

Cryptococcosis — diagnosis in people with HIV — is usually disseminated at the time of diagnosis and most commonly presents as subacute meningoencephalitis, and initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis generally shows mildly elevated protein levels, low-to-normal glucose concentrations, and a variable pleocytosis mostly of lymphocytes. Some people with advanced HIV may have very few CSF inflammatory cells, and a Gram stain or an India ink preparation, if available, may reveal numerous yeast forms.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114NhHPm]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis — intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement and serial lumbar puncture management: Control of elevated ICP is critical to reducing acute mortality, and lumbar opening pressure should be measured in all people with cryptococcal meningitis at the time of diagnosis, with a repeat lumbar puncture performed with measurement of opening pressure if it was not measured initially. For people with ongoing headaches, a repeat lumbar puncture should be performed with urgency, and among those without headaches, a repeat lumbar puncture should be considered strongly within 48 hours of the initial procedure; measures to decrease ICP should be used for all with confusion, blurred vision, papilledema, lower extremity clonus, or other neurologic signs indicative of increased ICP. Drainage of CSF via lumbar puncture is recommended for initial management (AII); one approach is to remove a volume of CSF that reduces the opening pressure by at least 50% or normalizes the pressure to < 20 cm CSF, and in the absence of a manometer, removal of 20 to 25 mL of CSF is recommended (AIII). Among patients with ongoing symptoms, therapeutic lumbar punctures should be repeated at least daily until symptoms and signs consistently improve and opening pressure normalizes to < 20 cm CSF (AII); strong consideration should be given to repeating a therapeutic lumbar puncture within 72 hours of the initial procedure in those who are relatively asymptomatic or who had a baseline CSF opening pressure of < 25 cm CSF (BII). If the initial opening pressure was not measured, a second lumbar puncture is recommended (AII).

Diagnosis

Figure 4 outlines a plan for approaching patients with suspected CM, encompassing clinical features, differential diagnosis and basic investigations. Box 1 presents practical diagnostic tips, and figure 5 shows images of important diagnostic tests. CM diagnostics have been transformed in recent years, but it is still useful to know the characteristic findings of CSF analysis. These include elevated opening pressure in the left lateral position (sitting lumbar puncture (LP) pressures are unreliable), lymphocytic pleocytosis, high CSF protein and low CSF glucose. In HIV-CM, the CSF white cell count may be lower than expected, or even normal, so it is important to perform specialised tests as outlined in table 1. The recommendations made in table 1 are adapted from the British Society for Medical Mycology 2015 best practice guidelines.

ABC, airway, breathing, circulation; DILI, drug-induced liver injury; FBC, full blood count; GFMCSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; LFT, liver function tests; RPR, rapid plasma reagin; TB, tuberculosis; U&E, urea and electrolytes.

Box 1
Diagnostic tips

Think about cryptococcal meningitis (CM) if your patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows abnormal white cell count (especially lymphocytosis), glucose or protein concentrations.
In a UK setting, for the correct CSF tests to be performed, it is important to specify that a patient is immunocompromised on the test request, or notify the laboratory.
India ink microscopy is no longer recommended unless cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) lateral flow assays are unavailable.
Serum and CSF CrAg are qualitative lateral flow tests with high sensitivity and specificity — in symptomatic patients, negative CSF CrAg effectively rules out CM.
Once positive, CrAg remains so for many months — it cannot be used to monitor treatment response or to diagnose early CM relapse.
Fungal culture can be helpful for diagnosis, but treatment is not usually contingent on antifungal sensitivities; it is, therefore, most useful in CM recurrence and relapse.
Where possible, a contrast-enhanced MRI brain should be performed within 48 hours in immunocompromised patients with suspected or proven meningitis and/or new neurological features such as seizures, persistent headache and altered mental state.

### Early versus delayed antiretroviral treatment in HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis [^111Hixtf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

HIV/AIDS remains one of the world's most significant public health challenges, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has substantially improved HIV prognosis by reducing associated morbidity and mortality. However uncertainty remains as to the optimal time for ART initiation when an HIV‐positive person is co‐infected with an opportunistic infection, particularly cryptococcal meningitis.

Description of the condition

Cryptococcal meningitis is an important opportunistic AIDS‐defining infection and a major contributor to high mortality before and after ART is initiated (Bicanic 2005; WHO 2013). It is caused by the encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, which is inhaled as small yeast cells. Patients may present with headache, fever, malaise, and altered mental status; they may also have signs of meningism, papilloedema, and focal neurological deficits. Raised intracranial pressure likely results from poor absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); this is usually responsible for the central nervous system manifestations. In addition to clinical history and physical examination, laboratory investigations assist accurate and timely diagnosis; recommended laboratory investigations include cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in CSF or serum, India Ink microscopy of CSF, or culture (Bicanic 2005; WHO 2013).

The case fatality rate in people with cryptococcal meningitis, the most common presentation of HIV‐related cryptococcal disease in adults, remains unacceptably high, particularly in sub‐Saharan Africa, where it is between 35% to 65% compared with 10% to 20% in most high‐income countries (Bicanic 2005; Park 2009; WHO 2016). In people who are immunocompromised, untreated cryptococcal meningitis will uniformly lead to death in a few weeks (Mwaba 2001). Cryptococcal meningitis is a leading cause of death in HIV‐positive people and typically affects those with low cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) counts (Rajasingham 2017; Williamson 2017). Amphotericin B, flucytosine, and the azoles are the mainstay antifungal treatments for cryptococcal meningitis. Drug toxicity related to amphotericin B has been reported in up to 60% of patients (Bicanic 2015; Meiring 2016). Cryptococcal meningitis is less frequently described in children, although cases do occur (NIH 2017b; Tinashe 2016). The best time to initiate ART in those recently diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis remains an area of debate.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cryptococcosis in HIV — diagnosis and screening: Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) generally demonstrates mildly elevated levels of serum protein, low-to-normal glucose concentrations, and pleocytosis consisting mostly of lymphocytes, and the opening pressure in the CSF may be elevated, with pressures ≥ 25 cm H2O occurring in 60% to 80% of patients. Cryptococcal disease can be diagnosed through culture, CSF microscopy, or by cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) detection; in patients with HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis, 55% of blood cultures and 95% of CSF cultures are positive and visible colonies can be detected within 7 days. India ink staining of CSF demonstrates encapsulated yeast in 60% to 80% of cases. CSF CrAg is usually positive in patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, serum CrAg is usually positive in both meningeal and non-meningeal infections and may be present weeks to months before symptom onset, and a positive serum CrAg should prompt a lumbar puncture to rule out meningeal disease. Three methods exist for antigen detection — latex agglutination, enzyme immunoassays, and lateral flow assay — and testing for the antigen in the serum is a useful initial screening tool in diagnosing cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients and may be particularly useful when a lumbar puncture is delayed or refused.

Case 2

A 23-year-old woman presented to an urban specialist referral hospital in Western Uganda with a two week history of severe headache, vomiting, visual and hearing impairment, low-grade fevers and recurrent generalised tonic clonic seizures. She also reported a 4-week history of night sweats and a productive cough. She had been diagnosed with HIV several years previously but reported good adherence to antiretroviral therapy for the past 3 years. Her GCS was 15/15. Neurological examination identified right sixth nerve palsy with bilateral pupillary dilatation and reduced visual acuity.

Bedside finger-prick serum CrAg was positive. After blood tests confirmed normal platelet count and clotting function, she proceeded directly to lumbar puncture (LP). CSF analysis revealed low opening pressure (7 cm H₂O), lymphocytic pleocytosis (WCC 16 cells/mm³, 78% lymphocytes), elevated protein (10 mg/dL) and normal glucose (CSF glucose 4.6 mmol/l, blood glucose 6 mmol/l). Bedside CSF CrAg was positive. She was subsequently found to have a serum HIV viral load of 3302 copies/mL and a low CD4 count of 6 cells/µL. Sputum GeneXpert testing was negative, and a plain chest radiograph unremarkable, effectively excluding concurrent disseminated tuberculosis infection.

She was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis and treated with 7 days intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate and oral flucytosine, followed by 7 days of high-dose oral fluconazole. She underwent scheduled therapeutic LP at day 3 of hospitalisation, as per local protocols, which identified a normal opening pressure of 19 cm H₂O. Her symptoms initially improved with treatment, but on day 6 of her hospital stay, she developed rebound headaches, vomiting and recurrent seizures. Repeat therapeutic LP revealed a newly raised opening pressure of 37 cm H₂O and she had 30 mL CSF drained. Repeat, contrast-enhanced CT head on day 14 of hospitalisation showed ventricular dilatation, but no cryptococcomas. She underwent 74 therapeutic lumbar punctures, guided by her symptoms, over the course of a 46 day hospital stay. She had a good neurological outcome, with marked improvement in her visual acuity and resolution of her raised ICP symptoms and transitioned successfully to consolidation therapy with further follow-up in local HIV clinic.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^115oJZ4n]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis — lumbar puncture indications for newly diagnosed infection — In patients with recently diagnosed coccidioidal infection, we recommend lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis only in patients with unusual, worsening, or persistent headaches, or with other focal or new local neurologic deficits (strong, moderate). Headache is nearly always produced by coccidioidal meningitis (CM), but it is also a common (21%) symptom in uncomplicated primary coccidioidal pneumonic disease; if the headache is modest in severity and dissipates in approximately a week, a lumbar puncture is not required, whereas if the headache is the predominant symptom or is consistent, persistent, and progressive, lumbar puncture is required. In contrast, unless signs or symptoms of central nervous system involvement are present, routine analysis of CSF is unnecessary, and in the absence of symptoms, CM is unlikely.

Cryptococcosis — diagnosis in suspected meningitis emphasizes that detection of cryptococcal antigen in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or other body fluids is highly effective, and a lumbar puncture should be done in any patient with suspected cryptococcal meningitis; CSF cell count, glucose, and protein can be virtually normal in central nervous system disease, but the opening pressure usually is elevated. Microscopic examination of CSF on India ink–stained wet mounts can be performed but is largely replaced by cryptococcal antigen testing, and in more than 90% of patients with cryptococcal meningitis, cryptococcal antigen can be detected in CSF or serum by latex agglutination test. Fungal cultures from CSF, sputum, and blood can identify the organism; in some cases of refractory or relapsed disease, susceptibility testing of the C. neoformans isolate can be beneficial, and overall, in vitro resistance to antifungal agents remains uncommon. Diffuse pulmonary disease can be diagnosed through bronchoalveolar lavage with direct examination, culture, and antigen detection, and focal pulmonary and skin lesions may require biopsy with culture and staining.

Monitoring of response to therapy and adverse events (including IRIS) in cryptococcal meningitis — intracranial pressure (ICP) management, procedures, and medication guidance: ICP elevations can cause clinical deterioration despite a microbiologic response, and they are more likely to occur if the CSF opening lumbar pressure is ≥ 25cm H2O; in 1 large clinical trial, increased ICP was associated with 93% of deaths during the first 2 weeks of therapy and 40% of deaths during weeks 3 to 10. Lumbar opening pressure should be measured in all patients with cryptococcal meningitis at the time of diagnosis. Drainage of CSF via lumbar puncture is recommended for initial management, and one approach is to remove a volume of CSF (typically 20–30 mL) that at least halves the opening pressure and repeat daily until symptoms and signs consistently improve. CSF shunting through a lumbar drain or ventriculostomy should be considered for patients who cannot tolerate repeated lumbar punctures or in whom signs and symptoms of cerebral edema persist after multiple lumbar taps (BIII). Corticosteroids and mannitol have been shown to be ineffective in managing ICP and are not recommended (AIII), and acetazolamide should not be used as therapy for increased ICP management since it may cause hyperchloremic acidosis and does not result in a decrease in ICP (AI). A randomized study compared a 6-week course of a tapering dose of dexamethasone among 451 Asian and African patients with HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis who received amphotericin B deoxycholate plus fluconazole; compared to placebo, there was no improvement in survival at 10 weeks and dexamethasone was associated with more adverse events, supporting that corticosteroids should not routinely be used during induction therapy for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis unless they are being used for IRIS (AI). After the first 2 weeks of treatment, many experts would advocate a repeat lumbar puncture; even with clinical improvement, positive CSF cultures after 2 weeks of therapy are predictive of future relapse, and some experts would continue amphotericin B plus flucytosine until the CSF cultures are negative (BIII). Monitoring titers of cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen in serum or CSF is of no value in determining response to therapy and is not recommended, and if new symptoms or clinical findings occur later, a repeat lumbar puncture with measurement of opening lumbar pressure and CSF culture should be performed. Patients treated with amphotericin B formulations should be monitored for dose-dependent nephrotoxicity and electrolyte disturbances, and pre-infusion administration of 500 to 1000 mL of normal saline appears to reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity during amphotericin B treatment.

### Recurrence of symptoms following cryptococcal meningitis: characterizing a diagnostic conundrum with multiple etiologies [^116X1vtS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cryptococcal meningitis is a common cause of AIDS-related mortality. Although symptom recurrence after initial treatment is common, the etiology is often difficult to decipher. We sought to summarize characteristics, etiologies, and outcomes among persons with second-episode symptomatic recurrence.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled Ugandans with cryptococcal meningitis and obtained patient characteristics, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and cryptococcosis histories, clinical outcomes, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis results. We independently adjudicated cases of second-episode meningitis to categorize patients as (1) microbiological relapse, (2) paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), (3) persistent elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) only, or (4) persistent symptoms only, along with controls of primary cryptococcal meningitis. We compared groups with chi-square or Kruskal-Wallis tests as appropriate.

Results

724 participants were included (n = 607 primary episode, 81 relapse, 28 paradoxical IRIS, 2 persistently elevated ICP, 6 persistent symptoms). Participants with culture-positive relapse had lower CD4 (25 cells/μL; IQR: 9–76) and lower CSF white blood cell (WBC; 4 cells/μL; IQR: 4–85) counts than paradoxical IRIS (CD4: 78 cells/μL; IQR: 47–142; WBC: 45 cells/μL; IQR: 8–128). Among those with CSF WBC < 5 cells/μL, 86% (43/50) had relapse. Among those with CD4 counts < 50 cells/μL, 91% (39/43) had relapse. Eighteen-week mortality (from current symptom onset) was 47% among first episodes of cryptococcal meningitis, 31% in culture-positive relapses, and 14% in paradoxical IRIS.

Conclusions

Poor immune reconstitution was noted more often in relapse than IRIS as evidenced by lower CSF WBC and blood CD4 counts. These easily obtained laboratory values should prompt initiation of antifungal treatment while awaiting culture results.

### High cryptococcal antigen titers in blood are predictive of subclinical cryptococcal meningitis among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients [^111RFAPo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

High mortality rates among asymptomatic cryptococcal antigen (CrAg)-positive patients identified through CrAg screening, despite preemptive fluconazole treatment, may be due to undiagnosed cryptococcal meningitis.

Methods

Symptoms were reviewed in CrAg-positive patients identified by screening 19233 individuals with human immunodeficiency virus infection and CD4 cell counts < 100/µL at 17 clinics and 3 hospitals in Johannesburg from September 2012 until September 2015, and at 2 hospitals until June 2016. Cerebrospinal fluid samples from 90 of 254 asymptomatic patients (35%) and 78 of 173 (45%) with headache only were analyzed for cryptococcal meningitis, considered present if Cryptococcus was identified by means of India ink microscopy, culture, or CrAg test. CrAg titers were determined with stored blood samples from 62 of these patients. The associations between blood CrAg titer, concurrent cryptococcal meningitis, and mortality rate were assessed.

Results

Cryptococcal meningitis was confirmed in 34% (95% confidence interval, 25%-43%; 31 of 90) of asymptomatic CrAg-positive patients and 90% (81%-96%; 70 of 78) with headache only. Blood CrAg titer was significantly associated with concurrent cryptococcal meningitis in asymptomatic patients (P < .001) and patients with headache only (P = 0.003). The optimal titer for predicting cryptococcal meningitis was > 160 (sensitivity, 88.2%; specificity, 82.1%); the odds ratio for concurrent cryptococcal meningitis was 34.5 (95% confidence interval, 8.3–143.1; P < .001).

Conclusions

About a third of asymptomatic CrAg-positive patients have concurrent cryptococcal meningitis. More effective clinical assessment strategies and antifungal regimens are required for CrAg-positive patients, including investigation for cryptococcal meningitis irrespective of symptoms. Where it is not possible to perform lumbar punctures in all CrAg-positive patients, blood CrAg titers should be used to target those most at risk of cryptococcal meningitis.

### Relationship of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, fungal burden and outcome in patients with cryptococcal meningitis undergoing serial lumbar punctures [^1179MiVk]. AIDS (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess impact of serial lumbar punctures on association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure and prognosis in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis; to explore time course and relationship of opening pressure with neurological findings, CSF fungal burden, immune response, and CD4 cell count.

Design

Evaluation of 163 HIV-positive ART-naive patients enrolled in three trials of amphotericin B-based therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in Thailand and South Africa.

Methods

Study protocols required four lumbar punctures with measurements of opening pressure over the first 2 weeks of treatment and additional lumbar punctures if opening pressure raised. Fungal burden and clearance, CSF immune parameters, CD4 cell count, neurological symptoms and signs, and outcome at 2 and 10 weeks were compared between groups categorized by opening pressure at cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis.

Results

Patients with higher baseline fungal burden had higher baseline opening pressure. High fungal burden appeared necessary but not sufficient for development of high pressure. Baseline opening pressure was not associated with CD4 cell count, CSF pro-inflammatory cytokines, or altered mental status. Day 14 opening pressure was associated with day 14 fungal burden. Overall mortality was 12% (20/162) at 2 weeks and 26% (42/160) at 10 weeks, with no significant differences between opening pressure groups.

Conclusion

Studies are needed to define factors, in addition to fungal burden, associated with raised opening pressure. Aggressive management of raised opening pressure through repeated CSF drainage appeared to prevent any adverse impact of raised opening pressure on outcome in patients with cryptococcal meningitis. The results support increasing access to manometers in resource-poor settings and routine management of opening pressure in patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for encephalitis, more specifically with respect to lumbar puncture, ABN/BIA 2012 guidelines recommend to include the following in the CSF investigations:

- opening pressure

- total and differential white cell count, red cell count, microscopy, culture, and sensitivities for bacteria (2×2.5 mL)

- correct the white cell count and protein for a bloody tap if necessary

- protein and glucose (1–2 mL) and compare it with plasma glucose taken just before the lumbar puncture

- send and store a sample for virological investigations or other future investigations (2 mL)

- Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6 mL) when clinically indicated.

### Clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes of spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114AYmho]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes of SIH based on the reports of 144 articles. Absence of orthostatic headache, normal imaging findings, or normal lumbar puncture opening pressure should not exclude a diagnosis of SIH. A single EBP was successful in 64% of patients. While this meta-analysis suggests that large EBPs have successful outcomes in a higher proportion of patients compared with small EBPs, this requires further validation. Large randomized clinical trials will be required to define the best management for SIH.

Aseptic meningitis during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy — workup and management are outlined as follows: Workup includes "MRI brain w/wo contrast with pituitary or sellar cuts protocol. AM cortisol, ACTH to rule out adrenal insufficiency. Strongly consider lumbar puncture with CSF analysis for opening pressure, cell count and differential, cytology for malignant cells that could indicate leptomeningeal metastases, protein, glucose, gram stain, viral or bacterial cultures, PCR for HSV, and other viral PCRs depending on suspicion", noting that one "May see elevated WBC in CSF with normal glucose, normal culture, and gram stain. May see reactive lymphocytes, neutrophils, or histiocytes on cytology". For G1 (mild), "Hold ICPi and discuss resumption with patient only after taking into account the risks and benefits" and "Consider neurology consult". For G2 (moderate), "Consider empiric antiviral (IV acyclovir) and antibacterial therapy until CSF results", and once infection is excluded, "may closely monitor off corticosteroids or consider oral prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day or IV methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day if moderate or severe symptoms". Steroid taper guidance states "Steroids can be tapered after 2–4 weeks, monitoring for symptom recurrence", and disposition includes "Consider hospitalization for G3–4".

### Disseminated cryptococcal infection in a patient who had kidney transplant: discrepancy between clinical symptoms and microbiological findings [^112aPetU]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Investigations

On admission, the patient complained of no other symptoms than headache. Physical examination revealed no pathological findings and a body temperature of 36.4°C. Blood test results showed neither leucocytosis nor an elevated C reactive protein level. Acute sinusitis was suspected but a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses was unremarkable. On day 2, the headache persisted and he was not responding to analgesics. The findings in the brain MRI were indicative of a meningeal irritation (figure 1). A lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was normal (10 cm H₂O), but the cell count in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of 28×10 6 /L (65% mononuclear) and the lactate (2.9 mmol/L), glucose (5.3 mmol/L) and albumin (564 mg/L) levels were slightly elevated. Viral PCR test results and bacterial culture from the CSF remained negative. However, India ink staining revealed a surprisingly high quantity of encapsulated yeast forms in the CSF (figure 2A). In addition, cryptococcal antigen tests in both CSF and blood were positive. Cryptococcus neoformans grew in cultures from CSF and all blood cultures obtained (figure 2B), leading to a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis and fungaemia.

### Cerebrospinal fluid analysis [^11342pRF]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Lumbar puncture is frequently performed in primary care. Properly interpreted tests can make cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) a key tool in the diagnosis of a variety of diseases. Proper evaluation of CSF depends on knowing which tests to order, normal ranges for the patient's age, and the test's limitations. Protein level, opening pressure, and CSF-to-serum glucose ratio vary with age. Xanthochromia is most often caused by the presence of blood, but several other conditions should be considered. The presence of blood can be a reliable predictor of subarachnoid hemorrhage but takes several hours to develop. The three-tube method, commonly used to rule out a central nervous system hemorrhage after a "traumatic tap", is not completely reliable. Red blood cells in CSF caused by a traumatic tap or a subarachnoid hemorrhage artificially increase the white blood cell count and protein level, thereby confounding the diagnosis. Diagnostic uncertainty can be decreased by using accepted corrective formulas. White blood cell differential may be misleading early in the course of meningitis, because more than 10 percent of cases with bacterial infection will have an initial lymphocytic predominance and viral meningitis may initially be dominated by neutrophils. Culture is the gold standard for determining the causative organism in meningitis. However, polymerase chain reaction is much faster and more sensitive in some circumstances. Latex agglutination, with high sensitivity but low specificity, may have a role in managing partially treated meningitis. To prove herpetic, cryptococcal, or tubercular infection, special staining techniques or collection methods may be required.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on postdural puncture headache: a consensus report from a multisociety international working group [^112PDJvy]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) — observation and follow-up after neuraxial block or lumbar puncture (LP) — Inpatients should be seen by a member of the healthcare team at least once per day to ensure full neurological recovery and absence of headache, patients should receive verbal and written advice before discharge on who to contact if complications appear, and if PDPH is suspected a member of the healthcare team should see the patient more often and within 24 hours and treatment initiated immediately; follow-up with patients is required until symptoms resolve. An analysis of more than 22 million deliveries showed that delayed treatment was the strongest risk factor associated with a cranial SDH. Statement: PDPH should be suspected if headache or neurological symptoms, which may be relieved when lying flat, occur within five days of a neuraxial procedure (Moderate Level of Certainty). Recommendation: Inpatients who have received a neuraxial procedure should be reviewed and evaluated for symptoms of PDPH. Outpatients should be instructed to report symptoms of PDPH to their physicians (Grade A; High Level of Certainty).

Early-stage syphilis (primary, secondary, early latent) — monitoring and retreatment criteria: Clinical and serologic response should be monitored at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after therapy (AIII). Re-treatment of patients with early-stage syphilis and evaluation for HIV infection is recommended for those who do not experience at least a fourfold decrease in serum nontreponemal test titers 6 to 12 months after therapy, have a sustained fourfold increase in serum nontreponemal test titers after an initial reduction post-treatment, or have persistent or recurring clinical signs or symptoms of disease. Individuals whose titers do not decline should at a minimum receive additional clinical and serologic follow-up; if such additional follow-up cannot be ensured, re-treatment is recommended, and evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be considered in the event of persistently elevated titers (BIII). If initial CSF examination demonstrates pleocytosis, repeat lumbar puncture should be conducted, and then every 6 months until the cell count is normal (AIII).

ICANS grading

The prodromal phase of ICANS occurs within days post-CAR-T cell infusion, presenting with mild neurological symptoms like headache, confusion, and subtle cognitive changes, alongside hypertension and tachycardia. As these symptoms may be overlooked, rigorous testing, including the immune effector cell encephalopathy (ICE)-score is necessary. If organ system failure (e.g. due to CRS) makes ICE-score monitoring unfeasible, brain imaging should exclude cerebral edema, electroencephalograms (EEGs) and the bispectral index (BIS) can monitor the level of consciousness and rule out epileptogenic potentials. Intracranial pressure monitoring should be initiated in sedated patients with unexplained bradycardia, hypertension, or anisocoria. Intracranial pressure monitoring should be initiated in sedated patients with unexplained bradycardia, hypertension, or anisocoria. Grade 1 ICANS symptoms are mild, including slower speech, confusion, difficulty concentrating, and mild headaches, with an ICE-score of 7–9 indicating grade 1. Diagnosis involves neurological exams while treatment emphasizes supportive care, symptom management, and seizure prophylaxis with 750 mg levetiracetam QD. For grade 2 ICANS (ICE-score 3–6), diagnostic imaging, rule-out-EEG are crucial. Lumbar puncture should be discussed in a case-by-case situation. Since patients after CAR T-cell therapy are deeply immunocompromised, infectious differential diagnoses (i.e. infectious meningitis/encephalitis) must be considered. When suspected a rigorous diagnostic methodology should be performed. Thus, initial combinatorial treatment, with dexamethasone (and tocilizumab if CRS co-incides) and treatment of suspected infectious encephalopathy (i.e. meningitis or encephalitis) should be considererd – de-escalation of one treatment path should occur once pending test results eliminate a differential diagnosis or undermine implausibility. Grade 3 and 4 ICANS require intensive diagnostic measures and treatments, including high-dose corticosteroids, intracranial pressure monitoring, ensuring adequate oxygenation, normotension, normovolemia, normocapnia, normoglycemia and normothermia. Intracranial pressure (ICP) should be kept < 20 mmHg, with a target cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) of 60–70 mmHg, and elevated ICP can be reduced with mannitol or moderate hyperventilation. Tocilizumab should be discontinued if neurological signs develop due to the risk of IL-6 accumulation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In highly proliferative diseases like diffuse large-cell B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) earlier escalation of corticosteroid dosage or switch to methylprednisolone can also prevent severe side effects. For life-threatening grade 4 ICANS, aggressive management in ICU, high-dose methylprednisolone, and antiepileptic treatment for seizures are mandatory. Anakinra should be considered in steroid-refractory high-grade ICANS (1 mg/kg QID with an upper dose of 100 mg). The use of cyclophosphamide, as described above, could potentially be considered, if there are no other options available. However, there is very limited data about this therapeutic option.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^112hgTWF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidal meningitis — cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging findings — Coccidioidal diagnosis requires laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); abnormal CSF is the hallmark of all meningitis, the opening pressure should always be measured if technically feasible, and the CSF should be submitted for differential analysis of the cells, glucose, protein, fungal culture, coccidioidal antibodies by immunodiffusion and/or complement fixation, and coccidioidal antigen. Typical CSF patterns include pleocytosis in the range of double digits to hundreds, but occasionally thousands, lymphocytic predominance with possible early neutrophilic predominance, eosinophils as an important clue, protein commonly > 150 mg/dL, and glucose commonly depressed to less than one-half to two-thirds of the fasting blood sugar value (nondiabetic). A positive CSF culture is a low frequency event, but when the clinical presentation is unexplained hydrocephalus, initial ventricular cultures are commonly positive; the presence of immunodiffusion or CF IgG antibody is nearly as specific but lacks sensitivity, with only 30%–60% positive initially, and diagnosis is most commonly made by clinical and CSF parameters plus IgG antibody in the serum. Neuroimaging may further support diagnosis, preferably by gadolinium-enhanced MRI; at initial diagnosis, approximately 50% of patients have a discernible abnormality, and a negative CT or MRI result does not exclude CM.

### Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease with aseptic meningitis-like presentation in a paediatric patient [^111HaHjE]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In the paediatric population, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) phenotypes continue to be identified. We present a case of seropositive MOGAD that began as what appeared to be aseptic meningitis with elevated intracranial pressure, followed by inflammatory myelopathy. The paediatric patient presented with a four-day history of persistent frontal headache, vomiting and episodic confusion without a fever. Lumbar puncture showed elevated cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Her headaches worsened despite treatment for increased pressure with acetazolamide. Her symptoms of inflammatory myelopathy emerged fourdays after admission. MRI brain at presentation demonstrated bilateral narrowing of the transverse sinuses as seen with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). After development of urinary retention and lower extremity symptoms, MRI spine showed signal abnormalities within the grey and white matter of both the cervical and thoracic spinal cord consistent with an inflammatory myelopathy. Serum MOG antibodies were positive. Here, we present a case of MOGAD that began with an aseptic meningitis-like presentation, but without the more commonly described initial presentations of MOGAD to illustrate an emerging phenotype. Aseptic meningitis with imaging suggestive of IIH, as well as persistent or evolving symptoms in a paediatric patient, should raise suspicions for MOGAD and prompt MOG antibody testing.

### Chorea and the effectiveness of steroids in a patient with the syndrome of transient headache with neurologic deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis: a case report [^111kvqvH]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Initial treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ganciclovir, mannitol and anti-epileptic medications at an external hospital did not halt the recurrence of the symptoms. During admission at our hospital, she was given ganciclovir initially, but she developed two new episodes of headache (VAS 7/10) with focal neurological symptoms, including numbness, weakness and involuntary movements of the left upper extremity. Chorea of the left hand lasted for 30–45 mins and headache for about 2 hrs. The left upper extremity weakness was graded as 4/5 using the Medical Research Council grading system. The characteristics of the episodes were similar to that described above. Meningeal irritation sign was absent during the attack.

The third lumbar puncture showed 30 cm H₂O of CSF opening pressure and lymphocytosis (74%). She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone with initial dose of 120 mg/day which was tapered to 40 mg/day within 7 days. The fourth CSF examination after the administration of methylprednisolone for 7 days showed CSF opening pressure of 23 cm H₂O and cell number of 24/µL with 74% of lymphocytes. She did not experience any recurrence of the symptoms, and the oral methylprednisolone was discontinued gradually within 1 month. After about 1 month, she was discharged from our hospital. The final and fifth CSF examination showed CSF opening pressure of 17 cm H₂O and cell count of 12/µL with 79% of lymphocytes. The five CSF examinations are summarized in Table 1. At 1-year follow-up, she denied any recurrence of the symptoms. Written informed consent from the patient was obtained to perform invasive procedures and publish data. The ethics committee of our institute approved the publication of the case details.

### Delayed diagnosis of bilateral subdural effusions complicating intracranial hypotension in a patient presenting with post lumbar puncture headache [^114NT5jY]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 34-year-old woman presented with an unrelenting headache which had been ongoing since discharge from hospital 4days before. She initially presented 2weeks earlier with a 7days history of severe headache, for which she had a CT scan, lumbar puncture and treatment for possible viral meningitis. The headache got worse 4days after the lumbar puncture. Despite analgesics and bed rest, the headache persisted. A subsequent magnetic imaging scan demonstrated bilateral subdural effusions. She was given supportive treatment, which included advice concerning strict bed rest and analgesia. The headache took several months to abate. A third of patients suffer from post lumbar puncture headaches and this should be explained during informed consenting and post procedure. Not all post lumbar puncture headaches are simple headaches. A post lumbar puncture headache continuing for more than 7–14days after the procedure requires further investigation to exclude life-threatening intracranial complications.

Chronic meningitis is a syndrome characterised by persistent and progressive signs and symptoms of meningitis along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and elevated protein that fail to improve over 4 weeks. A detailed and careful history and examination is required along with CSF parameters to guide a clinician towards the aetiology of the problem. Neuroimaging modalities have become a useful tool in the quest for a diagnosis in such cases. An interesting case is described in real time illustrating the process of making a diagnosis in chronic meningitis with an insight into investigations and subsequent management.

Diagnostic workup

Diagnostic criteria include a CSF pressure < 60 mm H 2 O and/or evidence of a CSF leak on imaging. As lumbar puncture is invasive and only one-third of SIH patients has a CSF opening pressure < 60 mm H 2 O, MRI of the head and the spine is mandatory. Note that particularly in patients with a long history of SIH or with large abdominal girth CSF opening pressure is often normal or even elevated.

### MOG positive primary autoimmune meningitis mimicking tuberculous meningitis: a case series [^116rk1x7]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Patient 2

A 61-year-old female presented elsewhere with headache, blurred vision, recurrent vomiting, neck pain and mild disorientation (table 1). She had no prior similar complaints. She was conscious on examination, had mild recall deficits and no other neurological deficits. Brain and spine MRIs were normal. CSF analysis showed elevated opening pressure, lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated proteins and no malignant cells (table 2). Infectious workup was negative. Serum ACE was normal. Whole body PET scan was normal. She was treated with ceftriaxone and acyclovir for 10 days, showed improvement in her symptoms and was discharged, but was admitted 2 weeks later to our centre with similar complaints.

There was no history or systemic symptoms indicative of tuberculosis. She had no relevant medical, family or psychosocial history, and no indications for genetic testing. MRI brain with contrast showed subtle leptomeningeal enhancement in the posterior fossa (figure 1). CSF showed increased cell count, reduced proteins and glucose as compared with before (table 2). CSF infectious workup was negative. She was started on dexamethasone and ATT due to increasing cell counts, after exclusion of alternative diagnoses. She improved over 1 week and was discharged. Three months later, she developed ATT-induced hepatitis, which was managed with modified regimen (levofloxacin and amikacin). ATT was continued for 1 year. She remained stable for 3 years but presented again with symptoms of headache and vomiting for 3 days. MRI brain and spine were normal. There were no focal neurological deficits or meningeal signs. CSF analysis showed increased opening pressure, mononuclear pleocytosis, elevated protein and hypoglycorrhachia (table 2). Considering recurrence on steroid tapering, autoimmune aetiology was suspected in spite of normal brain and spine MRI. Serum and CSF MOG testing and CSF infectious workup was negative (table 3). In view of the repeated recurrence of symptoms, the patient was initiated on monthly cyclophosphamide [750 mg/m² body surface area (BSA)], following which she improved. When admitted for the third dose, the patient had sudden onset dull aching headache and vomiting for 3 days. MRI brain and spine were normal. CSF showed relative worsening and infectious workup was negative (table 2). MOG antibody testing was positive. The patient was discharged with a plan to continue Cyclophosphamide (every 3 weeks). On follow-up testing after the sixth dose, CSF showed increased opening pressure, with relative improvement in other parameters (table 2). The patient was initiated on Rituximab (1 g). Following two doses of rituximab and six doses of cyclophosphamide, she presented 1 month later with imbalance while walking, memory disturbances and neck pain for 1 week. MRI brain showed subtle T2 Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities. Infectious workup was negative and autoimmune workup was positive for serum MOG antibodies (table 3). She was initiated on methylprednisolone (1 g for 3 months) with azathioprine (50 mg two times per day) and showed significant improvement. She was asymptomatic on latest follow-up, 6 years from her initial presentation. The patient indicated a significant improvement in her quality of life after treatment.

### Comparative evaluation of the diagnostic and prognostic performance of CNSide ™ versus standard cytology for leptomeningeal disease [^113TqH9L]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastatic disease (LMD) is a rare, but highly morbid and fatal complication affecting 5–15% of cancer patients and with rising incidence.LMD occurs when cancer spreads to the leptomeninges or subarachnoid space by hematogenous spread, direct infiltration from solid brain metastases, perineural, or perivascular invasion, or seeding of cancer cells after neurosurgical interventions. Once seeded in the meninges, cancer cells can circulate along the meningeal and ependymal surfaces or via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, with a preference for settling in regions of slow CSF flow, and gravity-dependent locations, such as the posterior fossa, basilar cisterns, and lumbar cistern.

LMD diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of malignant cells in the CSF or suggested by clinical and/or neuroimaging findings in patients with metastatic disease. The diagnosis is often quite challenging due to limited sensitivity with initial cytology (50–67%) and MRI (75%), as well as high variability of clinical presentation. Clinical symptomatology is nonspecific and includes headache (from meningeal irritation), cranial nerve palsies, altered mental status, bowel or bladder dysfunction, extremity numbness and weakness, and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure from LMD-induced irregularities in CSF dynamics. Using joint European Association of Neuro-Oncology and European Society of Medical Oncology [EANO-ESMO] criteria, LMD diagnosis is defined as type I (confirmed malignant cells in cytology), and type II (lack of verification from cytology). Neuroimaging findings further classify LMD into different categories, linear disease (type A), nodular disease (type B), both linear and nodular (type C), and no imaging findings or hydrocephalus (type D). This classification broadens LMD definition as confirmed, probable, possible, or lack of evidence (Table 1), providing guidance on treatment choice with reasonable confidence for "confirmed and probable" cases versus additional work-up advised for "possible or lack of evidence" cases.CSF cytology remains the diagnostic gold standard for LMD with the highest specificity, however with low sensitivity, as malignant cells are detected in only 50–67% of initial lumbar punctures, increasing to 80–90% only after 3 serial lumbar punctures. Although minimally invasive, lumbar puncture is associated with potential complications including postprocedural headache, cranial neuropathies, nerve root irritation, low back pain, stylet-associated problems, infections, bleeding, and cerebral and spinal herniation. In addition to these potential effects, procedural time and patient reluctance further limit the feasibility of completing multiple spinal taps in the outpatient setting. Furthermore, standardization of collection protocols are needed as inappropriate sampling such as limited quantity of CSF retrieved, and inaccurate technique can lead to incomplete analysis reducing the amount of accurate information obtained.

### Clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes of spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117HkDF8]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

A significant proportion of patients (28%) successfully respond to conservative treatment measures (Table 2). Based on this finding, it would be beneficial to attempt conservative treatment before EBP in every patient with SIH, but further studies will need to clarify the best type and duration of conservative treatment. One EBP was effective in 64% of patients (Table 2). Improvement after EBP was one of the diagnostic criteria included in the ICHD-II classification; therefore, the proportion of successful outcomes reported in this systematic review could be an overestimate. According to the literature, EBPs also have a very safe profile, with only transient minor complications. When comparing different EBP techniques, large EBPs (> 20 mL) gave successful outcomes in a higher proportion of patients than small EBPs (Figure 3). This finding is in line with the results of a previous study by Wu et al. On the other hand, the use of targeted EBPs gave similar success rates compared with nontargeted EBPs. Randomized clinical trials will be required to confirm the superiority of large EBPs and investigate the potential difference between targeted and nontargeted EBPs. Based on the results of this review, large nontargeted EBP could be attempted in patients with SIH who do not improve with conservative treatment.

The results of this study suggest that the absence of orthostatic headache, normal imaging findings, or normal lumbar puncture opening pressures can occur in SIH; therefore, this diagnosis cannot be excluded in patients who do not present with all the typical features of this disorder. We propose that brain MRI and spine MRI with contrast could be performed as first-line investigations in patients with clinical suspicion of SIH. While a lumbar puncture could be offered to patients with a clinical picture suggestive of SIH but inconclusive first-line imaging, it needs to be undertaken with caution bearing in mind that the sensitivity of this investigation is relatively low (67%) and there is a risk of worsening SIH. Treatment with EBPs could be attempted early, even if the exact leak location is unknown. Second-line spinal imaging (eg, DSM or MR myelography with intrathecal gadolinium) could be offered to patients who do not respond to EBP and require targeted treatment (EBP or surgical).

Upon admission, she had no symptom and the neurological examinations were unremarkable. Fundus examination revealed no papilledema or any other abnormalities. The routine blood tests and autoimmune tests were both normal. Also, the cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (with contrast medium) and angiography did not show any abnormality (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and angiography.

The first lumbar puncture at an external hospital showed intrathecal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure of 20cmH 2 O and prominent lymphocytic (90%) pleocytosis with the cell count of 114/µL.

The second lumbar puncture conducted in our hospital revealed slightly increased CSF opening pressure of 30cmH 2 O, and confirmed the pleocytosis with cell count of 54/µL (lymphocytes 81%). There was also increased level of protein with 5.04 g/L, but normal glucose level. Serological tests were positive for lgG coxsackie virus and lgG varicella-zoster, and CSF tests of IgM/G virus were negative. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and parasites were not detected in CSF, and oligoclonal bands were not detected as well. Electroencephalogram of asymptomatic period showed no abnormality.

### Evaluation of acute headaches in adults [^112JQnUA]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Classifying headaches as primary (migraine, tension-type or cluster) or secondary can facilitate evaluation and management A detailed headache history helps to distinguish among the primary headache disorders. "Red flags" for secondary disorders include sudden onset of headache, onset of headache after 50 years of age, increased frequency or severity of headache, new onset of headache with an underlying medical condition, headache with concomitant systemic illness, focal neurologic signs or symptoms, papilledema and headache subsequent to head trauma. A thorough neurologic examination should be performed, with abnormal findings warranting neuroimaging to rule out intracranial pathology. The preferred imaging modality to rule out hemorrhage is noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scanning followed by lumbar puncture if the CT scan is normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more expensive than CT scanning and less widely available; however, MRI reveals more detail and is necessary for imaging the posterior fossa. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can help to confirm or rule out hemorrhage, infection, tumor and disorders related to CSF hypertension or hypotension. Referral is appropriate for patients with headaches that are difficult to diagnose, or that worsen or fail to respond to management

### Disseminated cryptococcal disease during treatment with idelalisib and corticosteroids for follicular lymphoma [^114WVWJH]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Investigations

Chest radiography, ECG and urinalysis revealed no significant abnormalities. At this time, blood counts showed a stable haemoglobin level at 10.0 g/dL and a leucocyte count of 5.4×10 9 cells/L (normal reference range = 4–11). Leucocyte differentiation showed a normal neutrophil count, but significant lymphopenia (0.3×10 9 cells/L, normal reference range = 1.0–4.8). C-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly increased at 173 mg/L (normal reference range < 10). Blood cultures obtained at initial presentation did not reveal the growth of any organisms. The patient was admitted to our hospital due to suspected sepsis, and intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone were administered. Urinary cultures produced an amoxicillin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis, and the patient was discharged with oral antibiotics for an assumed urinary tract infection.

Two days later, however, the patient was readmitted because of persistent fatigue, malaise and fever, refractory to the prescribed antibiotics. At this time, leucocyte count had fallen to 2.6×10 9 /L and would continue to drop to a nadir of 1.4×10 9 /L over the coming days. Antimicrobial therapy was empirically switched to piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood cultures revealed the growth of Cryptococcus neoformans. Although the patient did not exhibit any symptoms suggestive of the central nervous system (CNS) or pulmonary infection, these sites are often involved in cryptococcosis in HIV-negative, immunocompromised hosts. For this reason, we performed a pulmonary and CNS diagnostic work-up. High-resolution CT scan of the thorax showed multiple nodular opacities suggestive of pulmonary cryptococcosis (figure 1). Due to the absence of pulmonary symptoms, a respiratory specimen for microbiological investigation could not be obtained. Lumbar puncture revealed an elevated opening pressure (25 cm H₂O, normal reference range = 18–20). PCR on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for cryptococcal antigen confirmed the presence of cryptococci in the CNS. Based on the presence of fungemia, infiltrative lung disease and CNS localisation, a diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis was established.

### Spontaneous intracranial hypotension – a case report [^113CgHTm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Positional or orthostatic headache symptoms secondary to intracranial hypotension are usually seen as complications in patients after medical procedures, such as lumbar puncture. We describe a case of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) in a 43-year-old man without a previous history of headaches. He presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a new-onset orthostatic headache without any history of recent medical procedure, such as lumbar puncture (LP). The ED evaluation included a normal neurologic examination and normal computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain. An LP showed low opening pressure, elevated protein, 46 RBCs and one lymphocyte. Subsequent evaluation with radionuclide cisternography confirmed a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in the area of the upper thoracic spine, and treatment with an epidural blood patch dramatically improved his symptoms. SIH is due to CSF leakage, usually in the area of the cervical or upper thoracic spine, often without a clear etiology. Conservative medical management including bed rest, oral hydration and caffeine intake is the usual first line treatment. An epidural blood patch is often a dramatically effective treatment that can be done once the presence and location of the leak is identified. Although mostly benign, this condition occasionally can be associated with the formation of clinically significant subdural fluid collections or hematomas. SIH is an increasingly recognized cause of headache.

### Dilemmas in the diagnosis of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis [^115birFF]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Rapid diagnosis and treatment of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis reduces mortality and neurological sequelae, but can be delayed by atypical presentation, assessment of lumbar puncture safety, and poor sensitivity of standard diagnostic microbiology. Thus, diagnostic dilemmas are common in patients with suspected acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis. History and physical examination alone are sometimes not sufficient to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Lumbar puncture is an essential investigation, but can be delayed by brain imaging. Results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination should be interpreted carefully, because CSF abnormalities vary according to the cause, patient's age and immune status, and previous treatment. Diagnostic prediction models that use a combination of clinical findings, with or without test results, can help to distinguish acute bacterial meningitis from other causes, but these models are not infallible. We review the dilemmas in the diagnosis of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and focus on the roles of clinical assessment and CSF examination.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) timing and repeat use — EBP is considered the gold standard therapy for PDPH, and if an initial EBP produces no or partial relief of symptoms it may be repeated. Observational studies suggest that EBP failure (defined as requiring more than one EBP) is more likely if EBP is performed within 24–48 hours of dural puncture. It has been suggested that approximately 15% of patients with PDPH may require more than one EBP.

Leptomeningeal metastases — patient evaluation and CSF diagnosis: Patients present with signs and symptoms ranging from injury to nerves that traverse the subarachnoid space, direct tumor invasion of the brain or spinal cord, alteration of the local blood supply, obstruction of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow pathways leading to increased intracranial pressure, or interference with normal brain function. Patients should have a physical examination with a careful neurologic evaluation, and MRI of the brain and spine should also be performed for accurate staging, particularly if the patient is a candidate for active treatment. A definitive diagnosis is most commonly made by CSF analysis via lumbar puncture if it is safe for the patient, and CSF protein is typically increased with possible pleocytosis or decreased glucose levels and ultimately positive CSF cytology for tumor cells. Assessment of circulating tumor cells increases the sensitivity of tumor cell detection in CSF, is now CLIA-approved in some states, and should be done when it is available. CSF cytology testing has approximately 50% sensitivity with the first lumbar puncture, and up to 90% sensitivity after repeated CSF analyses in affected patients, and clinicians should be aware that lumbar punctures may be contraindicated in patients with anticoagulation, thrombocytopenia, or bulky intracranial disease.

### Clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes of spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114WqgTx]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The term spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) defines a clinical condition characterized by debilitating postural headaches secondary to spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak and/or CSF hypotension. According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), third edition, SIH is diagnosed when headache has developed spontaneously and in temporal relation to a CSF leak (evident on imaging) and/or CSF hypotension (lumbar puncture opening pressure < 60 mm CSF).

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a highly misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed disorder. Estimates suggest that SIH is not uncommon with an annual incidence of 5 per 100 000 individuals every year, half the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite the lack of objective evidence on the effect of SIH on patients' quality of life, the orthostatic headache typical of this condition makes SIH debilitating, affecting patients during their most active hours. The exact pathogenetic mechanism of SIH is unknown, and this lack of knowledge has led to a series of misconceptions. Moreover, the ICHD diagnostic criteria for SIH have changed significantly throughout the last few decades, and alternative diagnostic criteria have been proposed. These factors have probably contributed to the current uncertainty on how to reliably diagnose SIH and effectively treat these patients.

Despite the increasing number of publications on SIH throughout the last 2 decades, this is the first comprehensive systematic review on this condition, to our knowledge. The aim of this study is to summarize the available evidence on clinical presentation, diagnostic investigations, and treatment outcomes for SIH. Specific questions addressed in this systematic review are: (1) What are the signs and symptoms of SIH and how frequently do they occur? (2) What is the sensitivity of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spinal imaging, and lumbar puncture opening pressures in detecting signs of SIH? (3) What is the most sensitive spinal imaging technique to detect CSF leaks? (4) What are the outcomes of conservative treatment and epidural blood patches (EBP) in patients with SIH? (5) What is the most efficient EBP technique in SIH (nontargeted vs targeted, small- vs large-volume patches)?

### How do I perform a lumbar puncture and analyze the results to diagnose bacterial meningitis? [^114616By]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Diagnostic lumbar punctures (LPs), commonly used to rule out meningitis, are associated with adverse events.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence about diagnostic LP techniques that may decrease the risk of adverse events and the evidence about test accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in adult patients with suspected bacterial meningitis.

Data Sources

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (using Ovid and PubMed) from 1966 to January 2006 and EMBASE from 1980 to January 2006 without language restrictions to identify relevant studies and identified others from the bibliographies of retrieved articles.

Study Selection

We included randomized trials of patients aged 18 years or older undergoing interventions to facilitate a successful diagnostic LP or to potentially reduce adverse events. Studies assessing the accuracy of biochemical analysis of the CSF for possible bacterial meningitis were also identified.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted relevant data. For studies of the LP technique, data on the intervention and the outcome were extracted. For studies of the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, data on the reference standard and test accuracy were extracted.

Data Synthesis

We found 15 randomized trials. A random-effects model was used for quantitative synthesis. Five studies of 587 patients compared atraumatic needles with standard needles and found a nonsignificant decrease in the odds of headache with an atraumatic needle (absolute risk reduction [ARR], 12.3%; 95% confidence interval, -1.72% to 26.2%). Reinsertion of the stylet before needle removal decreased the risk of headache (ARR, 11.3%; 95% CI, 6.50%-16.2%). The combined results from 4 studies of 717 patients showed a nonsignificant decrease in headache in patients who were mobilized after LP (ARR, 2.9%; 95% CI, -3.4 to 9.3%). Four studies on the accuracy of biochemical analysis of CSF in patients with suspected meningitis met inclusion criteria. A CSF-blood glucose ratio of 0.4 or less (likelihood ratio [LR], 18; 95% CI, 12–27]), CSF white blood cell count of 500/muL or higher (LR, 15; 95% CI, 10–22), and CSF lactate level of 31.53 mg/dL or more (≥ 3.5 mmol/L; LR, 21; 95% CI, 14–32) accurately diagnosed bacterial meningitis.

Conclusions

These data suggest that small-gauge, atraumatic needles may decrease the risk of headache after diagnostic LP. Reinsertion of the stylet before needle removal should occur and patients do not require bed rest after the procedure. Future research should focus on evaluating interventions to optimize the success of a diagnostic LP and to enhance training in procedural skills.

The Case

This report centers on an immunocompetent woman in her 30s who had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and met 2017 McDonald criteria 3 years before our initial encounter. Her initial MS symptoms were episodic left arm and left leg numbness, and she had multifocal brain, cervical, and thoracic spine demyelinating lesions identified by magnetic resonance imaging. She had never received disease-modifying therapies or other immunosuppressive medications. Results of her baseline neurologic examination was unremarkable.

In October 2022, the patient traveled to a commercial clinic in Baja California, Mexico. During a 4-day visit, she underwent 2 lumbar punctures for intrathecal injection of donor umbilical cord stem cells programmed to treat MS. She pursued treatment at this clinic after reviewing its associated website as part of her research on stem cell treatments for MS.

The day after the second intrathecal injection, she visited an emergency department in the United States for positional headache and received an epidural blood patch for presumed postlumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. She reported nocturnal fevers, but vital signs, neurologic examination, complete blood counts, and computed tomography of the head were unremarkable. She was discharged after her headache improved but subsequently received 2 blood patches in the outpatient setting for recurrent headaches.

Because of persistent fevers, the patient was admitted to an outside hospital 5 days after receiving the third blood patch. At admission, she was febrile (101.3°F), but vital signs and complete blood counts were otherwise within reference ranges and HIV serology results were negative. Neurologic examination remained unremarkable. Sampling of her CSF revealed 74 nucleated cells/μL (76% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes), 64 red blood cells/µL, 84 mg/dL of protein, and 29 mg/dL of glucose (serum glucose 96 mg/dL). Results of herpes simplex virus PCR and enterovirus real-time reverse transcription PCR tests were negative. There was no growth on aerobic or anaerobic bacterial cultures. She received vancomycin and 1 dose of cefepime before changing over to meropenem because rash developed during cefepime infusion. She transitioned to imipenem for a 10-day total course; fever resolved, and headache improved.

### Consensus guidelines for lumbar puncture in patients with neurological diseases [^113DQF1W]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Lumbar puncture (LP) is a technique to sample cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a window into brain pathology (Supplemental Data). The procedure involves introducing a needle into the subarachnoid space of the lumbar sac, at a level safely below the spinal cord. Despite modern neuroimaging techniques, LP remains an important diagnostic tool as CSF analysis provides important diagnostic information for many neurological conditions. For example, no procedure can replace the CSF analysis in differential diagnosis of infectious disorders of the central nervous system (e.g. bacterial or viral meningitis, neuroborreliosis). Moreover, CSF analysis is now at the core of the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, an LP is the easiest procedure to perform a CSF pressure measurement. Given the use of CSF analysis for diagnosis, LPs are currently often performed to perform research to discover novel diagnostic biomarkers and understand brain pathology.

### Epidural steroid injection complicated by intrathecal entry, pneumocephalus, and chemical meningitis [^1172b7CN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural steroid injections are frequently used to treat back and extremity pain. The procedure is generally safe, with a low rate of adverse events, including intrathecal entry, pneumocephalus, and chemical meningitis.

Case Report

We report a case of a 45-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with headache, nausea, vomiting, and photophobia after a lumbar epidural steroid injection. She was afebrile and had an elevated white blood cell count. A non-contrast computed tomography scan of the head revealed pneumocephalus within the subarachnoid space and lateral ventricles. The patient was admitted to the ED observation unit for pain control and subsequently developed a marked leukocytosis and worsening meningismus. A lumbar puncture was performed yielding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) consistent with meningitis (1,000 total nucleated cells, 89% neutrophils, 85 mg/dL total protein, and no red blood cells). Gram stain revealed no bacteria. The patient was admitted on empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Antibiotics were discontinued at 48 h when CSF cultures remained negative and the patient was clinically asymptomatic. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should consider intrathecal entry and pneumocephalus in patients who present with a headache after an epidural intervention. The management of pneumocephalus includes supportive therapies, appropriate positioning, and supplemental oxygen. These symptoms can be accompanied by fever, leukocytosis, and markedly inflammatory CSF findings consistent with bacterial or chemical meningitis. Empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated until CSF culture results are available.

Brain imaging may be considered when non-orthostatic headache is present or develops after initial orthostatic headache, or when headache onset is more than five days after suspected dural puncture, and focal neurological deficits, visual changes, alterations in consciousness, or seizures, especially in the postpartum period, should prompt neuroimaging to evaluate alternative diagnoses; spinal imaging is usually not needed in routine PDPH but may occasionally show abnormalities in refractory PDPH.

In the initial assessment of the headache patient, the emergency physician must consider several dangerous secondary causes of headache. A thorough history and physical examination, along with consideration of a comprehensive differential diagnosis may alert the emergency physician to the diagnosis of a secondary headache particularly when the history is accompanied by any of the following clinical features: sudden/severe onset, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, advanced age, active or recent pregnancy, coagulopathy, malignancy, fever, visual deficits, and/or loss of consciousness.

Headache in IIH

As described above, chronic headache is another key symptom of IIH. Headache represents the most common reason for IIH patients to seek medical advice as it has a profound impact on the patient's quality of life. While the definition of IIH-related headache of the International Headache Society is relatively unspecific, it frequently has a migrainous phenotype (,–). Therefore, the differentiation between chronic migraine and IIH-related headache may be challenging. This is complicated even further due to the fact that in many IIH-patients, headache persists in the long-term despite a normalisation of CSF pressure. The IIHTT and other studies revealed that there is no correlation between CSF pressure and headache presence or intensity. The transient improvement after lumbar puncture is not exclusive to IIH-related headache, as it is also observed in other chronic headaches. When IIH-related headaches have a migrainous phenotype, the accompanying symptoms such as nausea, photophobia and phonophobia also tend to improve after lumbar puncture. For these reasons, a lumbar puncture-induced transient improvement of headache and accompanying symptoms does not allow the pathophysiological origin of IIH-related headache to be distinguished. It is clear that attributing it simply to the direct effect of elevated CSF pressure falls short as a plausible explanation, at least in the majority of IIH patients. Understanding the pathomechanism of IIH-related headache, including the involved neuronal networks and molecular mediators, would allow us to understand and reliably distinguish whether, in an individual patient, IIH-related headache is its own entity or if it is the result of a CSF pressure-induced aggravation of a pre-existing migraine, or if it may even unmask a migraine that had been previously been clinically inapparent. This differentiation may also allow understanding of why headache persists in some patients after normalisation of CSF pressure while it does not in others. It may be speculated that the subgroup of patients in which headache persists despite normalisation of CSF pressure may in fact have an additional migrainous biology, which may be the driving force behind headache chronification and maintenance of post-IIH headache. Unfortunately, to date there is no structured clinical study that answers this question in detail although this knowledge would be essential for the therapeutic management of IIH-related headache. When assessing the efficacy of a specific medication for the treatment of IIH, in contrast to the improvement in papilledema and visual function, the effect on IIH-related headache is much more difficult to assess given the complexity around the origin of IIH-related headache and its frequent overlap with chronic migraine.

An 89-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of chronic daily headaches that significantly worsened over the past 4 months. Initially episodic, the left-sided headaches became continuous and were accompanied by systemic symptoms such as weight loss and elevated inflammatory markers, specifically C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Over subsequent weeks, the neurologic examination revealed new-onset left-sided ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and marked visual acuity loss. This article explores the differential diagnosis for such a complex clinical presentation and highlights how a systematic diagnostic approach can guide clinicians toward the correct diagnosis.

### Pituitary apoplexy masquerading as intractable headache in a 66-year-old man: a case report [^116S7oWa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pituitary apoplexy is a rare but potentially life-threatening endocrine emergency caused by acute hemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland, typically in the setting of a preexisting adenoma. It often mimics other acute neurologic conditions, leading to delayed diagnosis.

Case Report

We describe the case of a 66-year-old man who presented twice to the emergency department with progressively worsening headache. On the initial visit, a noncontrast computed tomography was obtained and was normal, but on return visit, imaging revealed a pituitary macroadenoma. Fever and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis subsequently raised concern for meningitis, but the clinical context supported chemical meningitis secondary to apoplexy. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of pituitary apoplexy and emphasizes the need for advanced imaging and early endocrine consultation in evolving headache syndromes. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case emphasizes the diagnostic challenge of pituitary apoplexy, particularly when initial imaging is nondiagnostic and clinical symptoms evolve. Emergency physicians should maintain a high level of suspicion in patients with severe or recurrent headaches, even in the absence of classic visual or endocrine symptoms. Pituitary apoplexy, although rare, is a critical consideration in the differential diagnosis of sudden, severe headaches. Normal computed tomography imaging does not exclude the diagnosis, and evolving neurologic signs warrant advanced imaging. Cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities may mimic meningitis, but are often sterile in origin. Early recognition, corticosteroid therapy, and multidisciplinary management are essential to prevent permanent deficits.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^111PinX7]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar puncture — patient selection and infection findings: There are no prospective studies that support performing a lumbar puncture as part of the diagnostic evaluation in the ED on patients who are alert, oriented, afebrile, and not immunocompromised. There is evidence to support performing a lumbar puncture in patients who are immunocompromised and who have a first-time seizure, even if they are afebrile. In a retrospective cohort of 100 consecutive HIV-positive patients, 14 cases of central nervous system infections were identified on lumbar puncture; however, clinical correlation was not provided. In a prospective cohort, Sempere et al reported on 8 HIV-positive patients found to have a central nervous system infection as a cause of their seizure, 2 of whom were afebrile with no meningeal signs. Sempere et al reported that 5 of 9 patients with a first seizure who had a fever had a central nervous system infection. In a retrospective pediatric case series of 503 cases of meningitis in children aged 2 months to 15 years, there was no case of occult bacterial meningitis manifesting solely as a simple seizure.

### Meningitis [^115VveNx]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

Based on strong evidence, blood cultures usually recover the causative organism of bacterial meningitis in children not pretreated with antibiotics. Based on moderate evidence, pretreatment does not adversely affect the cerebrospinal fluid cell count, but it decreases the positive test result for cerebrospinal fluid culture, especially for meningococcal meningitis. Based on some research evidence as well as consensus, children with suspected bacterial meningitis and no clinical signs of brain herniation do not need neuroimaging as part of their initial clinical evaluation. Dexamethasone adjunctive therapy in children with pneumococcal meningitis is controversial. Some experts recommend neuroimaging toward the end of therapy for all neonates with bacterial meningitis. Based on some research evidence as well as consensus, home intravenous antimicrobial therapy may be an option in selected cases of pediatric bacterial meningitis.

### Reactive pleocytosis after repeated lumbar puncture-implications for clinical practice [^112zu7NA]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Lumbar puncture (LP) is a clinical procedure used either to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or to measure CSF opening pressure for routine diagnostic work‐up, or for therapeutic reasons, for example, to reduce intracranial pressure in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), or instillation of medication. In some cases, repeated LP is necessary. Irritation of meningeal and peri‐meningeal structures caused by LP might lead to reactive pleocytosis interfering with CSF results in case of subsequent LP. There is limited evidence on this topic with contradicting results, with the earliest publications dating back to the 1940s. While some studies observed that repeated LP affects white blood cell count (WBC), others reported no significant changes. Whether the time interval between repeated LP impacts CSF findings has not been investigated so far.

The aim of the present study was to investigate (i) whether repeated LP is associated with reactive pleocytosis and/or disruption of blood–CSF barrier function, and (ii) to determine the role of the time interval between repeated LP.

Clinician

Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from gastritis, colitis (splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, or left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illness, so the challenge is determining if the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis or brain abscess. The severity and duration of headache, lack of previous headache history, presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the CSF.

### Repeat lumbar puncture in adults with bacterial meningitis [^116WkXRr]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

In a prospective nationwide cohort study performed in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2014 we analysed clinical and laboratory characteristics of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis who underwent repeat lumbar puncture. Repeat lumbar puncture was performed in 124 of 1490 included episodes (8%), most commonly because of clinical deterioration (42%). Median cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leucocyte count on admission was 1473 cells/mm³. Median CSF cell count showed a decrease of 19% when repeated within 2 days; of 84% within 3–7 days, of 93% within 8–14 days and of 98% within 15–21 days. Repeat lumbar puncture confirmed the diagnosis of meningitis in eight patients with normal initial CSF examination. Repeat CSF cultures yielded bacteria in nine patients, which led to identification of an underlying source of infection in two. We conclude that repeat lumbar puncture is performed in a small proportion of adults. Although it should not be seen as routine it can be useful in selected cases to confirm diagnosis, to exclude relapsing or persistent infection, or for therapeutic purpose in communicating hydrocephalus.

### Physical activity and excess body weight and adiposity for adults. American College of Sports Medicine consensus statement [^111B17qJ]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Exercise, appetite, and energy intake — consensus statements — A single bout of aerobic exercise does not increase hunger or energy intake over the subsequent 24 h, yet further evidence is needed to examine individual responses, and when performed over the longer term, regular aerobic exercise can elicit partial compensation in energy intake. High habitual levels of physical activity may sensitize the control of appetite with a tighter coupling between energy expenditure and energy intake following energy perturbations, whereas physical inactivity and sedentariness fail to downregulate energy intake and can permit overconsumption. The complex interaction between energy expenditure and energy intake means that the effects of exercise on the control of appetite will be variable between individuals.

### Migraine [^113vLPH6]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Migraine is a complex neurological disorder characterized by episodes of moderate-to-severe headache, most often unilateral and generally associated with nausea, light sensitivity and sound sensitivity. Other characteristic symptoms include vomiting, cognitive dysfunction, allodynia, dizziness, and/or exacerbation of symptoms by routine physical activity. Some people with migraine experience aura, a premonitory period of sensory disturbance widely accepted to be caused by cortical spreading depression at the onset of a migraine attack. Signs and symptoms Migraine typically presents with self-limited, recurrent severe headaches associated with autonomic symptoms. About 15–30% of people living with migraine experience episodes with aura, and they also frequently experience episodes without aura. The severity of the pain, duration of the headache, and frequency of attacks are variable.

A migraine attack lasting longer than 72 hours is termed status migrainosus. There are four possible phases to a migraine attack, although not all the phases are necessarily experienced:

- The premonitory phase or prodrome, which occurs hours or days before the headache
- The aura, which immediately precedes the headache
- The pain phase, also known as the headache phase
- The postdrome, the effects experienced following the end of a migraine attack Migraine is associated with major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. These psychiatric disorders are approximately 2–5 times more common in people without aura, and 3–10 times more common in people with aura. The pain is frequently accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, sensitivity to smells, fatigue, and irritability. Many thus seek a dark and quiet room.

In a basilar migraine, a migraine with neurological symptoms related to the brain stem or with neurological symptoms on both sides of the body, common effects include a sense of the world spinning, light-headedness, and confusion. Nausea occurs in almost 90% of people, and vomiting occurs in about one-third. Other symptoms may include blurred vision, nasal stuffiness, diarrhea, frequent urination, pallor, or sweating. Swelling or tenderness of the scalp may occur as can neck stiffness. Associated symptoms are less common in the elderly. Silent migraine Sometimes, aura occurs without a subsequent headache. This is known in modern classification as a typical aura without headache, or acephalgic migraine in previous classification, or commonly as a silent migraine.

However, silent migraine can still produce debilitating symptoms, with visual disturbance, vision loss in half of both eyes, alterations in color perception, and other sensory problems, like sensitivity to light, sound, and odors. Postdrome The migraine postdrome is the constellation of symptoms occurring once the acute headache has ceased. A study found reports of a sore feeling in the same area as the migraine; reports of impaired thinking for a few days after the headache passed; reports of tiredness, feeling "hungover", head pain, cognitive difficulties, gastrointestinal symptoms, weakness, body aches, and nausea. Studies of the brain's structure and function indicate that brain activity changes during the 48 hours before the pain phase of migraine.

### Meningitis… [^112erJ1z]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Meningitis is acute or chronic inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, collectively called the meninges. The most common symptoms are fever, intense headache, vomiting and neck stiffness and occasionally photophobia. Other symptoms include confusion or altered consciousness, nausea, and an inability to tolerate loud noises. Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding. A non-blanching rash may also be present. The inflammation may be caused by infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites. Non-infectious causes include malignancy, subarachnoid hemorrhage, chronic inflammatory disease and certain drugs. Meningitis can be life-threatening because of the inflammation's proximity to the brain and spinal cord; therefore, the condition is classified as a medical emergency.

A lumbar puncture, in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, can diagnose or exclude meningitis. Signs and symptoms Clinical features In adults, the most common symptom of meningitis is a severe headache, occurring in almost 90% of cases of bacterial meningitis, followed by neck stiffness. The classic triad of diagnostic signs consists of neck stiffness, sudden high fever, and altered mental status; however, all three features are present in only 44–46% of bacterial meningitis cases. If none of the three signs are present, acute meningitis is extremely unlikely. Other signs commonly associated with meningitis include photophobia and phonophobia. Small children often do not exhibit the aforementioned symptoms, and may only be irritable and look unwell.

The fontanelle can bulge in infants aged up to 6 months. Other features that distinguish meningitis from less severe illnesses in young children are leg pain, cold extremities, and an abnormal skin color. Another test, known as the "jolt accentuation maneuver" helps determine whether meningitis is present in those reporting fever and headache. A person is asked to rapidly rotate the head horizontally; if this does not make the headache worse, meningitis is unlikely. Other problems can produce symptoms similar to those above, but from non-meningitic causes. This is called meningism or pseudomeningitis. Early complications Additional problems may occur in the early stage of the illness. These may require specific treatment, and sometimes indicate severe illness or a worse prognosis.

The infection may trigger sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome of falling blood pressure, fast heart rate, high or abnormally low temperature, and rapid breathing. Very low blood pressure may occur at an early stage, especially but not exclusively in meningococcal meningitis; this may lead to insufficient blood supply to other organs. The brain tissue may swell, pressure inside the skull may increase, and the swollen brain may herniate through the skull base. This may be noticed by a decreasing level of consciousness, loss of the pupillary light reflex, and abnormal posturing. The inflammation of the brain tissue may also obstruct the normal flow of CSF around the brain. Seizures may occur for various reasons; in children, seizures are common in the early stages of meningitis and do not necessarily indicate an underlying cause. Seizures may result from increased pressure and from areas of inflammation in the brain tissue.

### New daily persistent headache… [^116tw4xy]. Wikipedia (2009). Low credibility.

New daily persistent headache is a primary headache syndrome which can mimic chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache. The headache is daily and unremitting from very soon after onset, usually in a person who does not have a history of a primary headache disorder. The pain can be intermittent, but lasts more than 3 months. Headache onset is abrupt and people often remember the date, circumstance and, occasionally, the time of headache onset. One retrospective study stated that over 80% of patients could state the exact date their headache began. The cause of NDPH is unknown, and it may have more than one etiology. NDPH onset is commonly associated with an infection or flu-like illness, stressful life event, minor head trauma, and extra cranial surgery. Infection or flu-like illness and stressful life event are most often cited. The pathophysiology of NDPH is poorly understood.

Signs and symptoms The headaches can vary greatly in their clinical presentation and duration. Quality of the headache has been described as dull and/or pressure-like sensation, and throbbing and/or pulsating sensation. The pain is usually on both sides of the head, but may be unilateral, and may be localized to any head region. The pain can fluctuate in intensity and duration, is daily, and lasts more than 3 months. There may be accompanying photophobia, phonophobia, lightheadedness or mild nausea. Co-morbidity with mood disorders has been reported in a subset of patients. Cranial autonomic nervous symptoms occur with painful exacerbations in 21%, and cutaneous allodynia may be present in 26%. In 2002, Li and Rozen conducted a study of 56 patients at the Jefferson Headache Center in Philadelphia and published the following results:

- 82% of patients were able to pinpoint the exact day their headache started.
- 30% of the patients, the onset of the headache occurred in correlation with an infection or flu-like illness.
- 38% of the patients had a prior personal history of headache.
- 29% of the patients had a family history of headache.
- 68% reported nausea.
- 66% reported photophobia.
- 61% reported phonophobia.
- 55% reported lightheadedness. Imaging and laboratory testing were unremarkable except for an unusually high number of patients who tested positive for a past Epstein-Barr virus infection. Diagnosis Although NDPH is classified as a primary headache syndrome, it must be remembered that a number of important conditions can present with a new-onset persisting headache, and these must be excluded prior to making a diagnosis of a primary headache disorder. The diagnosis is one of excluding the many secondary types or NDPH mimics, which is especially critical early in the course of the disease when a secondary etiology is more likely. NDPH mimics include but are not limited to:

- cerebral venous thrombosis
- Chiari malformation
- NDPH with medication overuse headache Many doctors state that the condition is best viewed as a syndrome rather than a diagnosis. Once a diagnosis of NDPH is made, clinicians argue that patients are best managed according to the more detailed pathophysiology-based diagnosis than lumped together into a single group, since a single disorder is unlikely to exist. NDPH is classified as a Primary Headache Disorder by the ICHD-2 classification system using number 4.
8. It is one of the types of primary headache syndromes that present as a chronic daily headache, which is a headache present for more than 15 days a month for more than 3 months. ICHD criteria The ICHD diagnostic criteria are:

1. Headache that, within 3 days of onset, fulfils criteria 2–4
2. Headache is present daily, and is unremitting, for > 3 months 3. At least two of the following pain characteristics:

1. bilateral location 2.
