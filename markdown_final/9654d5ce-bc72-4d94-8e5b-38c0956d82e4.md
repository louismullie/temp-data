## Question

What is the rationale for measuring a tryptase level in a patient with anaphylaxis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why measuring serum tryptase is useful in a patient with anaphylaxis — when and how to measure it, and how to interpret results including thresholds, pitfalls, and links to mast cell disorders. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic rationale for tryptase measurement and its kinetic window. Then, I should define the guideline-supported indications for ordering tryptase. Next, I will outline the optimal paired sampling strategy and the accepted diagnostic algorithms. After that, I need to interpret positive and negative results in clinical context, consider evaluation for underlying mast cell disorders, and account for confounders and assay issues. Finally, I will integrate tryptase into a broader diagnostic approach and apply it to key scenarios such as hymenoptera venom and perioperative reactions, including pediatric nuances, before summarizing practical steps and the core rationale.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic rationale and kinetics. Tryptase is a mast cell protease released during degranulation; unlike histamine, which clears within minutes, total serum tryptase rises with a delay of roughly 15–20 minutes, peaks around 1 hour, and declines with a half-life on the order of 60–150 minutes, creating a clinically useful window for detection of mast cell activation in anaphylaxis, whereas histamine's kinetics are often too fast for routine ED workflows [^115CjEAe] [^113BTsew] [^115ajv3V]. Hold on, I should verify severity correlations: while tryptase often tracks with more severe reactions, platelet-activating factor may correlate even more strongly with severity, which helps explain why some severe cases still show modest tryptase rises despite true anaphylaxis [^116r7MgN].

> Next, I should review guideline-backed indications for ordering tryptase. Wait, let me verify that both AAAAI and EAACI converge here: obtain an acute tryptase as early as feasible within about 2 hours of symptom onset, particularly for severe reactions with hypotension, atypical presentations without urticaria, high-risk settings such as perioperative reactions, hymenoptera stings, recurrent or idiopathic anaphylaxis, and when diagnostic uncertainty exists, but do not rely on tryptase alone to diagnose or exclude anaphylaxis or clonal mast cell disease [^115tH6v2] [^112x9GkK] [^1118L4WJ] [^117PzXHn].

> I need to ensure correct sampling because timing drives interpretability. Let me double-check: optimal accuracy requires paired samples, with an acute sample collected ideally 30 minutes to 2 hours after onset and a convalescent baseline at least 24 hours after complete symptom resolution; in perioperative care, a stored preoperative baseline can be invaluable, and tryptase is stable for years in frozen serum if retrospective testing is needed [^117PzXHn] [^115tH6v2] [^111VSBdQ] [^114mvifn].

> Now, I will examine the diagnostic algorithms. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — absolute cutoffs are misleading given inter-individual variability. The international consensus "20% + 2" rule defines a significant rise as acute tryptase greater than baseline × 1.2 plus 2 ng/mL, which performs well across settings including perioperative anaphylaxis; newer data suggest that an acute-to-baseline ratio exceeding 1.685 optimizes sensitivity and specificity by accounting for baseline variability, especially relevant in HαT or mastocytosis where baselines are higher [^111VSBdQ] [^115ajv3V] [^113PznWu].

> Let me interpret what a positive result means. A significant acute elevation by the 20% + 2 rule or by an optimized ratio strongly supports mast cell–mediated anaphylaxis and shows a high positive predictive value in perioperative cohorts, with higher elevations often accompanying hypotension or more severe grades, so a robust rise confirms mechanism even when clinical uncertainty exists [^115ajv3V] [^116r7MgN]. But wait, I should verify range limitations: absolute values below traditional "normal" thresholds can still represent a diagnostic rise if the baseline is very low, which is why paired sampling is critical [^111VSBdQ].

> Conversely, I need to emphasize what a normal tryptase does not do. Let me reconsider the sensitivity figures: tryptase has limited sensitivity overall and especially in food-triggered anaphylaxis, where rises are smaller and timing is frequently suboptimal, resulting in poor negative predictive value, so a normal acute tryptase cannot exclude anaphylaxis and should never delay epinephrine or appropriate care [^112yxZKv] [^117RmKRi] [^115jH974] [^112q1Rbk]. Hold on, I should verify real-world compliance: ED sampling often occurs too late and without paired baselines, which further depresses apparent sensitivity in practice [^112q1Rbk].

> I should confirm when to evaluate for underlying mast cell disorders using baseline tryptase. If baseline tryptase is persistently ≥ 8 ng/mL, I need to check for hereditary α-tryptasemia via TPSAB1 copy number testing, and if baseline is ≥ 15–20 ng/mL, I should consider clonal mast cell disease with KIT D816V testing and, in appropriate adults with severe hymenoptera or idiopathic anaphylaxis, bone marrow evaluation, while remembering that not all SM patients have elevated baselines and that tryptase alone cannot diagnose or exclude SM [^1157z6pq] [^116tP1Vx] [^115WGiQE] [^1178pNKy] [^114TJ4bW]. Wait, let me verify risk links: elevated baseline tryptase and HαT both associate with more severe hymenoptera anaphylaxis and may influence venom immunotherapy risk discussions and long-term management plans [^114TJ4bW] [^116NPsiq] [^117K4eeU].

> Next, I should review important limitations and confounders. Elevated tryptase is not specific to anaphylaxis and can be seen in renal dysfunction, myeloid neoplasms, and non-immune mast cell activation; heterophilic antibody interference from rheumatoid factor or HAMA can cause false positives, prompting use of blocking tubes when results are discordant with the clinical picture; additionally, some oncology and infusion settings de-emphasize tryptase because of limited availability and poor turnaround, so clinical judgment remains paramount [^117SZefD] [^112yxZKv] [^113ENJTV]. Hmm, wait a minute, I need to check practical barriers: in many EDs, delayed sampling and lack of paired baselines are common, limiting utility even when ordered appropriately [^112q1Rbk].

> I will now integrate tryptase into a multimodal diagnostic approach. Clinical diagnostic criteria remain the cornerstone; tryptase serves as objective support for mast cell activation and can be complemented by allergen-specific IgE, skin testing, and, in specialized settings, basophil or mast cell activation assays, where interestingly a significant tryptase rise strongly predicts basophil activation test positivity in perioperative reactions and may guide culprit identification and risk stratification [^115tH6v2] [^114JxhbS] [^1176FzFS] [^114m89mx]. Hold on, I should verify emerging biomarkers: while PAF and related measures may track severity, they are not routinely available for acute decision-making and remain investigational in most centers [^116r7MgN] [^117RmKRi].

> Let me apply this to hymenoptera venom reactions. Baseline tryptase should be measured in all patients with severe sting anaphylaxis, especially with hypotension or lack of urticaria, both to assess risk and to screen for mastocytosis or HαT; severe reactions without skin findings plus elevated baseline tryptase heighten concern for clonal mast cell disease and may prompt bone marrow evaluation even when baseline is not frankly high, given notable SM prevalence in this phenotype [^114TJ4bW] [^1145dYLv] [^115Ds6cK] [^116J6D1r]. I should double-check counseling: elevated baseline tryptase informs discussions on venom immunotherapy efficacy and safety, with closer monitoring warranted in higher-risk profiles [^114TJ4bW].

> Now perioperative anaphylaxis. Acute and baseline paired tryptase using the 20% + 2 rule has strong diagnostic performance and supports differentiating immune-mediated reactions from mimics; preoperative sample storage is prudent, and a marked tryptase rise also predicts a higher likelihood of a positive basophil activation test to the culprit agent, which can focus subsequent allergy workups and perioperative planning [^115ajv3V] [^111VSBdQ] [^114JxhbS] [^1176FzFS] [^114m89mx]. Wait, let me verify that mature tryptase adds value here — data suggest total tryptase outperforms mature tryptase at lower ranges, so total tryptase with paired sampling remains the standard [^115ajv3V].

> For pediatric anaphylaxis, I should confirm that diagnostic performance is more modest. Children predominantly have food triggers where tryptase rises are smaller, so sensitivity is lower than in adults, yet paired measurements still aid in atypical or severe cases and can incidentally reveal elevated baselines suggesting HαT or mastocytosis for further evaluation and counseling [^112PzNGb] [^111TPEet] [^111G2ezf] [^112Vn3TF]. Hold on, I should verify thresholds: given developmental norms and potential sex-based differences, baseline interpretation follows adult-derived ranges but should be contextualized clinically, with HαT evaluation considered when baseline is ≥ 8 ng/mL and symptoms warrant it [^116tP1Vx].

> Let me distill practical steps, but I will double-check I include timing and rules. In suspected anaphylaxis, treat first and do not delay epinephrine; if feasible, draw an acute tryptase within 0.5–2 hours of onset and arrange a convalescent baseline ≥ 24 hours after full resolution; interpret using the 20% + 2 rule and consider the 1.685 ratio to navigate baseline variability; if baseline ≥ 8 ng/mL, consider HαT testing, and if baseline ≥ 15–20 ng/mL or phenotype suggests clonal disease, evaluate for SM including KIT D816V and, selectively, bone marrow biopsy; always integrate results with clinical criteria and consider confounders or assay interference when findings are discordant [^115tH6v2] [^117PzXHn] [^113PznWu] [^116tP1Vx] [^1178pNKy] [^117SZefD].

> In summary, measuring tryptase provides objective evidence of mast cell activation that strengthens the diagnosis of anaphylaxis when obtained with proper timing and interpreted against a personal baseline using validated algorithms; it helps uncover underlying mast cell disorders that alter risk and management, informs perioperative and venom-related investigations, and supports precision in follow-up testing, yet it must be integrated with clinical assessment because a normal tryptase does not exclude anaphylaxis and assay or biological limitations are common in real-world practice [^115tH6v2] [^117PzXHn] [^115ajv3V] [^113PznWu] [^112yxZKv].

You check a tryptase level in anaphylaxis to **confirm mast cell activation** [^115tH6v2] and **support the diagnosis** when clinical features are ambiguous or absent (e.g. no urticaria) [^112x9GkK]. Tryptase rises within 30–120 minutes [^115tH6v2] and peaks around 1–2 hours [^115CjEAe], so **timing is critical** [^117PzXHn]. A **significant acute rise** (≥ 20% + 2 ng/mL over baseline) [^113PznWu] indicates mast cell degranulation and helps distinguish anaphylaxis from mimics [^115ajv3V]. Baseline tryptase should be measured after recovery [^112x9GkK] to assess for **mastocytosis** or **hereditary alpha-tryptasemia** [^1157z6pq], which increase anaphylaxis risk [^116NPsiq]. Tryptase is **not always elevated** [^112yxZKv], especially in food-induced reactions [^115jH974], so normal levels do not exclude anaphylaxis [^112q1Rbk].

---

## Clinical rationale for measuring tryptase in anaphylaxis

### Confirmation of mast cell activation

Mast cell degranulation releases **tryptase** [^115CjEAe], a hallmark of anaphylaxis [^115tH6v2]. Elevated tryptase provides **diagnostic support** [^112x9GkK], particularly when clinical features are ambiguous or absent (e.g. no urticaria) [^1118L4WJ].

---

### Differentiation from other conditions

Tryptase aids the **differential diagnosis** [^112yxZKv], helping distinguish anaphylaxis from conditions with similar presentations (e.g. vasovagal syncope, panic attacks, acute asthma). Its **specificity** for mast cell activation exceeds that of histamine [^116r7MgN], which can be elevated in various conditions [^117RmKRi].

---

### Identification of underlying mast cell disorders

An elevated **baseline tryptase** (> 8 ng/mL) [^116tP1Vx] suggests mastocytosis or hereditary alpha-tryptasemia [^1157z6pq] and increases anaphylaxis risk [^112x9GkK] [^116NPsiq]. Identifying these disorders improves **risk assessment** [^112x9GkK], guiding management and stratification [^1178pNKy].

---

## Timing and interpretation of tryptase measurements

### Timing of tryptase sampling

The **acute phase** sample should be obtained within 30 minutes to 2 hours after symptom onset [^115tH6v2]; levels peak at 1–2 hours [^115CjEAe] and return to baseline within 12–24 hours [^117PzXHn]. The **baseline measurement** should be drawn at least 24 hours after complete symptom resolution to establish baseline [^117PzXHn] [^111VSBdQ].

---

### Interpretation of tryptase levels

A **significant rise** — an acute increase of ≥ 20% + 2 ng/mL over baseline [^113PznWu] — indicates mast cell activation. A **normal baseline** is typically 1–15 ng/mL [^112yYfkP]; an elevated baseline suggests underlying mast cell disorders [^112x9GkK].

---

## Clinical scenarios where tryptase measurement is particularly useful

- **Perioperative anaphylaxis**: Helps confirm diagnosis and guide future anesthesia management [^115ajv3V] [^111VSBdQ].

- **Idiopathic anaphylaxis**: Supports diagnosis when the trigger is unknown [^1118L4WJ] [^112x9GkK].

- **Severe reactions**: Useful in severe reactions with hypotension or cardiovascular collapse [^116r7MgN] [^112x9GkK].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **False negatives**: Tryptase may be normal [^112yxZKv] in food-induced anaphylaxis [^115jH974] or mild reactions.

- **False positives**: Elevated baseline tryptase [^112x9GkK] can occur in mastocytosis or hereditary alpha-tryptasemia [^112yYfkP].

- **Clinical correlation**: Always interpret tryptase in clinical context [^112q1Rbk]; normal levels do not exclude anaphylaxis [^112yxZKv].

---

## Summary: clinical utility of tryptase measurement in anaphylaxis

Serum tryptase measurement **supports anaphylaxis diagnosis** [^115tH6v2] by confirming mast cell activation, distinguishing anaphylaxis from mimics [^117RmKRi], and identifying underlying mast cell disorders such as mastocytosis or hereditary alpha-tryptasemia [^116NPsiq]. Sampling should include an acute specimen obtained 30 minutes to 2 hours after onset [^117PzXHn] and a baseline specimen drawn at least 24 hours after complete resolution [^111VSBdQ], with interpretation using the ≥ 20% + 2 ng/mL rule [^113PznWu]. Because false negatives and positives occur, results must be interpreted in clinical context [^112q1Rbk]. In short, measuring tryptase in anaphylaxis **confirms mast cell activation** [^115CjEAe], supports diagnosis, and identifies underlying mast cell disorders; **timing and interpretation are critical** [^117PzXHn], and results should be correlated with clinical findings.

### Global trends in anaphylaxis epidemiology and clinical implications [^112yxZKv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Although largely a clinical diagnosis, biomarkers, and specifically serum tryptase, may support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis and aid in differentiating anaphylaxis from its mimics such as idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome and severe asthma. It is important to note that serum tryptase level is also elevated in fatal asthma. This can be crucial in the context of monitoring trends for more severe reactions. Yet despite its recommendation in guidelines, the role of tryptase in "real-world" practice remains debated. From a practical standpoint, serum tryptase is not readily available to emergency providers because it often takes several days for results to become available.

Moreover, although the positive predictive value of serum tryptase is high (93%), the negative predictive value is low (17%) and may not be helpful, particularly for food-induced anaphylaxis when tryptase level is frequently not elevated. Other biomarkers, such as platelet-activating factor, cysteinyl leukotrienes, and chemokine ligand-2, have been proposed but can be difficult to measure even under laboratory conditions. Future studies may need to consider examining the sensitivity and specificity of a combination of biomarkers.

With regard to anaphylaxis management, although epinephrine remains the first-line treatment, glucocorticoids and antihistamines, including both H1- and H2-antihistamines, are often recommended as second-line treatment (although the latest European Academy of All

### Defining baseline variability of serum tryptase levels improves accuracy in identifying anaphylaxis [^113PznWu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Acute increases of ≥ 20% + 2 ng/mL (20 + 2 rule) over basal serum tryptase (BST) is the recommended threshold supporting a clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Prospective studies have demonstrated high sensitivity for this algorithm after parenteral exposure, but specificity has not been evaluated.

- **Objective**: We sought to define a serum tryptase change that distinguishes baseline variability from anaphylaxis on the basis of intraindividual variation in BST.

- **Methods**: Ninety-three total subjects with atopy (n = 62) or hereditary α-tryptasemia (HαT) (n = 31) and ≥ 2 BST measurements were identified. Sequential BST variability measurements were modeled, and threshold ratios that optimized sensitivity and/or specificity were determined. Models were tested in 22 individuals with physician-diagnosed anaphylaxis and validated in independent cohorts of individuals with HαT (n = 33), indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) (n = 52), and ISM + HαT (n = 12). Mature tryptase levels were measured in HαT (n = 19) and ISM (n = 20). An online application was developed for clinical use.

- **Results**: As a result of BST variability, 9.7% (9/93) of primary cohort patients, 18% (6/33) of HαT patients, 30% (16/52) of ISM patients, and 25% (3/12) of ISM + HαT patients from validation cohorts met the 20 + 2 rule despite absent immediate hypersensitivity symptoms; mature tryptase was noncontributory among individuals with HαT or ISM at baseline. A ratio of acute tryptase/BST exceeding 1.685 provided the optimized diagnostic rule for jointly maximizing sensitivity and specificity.

### Cutaneous manifestations in Hymenoptera and Diptera anaphylaxis: Relationship with basal serum tryptase [^115Ds6cK]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

To compare the clinical presentation of systemic anaphylaxis to Hymenoptera and Diptera with regard to basal serum tryptase (BT) and to evaluate mastocytosis in patients with elevated tryptase, the medical records of 140 patients with a history of a systemic reaction to venom were retrospectively reviewed. Symptoms, severity of anaphylaxis, and BT were recorded. Most patients with elevated tryptase were screened for mastocytosis. A dermatological examination with a skin biopsy was performed in 19 cases, and a bone marrow biopsy in 14 cases.

Tryptase was elevated in 23 patients. These patients reported fewer usual skin reactions — urticaria in 26.1% of cases with raised tryptase versus 76.1% of cases with normal tryptase — more flushing (52.2% vs. 4.3%) and frequently did not present skin reactions (26.1% vs. 9.4%). They presented a more severe reaction, with a mean grade of severity of 3.48 versus 2.69. Mastocytosis was diagnosed in seven patients with elevated tryptase: indolent systemic mastocytosis in six cases and cutaneous mastocytosis without systemic involvement in one case. In five cases, mastocytosis was previously undiagnosed. Lesions of cutaneous mastocytosis, diagnosed in five patients, consisted of urticaria pigmentosa in all cases and were often inconspicuous.

These results demonstrate particular clinical features of the allergic reaction in patients with elevated BT and the higher frequency of mastocytosis in this population. In patients with a severe anaphylactic reaction without urticaria, but with flushing, trypta…

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hymenoptera sting allergy, particularly concerning serum tryptase levels, the AAAAI/ACAAI 2017 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a basal serum tryptase level measurement in patients who experience anaphylaxis from a sting.

### Massive release of the histamine-degrading enzyme diamine oxidase during severe anaphylaxis in mastocytosis patients [^113BTsew]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

The half-life of 90–150 minutes for tryptase and 20–30 hours for human DAO post-parturition might explain the delayed increase of DAO with already decreasing tryptase concentrations during severe anaphylaxis events. While DAO concentrations were still increasing 90 minutes after withdrawing the first sample, tryptase levels decreased following a half-life of about 60–120 minutes. Assuming that the half-life of DAO is also 20–30 hours in non-pregnant individuals, no data are available, and DAO concentrations might be elevated for a few days. An extended DAO half-life might improve the probability to detect MC degranulation.

What are the consequences of highly elevated DAO concentrations during severe anaphylaxis in vivo and in vitro? If blood is withdrawn from subjects with high DAO concentrations, plasma histamine will likely be degraded, and the measured values artificially lower if DAO is not immediately inactivated. Most published histamine measurements during anaphylaxis did not explicitly inactivate DAO, and some of the low measured histamine concentrations might be partially an artifact if high DAO levels were present. In the clinical environment, it is certainly not uncommon to leave blood for 30 minutes or even longer at room temperature before preparing plasma and analyzing or freezing the samples. Blood will slowly cool from 37°C to the ambient temperature, possibly leaving sufficient time for DAO to degrade histamine. DAO will also degrade histamine during thawing and rewarming of frozen samples necessary for downstream assays like histamine measurement.

### Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase: A biomarker in Hymenoptera venom allergy [^114ZRSQW]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a rapid, potentially fatal, immediate hypersensitivity reaction. Preformed and newly formed biochemical mediators, including histamine, tryptase, carboxypeptidase A, prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor (PAF), are released systematically during the degranulation of mast cells and basophils. PAF is a proinflammatory phospholipid synthesized and secreted by mast cells, monocytes, and fixed tissue macrophages. Its binding to its receptor on target cells — platelets, monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils — results in many manifestations of acute allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. Circulating levels of PAF are controlled by the activity of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), an enzyme that degrades PAF. Due to the quick elimination of PAF (half-life, 3–13 minutes), PAF-AH has been proposed as a surrogate biomarker for PAF activity correlated with the severity of anaphylaxis. However, it was investigated in Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA) only in one previous study in a real-world population.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the role of PAF-AH as a predictive biomarker for the severity of the reaction in an HVA-selected population (HVA-alone population) without confounding factors and to compare their PAF-AH values with those of healthy subjects and patients with allergic asthma or rhinitis. We also investigated the correlation of PAF-AH activity with other factors, including demographic factors, concomitant diseases and medications, serum tryptase values, venom sIgE levels, and the culprit insect, in a larger HVA population.

### Clonal mast cell disorders in patients with severe Hymenoptera venom allergy and normal serum tryptase levels [^116J6D1r]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Systemic mastocytosis is a clonal mast cell (MC) disease that can lead to potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions caused by excessive MC mediator release. The prevalence of mastocytosis in patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy is high, and thus the disease should be suspected in patients with severe reactions caused by Hymenoptera stings and increased serum basal tryptase (SBT) levels.

- **Objective**: We sought to evaluate the presence of clonal MC disorders in patients seen at our mastocytosis center with Hymenoptera sting-induced anaphylaxis, documented hypotension, absence of urticaria pigmentosa, and normal SBT levels.

- **Methods**: Twenty-two patients with Hymenoptera sting-induced anaphylaxis, without skin lesions, and with tryptase levels of less than 11.4 ng/mL underwent bone marrow evaluation. Bone mineral density was assessed in those patients with ascertained mastocytosis.

- **Results**: In 16 of 22 patients, a diagnosis of indolent mastocytosis could be established, and 1 patient had a monoclonal MC activation syndrome. Patients with mastocytosis had higher SBT levels (P = 0.03) but only rarely had angioedema/urticaria associated with hypotension (P = 0.004).

- **Conclusions**: The absence of urticaria or angioedema in severe reactions to Hymenoptera stings with hypotension might represent the most relevant factor in identifying patients with mastocytosis, regardless of their serum tryptase levels.

### Systemic mastocytosis: Current status and challenges in 2024 [^112u3gjG]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

How to diagnose systemic mastocytosis?

A multidisciplinary approach, including symptom review and clinical examination, is essential for patients with suspected systemic mastocytosis (SM). Basal serum tryptase levels can be used as a screening test; levels greater than 20 ng/mL can be detected in over 70% of patients with SM (see Figure 3). In these patients, a KIT D816V mutation increases the likelihood of SM. A bone marrow biopsy is recommended for all patients with suspected SM. Although tryptase screening is straightforward, not all patients have elevated levels, and immunocytochemistry does not require a minor criterion for SM diagnosis with the major criterion.

Mean tryptase levels vary, but markedly increased levels (greater than 200 ng/mL) are more common in smoldering SM (SSM), aggressive SM (ASM), mast cell leukemia (MCL), and SM with associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN). Tryptase levels are lower in non-advanced SM (except SSM) than in advanced SM, but there is no absolute correlation between mast cell burden, tryptase levels, symptoms, or disease aggressiveness/prognosis. Patients with bone marrow mastocytosis (BMM) with low tryptase often have severe symptoms, while patients with SM with higher tryptase levels may have milder symptoms.

Elevated tryptase in the general population is usually due to a higher copy number in the TPSAB1 gene encoding α-tryptase (hereditary α-tryptasemia, HaT), which is seen in up to 7% of the population, most of whom are asymptomatic. SM and HaT are not mutually exclusive; several studies have shown a higher prevalence of HaT in SM. Patients with concurrent SM and HaT may experience more severe mast cell activation and anaphylaxis. Serum tryptase reference ranges should be adjusted for patients with SM and HaT, but a consensus on the optimal correction method is lacking.

### Paired acute-baseline serum tryptase levels in perioperative anaphylaxis: An observational study [^115ajv3V]. Allergy (2019). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis is recognized mainly through clinical criteria, which may lack specificity or relevance in the perioperative setting. The transient increase in serum tryptase has been proposed since 1989 as a diagnostic tool. Sampling for well-defined acute and baseline determinations has been recommended. We assessed the performance of four proposed algorithms with tightly controlled time frames for tryptase sampling, their robustness with inadequate sampling times, and the possible use of mature tryptase determination.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was performed on 102 adult patients from the Aix-Marseille University Hospitals who had experienced a perioperative hypersensitivity reaction clinically suggesting anaphylaxis. EAACI and ICON criteria were used to diagnose anaphylaxis. Mature and total serum tryptase levels were measured.

- **Results**: Based on EAACI guidelines, clinical diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis were found in 76 patients and lacking in 26. The most effective algorithm was the international consensus recommendation of 2012 that acute total tryptase levels should be greater than (1.2×baseline tryptase + 2) μg/L to be considered a clinically significant rise. In our cohort, this algorithm achieved 94% positive predictive value (PPV), 53% negative predictive value (NPV), 75% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and a Youden's index value of 0.61. A detectable acute mature tryptase level showed lower sensitivity, particularly in patients with acute total tryptase levels lower than 16 μg/L.

### Anaphylaxis: A 2023 practice parameter update [^1178pNKy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anaphylaxis, particularly in evaluating mastocytosis, the AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend considering an evaluation for mastocytosis, which may include a bone marrow biopsy. This is especially advised for adult patients experiencing severe insect sting anaphylaxis or idiopathic anaphylaxis, particularly when a predictive REMA score is involved.

### Tryptase in type I hypersensitivity [^115CjEAe]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

Tryptase is currently the main mast cell biomarker available in medical practice. Tryptase determination is a quantitative test performed in serum or plasma for the diagnosis, stratification, and follow-up of mast cell-related conditions. The continuous secretion of monomeric α and β protryptases forms the baseline tryptase level. Transient, activation-induced release of tryptase is known as acute tryptase. Because mast cells are tissue-resident cells, the detection of an acute tryptase release in the bloodstream is protracted, with a delay of 15 to 20 minutes after the onset of symptoms and a peak at approximately 1 hour. Constitutive release of tryptase is a marker of mast cell number and activity status, whereas transient release of mature tryptase is a marker of mast cell degranulation. Although consensual as a concept, the application of this statement in clinical practice has only been clarified since 2020. For baseline tryptase to be used as a biomarker, reference values need to be established. In contrast, defining a transient increase using acute tryptase can only be achieved as a function of the baseline status.

### Anesthetic anaphylactic shock in an emergency cesarean section: A case report [^113RmAyc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

In the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, several biochemical markers can provide additional confirmation and help guide treatment decisions. The most commonly used marker is serum tryptase, which tends to rise within 30 minutes to 3 hours after the onset of an anaphylactic reaction. Elevated tryptase levels can confirm mast cell activation, which is critical for diagnosing anaphylaxis in uncertain cases. In our patient, tryptase was measured after admission to the ICU, and the results were consistent with anaphylaxis. However, other markers such as plasma histamine and specific IgE to the suspected allergen could further support the diagnosis. Due to the acute nature of the case and the need for immediate intervention, we did not conduct these tests. Future cases may benefit from a more comprehensive biochemical evaluation if the clinical setting allows.

For cesarean sections, there is a high risk of complications related to airway management, such as aspiration pneumonia and hypoxia, and a high incidence of difficult or failed intubation. While succinylcholine is traditionally favored for rapid sequence induction due to its rapid onset and short duration, rocuronium presents an alternative for situations where succinylcholine use may be contraindicated, such as in patients with a history of allergic reactions or those at risk of malignant hyperthermia. Rocuronium, when used in combination with a reversal agent like sugammadex, can achieve rapid recovery, making it a viable choice for cesarean sections where neuromuscular blockade is needed.

### The normal range of baseline tryptase should be 1 to 15 ng/mL and covers healthy individuals with HαT [^116tP1Vx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

When should tryptase genotyping (HαT test) be recommended?

It is generally accepted that tryptase genotyping is an emerging genetic parameter that should be included as an integral component in the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected MC diseases (including SM and MC activation disorders) and related diagnostic algorithms. From a clinical point of view, knowledge about HαT is essential for many patients, both for estimating the risk of more severe anaphylaxis in certain populations and for estimating the probability that the patient is suffering from an underlying SM. Typical indications for a HαT test in clinical practice are summarized in Table V. The intention to determine the copy number status of the TPSAB1 gene in individual cases depends on:

1. The BST level
2. Clinical symptoms at presentation and in the case history (including family history)
3. The age of the patient

Because extra copy numbers of TPSAB1 are primarily detected in individuals with a serum tryptase level of at least 8 ng/mL, testing for HαT is usually recommended when the basal tryptase level is 8 ng/mL or greater. However, cases of HαT with a basal tryptase lower than 8 ng/mL (sometimes as low as 6.5 ng/mL or even lower) have been described. By contrast, in most patients with a tryptase level greater than 15 ng/mL, tryptase genotyping should be performed, unless the patient is asymptomatic and/or has a known underlying disease that explains the tryptase elevation (nephropathy, myeloid neoplasm, or MC neoplasm). For example, in an 80-year-old patient with MDS who has no MC m

### Platelet-activating factor, histamine, and tryptase levels in human anaphylaxis [^116r7MgN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an important mediator and correlates with anaphylaxis severity. However, it is not known how well PAF correlates with severity relative to histamine or tryptase.

- **Objective**: To analyze the levels of PAF, histamine, and tryptase as a function of severity in patients with acute allergic reactions.

- **Methods**: PAF, histamine, and tryptase levels were measured in blood samples collected from 23 healthy volunteers and 41 patients during acute allergic reactions. Reactions were stratified by severity from grade 1 (least severe) to grade 3 (most severe).

- **Results**: Among the three reaction grades, there were significant differences by ANOVA for PAF (P < .0001). The proportion of elevated PAF values increased across severity groups (P = 0.0009). Increased PAF levels were observed in 20%, 66.7%, and 100% of the patients with grades 1, 2, and 3 allergic reactions, respectively. While the proportion of elevated histamine values increased from 40% to 57% to 70% across grades 1, 2, and 3, respectively, these differences were not significant (P = 0.40). For tryptase, the proportion of elevated values increased monotonically from 0% in grade 1 to 4.8% in grade 2 and 60% in grade 3 (P = 0.0002).

- **Conclusions**: The PAF level was significantly elevated in proportion to the severity of acute allergic reactions. Whereas the PAF level was elevated in all patients with severe anaphylaxis, this was not true for either histamine or tryptase. Neither histamine nor tryptase showed correlations with severity scores as strong as PAF. These data are consistent with a pivotal role for PAF in the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis.

### Constitutively raised serum concentrations of mast-cell tryptase and severe anaphylactic reactions to Hymenoptera stings [^117K4eeU]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Anaphylactic IgE-mediated reactions to Hymenoptera stings vary in their severity for reasons that are not clear. We investigated patients with a history of systemic anaphylactic reactions to honeybee or wasp stings. Nine (75%) of 12 patients with raised tryptase concentrations, but only 28 (28%) of 102 patients with lower tryptase concentrations, had a history of severe sting reactions (p = 0.004). Raised baseline serum concentrations of mast-cell tryptase and mastocytosis are potential risk factors for severe allergic reactions to Hymenoptera venom.

### The normal range of baseline tryptase should be 1 to 15 ng/mL and covers healthy individuals with HαT [^116fRURW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

During an anaphylactic reaction, serum tryptase levels may increase over the individual's baseline level. The magnitude of the increase depends on several variables, including the severity of the reaction, time lapse between the blood draw and the reaction, type and number of organs involved, type of allergy, presence of comorbidities, and use and type of prophylactic therapy. When the reaction is massive and systemic, involving at least two organ systems, tryptase levels increase substantially.

In these patients, MCAS is diagnosed when all MCAS criteria are met. These criteria include:

- **Typical clinical symptoms**: Usually in the form of anaphylaxis involving at least two organ systems.
- **Serum tryptase increase**: An increase of the serum tryptase level to at least 120% + 2 ng/mL of the individual's baseline or an increase in other MC mediators.
- **Response to treatment**: A response of the symptomatology to drugs targeting mediator effects, such as receptors of these mediators like histamine receptors, mediator production, or MC activation.

All three MCAS criteria must be fulfilled to diagnose MCAS in such a patient. Baseline tryptase levels should be measured at least 48 hours after, but not before, the complete resolution of all clinical symptoms in these patients. An important aspect is that MCAS can be diagnosed in patients with clonal MC disorders, including SM (primary MCAS), but also in patients with an IgE-dependent allergy or other reactive diseases without evidence of a clonal MC disease (secondary MCAS).

### Pediatric anaphylaxis in the emergency department: Performances of dynamic tryptase measurement [^112PzNGb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

Pediatric anaphylaxis remains a challenging issue, underlined by the unmet need for specific guidelines. By describing a 10-year series of pediatric anaphylaxis in outpatients, we provide insight into pediatric anaphylaxis diagnosis in the emergency department (ED), focusing on the use and interpretation of serum tryptase.

We described a cohort of 317 pediatric episodes (315 patients) of suspected anaphylaxis in a tertiary-care hospital, with 175 children (55.2%) confirmed as anaphylactic on retrospective review. Most of these patients experienced food-induced, milder reactions, in line with previous findings. Indeed, half of our cases were attributable to seeds, nuts, and cow's milk proteins, which are well-known allergens in children. Epinephrine, the first-line treatment for suspected anaphylaxis, was prescribed in only 96 (30.3%) of the suspected cases, and 14 were inadequately administered the drug to patients with septic shock with cardiovascular involvement.

Several clinically salient features were noted in our 10-year pediatric ED cohort. Interestingly, no grade 4 pediatric anaphylaxis was observed. Drugs and insect stings were infrequent triggers, demonstrated in less than 11% of the anaphylaxis events. A trigger could not be identified in only 8% of cases, a relatively small proportion of anaphylaxis events. By collecting data, we found that 8 patients had an elevated serum baseline tryptase (sBT) above 8 μg/L, which could suggest the presence of an underlying mast cell-related disease, one not necessarily known at the time of the episode. Our results were in line with some, but not all, available studies.

### The normal range of baseline tryptase should be 1 to 15 ng/mL and covers healthy individuals with HαT [^112yYfkP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

This proposal includes a genetically determined normal upper tryptase limit of 8 ng/mL, below which the likelihood of HαT is rather low. The clinically relevant cut-off for tryptase is higher (15 ng/mL) in order to include healthy individuals with HαT and all other controls, whereas in most patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM), tryptase levels are higher (> 15 ng/mL).

- **Causes of elevated levels of BST**: A number of different conditions may be associated with a higher (or lower) BST level. As mentioned, the most prevalent underlying etiology is HαT, an autosomal dominant genetic trait defined by an increased number of TPSAB1 gene copies encoding alpha tryptase. Hereditary alpha tryptasemia is detected in about 4% to 7.5% of the population in the Western world. Most individuals with HαT present with a slightly to moderately elevated BST level (15–30 ng/mL). It has also been demonstrated that the serum tryptase levels correlate with the total copy numbers of the TPSAB1 gene in these cases. However, HαT-positive persons may also present with a lower tryptase level (≤ 8 ng/mL) or a rather high tryptase level (up to and rarely over 150 ng/mL). Those with a very high tryptase exhibit multiple TPSAB1 replications.

Clinically, most individuals with HαT do not have symptoms that had previously been associated with this trait. However, HαT has also been reported in patients who have experienced severe anaphylactic reactions, especially when a concomitant allergy and/or clonal MC disease are also present.

### Acute/baseline ratios of all 3 MC mediator metabolites can enhance diagnosis and management of mast cell activation syndrome [^111DxQ79]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). Low credibility.

The findings of his clinical laboratory reports had remained stable for many years, with serum tryptase levels of 12–14 ng/mL and normal urinary levels of the MC mediator metabolites N-MH, (2,3-dinor)-11β PGF 2α, and LTE 4.

In 2022, however, he experienced an anaphylactic reaction following jackfruit ingestion, developing throat irritation, ocular and palmar pruritus, and subsequent loss of consciousness. Epinephrine was administered en route to the emergency department, where he was given additional epinephrine and diphenhydramine.

In 2023, following stings by four yellow jackets, he developed diffuse pruritus and lightheadedness. Despite using his epinephrine injector and taking oral diphenhydramine, he lost consciousness. He regained consciousness after the arrival of emergency medical services but became diaphoretic and lost consciousness again. Second doses of intramuscular epinephrine and intramuscular diphenhydramine, 50 mg, were administered, as was 450 mL of intravenous saline. The patient's blood pressure measured 100/50 mm Hg en route to the emergency department, and his oxygen saturation was in the range of 90%. He regained consciousness by the time he arrived at the emergency department, where he was given intravenous solumedrol, 125 mg; he was observed for several hours and subsequently discharged.

His acute MC mediator levels obtained at that time are shown in Table I. The increase in the patient's serum tryptase level qualified for the 20% + 2 metric. The acute/baseline ratio is also shown, but more impressive were the considerable increases in le.

### Anaphylaxis: A 2023 practice parameter update [^1145dYLv]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anaphylaxis, specifically in the evaluation for mastocytosis, the AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a baseline serum tryptase measurement in patients with severe insect sting anaphylaxis, particularly in cases involving hypotension and/or absence of urticaria, unexplained anaphylaxis, or suspected mastocytosis. Do not rely solely on serum tryptase levels for the diagnostic assessment of the likelihood of a clonal mast cell disorder.

### Diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis in precision medicine [^113NnRSH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is the most severe and frightening of the allergic reactions, placing patients at high risk and demanding prompt recognition and immediate management by health care providers. Yet, because its symptoms imitate those of other diseases, such as asthma and urticaria, data suggest that its diagnosis is often missed, with underuse of tryptase measurement; its treatment is delayed, with little use of epinephrine; and its underlying cause or causes are poorly investigated. Deaths from anaphylaxis are difficult to investigate because of miscoding.

Surprisingly, patients treated with new and powerful chemotherapy agents and humanized mAbs present with nonclassical symptoms of anaphylaxis, and patients may present with unrecognized clonal mast cell disorders with KIT mutations, presenting as Hymenoptera-induced or idiopathic anaphylaxis. The goal of this review is to recognize the presentations of anaphylaxis with the description of its phenotypes, to provide new insight and understanding of its mechanisms and causes through its endotypes, and to address its biomarkers for broad clinical use. Ultimately, the aim is to empower allergists and health care providers with new tools that can help alleviate patients' symptoms, preventing and protecting them against anaphylaxis.

### Pediatric anaphylaxis in the emergency department: Performances of dynamic tryptase measurement [^11122iFj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Methods

- **Study population**: Patients were retrospectively included in our cohort only if at least one tryptase determination was performed during the ED visit and was available from the laboratory database. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected for pediatric patients (18 years or younger) admitted with a suspicion of anaphylaxis from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2020, at the ED of the University Hospitals of Marseille, France. For each patient, we collected data on age, sex, atopic history (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food, drug, latex allergy), and presence of MC-related diseases (clonal MC diseases, MCA syndrome). At ED admission, the definition of anaphylaxis was a perceived life-threatening systemic reaction of sudden onset at the time of clinical evaluation by the physician in charge of the child's care. Clinical manifestations were classified as mucocutaneous (rash or skin flushing, angioedema), respiratory (sneezing, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema or stridor), gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, tingling mouth, nausea and vomiting), and cardiovascular (hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia) symptoms. The severity was graded using the 4-class scale adapted from Ring and Messmer. Grade 1 reactions were defined by the presence of mucocutaneous symptoms only. Grade 2 reactions were characterized by the presence of any of the previous symptoms as well as moderate respiratory or digestive symptoms. Cases were categorized as grade 3 if any of the following symptoms were present: cyanosis, hypoxia (saturation < 92%), hypotension, dysrhythmia.

### Pediatric anaphylaxis in the emergency department: Performances of dynamic tryptase measurement [^111G2ezf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is an immediate and potentially life-threatening systemic reaction, most often due to mast cell (MC) degranulation, that represents a clinical and diagnostic challenge. International guidelines endorse the use of serum tryptase determination to confirm MC degranulation and thus to support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. However, most studies supporting this recommendation have been conducted in adults. The literature suggests that the diagnosis of pediatric anaphylaxis, which is more challenging than in adults, might be confirmed by tryptase determination.

A 2012 international consensus proposal enshrined the adequate sampling times of serum acute tryptase (sAT) and serum baseline tryptase (sBT). It established the consensus formula (CCF) that sAT values exceeding a personalized cutoff calculated as (1.2 × sBT) + 2 confirm systemic MC activation (MCA) and degranulation. These findings were further confirmed in 2019.

Data on tryptase performance for the diagnosis of pediatric anaphylaxis are scarce. A previous study including 41 children with sAT and sBT admitted to the emergency department (ED) found a 60.3% diagnostic sensitivity for the CCF, and up to 85.7% in severe reactions. In food-induced anaphylaxis in 49 children, serum tryptase determinations displayed 65.3% sensitivity.

These studies applied the CCF to small pediatric cohorts and found moderate performance. We took advantage of a 10-year database on tryptase sampling at the pediatric ED of the University Hospitals of Marseille, France, to describe a large pediatric cohort of anaphylaxis and the findings associated with it.

### What the clinician should know when ordering a mast cell tryptase test: A review article for the North American practicing clinician [^112KNRkU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Tryptase is currently the most specific mast cell biomarker available in clinical laboratories. Tryptase levels in the peripheral blood contribute to the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic evaluation of the following three clinical categories: (1) immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including the life-threatening systemic form known as anaphylaxis; (2) clonal mast cell diseases and other myeloid malignancies, also as a biomarker for the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents targeting mast cell survival; and (3) hereditary α-tryptasemia, a genetic trait found in 4% to 8% of the general population associated with an increased risk of severe immediate hypersensitivity reactions.

Rapidly evolving pathophysiology knowledge and management guidelines affect tryptase use in clinical practice, explaining the need for frequent updates. Such updates often lack context on the pathophysiology and methods regarding mast cells and tryptase, thus hampering the practicing clinician's ability to get the full picture from tryptase test results. Here, we provide the practicing physician with the 2025 state-of-the-art recommendations on tryptase use and interpretation in clinical practice, also exposing their basic, clinical, and technical foundations. Successive additions to mast cell and tryptase research are summarized and revisited in light of today's knowledge. The review sections are titled to reflect matter-of-fact questions arising in clinical practice. Currently unmet needs of tryptase use and selected lines of ongoing research expected to influence clinical practice in the near future are also presented.

### The normal range of baseline tryptase should be 1 to 15 ng/mL and covers healthy individuals with HαT [^111idg5m]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Intra-individual variation of serum tryptase levels and event-related increase during a massive systemic anaphylactic reaction:

As mentioned previously, the basal tryptase levels in individual donors (patient or healthy donor) are relatively consistent when tested repeatedly over time under stable and identical conditions (Figure 3). Even in patients with a very high basal tryptase level, the intra-individual range of basal tryptase often remains rather stable over time (Figure 3).

However, there are a number of reasons for variations in basal tryptase levels, such as a decrease in kidney function, concomitant medications such as glucocorticoids, or a myeloid neoplasm. In such myeloid neoplasms (MDS, MPN, chronic myeloid leukemia), basal tryptase levels may be initially elevated and may rise further when the numbers of tryptase-positive, neoplastic cells (MCs, basophils, or lineage-committed blasts) increase due to progression. In patients receiving corticosteroids (systemic or topical), BST levels may decrease. For example, Schlag et al. reported that in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, topical therapy with fluticasone (500 μg twice daily) resulted in a decrease of tryptase levels from 4.7 ng/mL to 3.8 ng/mL.

In general, such drug effects may be an issue in patients with anaphylaxis in which event-related tryptase levels and post-event (basal) tryptase levels should be compared to define whether MCAS criteria are met. When the patient is still under corticosteroid therapy (but did not receive such drugs before and at the time of anaphylaxis).

### Personalized diagnostic approach and indirect quantification of extravasation in human anaphylaxis [^1167m2c3]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis is the most acute and life‐threatening manifestation of allergic disorders. Currently, there is a need to improve its medical management and increase the understanding of its molecular mechanisms. This study aimed to quantify the extravasation underlying human anaphylactic reactions and propose new theragnostic approaches.

- **Methods**: Molecular determinations were performed in paired serum samples obtained during the acute phase and at baseline from patients presenting with hypersensitivity reactions. These were classified according to their severity as Grades 1, 2, and 3, the latter two being considered anaphylaxis. Tryptase levels were measured by ImmunoCAP, and serum protein concentration was quantified by Bradford assay. Human serum albumin (HSA) and hemoglobin beta subunit (HBB) levels were determined by Western blot and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively.

- **Results**: A total of 150 patients were included in the study. Of them, 112 had experienced anaphylaxis (83 and 29 with Grade 2 and 3 reactions, respectively). Tryptase diagnostic efficiency substantially improved when considering patients' baseline values (33%–54%) instead of the acute value threshold (21%). Serum protein concentration and HSA significantly decreased in anaphylaxis (p < 0.0001). HSA levels dropped with the severity of the reaction (6% and 15% for Grade 2 and 3 reactions, respectively). Furthermore, HBB levels increased during the acute phase of all hypersensitivity reactions (p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: For the first time, the extravasation underlying human anaphylaxis was documented in this study.

### Extending the role of tryptase in perioperative anaphylaxis: Predicting positive results in basophil activation tests [^114JxhbS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2024). High credibility.

The study investigates the utility of tryptase measurements in predicting positive basophil activation tests during perioperative anaphylaxis. Tryptase, a mast cell enzyme, may serve as an essential biomarker for assessing anaphylactic responses.

- **Study findings**: Elevated tryptase levels correlate strongly with positive basophil activation test results, suggesting a potential role in diagnosing perioperative anaphylaxis accurately.

This research emphasizes the importance of measuring tryptase levels in clinical settings, providing a valuable tool for anesthesiologists and allergy specialists in managing patient safety and treatment.

### Expression of alpha-tryptase and beta-tryptase by human basophils [^112vM9Vk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Alpha and beta-tryptase levels in serum are clinical tools for the evaluation of systemic anaphylaxis and systemic mastocytosis. Basophils and mast cells are known to produce these proteins.

- **Objective**: The study examines the effect of the alpha, beta-tryptase genotype on basophil tryptase levels and the type of tryptase stored in these cells.

- **Methods**: Tryptase extracted from purified peripheral blood basophils from 20 subjects was examined using ELISAs measuring mature and total tryptase and an enzymatic assay with tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide. Tryptase genotypes (4:0, 3:1, and 2:2 beta/alpha ratios) were assessed using a hot-stop PCR technique with alpha, beta-tryptase-specific primers. Total alpha, beta-tryptase mRNA was measured by means of competitive RT-PCR, and ratios of alpha to beta-tryptase mRNA were measured by means of hot-stop RT-PCR.

- **Results**: Tryptase in all but one of the basophil preparations was mature and enzymatically active. Tryptase quantities in basophils were less than 1% of those in tissue mast cells. Tryptase genotypes (beta/alpha) among the 20 donors were 4:0 in 7, 3:1 in 7, and 2:2 in 6. Tryptase protein and mRNA levels per basophil were not affected by the tryptase genotype.

- **Conclusion**: Basophils from healthy subjects contain modest amounts of mature and enzymatically active tryptase unaffected by the tryptase genotype.

### Raised tryptase without anaphylaxis or mastocytosis: Heterophilic antibody interference in the serum tryptase assay [^117SZefD]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Mast cell tryptase (MCT) is a key diagnostic test for mastocytosis and anaphylaxis. High serum tryptase levels are also risk factors for adverse reactions in venom immunotherapy; however, some patients exhibit elevated levels without either diagnosis. These false-positive results may arise from assay interference by heterophilic antibodies, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).

We investigated heterophilic antibody interference, specifically by rheumatoid factor activity and HAMA, as a cause of raised MCT results in the Phadia tryptase assay. Serum samples from 83 patients were assayed for MCT and rheumatoid factor before and after using heterophilic antibody blocking tubes (HBT). Samples showing more than 17% reduction in MCT alongside detectable RF were subsequently tested for HAMA.

Fourteen (17%) of the 83 samples with positive RF exhibited a reduction greater than 17% in mast cell tryptase after HBT blocking. Post-HBT, eight out of these 14 samples (57%) reverted to normal range values, with reductions of up to 98%. RF levels were also significantly decreased, up to 75%. Only one of the 83 tested samples was apparently affected by HAMA in the absence of detectable IgM RF.

In conclusion, any suspicious MCT result should be evaluated for heterophilic antibodies to assess possible interference. False-positive MCT levels can be attributed to rheumatoid factor. We propose a strategy for identifying assay interference and emphasize the necessity of including this consideration in the guidance for interpreting MCT results.

### Pediatric anaphylaxis in the emergency department: Performances of dynamic tryptase measurement [^111TPEet]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

To evaluate the performance of serum tryptase, we only considered episodes with an adequate sampling time and compared the patients with anaphylaxis to the control group. The CCF displayed 62.2% sensitivity and 80% specificity, with a Youden index of 0.42. Receiver operator curve analysis for rT and dT showed an area under the curve of 0.84 and 0.80, respectively, with 1.74 and 4.12 as optimal thresholds. At the optimal threshold, the sensitivity was 66.7% and 51.1% for rT and dT, with 90% specificity for both. rT was the best option to confirm anaphylaxis.

### Beta tryptase levels are not elevated in patients undergoing liver transplantation [^1164SWxr]. Liver Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Reperfusion syndrome during liver transplantation and anaphylaxis are clinical syndromes that share similarities in physiological responses. The liver and intestine contain a variety of immunologically active cells, including mast cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility that mast-cell degranulation occurs routinely during transplantation and thereby contributes to hemodynamic instability and coagulopathy. Beta tryptase, an enzyme released by mast cells during degranulation, is a reliable marker for mast-cell-mediated events. Six patients undergoing liver transplantation had beta tryptase levels assayed in blood immediately before and after reperfusion of the liver. No patient showed an increase in beta tryptase levels at 15 or 60 minutes after reperfusion. In conclusion, it is unlikely that clinically significant mast-cell degranulation occurs routinely in patients undergoing liver transplantation.

### Personalized diagnostic approach and indirect quantification of extravasation in human anaphylaxis [^1112yjEg]. Allergy (2023). Low credibility.

Due to the previous observation, it was considered relevant to determine the levels of HSA, as it alone accounts for more than 50% of the total serum protein. HSA levels significantly dropped during the acute phase of anaphylaxis and correlated with the protein concentration decrease previously observed (Figure 3A, B). However, they did not correlate with the increase of tryptase ratio (R: −0.09407; p = .3283).

After evaluating HSA concentrations according to the severity of the reaction, no changes from baseline to the acute phase were identified for Grade 1 events, but a statistically significant decrease was observed for Grade 2 and Grade 3 reactions (Figure 3C). Similarly, as seen with serum protein determinations, the acute/basal ratio of HSA levels of patients who suffered anaphylaxis was 8% lower compared with those who experienced a Grade 1 reaction (Figure 3D). Furthermore, this drop in HSA ratios during the acute phase was commensurate with the severity of the reaction, being unaffected in Grade 1 reactions, but reduced 6% and 15% in Grade 2 and Grade 3 cases, respectively (Figure 3E).

### Diagnostic utility of biomarkers in anaphylaxis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117RmKRi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction commonly triggered by food, venom, or drugs. Clinical criteria are central to diagnosing anaphylaxis; however, laboratory biomarkers could provide valuable confirmation when clinical diagnosis is challenging.

- **Objective**: We aimed to evaluate key biomarkers including tryptase, histamine, platelet-activating factor (PAF), PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), and urinary prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) for their diagnostic utility in anaphylaxis.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA-DTA (Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy studies) guidelines. Studies published between 2004 and 2024 from Embase and MEDLINE were included if they evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of tryptase, histamine, PAF, PAF-AH, or urinary PGD2 in confirmed anaphylaxis cases. Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated using the diagmeta package in R.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight studies with 18,749 patients were included, of whom 3,329 had anaphylaxis. Tryptase was the most frequently studied biomarker (24 studies), with a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.49 and 0.82, respectively. Histamine had a pooled sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.69. Limited data were available for PAF, PAF-AH, and urinary PGD2.

- **Conclusions**: Studies suggest that tryptase remains the most widely used and accessible biomarker for diagnosing anaphylaxis mainly using the "Rule of Twos" diagnosis strategy. Histamine and urinary PGD2 show potential, though their application is not fully established.

Mastocytosis encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the accumulation of clonal mast cells (MCs) in the skin and/or internal organs. Patients typically present with a broad variety of mediator-related clinical symptoms, including severe anaphylaxis. However, not all patients with mastocytosis experience anaphylactic reactions.

- **Objective**: We sought to identify disease-specific biomarkers in plasma that could be used to predict patients with mastocytosis and an increased risk of anaphylaxis.

- **Methods**: Nineteen patients (≥ 18 years) and 2 control groups (11 subjects with allergic asthma and 13 healthy volunteers without a history of atopy) were recruited. In total, 248 plasma proteins were analyzed by Proximity Extension Assay using Olink Proseek Multiplex panels.

- **Results**: We identified four novel proteins, in addition to tryptase, E-selectin, adrenomedullin, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1, and CUB domain-containing protein 1/CD138, to be significantly increased in patients with mastocytosis compared with both patients with asthma and healthy controls. Furthermore, we investigated whether we could discriminate between patients with mastocytosis with or without anaphylaxis. In addition to tryptase, we identified three novel proteins, namely allergin-1, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, and galectin-3, with significantly different levels in patients with mastocytosis with anaphylaxis compared with those without anaphylaxis.

- **Conclusions**: Newly identified proteomic biomarkers may be used to predict patients with mastocytosis who have an increased risk of anaphylaxis.

### Diagnostic value of tryptase in food allergic reactions: A prospective study of 160 adult peanut challenges [^115jH974]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Serum tryptase is useful in diagnosing drug and venom anaphylaxis; however, its utility in food anaphylaxis is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine whether tryptase rises in food allergic reactions, identify optimal sampling time points, and establish a diagnostic cutoff for confirming a clinical reaction. Characterized peanut allergic patients were recruited to undergo up to four peanut challenges and one placebo challenge each. Tryptase levels were measured serially on challenge days both before (baseline) and during the challenge. The peak percentage tryptase rise (peak/baseline) was related to reaction severity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to establish an optimal diagnostic cutoff.

- **Results**: Tryptase was analyzed in 160 reactive (9% anaphylaxis) and 45 nonreactive (placebo) challenges in 50 adults aged 18 to 39 years. Tryptase rose above the normal range (11.4 ng/mL) in 4 out of 160 reactions. Compared with baseline levels, a rise was observed in 100 out of 160 (62.5%) reactions and 0 of 45 placebo challenges. The median rise (95% confidence interval [CI]) for all reactions was 25% (13.3% to 33.3%) and 70.8% (33.3% to 300%) during anaphylaxis. Peak levels occurred at 2 hours and correlated with severity (P < .05). Moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms, generalized erythema, dizziness, and hypotension were correlated with a higher peak/baseline tryptase (P < .05). ROC curve analysis demonstrated the optimal cutoff to identify a reaction as a 30% rise (sensitivity 0.53; specificity 0.85), with an area under the curve of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.6).

### Hereditary α tryptasemia is a valid genetic biomarker for severe mediator-related symptoms in mastocytosis [^112u2RpJ]. Blood (2021). Low credibility.

Mastocytosis is a hematopoietic neoplasm characterized by the expansion of KIT D816V-mutated clonal mast cells in various organs and severe or even life-threatening anaphylactic reactions. Recently, hereditary α-tryptasemia (HαT) has been described as a common genetic trait with increased copy numbers of the α-tryptase encoding gene, TPSAB1. It is associated with an increased basal serum tryptase level and a risk of mast cell activation. The purpose of our study was to elucidate the clinical relevance of HαT in patients with mastocytosis. TPSAB1 germline copy number variants were assessed by digital polymerase chain reaction in 180 mastocytosis patients, 180 sex-matched control subjects, 720 patients with other myeloid neoplasms, and 61 additional mastocytosis patients from an independent validation cohort. α-Tryptase encoding TPSAB1 copy number gains, compatible with HαT, were identified in 17.2% of mastocytosis patients and 4.4% of the control population (P < .001). Patients with HαT exhibited higher tryptase levels than patients without HαT (median tryptase in HαT+ cases: 49.6 ng/mL vs. HαT- cases: 34.5 ng/mL, P = 0.004), independent of the mast cell burden. Hymenoptera venom hypersensitivity reactions and severe cardiovascular mediator-related symptoms or anaphylaxis were far more frequently observed in mastocytosis patients with HαT than in those without HαT. Results were confirmed in an independent validation cohort. The high prevalence of HαT in mastocytosis hints at a potential pathogenic role of germline α-tryptase encoding TPSAB1 copy number gains in disease evolution.

### Pediatric anaphylaxis in the emergency department: Performances of dynamic tryptase measurement [^112Vn3TF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

Dynamic measurement of serum acute (sAT) and baseline (sBT) tryptase confirms mast cell degranulation during systemic hypersensitivity reactions, provided timing and interpretation are appropriate. The consensus formula requires sAT greater than a personalized cutoff value: sAT > (1.2 × sBT) + 2. Only a few studies have investigated its diagnostic performance in children.

- **Objective**: We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the consensus formula and alternative algorithms for interpreting tryptase levels in pediatric patients with suspected anaphylaxis.

- **Methods**: Medical records of suspected anaphylaxis referred to the pediatric emergency department of the University Hospitals of Marseille (France) from 2011 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and laboratory data, including total tryptase and allergy evaluations, were collected. Anaphylaxis was defined as a sudden-onset, perceived life-threatening systemic reaction at the time of physician assessment. Inclusion criteria were suspected anaphylaxis and at least one tryptase determination. The diagnostic performance of the consensus formula was compared to five alternative tryptase interpretation algorithms.

- **Results**: Among 315 patients (median age, 7.8 years; 317 emergency department visits), 175 (55%) were categorized as cases. Food-induced anaphylaxis was diagnosed in 82%, and 92 (52.6%) had two or more tryptase determinations. The highest diagnostic performance was achieved by the sAT/sBT ratio. A cutoff for the sAT/sBT ratio of > 1.74 yielded 66.7% sensitivity, 90.0% specificity, and 96.8% positive predictive value.

### Heritable risk for severe anaphylaxis associated with increased α-tryptase-encoding germline copy number at TPSAB1 [^116NPsiq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

An elevated basal serum tryptase level is associated with severe systemic anaphylaxis, most notably caused by Hymenoptera envenomation. Although clonal mast cell disease is the culprit in some individuals, it does not fully explain this clinical association.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to determine the prevalence and associated impact of tryptase genotypes on anaphylaxis in humans.

- **Methods**: Cohorts with systemic mastocytosis (SM) and venom as well as idiopathic anaphylaxis from referral centers in Italy, Slovenia, and the United States, underwent tryptase genotyping by droplet digital PCR. Associated anaphylaxis severity (Mueller scale) was subsequently examined. Healthy volunteers and controls with nonatopic disease were recruited, and tryptase was genotyped by droplet digital PCR and in silico analysis of genome sequence, respectively. The effects of pooled and recombinant human tryptases, protease activated receptor 2 agonist and antagonist peptides, and a tryptase-neutralizing mAb on human umbilical vein endothelial cell permeability were assayed using a Transwell system.

- **Results**: Hereditary α-tryptasemia (HαT) - a genetic trait caused by increased α-tryptase-encoding Tryptase-α/β1 (TPSAB1) copy number resulting in elevated basal serum tryptase (BST) level - was common in healthy individuals (5.6% [n = 7 of 125]) and controls with nonatopic disease (5.3% [n = 21 of 398]). HαT was associated with grade IV venom anaphylaxis (relative risk = 2.0; P < .05) and more prevalent in both idiopathic anaphylaxis (n = 8 of 47; [17%; p = 0.006]) and SM (n = 10 of 82 [12.2%; p = 0.03]).

### Extending the role of tryptase in perioperative anaphylaxis: Predicting positive results in basophil activation tests [^114m89mx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2024). Low credibility.

A total of 90 patients with an exact culprit identified and meeting all inclusion criteria were included for analysis. Seventy (77.8%) showed significant tryptase elevation. In 41.1% (37 of 90) of patients, basophil activation test (BAT) results were positive for the identified culprit. BAT-positive patients presented with significantly higher absolute levels (15.9 μg/L vs 9.1 μg/L; p = 0.018), absolute elevation (12.8 μg/L vs 7.1 μg/L; p = 0.012), and fold elevation (5.6- vs. 4.1-fold; p = 0.014) of acute tryptase than BAT-negative patients.

Among patients with a positive BAT result, 94.6% (35 of 37) demonstrated elevated acute tryptase, significantly more than the BAT-negative group (66.0%; P < .001). Aside from acute tryptase results, no significant differences were noted between BAT-positive and BAT-negative patients. In regression analysis, tryptase elevation was the sole significant factor correlated to BAT positivity (odds ratio, 10.14; 95% CI, 2.15–47.85; p = 0.003).

In receiver-operating characteristic analysis, both acute tryptase level (area under the curve, 0.647; 95% CI, 0.529–0.765) and significant tryptase elevation (area under the curve, 0.646; 95% CI, 0.528–0.764) demonstrated satisfactory performance for BAT positivity prediction. An acute tryptase level of greater than or equal to 9.0 μg/L was identified as the optimal cutoff, which has a sensitivity of 89.2%, a specificity of 50.0%, and a negative predictive value of 86.7%.

### Anaphylaxis and clinical utility of real-world measurement of acute serum tryptase in UK emergency departments [^112q1Rbk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

British guidelines recommend that serial acute serum tryptase measurements be checked in all adults and a subset of children presenting with anaphylaxis. This study is the first to report on the clinical utility of acute serum tryptase in a "real-world" emergency department (ED) setting following the publication of the World Allergy Organization (WAO) criteria for anaphylaxis.

- **Objectives**: To (a) assess sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of acute serum tryptase in anaphylaxis; (b) determine factors associated with higher acute serum tryptase levels; and (c) audit compliance of acute serum tryptase measurement in the ED.

- **Methods**: The methods used were retrospective electronic search for ED admissions to three acute care hospitals in Birmingham, UK, with anaphylaxis in 2012 using wide search terms, followed by scrutiny of electronic clinical records and application of the WAO diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis. Patients with an acute serum tryptase measurement were included in the analysis.

- **Results**: Acute serum tryptase level was measured in 141 of 426 (33.1%) cases. The mean time from the onset of symptoms to the measurement of acute serum tryptase level was 4 hours 42 minutes (SD ± 05:03 hours), and no patients had serial measurements conforming to British guidelines. An acute serum tryptase level of more than 12.4 ng/mL (75th centile) was associated with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 28%, 88%, 0.93, and 0.17, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that male sex (odds ratio, 2.66; p = 0.003) and hypotension were associated factors.

### Basal serum tryptase outperforms hereditary alpha tryptasemia as a biomarker of food allergy severity [^111WbH86]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

We found a high prevalence of hereditary alpha tryptasemia (HαT) among anaphylaxis patients with a basal serum tryptase (BST) level ≥ 8 μg/L, particularly in food anaphylaxis (FAn), where it was associated with severity. Although HαT was only tested in patients with BST ≥ 8 μg/L, the likelihood of finding HαT in patients with BST < 8 seems really low, as described elsewhere. Lyons et al. reported a higher prevalence of HαT in severe hymenoptera venom (HVe) anaphylaxis (9.2% grade IV vs. 4.3% grade I-III) and a correlation between BST and severity. However, Gonzalez-de-Olano et al. reported similar anaphylaxis severity regardless of HαT status in mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) patients.

In our series, HαT+ patients were mostly allergic to food, followed by drugs, although previous studies reported drugs or HVe as main culprits. Notably, while the proportion of patients referred for drug and food allergies to our department is similar, HαT+ was predominantly observed in food anaphylaxis (FAn). In this line, Sordi et al. observed that although HVe was the main cause of anaphylaxis in their population, food was most common in HαT+ individuals. Similarly, Gonzalez-de-Olano et al. reported that food as a trigger was significantly more frequent in HαT+ (11% vs. 4% HαT-) MCAS patients. Finally, Lang et al. described that having α-tryptase gene copies, compared to only β-tryptase isoforms, was linked to having a history of FAn, aligning with our findings.

### Elevated basal serum tryptase and Hymenoptera venom allergy: Relation to severity of sting reactions and to safety and efficacy of venom immunotherapy [^113jMnWn]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Mastocytosis and/or elevated basal serum tryptase may be associated with severe anaphylaxis. The objective of this study was to analyze Hymenoptera venom-allergic patients with regard to basal tryptase in relation to the severity of sting reactions and the safety and efficacy of venom immunotherapy.

- **Methods**: Basal serum tryptase was measured in 259 Hymenoptera venom-allergic patients (158 honey bee, 101 Vespula). In 161 of these patients (104 honey bee, 57 Vespula), a sting challenge was performed during venom immunotherapy.

- **Results**: Nineteen of the 259 patients had an elevated basal serum tryptase. Evidence of cutaneous mastocytosis, as documented by skin biopsy, was present in 3 out of 16 patients (18.8%). There was a clear correlation of basal serum tryptase to the grade of the initial allergic reaction (P < 0.0005). Forty-one of the 161 sting-challenged patients reacted to the challenge, 34 to a bee sting and 7 to a Vespula sting. Of these, 10 had an elevated basal serum tryptase: 1 (2.9%) of the reacting and 2 (2.9%) of the non-reacting bee venom (BV) allergic individuals, compared to 3 (42.9%) of the reacting and 4 (8%) of the non-reacting Vespula venom-allergic patients. There was a significant association between a reaction to the sting challenge and an elevated basal serum tryptase in Vespula (chi² = 6.926, P < 0.01), but not in BV-allergic patients. Systemic allergic side-effects to venom immunotherapy were observed in 13.9% of patients with normal basal serum tryptase and in 10% of those with elevated basal serum tryptase.

- **Conclusions**: An elevated basal serum tryptase as well as mastocytosis are positively correlated with severe anaphylaxis in Vespula venom-allergic patients.

### Redefining tryptase norms in the pediatric population reveals sex-based differences: Clinical implications [^116DHE96]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

The measurement of serum basal tryptase (sBT) levels is a widely used analysis for the diagnosis of mast cell (MC) activation disorders. Knowledge of an individual's sBT level can diagnose hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (HαT), a genetic trait caused by a duplication/amplification of the alpha-1 allele of the TPSAB1 gene, which induces an elevation of sBT levels. The prevalence of HαT is around 5% in the general population but is higher among people with clonal MC disorders. HαT is associated with an elevated risk of hymenoptera venom and grade IV idiopathic anaphylaxis, particularly in the context of mastocytosis. Several studies have highlighted the relationship between sBT levels and the risk and severity of anaphylaxis in children with food allergy. The sBT threshold for HαT is set at 8.0 ng/mL according to the 95th percentile, primarily based on adult populations, with limited data on children. Both the influence of age on sBT levels and the threshold for an elevated sBT in pediatric patients are subject to debate. The study aimed to confirm the 8.0 ng/mL sBT threshold in the general pediatric population.

### Personalized diagnostic approach and indirect quantification of extravasation in human anaphylaxis [^116oA3Ca]. Allergy (2023). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first time that serum protein concentration and HSA levels have been evaluated in anaphylaxis. Results showed a decrease in both factors during the acute phase compared to baseline and according to the severity of the reaction. Serum protein concentration has been proposed as a diagnostic indicator for other acute conditions such as pancreatitis and ascites. Similarly, HSA levels have been associated with pathological processes like operative stress and liver surgery. Hence, using both measurements as complementary biomarkers to serum tryptase could improve and increase the accuracy of anaphylaxis diagnosis. However, additional studies with different patient cohorts and larger sample sizes are needed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of these molecular markers, both individually and in combination with serum tryptase.

In contrast, increased HBB levels were observed during the acute phase in patients with anaphylaxis. Systemic inflammation has been shown to trigger massive release of haemoglobin from red blood cells. Therefore, haemolysis could be an indicator of inflammatory processes. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that free haemoglobin can increase vascular permeability in the pulmonary microvasculature. In addition, HBB has been proposed as a diagnostic marker for sepsis. However, haemolysis can also occur during the obtaining, processing, and storage of samples, leading to measurement alterations and detracting from the value of haemoglobin as a diagnostic marker.

### Anaphylaxis in outpatients: A 5-year retrospective study on incidence and clinical characteristics at a university hospital in Wuhan, China [^11657ok8]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

This study's limitations include potential recall bias and variability in medical record documentation. Moreover, serum tryptase detection kits have not yet received marketing approval in China. This limitation precludes the possibility of using serum tryptase to further verify the diagnosis of anaphylaxis in patients initially identified by our physicians. Additionally, unmeasured confounding factors cannot be eliminated, such as the population consisting of patients actively seeking medical treatment. It is noteworthy that, while the DPAP system is restricted to internal hospital use and is not transferable, the extensive data set comprising 75 million medical records from over 16 million patients mitigates some biases.

### Extending the role of tryptase in perioperative anaphylaxis: Predicting positive results in basophil activation tests [^115eXtAf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to this study. The performance of basophil activation tests (BAT) depends on multiple factors, including individual laboratory variations, basophil counts, patient comorbidities, and specific culprits, which were not studied. It should be noted that BAT has varying sensitivity and specificity for different causes of perioperative anaphylaxis (PA), with fairly satisfactory performance against, for instance, neuromuscular-blocking agents and chlorhexidine, but not β-lactam antibiotics. We did not specifically look into potential differences in CD63 and CD203c expression. The exact timing of tryptase sampling (within the 4-hour window) was not available either. Furthermore, not all identified culprits were confirmed by drug provocation tests. Despite the fact that all included patients had an exact culprit identified by multiple diagnostic modalities, which were concordant with a clinical diagnosis made by an allergist, there remains a possibility of false-positive results.

Prospective and multicenter studies will be required to overcome these limitations and evaluate this novel utility of tryptase results. Regardless, we believe that our findings are of empirical value and could help inform clinicians planning their investigations in real-life practice.

In conclusion, we observed that tryptase elevation is a very sensitive predictor of BAT positivity among patients with identified culprits of PA. Given the additional utility of tryptase levels in predicting BAT positivity, we strongly reinforce the importance of measuring acute tryptase in all instances of suspected PA.

### The normal range of baseline tryptase should be 1 to 15 ng/mL and covers healthy individuals with HαT [^115WGiQE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Based on the data reviewed previously and the discussion in our consensus group, we propose that the range for normal basal tryptase to be used in daily clinical practice (encompassing also asymptomatic cases with HαT) should be 1 to 15 ng/mL. This range covers all previously proposed ranges, all groups of healthy controls including asymptomatic HαT-positive individuals, and also the 95% confidence interval calculated on the basis of 2 SDs in published cohorts. For daily practice, this normal range would help to avoid unnecessary investigations by caregivers and unnecessary anxiety in patients.

Conversely, a normal tryptase level (< 15 and even < 11.4 ng/mL) does not exclude SM, a myeloid neoplasm, or HαT with certainty. Therefore, a normal tryptase level cannot be applied as a major exclusion criterion for such conditions. Another important point is that the recommended threshold for delineating between normal and elevated is not identical to the threshold used to recommend an HαT test for genetic classification. Rather, our faculty recommends that tryptase genotyping should be considered when HαT is suspected (e.g. patients with unexplained and/or severe anaphylaxis, especially in patients with SM or a known allergy) and the basal tryptase level is at least 8 ng/mL. Sometimes, the test may even be recommended in a symptomatic patient with a tryptase level below 8 ng/mL.

### Mast cell activation test in the diagnosis of allergic disease and anaphylaxis [^11497QVd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Whether basophils are involved as effector cells in the pathophysiology of allergic reactions is unclear. Traditionally, mast cells (MCs) have been considered the main effector cells in patients with allergic reactions. After allergen exposure, these cells become activated through IgE cross-linking of FcεRI expressed on the cell surface, resulting in the release and de novo synthesis of inflammatory mediators. Despite sharing allergen-mediated activation mechanisms, MCs are transcriptionally distinct and independent from circulating granulocytes. Therefore, we sought to develop an alternative approach to the diagnosis of allergic disease and anaphylaxis using primary human blood-derived mast cells (hMCs) generated from CD117+ peripheral blood precursors. These cells are passively sensitized with patients' sera and then incubated in vitro with allergen; this is known as the mast cell activation test (MAT). In this report, we describe the development of the MAT, its potential application in patients with peanut and insect venom allergy, and its initial validation as a diagnostic tool for peanut allergy compared with existing diagnostic tests.

### Extending the role of tryptase in perioperative anaphylaxis: Predicting positive results in basophil activation tests [^1176FzFS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2024). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the associations between tryptase elevation and the performance of basophil activation tests (BATs) among patients with perioperative anaphylaxis (PA). In our large cohort of patients with PA undergoing BATs, almost all (94.6%) positive results came from patients with significantly elevated tryptase during the index reaction. This phenomenon is reminiscent of previous reports describing the association between BAT positivity and elevated tryptase among patients experiencing reactions during desensitization with platinum compounds. Because tryptase exists almost exclusively within both mast cells (MCs) and basophils, significant elevation during PA may reflect the individual tendency for MC/basophil degranulation in context with the specific drug culprit. Therefore, such individuals would have an increased likelihood of a positive BAT result with the same drug in comparison to those without significantly elevated tryptase levels. Furthermore, recent reports suggest a close interplay between MCs and basophils, and it is possible that a positive BAT result correlates with this interaction.

### Systemic reactions and anaphylaxis with an acute serum tryptase ≥ 14 μg/L: Retrospective characterisation of aetiology, severity and adherence to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for serial tryptase measurements and specialist referral [^116ZE1Sn]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

To characterize patients with systemic reactions and anaphylaxis with an acute serum tryptase of ≥ 14 μg/L against recently published World Allergy Organization (WAO) diagnostic criteria, a clinical audit was also performed to assess adherence to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline recommendations regarding serial tryptase measurements and specialist referral.

- **Methods**: A systematic retrospective survey (2006–2010) was carried out (n = 171; males = 86; mean age ± SD 48 ± 20 years) and data were extracted from emergency department and specialist allergy clinic records.

- **Results**: 34 patients (20%) had a grade 1 reaction, 61 (36%) grade 2, 46 (27%) grade 3, and 6 patients (4%) grade 4. 24 patients (13%) could not be graded due to the lack of adequate clinical details, and 6% developed a biphasic response. Serial tryptase measurements were not available in 117 (69%) of the cohort. 97 (57%) patients were referred for specialist assessment, and 72 (74%) attended. Of the cases, 50% were diagnosed with idiopathic systemic reactions/anaphylaxis, while 28%, 14%, and 8% were triggered by drugs, foods, and other allergies including disorders of mast cell overload, respectively. A weak positive correlation was detected between acute serum tryptase and severity.

- **Conclusions**: The correlation between acute serum tryptase and the severity of anaphylaxis/systemic reactions is weak. A significant proportion of patients with raised acute serum tryptase had mild reactions that did not meet WAO criteria for anaphylaxis, which may reduce the specificity of the test.

### Elevated serum concentrations of beta-tryptase, but not alpha-tryptase, in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). An investigation of anaphylactic mechanisms [^116pUmdq]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), or cot death, remains the most common category of post-perinatal death in the UK. By definition, the cause of death is unknown, but a long-standing theory is that some of these deaths could be the result of anaphylaxis.

- **Objective**: To investigate the potential contribution of anaphylactic mechanisms to deaths in infancy by determining relative levels of alpha- and beta-tryptases and both total and allergen-specific IgE in sera from groups of infants whose deaths were attributed to SIDS or to other causes.

- **Methods**: Serum samples were collected at the time of post-mortem examination from infants whose death was classed as SIDS (n = 40) and from a comparison group in which the cause of death had been established (n = 32). Serum tryptase concentrations were measured with a radioimmunoassay using monoclonal antibody G5, which primarily detects beta-tryptase, or an ELISA with antibody AA5, which has equal sensitivity for alpha- and beta-tryptases. Levels of total IgE and IgE specific for casein, beta-lactoglobulin, house dust mite, and moulds were determined.

- **Results**: Analysis of the results of the two assays for tryptase indicated that levels of the beta-like tryptase (the form secreted on anaphylactic degranulation) were significantly higher in serum from infants with SIDS compared with those whose death was explained. There was no evidence for an increase in serum levels of alpha-tryptase (the variant secreted constitutively from mast cells). Total levels of serum IgE did not differ between the two groups, reflecting the low circul.

### Use and interpretation of acute and baseline tryptase in perioperative hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis [^111VSBdQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Paired acute and baseline serum or plasma tryptase sampling and determination have recently been included as a mechanistic approach in the diagnostic and management guidelines of perioperative immediate hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. The timing of this paired sampling is clearly defined in international consensus statements, with the optimal window for acute tryptase sampling between 30 minutes and 2 hours after the initiation of symptoms, whereas baseline tryptase should be measured in a sample collected before the event (preop) or at least 24 hours after all signs and symptoms have resolved. A transient elevation of the acute tryptase level greater than 2 + (1.2 × baseline tryptase level) supports the involvement and activation of mast cells.

Here, we provide the clinical, pathophysiological, and technical rationale for the procedure and interpretation of paired acute and baseline tryptase. Clinical examples, up-to-date knowledge of hereditary α-tryptasemia as a frequent cause of baseline tryptase of 7 μg/L and higher, mastocytosis, other clonal myeloid disorders, cardiovascular or renal failure, and technical improvements resulting in continued lowering of the 95th percentile value are discussed.

- **Clues for improved management of perioperative immediate hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis include**:
	1. Sustained dissemination and implementation of updated guidelines.
	2. Preoperative sample storage for deferred analysis.
	3. Referral for thorough allergy investigation, screening for mast cell-related disorders, and recommendations for future anesthetic procedures.
