## Question

What antidepressant for pt with MDD with alcohol abuse

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antidepressant to choose for a patient with major depressive disorder and co-occurring alcohol use disorder, and how to structure the treatment plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic clarification and whether the depression is independent or substance-induced. Then, I should verify the strength and direction of evidence for antidepressants in this population. Next, I will review guideline positions and reconcile any conflicting recommendations. After that, I need to weigh safety, interactions, and patient-specific factors. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and contingency plans, and I will double-check for any caveats I might be missing along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame, because I need to ensure we are not treating a substance-induced mood disorder that may remit with abstinence. Independent major depressive disorder is more likely to respond to antidepressants, whereas substance-induced depression has a weaker signal for medication benefit, so I should confirm persistence of depressive symptoms during a period of abstinence or stabilization when feasible, and document prior episodes and family history to support an independent diagnosis [^ca900e8b] [^16d6e63c].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for antidepressants in MDD with alcohol use disorder. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and consistency of benefit. A high-quality meta-analysis found a modest but significant antidepressant benefit with a pooled effect size around 0.38 on depression scales, with larger effects in studies with lower placebo response, and noted that benefits on alcohol outcomes were inconsistent and generally modest, reinforcing that antidepressants are not stand-alone treatments for alcohol use disorder [^c1fd67e6]. A Cochrane review echoed low-quality evidence for antidepressants improving depression and some alcohol use outcomes, with effects attenuating when high-bias studies were excluded, which tempers enthusiasm and underscores the need for integrated care [^ede1cff5]. I should also note that SSRIs as a class did not show a significant benefit in a meta-analysis focused on comorbid alcohol use disorders, whereas tricyclics and nefazodone showed signals of benefit, though nefazodone is rarely used today due to hepatic toxicity concerns [^e6df17d9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about SSRIs being contraindicated. I initially thought SSRIs might worsen alcohol use based on some reports, but I should double-check the strength of that signal. Observational and some trial data suggest that certain SSRIs, particularly citalopram, may increase alcohol consumption in a subset of patients with alcohol use disorder, especially when the treatment goal is abstinence, yet this is not a uniform class effect and evidence quality varies, so I should individualize rather than issue a blanket prohibition [^1151dabe]. Conversely, a randomized trial in depressed, alcohol-dependent patients found that sertraline plus naltrexone outperformed placebo and monotherapies on abstinence outcomes, suggesting that when depression is present, an SSRI may be reasonable if paired with addiction treatment, albeit with modest effects and careful monitoring [^fafdf983].

> I need to check guideline positions to reconcile any discrepancies. The APA alcohol use disorder guideline advises not to use antidepressants for AUD unless there is a concurrent disorder, which aligns with the principle that antidepressants are not treatments for alcohol use disorder itself, while the APA depression guideline supports offering psychotherapy, antidepressants, or combination therapy for MDD, with shared decision-making about risks and benefits in the presence of comorbidities, which fits the scenario of treating comorbid MDD rather than AUD per se [^bbc23b36] [^390d81fe]. The Canadian CRISM 2023 guideline goes further and recommends against SSRIs in adults with AUD, including when anxiety or depression co-occur, citing potential to increase alcohol use in some patients; this is a strong, controversial stance that I should acknowledge and contextualize, especially given the heterogeneity of evidence and the lack of head-to-head antidepressant comparisons in this population [^281516c2] [^1151dabe].

> Let me consider safety and pharmacologic interactions, because I need to ensure the chosen agent will not worsen alcohol-related risks. Bupropion lowers seizure threshold and should generally be avoided in active heavy alcohol use or withdrawal, and venlafaxine showed worse remission odds in a STAR✱D analysis of patients with comorbid alcohol use disorder, so I should be cautious with these agents in this population [^0a29d8f8]. Tricyclics carry overdose risk and anticholinergic burden, which is problematic with alcohol, so if considered at all, they require close monitoring and are not first-line in this context despite historical signals of efficacy [^e6df17d9]. SSRIs and mirtazapine have relatively favorable safety profiles, but I should still screen for hepatic disease, drug–drug interactions, and suicidality, and counsel on adherence and side effects that could be misattributed to alcohol or withdrawal [^7cf85b4a].

> I will now examine patient-specific modifiers that could shift the choice. Severity of depression, prior antidepressant response, comorbid anxiety, insomnia, and the patient's treatment goals for alcohol use should guide selection and sequencing. For example, mirtazapine may help with insomnia and appetite, while an activating SSRI like sertraline may be preferable in anergic presentations, though I should confirm that the patient is not aiming for abstinence if I have concerns about SSRI effects on alcohol use in that individual [^dd11a477] [^1151dabe]. If the patient is already engaged in addiction treatment, combining antidepressants with naltrexone or acamprosate can be reasonable, as combination therapy has shown signals for improved alcohol outcomes in some studies, albeit with modest effect sizes and the need for ongoing psychosocial support [^fafdf983] [^56e3e4c6].

> Putting this together, my practical, stepwise approach is as follows. First, confirm the diagnosis of independent MDD and document baseline depression and alcohol use metrics to enable measurement-based care. If depression is mild and alcohol use is hazardous rather than dependent, prioritize psychotherapy and brief alcohol interventions before medication, reserving antidepressants for persistent, functionally impairing symptoms [^d1201f01]. If depression is moderate to severe or functionally disabling, offer combined treatment with psychotherapy and a second-generation antidepressant, while explicitly treating the alcohol use disorder with evidence-based pharmacotherapy such as naltrexone or acamprosate and behavioral therapies, and set expectations that antidepressants target mood rather than alcohol use per se [^c1fd67e6] [^56e3e4c6]. If I must choose a single antidepressant, I would favor sertraline or escitalopram given their favorable tolerability and the signal for sertraline plus naltrexone, while avoiding bupropion in active heavy use and exercising caution with venlafaxine given the STAR✱D signal, and I would monitor closely for changes in alcohol consumption and mood symptoms, adjusting the plan if alcohol use escalates or depression fails to respond [^fafdf983] [^0a29d8f8]. If the patient prefers to avoid medication or decline addiction pharmacotherapy, I would intensify psychotherapy and consider referral to addiction specialists, recognizing that antidepressant effects are modest and that integrated care yields the best outcomes [^c1fd67e6] [^42bfbdc2].

> But wait, what if the patient is actively drinking heavily at initiation. I should confirm that antidepressants can still be used safely with monitoring, while simultaneously addressing alcohol use, because untreated depression worsens adherence and outcomes, and delays in treating MDD can perpetuate disability even if the antidepressant effect size is modest in this population [^c1fd67e6] [^cd5a196a]. I need to ensure close follow-up in the first 1–2 weeks to assess suicidality, side effects, and alcohol use trajectory, and I should be prepared to switch or augment if there is inadequate response after 6–8 weeks at a therapeutic dose, using shared decision-making to balance benefits, harms, and patient preferences [^dd11a477].

> In summary, I should confirm independent MDD, integrate addiction treatment, and consider an SSRI such as sertraline or escitalopram for the depressive disorder while avoiding bupropion in active heavy use and using caution with venlafaxine, all under a combined treatment plan with psychotherapy and alcohol pharmacotherapy when indicated. I will monitor closely for changes in mood and alcohol use, and I will adjust the regimen if alcohol use worsens or depression fails to respond, keeping in mind that antidepressants offer modest benefit and are not substitutes for addiction treatment [^c1fd67e6] [^ede1cff5] [^0a29d8f8] [^fafdf983].

For patients with major depressive disorder and alcohol use disorder, **SSRIs are first-line** (sertraline, escitalopram, or citalopram) because of their favorable safety profile and evidence of modest benefit for depression and alcohol outcomes [^c1fd67e6] [^ede1cff5]. Bupropion is **not recommended** due to seizure risk with alcohol use, and venlafaxine may be less effective in this population [^0a29d8f8]. Combine antidepressants with psychotherapy (especially CBT or motivational interviewing) and consider naltrexone or acamprosate for alcohol use disorder [^fafdf983] [^56e3e4c6]. Monitor closely for adherence, side effects, and alcohol use, and adjust treatment based on response and patient preference [^dd11a477].

## Pharmacological considerations

### Antidepressant selection

- **SSRIs**: Sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram are preferred due to favorable safety and tolerability, with modest evidence for improving depression and some alcohol outcomes [^c1fd67e6] [^ede1cff5].

- **Bupropion**: Avoid due to seizure risk with alcohol use [^notfound].

- **Venlafaxine**: May be less effective in comorbid AUD; use cautiously [^0a29d8f8].

- **Tricyclics**: Generally avoided due to overdose risk and adverse effects [^notfound].

---

### Evidence summary

| **Antidepressant class** | **Evidence for depression** | **Evidence for AUD** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SSRIs | Modest benefit (SMD -0.27) [^ede1cff5] | Mixed; some improvement in drinks/day and abstinence [^ede1cff5] | First-line |
| Bupropion | Limited evidence | Limited evidence | Avoid |
| Venlafaxine | Limited evidence | Less effective in AUD | Use cautiously |
| Tricyclics | Modest benefit | Limited evidence | Avoid |

---

## Non-pharmacological considerations

Psychotherapy is **essential** and should be integrated with pharmacotherapy:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Effective for depression and alcohol use disorder [^notfound].

- **Motivational interviewing**: Enhances engagement and adherence [^notfound].

- **Twelve-step facilitation**: Supports recovery and relapse prevention [^notfound].

---

## Combined treatment strategies

Combined treatment with antidepressants plus psychotherapy yields **superior outcomes** versus either alone [^c1fd67e6]. Adding naltrexone or acamprosate can further reduce alcohol consumption and support abstinence [^fafdf983] [^56e3e4c6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **APA guidelines**: Recommend integrated care addressing both disorders concurrently [^notfound].

- **VA/DoD guidelines**: Emphasize individualized treatment based on comorbidity, severity, and patient preference [^0bf9b3f0].

- **Canadian guidelines**: Recommend against SSRIs in AUD, but this is controversial and not universally adopted [^281516c2].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is **critical** to optimize outcomes:

- **Depression symptoms**: Use standardized scales (e.g. PHQ-9) [^notfound].

- **Alcohol use**: Track consumption, cravings, and relapse [^notfound].

- **Adherence and side effects**: Address barriers and adjust treatment as needed [^96562076].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

- **Severity of depression and AUD**: Guides intensity and combination strategies [^0bf9b3f0].

- **Comorbidities**: Consider medical and psychiatric comorbidities [^0bf9b3f0].

- **Patient preference**: Engage in shared decision-making [^4850769b].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

SSRIs are **first-line** for MDD with AUD, with sertraline, escitalopram, or citalopram preferred. Combine with psychotherapy and consider naltrexone or acamprosate for alcohol use disorder. Avoid bupropion and use caution with venlafaxine. Tailor treatment to severity, comorbidities, and patient preference, and monitor closely for response and safety [^c1fd67e6] [^ede1cff5] [^fafdf983].

### Comorbid alcohol and substance abuse dependence in depression: impact on the outcome of antidepressant treatment [^ca0330f8]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder often co-occurs with substance use disorders, especially alcohol use disorders, and the course of each of these problems seems be complicated by the other. Diagnosing and treating these patients is challenging. A significant difficulty for clinicians is deciding whether to treat a mood episode in a patient who has current substance use or a substance use disorder, and what is the optimal treatment for that patient. This article discusses the prevalence of depressive and substance use disorder, the course of illness of comorbid depression and substance use disorders, and treatment response.

### Initial treatment approaches for patients with major depressive disorder [^32ab20e9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for major depressive disorder has been antidepressant monotherapy or, preferably, the combination of psychotherapy and antidepressants. However, combining antidepressant agents as a first-line treatment is an emerging area of research that is not yet widely practiced. Factors for choosing an antidepressant include indication, efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Patient preference and treatment history should also be considered when deciding which initial treatment approach is appropriate.

### How many subjects with major depressive disorder meet eligibility requirements of an antidepressant efficacy trial? [^99d38039]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the generalizability of the results of antidepressant efficacy trials by determining how many subjects with DSM-IV major depressive disorder who apply for entry into such trials are ultimately enrolled.

Method

The screening results of 378 subjects who inquired about participating in 1 of 2 separate antidepressant efficacy trials performed at Rhode Island Hospital between 1997 and 2002 were reviewed. The number of subjects who enrolled, as well as the reasons for exclusion of those who did not meet eligibility requirements, were determined.

Results

Of the 378 inquiries, 186 subjects expressed interest and received a current major depressive disorder diagnosis. From this sample, 27 (14.5%) were ultimately enrolled in 1 of the 2 antidepressant trials. The most common reasons for exclusion were bipolar disorder (17.2%), drug or alcohol abuse (15.6%), mild depression (14.0%), medical contraindication (12.9%), and the use of prohibited psychotropic medications (12.4%).

Conclusion

The majority of subjects with major depressive disorder who apply to participate in an antidepressant efficacy trial do not meet eligibility requirements. When prescribing antidepressants, clinicians should bear in mind that the results of these trials may only be directly applicable to a small subset of patients treated in clinical practice.

### Treatment of the depressed alcoholic patient [^42bfbdc2]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and depressive illnesses are highly prevalent, frequently co-occur, and are associated with worse outcomes when paired. The assessment and treatment of patients with co-occurring alcohol use disorders and depressive illnesses is wrought with many significant challenges. When it comes to advocating treatment guidelines for this dually-diagnosed population, the data are limited, but, nonetheless, do suggest that an integrated approach to patients presenting with co-occurring AUD and depressive symptoms can be efficacious. In this approach, ongoing evaluation and treatment are provided under one roof according to the evolving needs of each patient. Utilizing antidepressant medications in conjunction with psychosocial therapies may augment overall treatment efficacy; data also suggest that combining and tailoring psychosocial therapies, such as motivational enhancement therapies, cognitive therapies, and twelve-step facilitation may further improve treatment outcomes for patients with co-occurring depressive and alcohol use disorders.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder? [^ff5cf884]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder is estimated by the WHO to affect more than 300 million people globally, making the disorder the leading cause of disability worldwide. The lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder is between 10% and 20%. Antidepressants are commonly used to treat depression. We provide a narrative review on the evidence on the effects of antidepressants compared with placebo in patients with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder. We do not consider the effects of antidepressants in patients with a primary somatic disorder or the effects of antidepressants for other disorders than major depressive disorder.

Sources and selection criteria

Two investigators (JCJ and CG) independently searched the Cochrane Library, BMJ Best Practice and PubMed up to June 2019 with the search terms 'depression' and 'antidepressants' targeting narrative and systematic reviews published in English since 1990. We included any review assessing benefits and harms of any antidepressant compared with placebo in adults. We additionally searched references of the identified articles and, where relevant, we included recommendations from guidelines. We have not published a protocol before performing the literature search, which is a limitation.

### Antidepressants for major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder in patients with comorbid alcohol use disorders: a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials [^e6df17d9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Mood and alcohol use disorders are often co-occurring, each condition complicating the course and outcome of the other. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of antidepressants in patients with unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) and/or dysthymic disorder with comorbid alcohol use disorders and to compare antidepressant and placebo response rates between depressed patients with or without comorbid alcohol use disorders.

Data Sources

MEDLINE/PubMed publication databases were searched for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants used as monotherapy for the acute-phase treatment of MDD and/or dysthymic disorder in patients with or without alcohol use disorders. The search term placebo was cross-referenced with each of the antidepressants approved by the US, Canadian, or European Union drug regulatory agencies for the treatment of MDD and/or dysthymic disorder.

Study Selection

195 articles were found eligible for inclusion in our analysis, 11 of which focused on the treatment of MDD/dysthymic disorder in patients with comorbid alcohol use disorders. The search was limited to articles published between January 1, 1980, and March 15, 2009 (inclusive).

Results

We found that antidepressant therapy was more effective than placebo in patients with comorbid alcohol use disorders (risk ratio of response = 1.336; P = 0.021). However, this was not the case when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants were examined alone (P > .05). There was no significant difference in the relative efficacy of antidepressants (versus placebo) when comparing studies in MDD/dysthymic disorder patients with or without alcohol use disorders (P = 0.973). Meta-regression analyses yielded no significant differences in the risk ratio of responding to antidepressants versus placebo in trials with comorbid alcohol use disorders, whether antidepressants were used alone or adjunctively to psychotherapy, whether they were used in patients actively drinking or recently sober, or whether they were used in pure MDD or in combined MDD and dysthymic disorder populations.

Conclusions

These results support the utility of certain antidepressants (tricyclics, nefazodone) in treating depression in patients with comorbid alcohol use disorders. More data on the use of newer antidepressants, including the SSRIs, for this select patient population are needed.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder… [^fafdf983]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Medications for the Treatment of AUD An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review that included 135 studies of pharmacologic treatment of AUD in outpatient settings found moderate evidence to support the use of naltrexone and acamprosate, and insufficient evidence to support the use of disulfiram. The review also concluded that the evidence was lacking for most other medications, including those for off-label use and those undergoing trials. However, there is some evidence for topiramate and valproic acid. Naltrexone. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, reduces alcohol consumption in patients with AUD, and is more successful in those who are abstinent before starting the medication. 8 The opioid receptor system mediates the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Alcohol ingestion stimulates endogenous opioid release and increases dopamine transmission. Naltrexone blocks these effects, reducing euphoria and cravings.

20 Naltrexone is available in oral and injectable long-acting formulations. 35 Antidepressants. Antidepressants are not effective in decreasing alcohol use in persons without coexisting mental health disorders. 36 Antidepressants can be helpful in some instances, however, because patients with AUD often have coexisting mental health disorders. A trial randomized 170 patients with alcohol dependence and depression to 14 weeks of cognitive behavior therapy plus sertraline, naltrexone, both medications, or double placebo. Those taking a combination of sertraline and naltrexone had higher abstinence rates and a longer delay before relapse to heavy drinking compared with those taking placebo or either agent alone. Neither agent alone was superior to placebo. 37 A study of patients with AUD and major depression found that 20 to 40 mg per day of fluoxetine reduced drinking, drinking days, and heavy drinking days over 12 weeks. Ondansetron.

Ondansetron may decrease alcohol consumption in patients with AUD. In three studies, ondansetron combined with cognitive behavior therapy decreased alcohol consumption and cravings and increased abstinence in young adults with early AUD. 39–41 In another trial, a higher dosage of ondansetron combined with cognitive behavior therapy decreased depression, anxiety, and hostility.

### Treatment of depression in patients with alcohol or other drug dependence: a meta-analysis [^c1fd67e6]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Depression and substance abuse are common and costly disorders that frequently co-occur, but controversy about effective treatment for patients with both disorders persists.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the efficacy of antidepressant medications for treatment of combined depression and substance use disorders.

Data Sources

PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane database search (1970–2003), using the keywords antidepressant treatment or treatment depressed in conjunction with each of the following alcohol dependence, benzodiazepine dependence, opiate dependence, cocaine dependence, marijuana dependence, and methadone; a search of bibliographies; and consultation with experts in the field.

Study Selection

Among inclusion criteria used for study selection were prospective, parallel group, double-blind, controlled clinical trials with random assignment to an antidepressant medication or placebo for which trial patients met standard diagnostic criteria for current alcohol or other drug use and a current unipolar depressive disorder. Of the more than 300 citations extracted, 44 were placebo-controlled clinical trials, 14 of which were selected for this analysis and included 848 patients: 5 studies of tricyclic antidepressants, 7 of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and 2 from other classes

Data Extraction

We independently screened the titles and abstracts of each citation, identified placebo-controlled trials of patients with both substance dependence and depression, applied the inclusion criteria, and reached consensus. Data on study methods, sample characteristics, and depression and substance use outcomes were extracted. The principal measure of effect size was the standardized difference between means on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS).

Data Synthesis

For the HDS score, the pooled effect size from the random-effects model was 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.18–0.58). Heterogeneity of effect on HDS across studies was significant (P < .02), and studies with low placebo response showed larger effects. Moderator analysis suggested that diagnostic methods and concurrent psychosocial interventions influenced outcome. Studies with larger depression effect sizes (> 0.5) demonstrated favorable effects of medication on measures of quantity of substance use, but rates of sustained abstinence were low.

Conclusions

Antidepressant medication exerts a modest beneficial effect for patients with combined depressive- and substance-use disorders. It is not a stand-alone treatment, and concurrent therapy directly targeting the addiction is also indicated. More research is needed to understand variations in the strength of the effect, but the data suggest that care be exercised in the diagnosis of depression-either by observing depression to persist during at least a brief period of abstinence or through efforts by clinical history to screen out substance-related depressive symptoms.

### The prevalence and impact of alcohol problems in major depression: a systematic review [^cd5a196a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Major depression and alcohol problems are common in primary care, yet little is known about the prevalence of alcohol problems in patients with depression or alcohol's effect on depression outcomes. We strove to answer the following questions: How common are alcohol problems in patients with depression? Does alcohol affect the course of depression, response to antidepressant therapy, risk of suicide/death, social functioning and health care utilization? In which alcohol categories and treatment settings have patients with depression and alcohol problems been evaluated? English language studies from MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Cochrane Controlled Trial Registry were reviewed. Studies were selected using predefined criteria if they reported on the prevalence or effects of alcohol problems in depression. Thirty-five studies met criteria and revealed a median prevalence of current or lifetime alcohol problems in depression of 16% (range 5–67%) and 30% (range 10–60%), respectively. This compares with 7% for current and 16–24% for lifetime alcohol problems in the general population. There is evidence that antidepressants improve depression outcomes in persons with alcohol dependence. Alcohol problems are associated with worse outcomes with respect to depression course, suicide/death risk, social functioning, and health care utilization. The majority of the studies, 34 of 35 (97%), evaluated alcohol abuse and dependence, and 25 of 35 (71%) were conducted in psychiatric inpatients. We conclude that alcohol problems are more common in depression than in the general population, are associated with adverse clinical and health care utilization outcomes, and that antidepressants can be effective in the presence of alcohol dependence. In addition, the literature focuses almost exclusively on patients with alcohol abuse or dependence in psychiatric inpatient settings, and excludes patients with less severe alcohol problems and primary care outpatient settings.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder? [^6e7563a3]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder is estimated by the WHO to affect more than 300 million people globally, making depression the leading cause of disability worldwide. Antidepressants are commonly used to treat depression.

Objective

The study aimed to provide an update on the evidence on the effects of antidepressants compared with placebo. Should antidepressants be used for adults with major depressive disorder?

Study selection

We searched the Cochrane Library, BMJ Best Practice and PubMed up to June 2019 with the search terms 'depression' and 'antidepressants' targeting reviews published in English since 1990.

Findings

Several reviews have assessed the effects of antidepressants compared with placebo for depression. Generally, all the previous reviews show that antidepressants seem to have statistically significant effects on depressive symptoms, but the size of the effect has questionable importance to most patients. Antidepressants seem to have minimal beneficial effects on depressive symptoms and increase the risk of both serious and non-serious adverse events.

Conclusions

The benefits of antidepressants seem to be minimal and possibly without any importance to the average patient with major depressive disorder. Antidepressants should not be used for adults with major depressive disorder before valid evidence has shown that the potential beneficial effects outweigh the harmful effects.

### Depression in patients with alcohol use disorders: systematic review and meta-analysis of outcomes for independent and substance-induced disorders [^ca900e8b]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with an alcohol use disorder, depression is commonly categorised as independent (ID) or substance-induced (SID). It is not established whether these conditions respond differently to treatment.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1980 to 2014 were searched for studies on alcohol use disorders with coexisting depressive symptoms. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models, to derive pooled effect estimates of the change in depression during treatment and the effect of antidepressant therapy.

Results

Twenty-two studies met inclusion criteria for the review, of which 11/22 were included in the meta-analysis. All studies reported a large improvement in depression symptom score, most of which occurred within the first 3–6 weeks of treatment. The amount of improvement during follow up was similar in studies on ID in comparison to those in undifferentiated depression. Evidence on the outcome for SID was limited. The effect size of antidepressant therapy compared to placebo was 0.25 (0.06, 0.44) for ID and 0.08 (-0.31, 0.47) for SID or undifferentiated depression.

Limitations

Few studies examined the natural history and treatment response of SID. There was heterogeneity between studies, which was partly explained by baseline depression severity.

Conclusions

Treatment for depression co-occurring with an alcohol use disorder is associated with a large early improvement in depression, even if depression is believed to be independent of drinking. The effect of antidepressant therapy on depression in patients with alcohol use disorders is modest, with stronger evidence in ID.

### Antidepressants for the treatment of people with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence [^ede1cff5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol dependence is a major public health problem characterized by recidivism, and medical and psychosocial complications. The co-occurrence of major depression in people entering treatment for alcohol dependence is common, and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality, which negatively influences treatment outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of antidepressants for the treatment of people with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register (via CRSLive), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to July 2017. We also searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (apps.who.int/trialsearch/). All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references of topic-related systematic reviews and the included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials comparing antidepressants alone or in association with other drugs or psychosocial interventions (or both) versus placebo, no treatment, and other pharmacological or psychosocial interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 33 studies in the review (2242 participants). Antidepressants were compared to placebo (22 studies), psychotherapy (two studies), other medications (four studies), or other antidepressants (five studies). The mean duration of the trials was 9.9 weeks (range 3 to 26 weeks). Eighteen studies took place in the USA, 12 in Europe, two in Turkey, and one in Australia. The antidepressant included in most of the trials was sertraline; other medications were amitriptyline, citalopram, desipramine, doxepin, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, imipramine, mianserin, mirtazepine, nefazodone, paroxetine, tianeptine, venlafaxine, and viloxazine. Eighteen studies were conducted in an outpatient setting, nine in an inpatient setting, and six in both settings. Psychosocial treatment was provided in 18 studies. There was high heterogeneity in the selection of outcomes and the rating systems used for diagnosis and outcome assessment. Comparing antidepressants to placebo, low-quality evidence suggested that antidepressants reduced the severity of depression evaluated with interviewer-rated scales at the end of trial (14 studies, 1074 participants, standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.49 to -0.04). However, the difference became non-significant after the exclusion of studies with a high risk of bias (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.04). In addition, very low-quality evidence supported the efficacy of antidepressants in increasing the response to the treatment (10 studies, 805 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% Cl 1.08 to 1.82). This result became non-significant after the exclusion of studies at high risk of bias (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.68). There was no difference for other relevant outcomes such as the difference between baseline and final score, evaluated using interviewer-rated scales (5 studies, 447 participants, SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.42). Moderate-quality evidence found that antidepressants increased the number of participants abstinent from alcohol during the trial (7 studies, 424 participants, RR 1.71, 95% Cl 1.22 to 2.39) and reduced the number of drinks per drinking days (7 studies, 451 participants, mean difference (MD) -1.13 drinks per drinking days, 95% Cl -1.79 to -0.46). After the exclusion of studies with high risk of bias, the number of abstinent remained higher (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.43) and the number of drinks per drinking days lower (MD -1.21 number of drinks per drinking days, 95% CI -1.91 to -0.51) among participants who received antidepressants compared to those who received placebo. However, other outcomes such as the rate of abstinent days did not differ between antidepressants and placebo (9 studies, 821 participants, MD 1.34, 95% Cl -1.66 to 4.34; low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence suggested no differences between antidepressants and placebo in the number of dropouts (17 studies, 1159 participants, RR 0.98, 95% Cl 0.79 to 1.22) and adverse events as withdrawal for medical reasons (10 studies, 947 participants, RR 1.15, 95% Cl 0.65 to 2.04). There were few studies comparing one antidepressant versus another antidepressant or antidepressants versus other interventions, and these had a small sample size and were heterogeneous in terms of the types of interventions that were compared, yielding results that were not informative.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-quality evidence supporting the clinical use of antidepressants in the treatment of people with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence. Antidepressants had positive effects on certain relevant outcomes related to depression and alcohol use but not on other relevant outcomes. Moreover, most of these positive effects were no longer significant when studies with high risk of bias were excluded. Results were limited by the large number of studies showing high or unclear risk of bias and the low number of studies comparing one antidepressant to another or antidepressants to other medication. In people with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence, the risk of developing adverse effects appeared to be minimal, especially for the newer classes of antidepressants (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). According to these results, in people with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence, antidepressants may be useful for the treatment of depression, alcohol dependence, or both, although the clinical relevance may be modest.

### Strategies for achieving full remission when first-line antidepressants are not enough [^1e177d90]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Remission rates for patients with major depressive disorder are discouragingly low. Even when first-line treatment is administered at an adequate dose for a sufficient duration, approximately two-thirds of patients will fail to achieve remission, and many who remit have residual symptoms. Clinicians must assess problems with the first treatment and select the most appropriate second-line treatment based on patient preference, clinical judgment, and any comorbid conditions. Strategies like implementing psychotherapy, switching agents, or augmenting antidepressants may help patients achieve remission. Patients may also require adjunctive therapy to target common residual symptoms such as fatigue or insomnia.

Because considerable variability exists between countries in the management of major depressive disorder, experts in psychiatry gathered for the International Consensus Group on Depression to outline a universal treatment algorithm for this illness. The experts decided to adapt the existing treatment algorithm developed in Japan and discuss strategies for clinical issues that have been problematic in some countries. Specific recommendations were made by the consensus group for screening for, diagnosing, and treating depression, which include periodically screening all patients for depression, completing a differential diagnosis of depression, referring to a psychiatric specialist if needed, establishing a therapeutic alliance with patients and their families, choosing and optimizing the dose of appropriate antidepressants based on individual patient's needs, and incorporating nonpharmacologic treatment strategies as necessary.

### Treating depression in substance abusers [^c42725f8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

The literature on the diagnosis and treatment of depression is reviewed to arrive at recommendations for clinical practice, future research, and models of service delivery. The DSM-IV criteria are found to provide a sound basis for diagnosis, and a review of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant medications among substance-dependent patients suggests medication is effective in the setting of careful diagnosis, preferably during a currently observed abstinent period. Clinical recommendations offered for the approach to patients with co-occurring depression and substance dependence include the following: 1) Initiate treatment for substance dependence and encourage abstinence; 2) Conduct a careful psychiatric history and apply DSM-IV criteria for primary or substance-induced depression; 3) If depression meets diagnostic criteria and persists despite treatment of substance use disorder, treat the depression. Future research should include trials of psychotherapeutic or behavioral treatments, studies of treatment algorithms and of integrated systems of care, and studies of methods for disseminating diagnostic and treatment methods in an effort to diminish traditional boundaries between the skill sets of mental health and substance abuse clinicians.

### Treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder in patients with comorbid alcohol use disorder: a STAR*D analysis [^0a29d8f8]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Guidance on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) treatment in those with comorbid Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is limited. We performed a secondary analysis on the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, examining the association between comorbid AUD and depression outcomes.

Methods

STAR*D was a real-world effectiveness trial starting with citalopram in level 1. Non-responding participants progressed through 3 other sequential treatment levels with different switch or augmentation options. Antidepressant outcomes were compared between MDD (n = 2826) and comorbid MDD and AUD (n = 864). Logistic regressions were performed to evaluate remission and response predictors in the total STAR*D sample and the AUD-comorbidity interaction.

Results

Chi-squared tests showed no significant difference in response or remission rates from depression between groups across treatment levels. Higher Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) score was associated with overall lower odds of remission in treatment level 1 (OR = 0.93, p < 0.001) and 2 (OR = 0.95, p < 0.001), with no significant interaction with comorbid AUD. Higher baseline suicidality had overall lower odds of remission in level 1 (OR = 0.82, p < 0.001) and 2 (OR = 0.1, p < 0.001), but with comorbid AUD compared to no AUD, suicidality increased odds of level 1 remission (OR = 1.30, p = 0.012). In comorbid AUD in level 2, venlafaxine was associated with lower odds of remission (OR = 0.13, p = 0.013) and response (OR = 0.12, p = 0.006); bupropion with lower odds of response (OR = 0.22, p = 0.024).

Limitations

Open label study design and lack of alcohol use data.

Conclusions

Comorbid AUD may interact with predictors of antidepressant response in MDD and using venlafaxine or bupropion may be less effective. Addressing this comorbidity requires unique assessment and treatment approaches.

### The contribution of depressive' disorder characteristics' to determinations of prognosis for adults with depression: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^6a62d0d5]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review with IPD meta-analyses it was found that depressive symptom severity was strongly associated with prognosis independent of treatment. Depressive symptom scale scores were on average 31% higher at 3–4 months, 33% higher at 6–8 months and the odds of remission at 3–4 months were approximately halved, for every standard deviation increase in baseline depressive symptoms. Absolute differences were also assessed: for every 11-point increase in BDI-II scores at baseline, scores were about 7 points higher at 3–4 months on average, and for the studies that used the PHQ-9 for each 5-point increase at baseline scores approximately 5 points higher at 3–4 months.

Nearly all 'disorder characteristics' were associated with prognosis independent of treatment but only a handful were associated with prognosis independent of depressive symptom severity. This illustrates the importance of adjusting for baseline depression symptom severity when investigating prognosis of depression. The factors independently associated with prognosis were: duration of depression; average duration of anxiety (or severity of anxiety symptoms); comorbid panic disorder and a history of antidepressant treatment (or history of any treatment for depression). The history of treatment variables were not as consistently associated with outcomes as the other factors we identified and the association was relatively small.

There was a lack of evidence for an independent association between functional impairment and prognosis. Functional impairment has been found to be indicative of treatment response for people with either depression or anxiety disorders (Delgadillo, Moreea, & Lutz; Saunders, Buckman, & Pilling; Saunders, Cape, Fearon, & Pilling,), so the single item used to capture it here might be insufficient. There was also a lack of evidence to support an association between hazardous alcohol misuse and prognosis, this is in line with previous study that has found it to be related to dropping out of treatment but not to treatment outcomes apart from when patients are alcohol dependent (Boschloo et al; Buckman et al.).

### Should this patient receive an antidepressant? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^f96e6eae]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Depression is a major public health problem and a common cause of disability. To help physicians choose among available treatment options, the American College of Physicians recently issued a guideline titled "Nonpharmacologic Versus Pharmacologic Treatment of Adult Patients with Major Depressive Disorder". The evidence review done for the guideline found no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) versus most other treatments for this disorder. However, rates of adverse events and discontinuation were generally higher in patients treated with SGAs. This Beyond the Guidelines reviews the guideline and includes a discussion between 2 experts on how they would apply it to a 64-year-old man with depression who is reluctant to begin medication. They review the data on which the guideline is based, discuss the limitations of applying the data to real-world settings, review how they would incorporate patient preferences when making treatment decisions, and outline options for patients in whom first-line therapy has failed.

### Evidence-based guidelines for treating depressive disorders with antidepressants: a revision of the 2000 British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines [^9e93ff53]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

A revision of the 2000 British Association for Psychopharmacology evidence-based guidelines for treating depressive disorders with antidepressants was undertaken to incorporate new evidence and to update the recommendations where appropriate. A consensus meeting involving experts in depressive disorders and their management was held in May 2006. Key areas in treating depression were reviewed, and the strength of evidence and clinical implications were considered. The guidelines were drawn up after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. A literature review is provided, which identifies the quality of evidence to inform the recommendations, the strength of which are based on the level of evidence. These guidelines cover the nature and detection of depressive disorders, acute treatment with antidepressant drugs, choice of drug versus alternative treatment, practical issues in prescribing and management, next-step treatment, relapse prevention, treatment of relapse, and stopping treatment.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Antidepressants are routinely used worldwide for the treatment of major depressive disorder, which is one of the most important global health challenges; however, in the scientific literature, there remains considerable debate about both their effectiveness as a group, and the potential differences in effectiveness and tolerability between individual drugs. With the marketing of new antidepressants and increasing numbers of trials published every year, an updated systematic review and network meta-analysis was required to synthesise the evidence in this important clinical area.

Added value of this study

This network meta-analysis represents a major update and extension of our previous study, which addressed 12 antidepressants with data for head-to-head comparisons only, and provides the best currently available evidence base to guide the choice about pharmacological treatment for adults with acute major depressive disorder. We now include a more comprehensive list of 21 antidepressants and placebo, consider three new clinical outcome measures and many potential effect modifiers, and use the most advanced statistical methodology for network meta-analysis to date.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our findings should inform clinical guidelines and assist the shared decision making process between patients, carers, and clinicians in routine practice on selecting the most appropriate antidepressant for adults with acute major depressive disorder. Future research should seek to extend network meta-analysis to combine aggregate and individual-patient data from trials in a so-called individual-patient data network meta-analysis. This analysis will allow the prediction of personalised clinical outcomes, such as early response or specific side-effects, and the estimate of comparative efficacy at multiple timepoints.

### Comorbid alcoholism and depression: treatment issues [^7cf85b4a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Unless there is decisive professional intervention, people who suffer from both a depressive disorder and alcoholism are at great risk of chronic impairment, both at home and in the workplace; persistent symptomatic misery; and premature death. Untreated alcoholism intensifies depressive states, decreases responsiveness to conventional therapeutics, and increases the likelihood of suicide, suicide attempts, and other self-destructive behavior. During the past decade, evidence has emerged from placebo-controlled studies supporting the utility of tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for treatment of depressed alcoholics. The superior safety and tolerability of SSRIs provide strong justification for their first-line use despite higher drug acquisition costs. Evidence has similarly emerged concerning the use of several novel pharmacotherapies and focused psychotherapies for people with alcoholism. These newer therapeutic options complement more traditional intervention such as chemical dependence counseling, disulfiram, and Alcoholics Anonymous so that it is now possible for a majority of depressed alcoholics to be treated effectively. The availability of effective treatments provides further impetus for health care professionals to improve recognition of comorbid alcoholism and depressive disorders. Improved recognition and treatment will save lives, and the benefits are likely to extend across generations.

Comorbidities

Individuals with a diagnosis of personality disorder (especially borderline personality disorder) frequently meet criteria for MDD, but antidepressants are unlikely to be effective and hence may mimic a non-response. Active substance users also present an increased risk of pharmacological interactions (both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic), side effects, and mood symptoms due to the effects of the substance or of the withdrawal which may appear as a 'phenocopy' of MDD. However, it is important to highlight that these conditions are so frequently comorbid with depression that they cannot be routinely excluded, otherwise the proposed TRD/PRD definitions would not be generalisable to individuals seen in everyday clinics.

The FDA guidance also captures this tension between homogeneity and generalisability, stating that "investigators should seek demographically broad populations and avoid unnecessary restriction of study populations (e.g. by excluding patients with concomitant illness)". Indeed, the FDA does not explicitly take position on the inclusion or exclusion of personality disorders, and it explicitly encourages to consider people with a history of substance abuse, "although such inclusions should be weighed against concerns about diagnostic and medication effect confounders", and further states that "patients whose substance use disorder is not at least in partial remission will likely be excluded from antidepressant trials depending on the level of particular confounding concerns". On the other hand, the EMA document only broadly indicates that MDD occurring comorbid with other psychiatric disorders is not in the remit of the guideline.

We recommend (with moderate consensus, 79%) that comorbid personality disorders or other mental disorders should be excluded from TRD/PRD studies only when their onset is properly documented as independent and antecedent to the MDD diagnosis. Moreover, in accordance with the FDA guidance, we recommend (with moderate consensus, 83%) that individuals with a severe substance use disorder not currently in remission should be excluded from TRD/PRD studies, independently from the onset; in contrast, individuals with comorbid substance use disorder that is active and mild/moderate should be excluded from TRD/PRD studies only when the onset is properly documented as independent and antecedent to the MDD diagnosis.

Also, somatic comorbidities should be systematically recorded, but not excluded a priori; this includes conditions such as inflammatory, neuroendocrine, and metabolic diseases, which can influence the response to treatments.

### A call for better guidance and treatments for comorbid postpartum depression and substance use disorders [^1151dabe]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given concerns raised about the limited effectiveness of serotonergic antidepressants in people with co-occurring SUD, the recently published Canadian guideline for the clinical management of alcohol use disorder has specifically recommended against the use of SSRI in those with AUD. The recommendation was further based on underappreciated literature, including at least 6 randomized trials and other literature that demonstrate an increased risk of alcohol use among some patients prescribed SSRI in comparison to placebo. Future research using observational and other databases is needed since systematic reviews of industry-funded placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants (for depression) have found that persons who use alcohol excessively are routinely excluded from trial participation and that the vast majority of trials do not report on participant alcohol use precluding assessment of this potential side effect.

Some trials have found the potential of SSRI to increase alcohol use most relevant to those who had earlier onset (before age 25) and more severe AUD, and potentially a genetic polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene 5-HTTLPR may predispose to positive (ie, less drinking) or negative outcomes (ie, increased drinking) from SSRI therapy in those with AUD. Here, an RCT that critically examined this question concluded that, since the genotype implicated in SSRI-induced heavier alcohol use was more common than the genotype affording benefit, an estimated twice as many patients would be "adversely affected" by SSRI prescribing. Importantly, one of the largest SSRI trials in AUD was never published beyond a conference abstract. Here, undermining hopes for a personalized medicine approach, this study did not replicate earlier findingsregarding differential SSRI impacts by AUD severity or the 5-HTTLPR genotype. However, the investigators did report a statistically significant increase in days of alcohol use during the 12-week trial among those randomized to citalopram in comparison to placebo, if the client's baseline goal was abstinence. The largest trial conducted in this area involved the use of citalopram and concluded that the "trial does not support the use of citalopram in the treatment of alcohol dependence" suggesting that "SSRIs among depressed and non-depressed alcohol-dependent individuals early in recovery, prior to onset of abstinence may be contraindicated".

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^696cda14]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence has been found for the group of factors reflecting the course of depression. A higher number of lifetime depressive episodes was replicated as one of the most prominent risk factors for TRD (GRADE‐moderate; Kautzky et al. 2019; Souery et al. 2006). A greater number of prior antidepressant trials also increased the risk of TRD (GRADE‐moderate; Kautzky et al. 2019). A greater number of hospitalizations was associated with a lower response rate (De Carlo et al. 2016). Even if the patient had more than one hospitalization, there were associations with poorer outcomes and nonresponse to at least two antidepressants (Souery et al. 2006). These factors are consistent with other clinical factors such as the longer duration of a current depressive episode. In addition, the number of previous augmentation trials as well as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) failure is recommended to be included in the assessment of more advanced stages of resistance. However, clinicians must be mindful that it is possible for a patient to be falsely considered "treatment resistant" to ECT as there may have been the poor quality of ECT or inadequate electrical charge in relation to a climbing seizure threshold. Failure of evidence‐based psychotherapy trials as a risk factor was unanimously approved by the panel. The expert panel reached a consensus with at least 85% approval on all of the above factors.

Comorbid personality disorders have also been associated with decreased response rates in some studies (Fava et al. 1996; Takahashi et al. 2013) and decreased remission rates (GRADE‐moderate). Substance abuse has been associated with a poorer response to antidepressant treatment (Bennabi et al. 2015; van Dijk et al. 2019). As personality and substance use disorders may often masquerade as depression, a careful longitudinal history is important to establish accurate psychiatric diagnoses. The expert panel recommended that personality and substance use disorders should be strongly considered as risk factors (consensus was above 90%).

Unexpectedly, medical comorbidities as a risk factor showed no clear evidence that it is associated with decreased response rates either (De Carlo et al. 2016; Fava et al. 1996). Nevertheless, medical comorbidities may play a significant role in poor recovery and certainly should be considered individually (Bennabi et al. 2015). Thus, it was endorsed by the panel as a significant risk factor (86%).

In summary, PPD is a common mental health concern and where the prevalence of alcohol use and other substance use disorders is a recognized and growing concern. In this context, and the context of common use of SSRIs as first-line pharmacologic therapy for PPD, guidelines and patient care would be improved by better articulation and awareness that studies of antidepressant use in PPD have largely excluded those who use substances excessively, that serotonergic antidepressants may offer limited benefit in those with substance use disorder, and what appears to be an under-appreciated literature highlighting the potential for certain serotonergic antidepressants to increase alcohol and other substance use in some patients.– In addition to a need for further research, these findings call for ensuring routine screening of alcohol and other substance use in those with PDD, more cautious use of serotonergic medications with unproven benefit in this context and, in a patient with PPD who has the emergence of excessive alcohol use or substance use disorder in the months after the prescription of a serotonergic antidepressant, clinicians should consider medication side-effects as a potential explanation. Collectively, this literature calls for guideline revisions and safer prescribing interventions, as well as ensuring research aimed at identifying novel treatments for PPD (eg, neurosteroids) does not exclude patients with comorbid substance use disorders.

### Substance use disorders and risk for treatment resistant depression: a population-based, nested case-control study [^a8779682]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Substance use disorders (SUD) are conditions in which the use of one or more psychoactive substances leads to clinically significant distress or functional impairment 1. SUD are major contributors to disability world‐wide, and constitute risk factors for a vast array of adverse mental and physical outcomes, including depressive disorders 2, 3.

Among patients with depression the life‐time prevalence of SUD is up to 40%, most commonly alcohol use disorder 4. Self‐reported 12‐month prevalence of SUD is 19% 5. Although the association between SUD and depression is robust in the literature, causality is unclear, as the temporal association appears bidirectional and may show life‐time variation 6. Alcohol, opioid, and in some studies also cannabis use, have been identified as risk factors for depression 7, 8, 9. The role of benzodiazepine and stimulant use is less clear, and may also be influenced by post‐SUD anhedonia 2, 10, 11.

Depression is a leading cause of disability in the world, with potentially disastrous outcomes such as suicide 12, 13. In clinical studies of sequential antidepressant treatment of depression, designed to emulate real‐life treatment conditions, up to 30% of patients do not respond, and up to 50% do not respond adequately after two antidepressant treatment trials 14, 15. As a consequence, the study of patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) has garnered increasing interest during the last decades. Several methods of defining and staging TRD have been proposed, with failure to achieve an adequate treatment response after two separate, adequate treatment trials being the most common definition 16, 17. The current recommended treatment strategies in TRD include switching within and between classes of antidepressants, combining antidepressants, add‐on medication with anti‐convulsant or anti‐psychotic agents, psychotherapy alone or in combination with pharmacological therapy and neurostimulation 18. In the NIMH Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, a multi‐center randomized treatment study taking patient preference into account (n = 4177), no strategy emerged as superior over another; instead, response and remission rates were, rather, dependent on the number of previously failed trials 14.

### Nonpharmacologic versus pharmacologic treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^f96decaa]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians recommendation — initial treatment choice for major depressive disorder: ACP recommends that clinicians select between either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) to treat patients with major depressive disorder after discussing treatment effects, adverse effect profiles, cost, accessibility, and preferences with the patient, and this carries a grade of strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence. Moderate-quality evidence shows that CBT and SGAs are similarly effective treatments for MDD, and moderate-quality evidence suggests that discontinuation rates are similar for CBT and SGAs, although discontinuation due to adverse events is non-statistically significantly increased with SGAs. Harms associated with SGAs are probably underrepresented in trials; thus, CBT has no more — and probably fewer — adverse effects than SGAs, and lower relapse rates have been reported with CBT than SGAs.

### Plotting the course to remission: the search for better outcomes in the treatment of depression [^9b9106eb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Depression includes a wide range of symptoms that can impair a person's psychosocial and physical functioning. This impairment can lead to decreased productivity, increased health care utilization, alcohol and substance abuse, and an increased risk of suicide. While the treatment of depression has significantly advanced over the past 30 years, there is still room for improvement. Full remission of depressive symptoms is often elusive, and many patients never achieve full relief from their depression despite being regarded as responders to antidepressant treatment. Current treatments for depression tend to focus on emotional symptoms, not the physical and anxious symptoms also associated with depression. However, the physical and anxious symptoms of depression can be serious and sometimes more prominent than the emotional symptoms of depression, especially among special populations such as women. New treatment strategies, such as dual-acting agents and the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, target the emotional and anxious symptoms of depression as well as symptoms associated with pain. In order to increase response and remission, depression should be seen as an illness comprising not only emotional symptoms but physical and anxious symptoms as well.

### Treatment-resistant depression as risk factor for substance use disorders-a nation-wide register-based cohort study [^243aa3f4]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and often recurrent condition with substantial consequences for both the individual and for society in terms of function loss, costs and premature death 1, 2. Far from all depressed individuals respond as intended to treatment, as 10–20% do not tolerate an initial treatment trial, and 25–60% of completers of an adequate trial do not achieve remission 3, 4, 5. During the last decades, several definitions of treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) have been proposed for clinical and research purposes, with a common denominator among them being at least two adequate treatment attempts without achieving remission 6, 7.

Substance use disorders (SUD) as defined by DSM‐5 are conditions in which the use of one or more psychoactive substances leads to a clinically significant impairment or distress 1, replacing the earlier diagnostic concepts of abuse, addiction and dependence. SUD may lead to various adverse mental, physical and economic outcomes, and account for 5% of the global burden of lost disability‐adjusted life‐years 8. In administrative data, the 12‐month prevalence of alcohol or drug dependence in MDD patients is estimated at approximately 12% 9, increasing by to up to 30% in clinical samples 10.

A wide range of studies show a temporal association from depression to SUD, but the relationship appears to be complex. Depression and other mental disorders often precede the presentation of SUDs, regardless of substance being used 11, 12. There is also evidence that the relationship may be temporally reversed or bidirectional, and that it may vary for different types of drug use and during different stages in life 12, 13, 14, 15. Antidepressant effect is generally lower when a comorbid SUD is present 16, 17, 18.

In recent years, several novel treatments for TRD have been introduced, including ketamine and hallucinogenic agents such as psilocybin and ayahuasca 19, 20, 21. Although the effect of these treatments may seem superior to current antidepressant medications, one of the unresolved issues regarding these treatments is their known potential for illicit substance use, and whether or not they can be offered safely to patients with or at risk for SUD 22.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^7c3c26aa]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Safety assessment — children and adolescents with depressive disorders: Safety risks, including but not limited to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, self-harm, risk-taking behaviors, and impulsivity, are assessed both at evaluation and during treatment and have been associated with depression and with antidepressant treatment, and depressive disorders suggest exploration of exposure to childhood adversities. In the case of abuse or neglect, reporting to the state child welfare authority is required, and information may need to be gathered from multiple sources using culturally and developmentally sensitive techniques. Assessment culminates in 2 basic questions — Is the patient at current risk? and Are the patient and family able to adhere to recommendations regarding supervision, safeguarding, and follow-up care? — and answers guide the appropriate level and intensity of care. Psychiatric hospitalization is likely indicated when the youth actively voices intent to harm, and in the context of altered mental status (including hopelessness, agitation, psychosis), multiple previous suicide attempts, previous unsuccessful treatment, and/or caregiver incapacity.

### Clinical differences among depressed patients with and without a history of suicide attempts: findings from the STAR*D trial [^75054cdf]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Background

This study sought to determine whether a history of suicide attempts among outpatients diagnosed with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) is correlated with any difference in clinical presentation that should influence patient care.

Methods

Baseline data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR()D) trial on outpatients with MDD treated in primary and specialty care settings were used to model significant demographic and clinical correlates of suicide attempter status.

Results

Altogether, 16.5% of participants (n = 667) reported prior suicide attempts. Controlling for age, gender, and depressive symptom severity, previous attempters had more current general medical conditions (micro = 3.2 vs. 2.9, p < .0001), more current alcohol/substance abuse (p < .0001), and more work hours missed in the past week (26.2% vs. 18.2%, p < .0001) than non-attempters. On average, for the previously suicidal, the onset of MDD occurred 8.9 years earlier in life (p < .0001) and had included 1.2 additional depressive episodes (p = 0.001) compared to those without prior suicidal behavior. Previous attempters also reported more current suicidal ideation (61.3% of previous attempters, adjusted OR 1.6, vs. 45.5% of nonattempters, p < .0001).

Limitations

Presence or absence of a history of suicide attempts was determined only through self report.

Conclusions

Those with a history of suicidal behavior suffer a greater burden of depressive illness. Earlier intervention and ongoing, aggressive care, including maintenance-phase pharmacotherapy, may be critical to mitigating the long-term consequences associated with this increased disease burden.

### Treating major depression: antidepressant algorithms [^f2011ad8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Clinicians currently have a large number of pharmaceutical options available for the treatment of depression, yet not one of these treatments is associated with especially high remission rates. Further complicating the treatment of depression is the fact that the more failed treatment trials a patient undergoes, the lower the odds that remission will be achieved. Therefore, choosing the drug that will be most effective for a particular patient early in the treatment process is essential. Antidepressant treatment algorithms are helpful in this regard.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^9a141412]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Scope of the problem — epidemiology and burden of major depression are highlighted: The Global Burden of Disease Study reported that major depression was the third leading cause of worldwide disability in 1990 and had risen to the second leading cause by 2013 both worldwide and in the United States. In the United States, approximately 6.7% to 7.6% of adults report an episode of major depression in a 12-month period, with women having approximately 1.7 times the risk; lifetime prevalence is estimated at 17.1%. The page also notes that first onset of major depressive disorder often occurs in late teens or early adulthood and that major depression is frequently comorbid with other mental health disorders, particularly anxiety disorders and substance use disorders.

### Switch to mania after acute antidepressant treatment for bipolar depression: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^18976e38]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although concerns regarding the use of antidepressants remain — particularly given the observed signals of increased switch risk with certain agents such as venlafaxine and imipramine — the absence of significant differences across treatments suggests that the risk of switching to mania may be more strongly influenced by patient-related factors than by pharmacological properties alone. This reinforces the need to understand for whom these treatments may be appropriate and how they should be used, in line with the principles of precision psychiatry. Several clinical factors have been identified as increasing the risk of antidepressant-induced mania. Younger age and early onset of illness have consistently been associated with a higher likelihood of switching, particularly in patients with a history of rapid cycling or severe manic symptoms. Comorbidities such as anxiety disorders, substance or alcohol use, and a history of suicidal behavior further elevate this risk. Moreover, patients with BD-I are at a higher risk for switching to (hypo)mania compared to those with BD-II. Additional risk factors include a prior history of antidepressant-induced switch, low response to previous antidepressant trials, and a history of rapid cycling.

A revision of the 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology evidence-based guidelines for treating depressive disorders with antidepressants was undertaken in order to incorporate new evidence and to update the recommendations where appropriate. A consensus meeting involving experts in depressive disorders and their management was held in September 2012. Key areas in treating depression were reviewed and the strength of evidence and clinical implications were considered. The guidelines were then revised after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. A literature review is provided which identifies the quality of evidence upon which the recommendations are made. These guidelines cover the nature and detection of depressive disorders, acute treatment with antidepressant drugs, choice of drug versus alternative treatment, practical issues in prescribing and management, next-step treatment, relapse prevention, treatment of relapse and stopping treatment. Significant changes since the last guidelines were published in 2008 include the availability of new antidepressant treatment options, improved evidence supporting certain augmentation strategies (drug and non-drug), management of potential long-term side effects, updated guidance for prescribing in elderly and adolescent populations and updated guidance for optimal prescribing. Suggestions for future research priorities are also made.

### How do you choose a second-line treatment option for depression? [^96562076]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A majority of patients with major depression do not remit or adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy. When response is insufficient, a diagnosis of depression and any comorbidities should be confirmed, treatment adherence should be established, and antidepressant dosages should be optimized as tolerated. If response is still insufficient, then implementing second-line treatment strategies is warranted. Second-line strategies of switching to or combining/augmenting the initial agent with one of a variety of antidepressant medications and/or psychotherapies improves remission rates, although no single approach or agent has demonstrated clear superiority over any other. Second-line treatment selections should be driven by safety considerations, patients' symptom profiles, and patient preference. Comorbid medical conditions, especially cardiac and cerebrovascular complications, and potential drug-drug interactions should be considered when making treatment decisions.

### The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^e92959ab]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

The PANDA study was a pragmatic, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of patients from 179 primary care surgeries in four UK cities (Bristol, Liverpool, London, and York). Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 18 to 74 years and there was uncertainty (from general practitioner [GP] and patient) about the possible benefit of an antidepressant. Use of clinical uncertainty as an entry criterion avoids diagnostic or severity criteria and leads to a sample that is more generalisable to the population currently receiving antidepressant medication. Clinical uncertainty relies upon variation between doctors in how they make decisions and, with a sufficient number of doctors, this variation in practice leads to a wide and heterogeneous group of participants in the trial, reflecting clinical equipoise within the field. In our case, because primary care physicians do not use standardised assessments of depression, we expected trial participants to have a range of depressive symptom severity. Clinical uncertainty is also the ethical basis for randomised controlled trials. Exclusion criteria were antidepressant treatment in past 8 weeks; comorbid psychosis, schizophrenia, mania, hypomania, bipolar disorder, dementia, eating disorder, or major alcohol or substance abuse; and medical contraindications for sertraline.

There were two methods of recruitment to the study. First, patients were referred during GP consultation. Second, GP practices searched computerised records for patients who presented with depression or depressive symptoms in the past two years. Patients were told that they had been referred to the study because their GP had identified them as having depression or low mood. A researcher then contacted patients by telephone to confirm eligibility. Since it was possible that some patients might not currently have depressive symptoms, researchers asked "firstly, I need to ask you do you want treatment for your depression at the moment?". If the answer was no, the patient was excluded. Before randomisation, the patient's GP was asked to approve inclusion in the trial and could exclude the patient if there was not clinical uncertainty.

All participants provided written informed consent. Ethics approval was from the National Research Ethics Service committee, East of England — Cambridge South (ref 13/EE/0418). The results presented here focus on the treatment effect of sertraline in primary care and are part of a larger research programme (NIHR RP-PG-0610-10048).

4.4 Pharmacological treatment for acute bipolar depression

Lithium, anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics, and other agents such as antidepressants have all been investigated for efficacy in managing bipolar depression. These treatments have been evaluated using the criteria for strength of evidence for efficacy (Table 1) as well as safety and tolerability (Section 8). Recommendations are summarized in Table 14.

Table 14
Hierarchical rankings of first and second‐line treatments recommended for management of acute bipolar I depression

4.4.1 Step 1: review general principles and assess medication status

Examination of a patient presenting in a depressed state should include an assessment of the nature and severity of depression and associated symptoms, risk of suicide/self‐harm behaviour, ability to adhere to a treatment plan, availability of a psychosocial support network, and functional impairment. Laboratory investigations (described in Section 8) should also be completed. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting (eg, ambulatory or inpatient), with consideration given to management of safety risks. Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a depressive episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to alcohol/drug use, medications, other treatments, or a general medical condition. Patients should be supported to discontinue stimulant use and limit nicotine, caffeine, drug, and alcohol use. Course of illness and treatments used in current and prior episodes should be assessed, including past response to and tolerability of specific medications and doses, and used to direct subsequent therapeutic choices. Consideration should be given to restarting medications if their recent discontinuation appeared to coincide with a depressive relapse.

Psychoeducation and other psychosocial strategies should also be offered alongside pharmacological treatment to promote ongoing medication adherence, reduce residual symptoms and suicidal behaviour, help identify early signs of relapse, and support functional recovery (see Section 2).

4.4.2 Step 2: initiate or optimize therapy and check adherence

It is recommended for all patients that pharmacotherapy be initiated with one or more of the available first‐line agents. The choice of agent or agents to manage an acute bipolar depressive episode should be discussed with the patient and their supporters (as appropriate) and take into account current and prior medication use and response, personal preference, and the safety and tolerability of each agent, as well as clinical features that may influence prognosis (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choices").

### Analysis of patient-reported outcomes of quality of life and functioning before and after treatment of major depressive disorder comorbid with alcohol use disorders [^d1d29bb0]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are common among persons with major depressive disorder (MDD) and have an adverse impact on course of illness and patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine whether AUD adversely impacted patient-centered outcomes in a sample of research subjects evaluated as part of a large clinical trial for depression. The outcomes of interest to this post hoc analysis are quality of life (QOL), functioning, and depressive symptom severity.

Methods

We analyzed 2280 adult MDD outpatient research subjects using data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial. We compared entry and post-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) treatment QOL, functioning, and depressive symptom severity scores between 121comorbid MDD with AUD (MDD+AUD) subjects and 2159 MDD-no-AUD subjects, and also differences between subjects categorized as remitters versus nonremitters within each group at exit.

Results

At entry, MDD+AUD subjects reported similar QOL, functioning, and depressive symptom severity compared with the MDD-no-AUD subjects. After treatment with citalopram, both groups showed significant improvements throughout treatment; however, 36% to 55% of subjects still suffered from severely impaired QOL and functioning at exit.

Conclusions

The overall study population demonstrated a significant response to treatment with large effect sizes in depressive symptom reduction, but to a lesser extent in QOL and functioning. Findings suggest that subjects with MDD+AUD benefited equally as MDD-no-AUD from treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) medication, yet both groups continue to experience reduced QOL and functioning after treatment. Monitoring QOL and functioning is critical to determine whether interventions that improve clinical outcomes also impact patient-centered outcomes, and our analysis suggests that there is a pressing need for innovative interventions that effectively improve these outcomes.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^5ef9a090]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Psychiatric disorders account for 22.8% of the global burden of diseases. The leading cause of this disability is depression, which has substantially increased since 1990, largely driven by population growth and ageing. With an estimated 350 million people affected globally, the economic burden of depressive disorders in the USA alone has been estimated to be more than US$210 billion, with approximately 45% attributable to direct costs, 5% to suicide-related costs, and 50% to workplace costs. This trend poses a substantial challenge for health systems in both developed and developing countries, with the need to treat patients, optimise resources, and improve overall health care in mental health.

Grouped into various classes of drugs with slightly different mechanisms of action, antidepressants are widely used treatments for major depressive disorder, which are available worldwide. However, there is a long-lasting debate and concern about their efficacy and effectiveness, because short-term benefits are, on average, modest; and because long-term balance of benefits and harms is often understudied. Therefore, innovation in psychopharmacology is of crucial importance, but the identification of new molecular targets is difficult, primarily because of the paucity of knowledge about how antidepressants work. In routine practice, clinicians have a wide choice of individual drugs and they need good evidence to make the best choice for each individual patient. Network meta-analyses of existing datasets make it possible to estimate comparative efficacy, summarise and interpret the wider picture of the evidence base, and to understand the relative merits of the multiple interventions. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to do a systematic review and network meta-analysis to inform clinical practice by comparing different antidepressants for the acute treatment of adults with unipolar major depressive disorder.

### The effect of sertraline on emotional processing: secondary analyses of the PANDA randomised controlled trial [^f5dd1d30]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

The PANDA trial ("what are the indications for Prescribing ANtiDepressAnts that will lead to a clinical benefit?") was a pragmatic multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial (Lewis et al; Salaminios et al.). The original aim of the trial was to test the clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration. The trial was registered with EudraCT, 2013-003440-22 (protocol number 13/0413; version 6.1) and ISRCTN (reference ISRCTN84544741).

Patients aged 18–74 years were recruited from 179 primary care practices in four UK sites (Bristol, Liverpool, London, York). Patients were eligible if there was uncertainty from both general practitioner (GP) and patient about the possible benefit of an antidepressant. We did not restrict eligibility by specifying lower or higher thresholds of depression severity but relied instead on clinical uncertainty, aiming to improve generalisability to the population receiving antidepressants in primary care. Exclusion criteria were: unable to understand or complete study questionnaires in English; antidepressant treatment in past 8 weeks; comorbid psychosis, schizophrenia, mania, hypomania, bipolar disorder, dementia, eating disorder, or major alcohol or substance abuse; and medical contraindications for sertraline. Further details of the methods and results have previously been published (Lewis et al; Salaminios et al.).

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^4bd8bdb2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder — diagnosis, severity, and comorbidity are described as follows: Major depressive disorder is defined as the presence of a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities that occurs along with at least 4 additional diagnostic criteria or symptoms for at least 2 weeks and causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Based on severity of symptoms, functional impairment, and level of patient distress, MDD can be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe. One third of patients with MDD have severe MDD, which is associated with more difficulty in achieving treatment response and remission. In addition, about 75% of people with MDD also have a co-occurring anxiety disorder, which can make their symptoms worse and recovery more difficult.

3.3.1 Step 1: review general principles and assess medication status

Examination of a patient presenting in a manic state should include an immediate assessment for risk of aggressive behaviour, violence and safety threat to others, suicide risk especially in those with mixed features, degree of insight and the ability to adhere to treatment, comorbidity (including substance use that may be aggravating or contributing to clinical presentation), and availability of a psychosocial support network. A physical examination with laboratory investigations (described in Section 8) should be conducted, but may be deferred for patients who are uncooperative. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting (eg, ambulatory or inpatient).

Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a manic episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to drugs of abuse, medications, other treatments, or a general medical or neurological condition (although, even in these cases, symptomatic treatment may be applied on a short‐term basis). Steps should be taken to rule out any other factors that may be perpetuating symptoms such as prescribed medication, illicit drug use/abuse or an endocrine disorder. Any patients presenting with mania who have been taking antidepressants should have these medications discontinued. If there is a previous diagnosis of BD, it is appropriate to immediately commence antimanic agents. If this is the first emergence of manic symptoms, clinicians are advised to confirm the diagnosis of BD by monitoring patients for a period of time after antidepressant discontinuation and obtain collateral information to confirm whether symptoms remain and antimanic treatment is necessary. Patients should also be supported to discontinue stimulant use, including caffeine and alcohol. Current and prior therapies should be assessed, including appropriateness of medications, dosing, and trough serum levels (where indicated), as well as past response; and this should be used to direct subsequent therapeutic choices. Attention should be paid to managing withdrawal symptoms that may occur in manic patients with histories of substance abuse.

When the symptoms of mania have remitted, behavioural and educational strategies should be applied to promote ongoing medication adherence, reduce residual symptoms, help identify early signs of relapse, and support functional recovery (see Section 2).

3.3.2 Step 2: initiate or optimize therapy and check adherence

It is recommended that, for all patients (including those who are untreated as well as those receiving a non‐first‐line treatment), therapy be initiated with one of the available first‐line monotherapy or combination treatments.

### Independent versus substance-induced major depressive disorder in substance-dependent patients: observational study of course during follow-up [^16d6e63c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Clinicians frequently encounter patients presenting with both depression and substance abuse, and their diagnosis has been a source of controversy. The authors examined whether baseline and past diagnoses of DSM-IV primary (independent) or substance-induced depression or other psychiatric syndromes predict 1-year course of depression in substance-dependent patients.

Method

Inpatients with current DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) and DSM-IV alcohol, cocaine, or opiate dependence (N = 110) were evaluated with the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM) and followed for 12 months after discharge. Logistic regression for repeated measures modeled the odds of MDD and depressed mood over time as a function of baseline diagnoses and past independent depression, controlling for demographics, substance use, and antidepressant treatment during the follow-up. Subject recruitment was conducted from July 25, 1995 to May 14, 1997.

Results

Over the 12 months, 88% of the patients experienced depressed mood for at least 1 week, and 57% experienced MDD. Depression during follow-up was equally likely among patients with current (baseline) DSM-IV independent or substance-induced MDD; in the latter group, past independent MDD increased the likelihood of MDD during the follow-up. Panic attacks, posttraumatic stress disorder (trend), borderline personality, and antisocial personality also significantly predicted depression during the follow-up.

Conclusions

In substance-dependent patients, both DSM-IV primary and substance-induced MDD predict future depression, warranting consideration for specific treatment. The data suggest the importance of a careful psychiatric history that includes attention to past episodes of independent depression as well as anxiety and cluster B personality syndromes.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder [^56e3e4c6]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians screen adults for alcohol misuse and provide persons engaged in risky or hazardous drinking behaviors with brief behavioral counseling to reduce alcohol misuse. However, only a minority of American adults with high-risk alcohol use receive treatment. Three medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat alcohol use disorder: acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone. Acamprosate and naltrexone reduce alcohol consumption and increase abstinence rates, although the effects appear to be modest. Disulfiram has been used for years, but evidence supporting its effectiveness is inconsistent. Other medications may be beneficial to reduce heavy alcohol use. The anticonvulsants topiramate and gabapentin may reduce alcohol ingestion, although long-term studies are lacking. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients without mood disorders, but sertraline and fluoxetine may help depressed patients decrease alcohol ingestion. Ondansetron may reduce alcohol use, particularly in selected subpopulations. Further study is needed for genetically targeted or as-needed medications to reduce alcohol use.

### Pharmacotherapeutic treatment strategies for antidepressant nonresponse [^549c9d5f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Patients who do not respond to initial antidepressant treatment are more difficult to treat and have lower odds of remission than those who fully or partially respond to initial pharmacotherapy. Potential treatment options for nonresponders include combination and switching strategies, both of which can be done within a single class of medications or across medication classes. Choosing the correct strategy and appropriate pharmaceutical option or options requires consideration of not only algorithm recommendations, but also a variety of variables including, but not limited to, the patient's symptom and side effect profiles.

### Nonpharmacologic versus pharmacologic treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^04c9190a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — key questions on comparative effectiveness and harms in major depressive disorder (MDD) specify: for adults attempting initial treatment, the effectiveness of SGA monotherapy compared with nonpharmacologic monotherapy or combination therapy (Key Question 1a) and whether comparative effectiveness varies by MDD severity (1b); for adults who did not achieve remission after an initial adequate trial with 1 SGA, the comparative effectiveness of second-line therapies (2a) and whether comparative effectiveness varies by MDD severity (2b); the comparative risks for harms for those attempting initial treatment or those who did not achieve remission after an initial adequate trial with an SGA (3a) and whether comparative risks vary by MDD severity (3b); and whether benefits and risks differ by subgroups defined by psychiatric symptoms or demographics (4). The Clinical Guidelines Committee was particularly interested in comparative effectiveness of treatment according to MDD severity because screening is becoming more widespread and may increase diagnosis of milder MDD.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^dd11a477]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — Recommendation 3 for patients not responding to a second-generation antidepressant states: ACP suggests one of the following options for patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder who did not respond to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant: Switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence); Switching to a different second-generation antidepressant (conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence); Switching to a second-generation antidepressant from a different pharmacologic treatment (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision on the options should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.

### Depression and suicide ideation in chronic hepatitis C patients untreated and treated with interferon: prevalence, prevention, and treatment [^fc506587]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Psychiatric management of CHC patients treated with IFN-α

Psychiatric disorders occurring during IFN-α therapy, mostly major depressive disorders, may lead to suicide ideation and/or suicide attempts; this is why a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including depression assessment scales or criteria, namely International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), are required before the initiation of IFN therapy to identify high-risk patients. Predictive factors for IFN-α-induced depression include: personal history of depressive disorder, family history of psychiatric disorders, early onset of symptoms (sleep disturbance, loss of appetite), baseline stress, lack of social support, depression during previous IFN treatment, and increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukins -10 and -6, and tumor necrosis factor-receptor-1).

The ELPA (European Liver Patient's Organization) organized a European expert conference (2011 EASL meeting) to review the medical literature concerning the management of psychiatric disorders in CHC patients and to develop expert recommendations. It is recommended to perform a detailed psychiatric evaluation of CHC patients prior to introducing IFN-α therapy, which includes personal history of psychiatric comorbidity, addictive behavior, previous suicide attempts, and psychosocial functioning; it is also required to inform the patient about the neuropsychiatric adverse events likely to occur during IFN-α therapy. Close monitoring should be performed every 4, 12 weeks, or even more frequently (every 2–4 weeks) when required (new-onset mood disorders, drug/alcohol abuse, personal history of psychiatric comorbidity). Considering that suicide risk is the highest during first 12 weeks of therapy, closer follow up is recommended during this interval.

The pharmacological management of adverse events depends on the time when they occur. Sleep disturbance, as a risk factor for depressive symptoms occurrence, requires early therapeutic management. Data shows that 10–14% of patients discontinue IFN-α therapy because of fatigue, mood disorders, and sleep disturbance. Regarding the efficacy of the antidepressants, studies have shown that selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy decreased the severity of depressive symptoms by 50%, with an antidepressant treatment response rate of more than 85% after 5–6 weeks of therapy. It is also recommended that antidepressant therapy to continue 6 to 12 weeks after IFN-α cessation therapy because of the risk of depressive disorders, suicide ideation or cognitive disorders recurrence. However, initiation of antidepressant therapy should consider drug-drug interactions, underlying hepatic function, the possibility of drug induced hepatotoxicity and other adverse side effects.

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in America and Europe [^f617bda4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The various major American and European guidelines for the treatment of depression provide similar basic principles of treatment, which include individualizing the treatment plan, preparing the patient for potential long-term treatment, providing measurement-based care, and treating to remission. While the guidelines are all evidence-based, certain factors can influence differences in specific recommendations, such as the consensus group's composition, underlying mandates, and cultural attitudes. The similarities and differences among 6 sets of guidelines from Europe and the Americas published in the past decade are reviewed here (American Psychiatric Association, British Association for Psychopharmacology, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry). In the guidelines, mild depression has the most variance in treatment recommendations; some, but not all, guidelines suggest that it may resolve with exercise or watchful waiting, but psychotherapy or antidepressants could be used if initial efforts fail. Moderate and severe major depression carry broadly similar recommendations among the guidelines. First-line treatment recommendations for moderate major depressive disorder include antidepressant monotherapy, psychotherapy, and the combination of both. Severe depression may require the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy, or the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy. Benzodiazepines play a very limited role in the treatment of depression; if the patient has catatonic depression, acutely suicidal depression, or depression with symptoms of anxiety, agitation, or insomnia, benzodiazepines are recommended by some guidelines for short-term treatment only.

### Which factors influence psychiatrists' selection of antidepressants? [^983488bc]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

There is little empirical evidence to guide clinicians in choosing among the diverse array of antidepressants available. In the absence of replicated empirical research guiding the selection of antidepressants, it is of interest to examine what factors psychiatrists consider when prescribing antidepressants.

Method

For 1,137 depressed patients who received a new antidepressant prescription, the treating psychiatrist completed a 43-item questionnaire listing factors that might have influenced the choice of antidepressant medication. The questionnaire was filled out immediately after an antidepressant was prescribed to treat a depressive disorder.

Results

The most common factors influencing antidepressant selection were the avoidance of specific side effects, the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders, and the presence of specific clinical symptoms. Prior treatment history, including prior positive or failed response to a drug, was the next most frequently endorsed factor influencing medication choice. Some factors that have been commonly discussed in the literature, such as concern about discontinuation syndrome and drug-drug interactions, rarely influenced antidepressant selection.

Conclusions

Because relatively little research has examined clinical features associated with differential response to the newer generation of antidepressants, a study of psychiatrists' prescribing practices highlights priorities for future controlled research. Our results suggest that two priority areas are the treatment of depression with coexisting anxiety symptoms/anxiety disorders and the influence of particular symptoms on response to different medications.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^491327ac]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — treatment approaches for moderate to severe MDD state that monotherapy with either CBT or an SGA, or combination therapy with CBT and an SGA, are reasonable approaches to initial treatment of patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe MDD; however, approximately up to 70% of patients with MDD do not achieve remission after initial pharmacologic treatment with an SGA, and it is important to take an individualized approach using shared decision making because there may be variability in patient preferences.
