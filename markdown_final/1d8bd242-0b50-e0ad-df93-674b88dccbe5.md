## Question

How to treat enterococcus faecium in the clinic setting?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat Enterococcus faecium infections in the clinic setting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's resistance profile and why it matters. Then, I should verify the infection site and severity, because therapy differs for bacteremia, endocarditis, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, and CNS disease. Next, I will review first-line and alternative agents, dosing nuances, and the role of combination therapy. After that, I need to check special populations and stewardship considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight evidence gaps that could change practice, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and resistance landscape. E. faecium is a leading healthcare-associated pathogen with intrinsic ampicillin resistance and a high prevalence of vancomycin resistance, particularly among hospital-adapted strains, which constrains options and worsens outcomes in bloodstream infection and endocarditis, so I need to keep both species and resistance phenotype front and center when choosing therapy [^b94b44b3] [^aee57661] [^c9f23b5d].

> I will now examine the infection site and severity, because treatment hinges on them. For bacteremia without endocarditis, I should confirm duration and source control. For endocarditis, I need to check for prosthetic material and plan for prolonged therapy. For urinary tract infection, I should verify whether it is catheter-associated or complicated. For intra-abdominal infection, I need to distinguish community-acquired from healthcare-associated. For CNS infection, I must consider blood–brain barrier penetration and the need for intrathecal therapy. And for skin and soft tissue infection, I should confirm whether it is uncomplicated or complicated and whether VRE is likely [^e6a080f0] [^940da362] [^8528b5a5].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium bacteremia. Wait, let me verify the comparative data. Multiple meta-analyses and large cohorts suggest linezolid may outperform daptomycin for VRE-BSI, but I need to be cautious because these are observational and confounded; nonetheless, linezolid 600 mg IV or orally every 12 hours is FDA-approved for VREfm including bacteremia, and I should ensure duration is typically 14–28 days depending on source control and clinical response [^c7ec6073] [^92b85938] [^c83a1964] [^2fb3a73a].

> Hold on, I should verify daptomycin dosing and MIC issues. High-dose daptomycin at 10–12 mg/kg/day is commonly used off-label for VREfm bacteremia, but EUCAST cautions that even these doses may be inadequate for isolates at the high end of wild-type MICs, and CLSI moved to a susceptible-dose dependent breakpoint of ≤ 4 μg/mL with dosing 8–12 mg/kg/day, so I need to check the MIC and consider combination therapy if the MIC is 3–4 μg/mL or if there is persistent bacteremia [^aa03a23c] [^3b05de4a] [^f6dab7c5].

> Let me consider combination strategies when response is suboptimal or MICs are high. Ampicillin or ceftriaxone combined with daptomycin has in vitro synergy and is supported by endocarditis guidance for difficult enterococcal infections; I should confirm that this is particularly relevant for persistent bacteremia or high-daptomycin MICs, and I need to ensure we avoid nephrotoxic combinations when possible [^eee9500d] [^17879701].

> For vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium, I should double-check whether ampicillin is ever active. Most E. faecium are intrinsically ampicillin-resistant, so vancomycin remains reasonable if susceptible, though I must remember that many isolates are now VRE; if ampicillin happens to be active by rare susceptibility, it can be used, but I should not rely on that assumption in empiric planning [^85afa494].

> Now, for endocarditis due to multidrug-resistant E. faecium, I need to ensure duration and options are aligned with guidelines. Linezolid for at least 6 weeks is a Class IIb option, and high-dose daptomycin 10–12 mg/kg/day for at least 6 weeks is another Class IIb option. Importantly, the 2023 ESC guideline recommends vancomycin 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses plus gentamicin 3 mg/kg/day once daily for 2 weeks for β-lactam–resistant enterococcal endocarditis, which applies to many E. faecium cases, and I should coordinate with cardiology and cardiac surgery early [^eee9500d] [^940da362].

> For urinary tract infection due to VREfm, I should confirm urinary excretion profiles. Daptomycin has 50–70% urinary excretion and has shown success in small case series, making it a reasonable option for complicated VRE UTIs; linezolid has lower urinary excretion but can still be used when daptomycin is unsuitable, and I should remember to address catheters or obstruction to improve clearance [^db6409bf] [^66cc1bbf] [^4dd55ae8].

> For intra-abdominal infection, let me verify when to add enterococcal coverage. In healthcare-associated or high-risk intra-abdominal infection, guidelines suggest empiric coverage for E. faecium, often with vancomycin if susceptible or linezolid or daptomycin if VRE risk is high; I should tailor to local epidemiology and de-escalate promptly when cultures return [^743a2f62] [^40e2a8d4] [^aeac151a].

> For CNS infections, I need to check penetration and delivery. Linezolid achieves CSF concentrations and has the most supportive case-series evidence for VREfm meningitis or ventriculitis, while daptomycin has poor CSF penetration and generally requires intrathecal or intraventricular administration when used; I should coordinate with neurosurgery for device management and consider combination therapy in severe cases [^1382c19b] [^b9b4d808].

> For skin and soft tissue infection, I should confirm whether VRE is likely. Linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours IV or orally is reasonable for complicated infections when VRE is suspected or confirmed, with daptomycin as an alternative; I need to ensure adequate source control and consider wound care and surgical debridement when indicated [^8528b5a5].

> Special populations require extra caution. In pediatrics, linezolid is FDA-approved for VREfm and dosed at 10 mg/kg every 8 hours IV or orally, with vancomycin plus gentamicin for β-lactam–resistant enterococcal endocarditis per ESC guidance; in pregnancy, data are limited and decisions should be individualized with maternal–fetal medicine and ID input; in renal failure, daptomycin dosing is unchanged but I should monitor CPK, and linezolid does not require renal adjustment but I must watch for myelosuppression with prolonged use [^3914287c] [^91d21da8] [^c83a1964].

> I should confirm stewardship and monitoring steps. Early source control, repeat blood cultures to document clearance, and ID consultation improve outcomes in enterococcal bacteremia; susceptibility testing should guide de-escalation, and I need to monitor for linezolid-associated hematologic toxicity with weekly CBC and for daptomycin-related myopathy with CPK if therapy extends beyond a week or if symptoms arise [^e6a080f0] [^c0de247a].

> But wait, what about emerging options and evidence gaps. Oritavancin has potent in vitro activity against VREfm but lacks robust clinical data for deep infections, and lefamulin shows activity including VREfm in skin infection trials; accelerated endocarditis therapy is being studied, and ongoing debates about linezolid versus daptomycin for VRE-BSI underscore the need for randomized trials, so I should document outcomes and consider clinical trials when available [^b688463b] [^57064c2e] [^d644a1a8] [^c7ec6073].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. If E. faecium is VRE, I favor linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours IV or orally for most sites, using high-dose daptomycin 10–12 mg/kg/day if linezolid is contraindicated or failing, and adding ampicillin or ceftriaxone to daptomycin for persistent bacteremia or high MICs; if E. faecium is vancomycin-susceptible, vancomycin is reasonable, though many isolates are ampicillin-resistant; for endocarditis, I extend therapy to 6 weeks and involve surgery early when indicated; for UTI, I prioritize daptomycin; for CNS disease, I prefer linezolid and consider intrathecal daptomycin if needed; throughout, I ensure source control, monitor for toxicity, and adjust based on cultures and clinical response [^c83a1964] [^aa03a23c] [^eee9500d] [^940da362] [^e6a080f0].

Treat Enterococcus faecium infections using **ampicillin or vancomycin if susceptible** [^726a3cfa], with **linezolid or daptomycin for VRE** [^c83a1964] [^aa03a23c]. For severe infections (e.g. endocarditis, persistent bacteremia), use **combination therapy** (e.g. ampicillin plus gentamicin for synergy) [^940da362] or high-dose daptomycin (10–12 mg/kg/day) with or without a beta-lactam [^eee9500d] [^17879701]. Tailor therapy to site of infection, renal function, and susceptibilities; monitor for adverse effects (e.g. hematologic toxicity with linezolid, myopathy with daptomycin) [^c83a1964] [^aa03a23c]. Early source control and infectious diseases consultation improve outcomes [^e6a080f0].

## Antibiotic susceptibility and resistance patterns

E. faecium has **intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams** (except ampicillin) and frequently acquires resistance to vancomycin (VRE) [^b94b44b3], complicating therapy [^85afa494]. Susceptibility testing is essential to guide therapy [^c0de247a].

| **Antibiotic** | **Intrinsic resistance** | **Acquired resistance** |
|-|-|-|
| Ampicillin | Rare | Common |
| Vancomycin | None | Common (VRE) |
| Gentamicin (high-level) | None | Common |
| Linezolid | None | Rare |
| Daptomycin | None | Emerging |

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy

### Susceptible isolates

- **Ampicillin**: First-line for susceptible E. faecium [^notfound]; use high-dose continuous infusion for severe infections.
- **Vancomycin**: Use if ampicillin is unsuitable or resistance is present [^726a3cfa].

---

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE)

- **Linezolid**: 600 mg IV/PO every 12 hours; FDA-approved for VRE [^c83a1964] [^2fb3a73a].
- **Daptomycin**: 10–12 mg/kg IV daily; consider for bacteremia or endocarditis [^aa03a23c] [^17879701].
- **Tigecycline**: Alternative for multidrug-resistant infections; limited evidence [^85afa494].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy is recommended for **severe infections** (e.g. endocarditis, persistent bacteremia) [^940da362]:

- **Ampicillin + gentamicin**: Synergistic for endocarditis; monitor nephrotoxicity [^940da362].
- **High-dose daptomycin + beta-lactam**: Ampicillin or ceftriaxone for persistent bacteremia [^eee9500d] [^17879701].
- **Linezolid + daptomycin**: Consider for refractory infections [^b9b4d808].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Source control**: Remove infected devices, drain abscesses, and manage complications [^e6a080f0].
- **Renal function**: Adjust dosing for renal impairment, especially for vancomycin and daptomycin [^notfound].
- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for hematologic toxicity (linezolid), myopathy (daptomycin), and nephrotoxicity (gentamicin) [^c83a1964] [^aa03a23c].

---

## Emerging therapies and novel approaches

- **Oritavancin**: Promising for VRE; limited clinical data [^b688463b].
- **Fosfomycin**: IV formulation under study for multidrug-resistant E. faecium [^1bcae2cb].
- **Phage therapy**: Investigational and not yet clinically available [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

VRE infections have **higher mortality** than vancomycin-susceptible strains, especially in immunocompromised patients [^c9f23b5d]. Early appropriate therapy and source control improve outcomes [^a6e863e8].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended therapy** |
|-|-|
| Susceptible E. faecium | Ampicillin or vancomycin |
| VRE infection | Linezolid or daptomycin |
| Severe infection (endocarditis, persistent bacteremia) | Combination therapy (e.g. ampicillin + gentamicin or high-dose daptomycin + beta-lactam) |
| Renal impairment | Adjust dosing accordingly |
| Refractory infection | Linezolid + daptomycin |

---

Effective management of E. faecium requires **individualized therapy** based on susceptibilities, infection site, and patient factors, with early source control and close monitoring for adverse effects [^e6a080f0].

### A review of combination antimicrobial therapy for Enterococcus faecalis bloodstream infections and infective endocarditis [^fd4c9b3f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Enterococci, one of the most common causes of hospital-associated infections, are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Enterococcus faecalis, the more common and virulent species, causes serious high-inoculum infections, namely infective endocarditis, that are associated with cardiac surgery and mortality rates that remained unchanged for the last 30 years. The best cures for these infections are observed with combination antibiotic therapy; however, optimal treatment has not been fully elucidated. It is the purpose of this review to highlight treatment options and their limitations, and provide direction for future investigative efforts to aid in the treatment of these severe infections. While ampicillin plus ceftriaxone has emerged as a preferred treatment option, mortality rates continue to be high, and from a safety standpoint, ceftriaxone, unlike other cephalosporins, promotes colonization with vancomycin resistant-enterococci due to high biliary concentrations. More research is needed to improve patient outcomes from this high-mortality disease.

### Management of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections [^85afa494]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Enterococci are organisms with a remarkable ability to adapt to the environment and acquire antibiotic resistance determinants. The evolution of antimicrobial resistance in these organisms poses enormous challenges for clinicians when faced with patients affected with severe infections. The increased prevalence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium worldwide has resulted in a major decrease in therapeutic options because the majority of E. faecium isolates are now resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin, and exhibit high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, which are three of the traditionally most useful anti-enterococcal antibiotics. Newer antibiotics such as linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have good in vitro activity against enterococcal isolates, although their clinical use may be limited in certain clinical scenarios as a result of reduced rates of success, possible underdosing for enterococci and low serum levels, respectively, and also by the emergence of resistance. The experimental agent oritavancin may offer some hope for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci but clinical data are still lacking. Thus, optimal therapies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections continue to be based on empirical observations and extrapolations from in vitro and animal data. Clinical studies evaluating new strategies, including combination therapies, to treat severe vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections are urgently needed.

### The need for new therapeutic agents: what is the pipeline? [^e4cc9969]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

There is a clinical need for new treatment options for serious Gram-positive infections. Recently introduced agents such as the newer fluoroquinolones and the ketolide telithromycin have limited use as they do not cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE). The clinical use of the streptogramin combination quinupristin/dalfopristin, which has activity against MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, is limited because administration is via a slow infusion of a large volume. The oxazolidinone linezolid is active against MRSA and GRE but resistant organisms and treatment failures have been reported. A number of compounds currently in development show promise, the new glycopeptides oritavancin, dalbavancin and the glycolipodepsipeptide ramoplanin, as well as the new tetracyclines tigecycline and BAY73-7388. However, in some cases, there is concern that resistance may develop quickly to new compounds that are based on existing antimicrobial agents. Therefore daptomycin, a novel lipopeptide with a unique mode of action, is of particular interest. Daptomycin is active against MRSA (including vancomycin-resistant strains) and GRE. Daptomycin displays rapid concentration-dependent killing and is bactericidal even in the stationary phase of growth. Daptomycin-resistant strains are very difficult to generate in vitro. A dosage of 4 mg/kg intravenous once a day has been shown to be efficacious in two evaluator-blinded trials of complicated skin and soft tissue infections with clinical success rates similar for daptomycin and comparators (vancomycin or penicillinase-resistant penicillins). With its activity against key Gram-positive pathogens, including resistant strains, daptomycin has potential as a valuable addition to the available treatment options for serious Gram-positive infections.

### Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for enterococci [^c0de247a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Enterococci are major, recalcitrant nosocomial pathogens with a wide repertoire of intrinsic and acquired resistance determinants and the potential of developing resistance to all clinically available antimicrobials. As such, multidrug-resistant enterococci are considered a serious public health threat. Due to limited treatment options and rapid emergence of resistance to all novel agents, the clinical microbiology laboratory plays a critical role in deploying accurate, reproducible, and feasible antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods to guide appropriate treatment of patients with deep-seated enterococcal infections. In this review, we provide an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of existing manual and automated methods that test susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis to β-lactams, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, lipoglycopeptides, oxazolidinones, novel tetracycline-derivatives, and daptomycin. We also identify unique problems and gaps with the performance and clinical utility of antimicrobial susceptibility testing for enterococci, provide recommendations for clinical laboratories to circumvent select problems, and address potential future innovations that can bridge major gaps in susceptibility testing.

### New antimicrobial agents for use in the intensive care unit [^5100817b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Timely provision of adequate antimicrobial coverage in an initial anti-infective treatment regimen results in optimal outcomes for bacterial and fungal infections. However, selection of appropriate antimicrobial regimens for treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging due to expansion of resistance, which typically requires use of multidrug anti-infective regimens to provide adequate coverage of important pathogens commonly seen in the ICU setting. Indeed, a recent additional call to action by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has enforced the impact that antimicrobial-resistant pathogens can have on patient care. The term ESKAPE has been coined by this IDSA group to refer to Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, the etiologic causes of the majority of hospital-acquired infections in the United States that are able to effectively "escape" our antibiotic arsenal and that also mandate discovery of new antimicrobial agents. This article reviews select antibacterial agents and an antifungal agent in late stages of clinical development that appear to have potential for treatment of infections in the ICU.

### Daptomycin in the treatment of enterococcal bloodstream infections and endocarditis: a EUCAST position paper [^aa03a23c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Scope

This position paper describes the view adopted by EUCAST on the role of daptomycin in the treatment of serious infections caused by Enterococcus species.

Background

High-dose daptomycin is considered effective in the treatment of enterococcal bloodstream infection (BSI) and endocarditis, although published clinical experience with the latter condition is limited.

Methods

EUCAST reviewed the available published data on pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD), resistance selection, clinical efficacy and safety for the use of 10–12 mg/kg/day of daptomycin for these conditions, noting that the doses licensed by the European Medicines Agency are only 4–6 mg/kg/day, and only for infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

Findings and Recommendations

The PK-PD evidence shows that, even with doses of 10–12 mg/kg/day, it is not possible to treat infections caused by isolates at the upper end of the wild-type distributions of Enterococcus faecalis (with MICs of 4 mg/L) and E. faecium (with MICs of 4 or 8 mg/L). For this reason, and because there are ongoing issues with the reliability of laboratory testing, EUCAST lists daptomycin breakpoints for Enterococcus species as "IE"-insufficient evidence. EUCAST advises increased vigilance in the use of high-dose of daptomycin to treat enterococcal BSI and endocarditis. Additional PK-PD studies and prospective efficacy and safety studies of serious Enterococcal infections treated with high-dose daptomycin may permit the setting of breakpoints in the future.

### Editorial commentary: linezolid vs daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant enterococci: the evidence gap between trials and clinical experience [^c7ec6073]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections due to vancomycin-resistant enterococcal species (VRE-BSI) can be a lethal complication for hospitalized patients. VRE-BSI principally affects vulnerable patient populations, including complex postsurgical and internal medicine patients with multiple comorbid conditions. VRE-BSI has particularly high attributable mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, liver transplant recipients, oncology patients, and other critically ill hospitalized populations.

Despite the high human and economic burden of VRE-BSI, the optimal treatment for these infections has not been established, and due to the fact that most enterococcal isolates (ie, E. faecium) are multidrug-resistant, clinicians are often faced with no reliable therapeutic options in critically ill patients. Linezolid is the only drug specifically approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of VRE-BSI. However, studies leading to approval were based on limited data in an era where even fewer treatment options were available. Two phase-III clinical trials for VRE-BSI were started but were subsequently aborted due to enrollment difficulties. Additionally, there have been concerns that linezolid may not be optimal in deep-seated VRE infections. Linezolid is a bacteriostatic agent, and its activity may not be ideal for patients with severe VRE infections including those with infective endocarditis and other endovascular infections. Furthermore, linezolid toxicity when administered for prolonged courses may limit its use in VRE endocarditis.

Due to the above issues and despite lacking FDA approval for VRE infections, daptomycin (DAP, a lipopeptide antibiotic with in vitro bactericidal activity against VRE) has become a first-line agent to treat severe VRE infections. Although robust clinical evidence for the use of daptomycin for this indication is lacking, its in vitro profile and perceived clinical success has made DAP attractive for clinicians. However, the use of DAP for these infections have several caveats including, (i) emergence of resistance during therapy, (ii) the presence of mutations associated with DAP-resistance in isolates that are currently reported as DAP "susceptible" (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] 3–4 µg/mL, breakpoint 4 µg/mL) that may jeopardize DAP clinical utility as monotherapy, and (iii) the optimal DAP dosing for VRE infections has not been established with some in vitro data suggesting that doses of 10–12 mg/kg should be used to prevent development of resistance, a notion that is also supported by some clinical data indicating better outcomes with higher doses.

### Management of serious nosocomial bacterial infections: do current therapeutic options meet the need? [^54537153]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired bacterial infections pose a formidable challenge for healthcare providers, as patients often need to be treated empirically, at least initially, although delay of appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy is known to increase morbidity significantly and to increase mortality among affected patients. This elevated risk is compounded by the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Prompt initiation of treatment with an appropriate antimicrobial agent that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms is prudent for patients with nosocomial infections. As the continued usefulness of vancomycin comes into question, the number of alternative agents that provide efficacy equal to that of vancomycin remains limited. The development of novel and effective alternative agents, such as tigecycline, is therefore important.

### Treatment considerations for CNS infections caused by vancomycin-resistant: a focused review of linezolid and daptomycin [^1382c19b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the current literature describing pharmacology, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), efficacy, and safety of linezolid and daptomycin for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) faecium.

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE databases was conducted (from 1950 to April 2020) utilizing the following key terms: vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, VRE, meningitis, ventriculitis, CNS infection, daptomycin, and linezolid.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All relevant studies and case reports describing the treatment of VRE faecium from the CNS with linezolid or daptomycin were included.

Data Synthesis

A total of 17 reports describing 22 cases were identified. There were 15 of 19 cases involving linezolid that reported clinical cure, of which 53.3% were monotherapy. Only 5 of 9 cases involving intravenous (IV) daptomycin resulted in cure; all 4 cases reporting daptomycin administration via the intrathecal or intraventricular route achieved clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

The preferred treatment option for VRE faecium infections involving the CNS remains unclear. Supporting evidence through observational case reports have described varying outcomes with linezolid and daptomycin. This review compares reported outcomes between the 2 agents and provides a thorough discussion on drug- and patient-specific variables to consider.

Conclusions

Linezolid monotherapy appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of susceptible-VRE faecium CNS infections, with consideration of therapeutic drug monitoring in special populations and with prolonged treatment duration. Daptomycin is an effective treatment option via intrathecal or intraventricular administration when neurosurgical access is available. The role of IV daptomycin remains inconclusive.

### Development of daptomycin susceptibility breakpoints for Enterococcus faecium and revision of the breakpoints for other enterococcal species by the clinical and laboratory standards institute [^3b05de4a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Daptomycin is one of the few treatment options for infections caused by enterococci that are resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The emergence and clinical significance of daptomycin-resistant enterococci and evolving microbiologic, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic, and clinical data indicated that the pre-2019 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) susceptible-only breakpoint of ≤ 4 μg/mL for daptomycin and enterococci was no longer appropriate. After analyzing data that are outlined in this article, the CLSI Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing established new breakpoints for daptomycin and enterococci. For E. faecium, a susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) breakpoint of ≤ 4 μg/mL was established based on an increased dosage of 8–12 mg/kg/day (≥ 8 μg/mL-resistant). CLSI suggests infectious diseases consultation to guide daptomycin use for the SDD category. For Enterococcus faecalis and other enterococcal species, revised breakpoints of ≤ 2 μg/mL-susceptible, 4 μg/mL-intermediate, and ≥ 8 μg/mL-resistant were established based on a standard dosage of 6 mg/kg/day.

### Antimicrobial combination therapy for treatment of Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia (microEFfAECT) [^3156e828]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial Combination Therapy for Treatment of Enterococcus Faecalis Bacteremia ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Enterococcus faecalis is a common commensal of human gastrointestinal tract that can act as opportunistic pathogen causing mild to severe clinical illness. Severe infections due to EF include bacteremia, endocarditis and catheter-related infections. EF is the fourth causative pathogen of bloodstream infection in Europe after E. coli, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. The optimal treatment of EF-BSI uncomplicated with endocarditis is still a matter of debate. Ampicillin is commonly considered the drug of choice, when active in vitro. However, several studies demonstrated the synergistic effect of the combination treatment with an aminoglycosides or ceftriaxone in case of life-threatening infections.

To date the efficacy of the combination treatment in patients with EF-BSI was poorly evaluated in clinical studies and most of the data come from very old uncontrolled clinical observations. One strategy for overcoming this uncertainty is to assess the synergistic interaction of different antimicrobial molecules by in vitro tests and to validate in vitro synergisms with clinical studies. Indeed, in vitro evaluation of the drug combination effect has the potentiality for improving treatment by suggesting the possible synergistic or antagonistic interaction of antimicrobial associations. Although, different studies suggested the potential clinical utility of synergy testing, the real prognostic value of these methods is not defined yet. In this context, synergy testing could be used as strategy for improving antibiotic treatment of EF-BSI by suggesting the optimal antimicrobial combination therapy.

The primary aim of the study is to compare efficacy of appropriate monotherapy vs combination treatment for EF-BSI and validate clinically the in vitro synergistic/antagonistic interaction of antimicrobial combinations by synergy tests. Secondary objectives are:

- Adult
- Monomicrobial EF-BSI
- Receipt of ≥ 5 days of at least one in vitro active drug with or without a synergistic drug, at common suggested dosages for EF-BSI in empirical or definitive therapy.
- **Written informed consent Exclusion Criteria**:
- Short term mortality
- Other concomitant infection.

### Resistance in vancomycin-resistant enterococci [^ef2da100]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Serious infections owing to vancomycin-resistant enterococci have historically proven to be difficult clinical cases, requiring combination therapy and management of treatment-related toxicity. Despite the introduction of new antibiotics with activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci to the therapeutic armamentarium, significant challenges remain. An understanding of the factors driving the emergence of resistance in vancomycin-resistant enterococci, the dynamics of gastrointestinal colonization and microbiota-mediated colonization resistance, and the mechanisms of resistance to the currently available therapeutics will permit clinicians to be better prepared to tackle these challenging hospital-associated pathogens.

### How do I manage a patient with enterococcal bacteraemia? [^e6a080f0]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Enterococcal bacteraemia (EB) is common, particularly in the nosocomial setting, and its management poses a challenge for clinicians and microbiologists.

Objectives

The aim was to summarize the more relevant features of EB and to provide a practical state-of-the-art on the topics that more directly affect its management.

Sources

Pubmed articles from inception to 31 May 2020.

Content

The following topics are covered: epidemiological, clinical and microbiological characteristics and factors associated with prognosis of EB; diagnosis and work-up, including the use of echocardiography to rule out endocarditis; antibiotic management with special focus on antimicrobial resistance and complicated EB; and the role of infectious disease consultation and the use of bundles in EB. In addition, three clinical vignettes are presented to illustrate the practical application of the guidance provided, and major gaps in the current evidence supporting EB management are discussed.

Implications

EB is associated with large burdens of morbidity and mortality, particularly among fragile and immunosuppressed patients presenting complicated bacteraemia due to multidrug-resistant enterococci. Most cases of EB are caused by Enterococcus faecalis, followed by E. faecium. EB often presents as polymicrobial bacteraemia. Rapidly identifying patients at risk of EB is crucial for timely application of diagnostic techniques and empiric therapy. Early alert systems and rapid diagnostic techniques, such as matrix-assisted desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, especially if used together with infectious disease consultation within bundles, appear to improve management and prognosis of EB. Echocardiography is also key in the work-up of EB and should probably be more extensively used, although its exact indications in EB are still debated. Multidisciplinary approaches are warranted due to the complexity and severity of EB.

### Optimising genomic approaches for identifying vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium transmission in healthcare settings [^aee57661]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Enterococcus faecium comprises part of the normal gastrointestinal tract flora in humans, but in recent years, has become an increasingly important healthcare-associated pathogen, causing a range of infections, including bloodstream and urinary tract infections –. Enterococcus faecium is particularly difficult to treat due to intrinsic resistance to a range of antibiotics, and although vancomycin was once the treatment of choice for E. faecium, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium is now common in many countries. Consequently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) listed vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) as a "high priority" in its recent list of priority bacterial pathogens due to the limited treatment options available.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) allows high-resolution investigation of pathogen outbreaks and transmission networks, facilitating accurate targeting of infection control interventions and consequently reducing the number of infections. Conventional genomic approaches for determining genetic relatedness and transmission links include multilocus sequence type (MLST) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distances, generated from core genome alignments usually using recombination masking. However, these methods are not optimal for highly recombinogenic and very genetically diverse species, such as E. faecium, and may result in isolates being labelled as more closely/less closely related than they actually are. More recently, alternative approaches such as core genome MLST (cgMLST) and kmer-based methods (genomic data broken down into smaller pieces of known size k) have been developed to deal with some of the pitfalls of the conventional approaches. In all approaches, genomic data are combined with epidemiological information for a more accurate determination of transmission links and outbreak status.

### Enterococcus faecium: evolution, adaptation, pathogenesis and emerging therapeutics [^b94b44b3]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecium colonizes humans and a wide range of animals, endures numerous stresses, resists antibiotic treatment and stubbornly persists in clinical environments. The widespread application of antibiotics in hospitals and agriculture has contributed to the emergence of vancomycin-resistant E.faecium, which causes many hospital-acquired infections. In this Review, we explore recent discoveries about the evolutionary history, the environmental adaptation and the colonization and dissemination mechanisms of E.faecium and vancomycin-resistant E.faecium. These studies provide critical insights necessary for developing novel preventive and therapeutic approaches against vancomycin-resistant E.faecium and also reveal the intricate interrelationships between the environment, the microorganism and the host, providing knowledge that is broadly relevant to how antibiotic-resistant pathogens emerge and endure.

### Linezolid for the treatment of resistant gram-positive cocci [^19548eb4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a comprehensive review of linezolid, the first of a new class of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones. Therapeutic issues regarding the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and a brief history of the oxazolidinones are also discussed.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-March 2001) was conducted to identify pertinent literature, including preclinical trials, clinical trials, and reviews. Unpublished clinical data, adverse effects, and dosing information were abstracted from product labeling.

Study Selection

Clinical efficacy data were extracted from clinical trials, case reports, and abstracts that mentioned linezolid. Additional information concerning antibiotic resistance, the oxazolidinones, in vitro susceptibility and the pharmacokinetic profile of linezolid also was reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Linezolid exhibits activity against many gram-positive organisms, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Linezolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis at an early step in translation and is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of unpublished clinical trials in adults with pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections. The adverse effect profile is similar to that of comparator agents (beta-lactams, clarithrornycin, vancomycin).

Conclusions

Linezolid is the first oral antimicrobial agent approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Since the oxazoildinones have a unique mechanism of action and expanded spectrum of activity against virulent and highly resistant gram positive pathogens, linezolid is a valuable alternative to currently available treatment options. Clinical trials evaluating linezolid and other oxazolidinones for antibiotic-resistant gram-positive infections, as well as comparator studies comparing linezolid with other candidate drugs, such as quinupristin/dalfopristin and choramphenicol, will further define the role of linezolid.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^0c05c6c6]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Enterococcus Species

If enterococci (especially Enterococcus faecalis) are sensitive to ampicillin or amoxicillin, this should be the initial agent of choice, with up to a week intravenous therapy followed by oral amoxicillin.

For ampicillin-resistant enterococci, vancomycin and daptomycin are the first choices. Resistance to vancomycin is increasing (vancomycin-resistant enterococci). Apart from daptomycin or oral linezolid, often no other alternative options are available. Pristinamycin may be considered for treatment of E. faecalis, although evidence supporting this is limited for enterococcal implant-related infections.,

IV fosfomycin has extensive tissue penetration in inflamed tissue and bone. In an experimental model of foreign-body infection, the combination of fosfomycin and gentamicin showed good biofilm activity against E. faecalis. Further studies are needed before IV fosfomycin can be recommended as a standard therapy in enterococcal FRI, although it may be considered in selected cases. No safety data exist on long-term oral administration of fosfomycin. This route of administration is therefore not recommended for bone and joint infections.

### Optimizing therapy for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia in children [^768d5a94]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Uncertainties exist regarding the optimal treatment for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) bloodstream infections, particularly in settings in which ampicillin cannot be used.

Recent Findings

Quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin, all approved between 1999 and 2003, represent the mainstays of therapy for VRE bacteremia, although only linezolid has been specifically approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this indication. The main objective of this review is to compare the relative efficacies, dosing strategies, and side-effect profiles of quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin for VRE bacteremia in the pediatric population. A brief description of recently approved broad-spectrum Gram-positive agents that may have a role in the management of VRE bacteremia in upcoming years is also provided.

Summary

Linezolid, despite its bacteriostatic activity against VRE, may be the most versatile of the available drugs. It has activity against both Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, can be administered orally, and resistance appears to be less of a concern with linezolid compared with the other agents. Additionally, the results of two recent meta-analyses demonstrate more favorable outcomes with linezolid compared with daptomycin for the treatment of VRE bacteremia. The clinical pharmacokinetics of linezolid have been well described in children. The most notable concern with linezolid, however, is toxicities associated with prolonged use. Until more prospective data are available, we favor linezolid as first-line therapy for the treatment of VRE bacteremia in children.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^726a3cfa]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society revised guidelines — anti-enterococcal and anti-staphylococcal agents: Consider use of ampicillin for empiric or pathogen-directed therapy of susceptible enterococcal strains in higher-risk adults and children (Grade 2-B). Consider use of vancomycin for empiric or pathogen-directed therapy of vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in higher risk adults and children (Grade 2-B). Include vancomycin in aztreonam-based regimen for coverage of gram-positive organisms (Grade 2-B). Consider use of linezolid or daptomycin for empiric or pathogen-directed therapy of infections from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE) and as an alternative to vancomycin for infections from MRSA in adults and children (Grade 2-B).

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^4dd55ae8]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The data in this case series show daptomycin to be a safe and effective therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with VRE UTIs. Limitations of the present study include the fact that this is a retrospective case series with a small number of patients and clinical records that are often limited and variable. Furthermore, because of the paucity of data in the literature, it is unclear what the most appropriate daptomycin dose is for the treatment of VRE UTIs. Nevertheless, it is clear that VRE are increasingly involved in nosocomial infections. Of concern, VRE may transfer vancomycin resistance to other bacterial species, including S. aureus. Uncontrolled dissemination of VRE infections within health care institutions has been facilitated by incautious contact with contaminated medical equipment and surfaces, colonized health care personnel, and infected patients. For example, the spread of a strain of linezolid-resistant VRE has been reported in one zone of a transplantation unit despite extensive precautions.

Another major factor that has led to the spread of VRE infection is poor infection control techniques that rely on cephalosporins and other antibacterials inactive against enterococci. A recent report found that more than 30% of all clinical isolates of Enterococcus were resistant to vancomycin, including more than 90% of E. faecium isolates. For these reasons, appropriate antibiotic susceptibility testing is a mainstay of good clinical practice to limit the spread of multidrug-resistant strains, and agents that have specific activity against these strains must be used to eradicate these difficult-to-treat infections.

The urinary tract is one of the main portals for entry of VRE, so it is hardly surprising that the urinary tract is a major site of infection. Management of VRE UTIs usually requires correction of any factors contributing to the infection. Catheter removal, obstruction relief, abscess drainage, and initiation of antimicrobial therapy are all initial steps taken in clinical practice.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia pharmacotherapy [^92b85938]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on the pharmacotherapy of bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE literature search was performed for the period 1946 to May 2014 using the search terms Enterococcus, enterococci, vancomycin-resistant, VRE, bacteremia, and bloodstream infection. References were also identified from selected review articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language case series, cohort studies, and meta-analyses assessing the options in the pharmacotherapy of VRE BSIs in adult patients were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Studies were identified that utilized linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), and daptomycin. In all, 8 comparative retrospective cohort studies, 2 meta-analyses of daptomycin and linezolid, and 3 retrospective comparisons of linezolid and Q/D were included for review. Mortality associated with VRE BSIs was high across studies, and the ability to determine differences in outcomes between agents was confounded by the complex nature of the patients included. Two meta-analyses comparing daptomycin with linezolid for VRE BSIs found modest advantages for linezolid, but these conclusions may be hampered by heterogeneity within the included studies.

Conclusions

VRE BSIs remain a difficult-to-treat clinical situation. Differences in toxicity between the agents used to treat it are clear, but therapeutic differences are more difficult to discern. Meta-analyses suggest that a moderate advantage for linezolid over daptomycin may exist, but problems with the nature of studies that they included make definitive conclusions difficult.

### Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium meningitis successfully managed with linezolid: case report and review of the literature [^52799950]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Enterococci cause serious illness in immunocompromised patients and severely ill, hospitalized patients. Resistance to vancomycin has increased in frequency during the past few years. Limited therapeutic options are available for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections and the optimum therapy has not been established. We report a case of nosocomial vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium meningitis in the setting of hyperinfection with Strongyloides stercoralis that was successfully treated with linezolid. We also review the previously reported cases of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium meningitis.

### Complex routes of nosocomial vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium transmission revealed by genome sequencing [^fc20abc9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Enterococcus faecium is a leading cause of nosocomial infections in critically ill and immunocompromised patients. In 2009–2010, E. faecium was among the top 10 most common microorganisms associated with healthcare-associated infections in the United States. Vancomycin resistance in E. faecium (VREfm) was first reported in 1988 and has since become globally disseminated. Infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have limited treatment options, and are associated with higher mortality and healthcare costs compared with those caused by vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. Eradication of E. faecium from healthcare settings is challenging because it is often carried in the gut by hospitalized patients and can persist in the environment. Furthermore, some hospital infection control measures such as active screening programs of high-risk patients to detect and isolate VREfm carriers are not universally practiced.

The investigation of suspected VREfm outbreaks is triggered when 2 or more VREfm-positive individuals are identified in the same time and place. This epidemiological approach may be complemented by bacterial typing, but available methods lack sufficient resolution to distinguish between isolates belonging to the same genetic lineage. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides greater discrimination between isolates for a range of nosocomial pathogens, but the study of E. faecium has lagged behind. The first completed E. faecium genome was only published in 2012, and subsequent genome-based studies have involved relatively small numbers of isolates. A single study to date has addressed the clinical application of E. faecium WGS to patient cohorts, which used a core genome multilocus sequence typing scheme and confirmed the utility of WGS for the study of E. faecium outbreaks. Here, we report the findings of a large study that establishes a role for genome sequencing in the investigation of E. faecium transmission.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^c075a531]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The global spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is increasingly becoming a major challenge in clinical and public health settings. To date, the treatment for serious CRE infections remains difficult. The intelligent use of antimicrobials and effective infection control strategies is crucial to prevent further CRE spread. Early consultation with experts in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant organisms is valuable in patient management. This brief review will focus on the current, yet limited, treatment options for CRE infections.

### Advances in the therapy of bacterial bloodstream infections [^9ec54122]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Advances in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) have been achieved in the last years, improving clinical outcome. However, mortality associated with some pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp., is still high. In addition, the spread of antibiotic resistance, mainly among Gram-negative bacteria, reduces treatment options in some circumstances. Therefore, interest in new drugs, combination regimens and optimal dosing schedules is rising.

Objectives

Our aim is to summarize the current evidence on available antibiotic regimens for patients with bacterial BSI, focusing on drug choice, combination regimens and optimal dosing schedules. We selected bacteria that are difficult to manage because of virulence factors (i.e. methicillin-susceptible S. aureus), tolerance to antibiotic activity (i.e. Enterococcus faecalis), and/or susceptibility patterns (i.e. methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii).

Sources

MEDLINE search with English language and publication in the last 5 years as limits.

Content and Implications

The literature gaps on the use of new drugs, the uncertainties regarding the use of combination regimens, and the need to optimize dosing schedules in some circumstances (e.g. augmented renal clearance, renal replacement therapy, high inoculum BSI sources, and isolation of bacteria showing high MICs) have been revised.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^aeac151a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

An extensive literature review demonstrated some evidence in favour of using empirical therapy with enterococcal coverage for IAIs in the following cases: 1) immunocompromised patients or patients with hospital-acquired/post-operative cIAIs; 2) patients with cIAIs who have previously received cephalosporins and other broad-spectrum antibiotics selecting Enterococcus spp.; 3) patients with cIAIs and valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular material, at high risk of endocarditis. The ideal therapeutic regimen for these high-risk patients remains to be determined, but empirical therapy directed against enterococci should be considered.

Nearly all strains of E. faecalis, including some strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, are susceptible to ampicillin. In patients with IAIs, E. faecium is increasingly encountered, particularly in patients with hospital-acquired IAIs. In contrast to E. faecalis, nearly all strains of E. faecium are resistant to ampicillin and the growing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant strains is an area of concern, although the main clinical problem seems strictly related to BSIs. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis showed a higher mortality for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium BSIs compared with vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium BSIs (RR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.17–1.82). For patients with VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, linezolid or daptomycin are the preferred agents. Both linezolid and daptomycin have good in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium although higher daily doses are needed. For VanB-type resistant strains teicoplanin should be considered the preferred drug.

What are the optimal daily doses and modality of administration of antibiotics in patients with IAIs?

19. In patients with IAIs and sepsis or septic shock, appropriate dose and administration mode of antibiotics should include: 1) proper loading dose, 2) extended or continuous infusion for beta-lactams and 3) knowledge of the peritoneal/biliary penetration rate (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

20. Beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit good penetration rate in the peritoneal exudate fluid. In critically ill patients, continuous infusion should be implemented to grant optimal PK/PD target attainment at the infection site (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Administering adequate doses of antibiotics should be based on the intrinsic pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of each antibiotic class, the specific agent, and the specific pathophysiologic characteristics of the patient.

### Linezolid bladder irrigation as adjunctive treatment for a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^aa6297f1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the first reported successful use of adjunctive linezolid bladder irrigation.

Case Summary

An 89-year-old woman with 10% TBSA burns developed septic shock and anuric acute kidney insufficiency. She acquired a urinary tract infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm). Based on clinical status, a linezolid bladder irrigation was initiated in addition to high-dose intravenous linezolid and demonstrated microbiological cure with 7 days of treatment.

Discussion

Linezolid is primarily hepatically cleared and has no labeled indication for urinary tract infections. Anuria adds an additional complication of potentially reduced urinary drug concentrations. Bladder irrigation offers the benefit of achieving high local drug concentrations, but there are no data regarding such a route for linezolid. This case report is the first demonstrating the use, stability, safety, and efficacy of linezolid as a continuous bladder irrigation.

Conclusions

Linezolid use as a bladder irrigation may be a feasible route of administration in anuric, critically ill patients with VREfm and few antimicrobial options. Further studies are warranted.

### Management of multidrug-resistant organisms in health care settings, 2006 [^80b7120b]. American Journal of Infection Control (2007). Medium credibility.

Clinical importance of MDROs — In most instances, MDRO infections have clinical manifestations that are similar to infections caused by susceptible pathogens; however, options for treating patients with these infections are often extremely limited. For example, until recently, only vancomycin provided effective therapy for potentially life-threatening MRSA infections and during the 1990's there were virtually no antimicrobial agents to treat infections caused by VRE, and although antimicrobials are now available for MRSA and VRE infections, resistance to each new agent has already emerged.

### Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid: evidence and opinion [^95b89ed8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid demonstrate in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including many isolates resistant to earlier antimicrobials. Quinupristin-dalfopristin is inactive against Enterococcus faecalis but has been effective for treatment of infections due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium associated with bacteremia. In comparative trials, linezolid proved to be equivalent to comparator agents, resulting in its approval for several clinical indications. The almost-complete bioavailability of linezolid permits oral administration. Each agent can cause adverse effects that may limit use in individual patients. Resistance to these drugs has been encountered infrequently among vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin is rare among staphylococci in the United States, and resistance to linezolid is very rare. Whether there is any benefit to use of these agents in combination regimens, and whether there are circumstances in which they might be alternatives to cell-wall active antibiotics for treatment of bone or endovascular infections, are questions that deserve further study.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^40e2a8d4]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus and MRSA management in intra-abdominal infection (IAI) is addressed with graded suggestions: We suggest that ampicillin may be used for treatment of IAI in adults and children to provide pathogen-directed therapy against susceptible enterococcal strains (Grade 2-B). We suggest that vancomycin may be used for treatment of IAI in adults and children to provide empiric or pathogen-directed therapy for suspected or proven infections from vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (Grade 2-B), and we suggest inclusion of vancomycin in an aztreonam-based regimen for coverage of gram-positive organisms (Grade 2-B). We suggest that linezolid and daptomycin may be used for management of IAI in adults and children to provide empiric or pathogen-directed therapy for suspected or proven infections from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., and as an alternative to vancomycin for suspected or proven infections because of MRSA (Grade 2-B).

### Challenges in anti-infective development in the era of bad bugs, no drugs: a regulatory perspective using the example of bloodstream infection as an indication [^5be65203]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections present many challenges to clinicians. The number of hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection continues to increase, and the number of newly available antimicrobial agents to treat these particularly lethal infections and many other serious infections continues to decrease. Drug-development programs for bloodstream infection that have adhered to existing regulatory guidelines have not been significantly successful. This article examines the regulatory history of the bloodstream infection indication as an example of the challenges faced by individuals and sponsors developing drugs for treatment of the current spectrum of antimicrobial-resistant infections, with the goal of providing insight into development pathways for agents targeting drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Disease-specific and pathogen-specific indications are discussed, and recent regulatory approvals for bloodstream infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are reviewed.

Linezolid is a new oxazolidinone antibiotic used to treat infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In early clinical trials, emergence of resistance occurred rarely. We report clinical details and antibiotic susceptibility from five patients treated with linezolid for VRE infections who had resistant organisms isolated during therapy. Four were transplant patients receiving protracted courses of the drug; three cases were associated with treatment failure. One of 45 linezolid-treated patients developed resistance during therapy. Susceptibility testing should be done in all cases on starting therapy.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^57064c2e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Pleuromutilins: Lefamulin

Lefamulin is currently in late stage development as an IV and oral treatment for ABSSSIs. Lefamulin inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. It exhibits activity against frequently identified gram-positive skin pathogens, including MRSA, MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.

Pleuromutilins are not affected by resistance mechanisms involving major antibiotic classes, including fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines. A phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluated the use of lefamulin vs vancomycin in the treatment of patients with ABSSSIs caused by a gram-positive pathogen. In that trial, 207 patients were randomized to IV lefamulin 100 mg, lefamulin 150 mg, or vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours. Clinical success rates at test-of-cure in the clinically evaluable population were comparable across all 3 groups: 90% lefamulin 100 mg group; 88.9% lefamulin 150 mg group, and 92.2% vancomycin group. In addition, clinical response rates at day 3 were similar across the 3 treatment groups. The incidence of drug-related AEs was lower for lefamulin (34.3% and 39.4% in the 100 mg and 150 mg groups, respectively) compared with vancomycin (53.0%).

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: therapeutic challenges in the 21st century [^9e724894]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are serious health threats due in part to their ability to persist in rugged environments and their propensity to acquire antibiotic resistance determinants. Enterococci have now established a home in our hospitals and possess mechanisms to defeat most currently available antimicrobials. This article reviews the history of the struggle with this pathogen, what is known about the traits associated with its rise in the modern medical environment, and the current understanding of therapeutic approaches in severe infections caused by these microorganisms. As the 21st century progresses, vancomycin-resistant enterococci continue to pose a daunting clinical challenge.

### Chloramphenicol treatment for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteremia [^bd8461a7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the results of treating vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) bacteremia with chloramphenicol.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all adult patients with VREF bacteremia treated with chloramphenicol during the calendar year 1998 at a 522-bed tertiary referral center in New York City. Patients were identified by reviewing microbiology laboratory records. Patients with clinically significant VREF bacteremia who received chloramphenicol for at least 48 h were included in the study. Clinical and microbiological outcomes were determined. Microbiological and molecular tests were performed on a small representative sample of isolates to identify the presence of resistance mechanisms and to look for similarity among the isolates.

Results

Seven episodes of significant VREF bacteremia occurred in six patients. Mean age was 54 years. All patients had cancer and three had severe neutropenia. Five of seven episodes were associated with chronic indwelling devices, but in only one of these cases was the device removed. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol in vitro. All six microbiologically evaluable episodes had a favorable response to chloramphenicol treatment, and four of seven (57%) clinically evaluable episodes had favorable outcomes. Only one death may have been due to VREF bacteremia, so the maximal attributable mortality was 14%. The three representative samples that were tested further were indistinguishable from one another and they displayed no evidence of resistance mechanisms.

Conclusions

In a cohort of severely ill cancer patients, chloramphenicol was effective in treating VREF bacteremia. The use of chloramphenicol should be considered in treating infections with this highly resistant organism, where therapeutic options are limited.

### Treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections with quinupristin / dalfopristin [^8e871174]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Clinicians caring for patients with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) infections face severe constraints in the selection of treatment. Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is active in vitro against VREF, with a MIC(90) of 1.0 microg/mL. We investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of this agent in a multicenter, prospective, noncomparative, emergency-use study of 396 patients. Patients were included if they had signs and symptoms of active infection, including bacteremia of unknown origin, intra-abdominal infection, and skin and skin-structure infection, with no alternative antibiotic therapy available. The mean duration of treatment was 20 days (range, 4–40 days). The clinical response rate was 68.8% in the evaluable subset, and the overall response rate was 65.6%. The most common adverse events related to quinupristin/dalfopristin were arthralgias and myalgias. Related laboratory abnormalities were rare. In this severely ill patient population, quinupristin/dalfopristin was efficacious and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of VREF infection.

Vancomycin and ampicillin resistance in clinical Enterococcus faecium strains has developed in the past decade. Failure to adhere to strict infection control to prevent the spread of these pathogens has been well established. New data implicate the use of specific classes of antimicrobial agents in the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Extended-spectrum cephalosporins and drugs with potent activity against anaerobic bacteria may promote infection and colonization with VRE and may exert different effects on the initial establishment and persistence of high-density colonization. Control of VRE will require better understanding of the mechanisms by which different classes of drugs promote gastrointestinal colonization.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: mechanisms and clinical observations [^89b2c5d5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Enterococci are not generally regarded as highly virulent bacterial pathogens. However, resistance to many antimicrobial drugs complicates treatment of enterococcal infections. Acquired resistance to high concentrations of glycopeptide antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, has exacerbated this problem. This article seeks to concisely review the mechanisms of that resistance and its effects on clinical management of enterococcal infections, as well as clinical microbiology and infection control.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^6afe05af]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In fact in critically ill patients the possibility that the normal flora may be modified and that the IAI could be caused by several unexpected pathogens and by more resistant flora must be considered. In these patients antimicrobial regimens with broader spectrum of activity are recommended.

Therefore in a stable and low risk patient a simpler antibiotic choice, not including ESBL in the spectrum of activity is correct, while in critical and high risk patients any antibiotic regimen must take into account the risk of ESBL.

The available therapeutic options for the treatment of ESBL-associated infections are limited by drug resistance conferred by the ESBLs. The frequently observed co-resistances include various antibiotic classes (fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Carbapenems, stable against hydrolyzing activity of ESBLs, are considered as the drug of choice for the treatment of these infections. Tigecycline and polymyxins have a strong in vitro antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing bacteria, and the first should be considered a reasonable alternative. This is particularly true from an epidemiological point of view; in fact today any large hospital should implement carbapenems-sparing stewardship programs to control the spread of carbapenemase producing gram negative bacteria.

Although in the prospective French survey by Montravers and coll, a higher percentage of isolation of Enterococcus faecalis in non surviving patients was reported (23% versus 9%), empirical treatment against Enterococci and has not been generally recommended for patients with community-acquired IAI. In fact in several clinical trials comparing different therapeutic options inclusion/exclusion of agents with enterococcal coverage provides no impact in outcomes for patients with community-acquired infections.

In the setting of community acquired IAIs, antimicrobial therapy for enterococci should be considered on a patient-by-patient basis, mainly in high risk patients, in immunocompromised patients and in patients with valvular heart disease or prosthetic materials.

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is not commonly isolated from patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infection. Therefore empirical treatment against MRSA is not recommended in this setting.

### Using VRE screening tests to predict vancomycin resistance in enterococcal bacteremia [^5af9a315]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Enterococcus causes clinically significant bloodstream infections (BSIs). In centers with a higher prevalence of vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE) colonization, a common clinical question is whether empiric treatment directed against VRE should be initiated in the setting of a suspected enterococcal BSI. Unfortunately, VRE treatment options are limited, and relatively expensive, and subject patients to the risk of adverse reactions. We hypothesized that the results of VRE colonization screening could predict vancomycin resistance in enterococcal BSI.

Methods

We reviewed 370 consecutive cases of enterococcal BSI over a 7-year period at 2 tertiary-care hospitals to determine whether vancomycin-resistant BSIs could be predicted based on known colonization status (ie, patients with swabs performed within 30 days, more remotely, or never tested). We calculated sensitivity and specificity, and we plotted negative predictives values (NPVs) and positive predictive values (PPVs) as a function of prevalence.

Results

A negative screening swab within 30 days of infection yielded NPVs of 90% and 95% in settings where < 27.0% and 15.0% of enterococcal BSI are resistant to vancomycin, respectively. In patients with known VRE colonization, the PPV for VRE in enterococcal BSI was > 50% at any prevalence exceeding 25%.

Conclusions

The results of a negative VRE screening test result performed within 30 days can help eliminate unnecessary empiric therapy in patients with suspected enterococcal BSI. Conversely, patients with positive VRE screening swabs require careful consideration of empiric VRE-directed therapy when enterococcal BSI appears likely.

### Quinupristin-dalfopristin: a new antibiotic for severe gram-positive infections [^900a2192]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The steady increase in resistant organisms is related to the widespread use of antibiotics in community and hospital settings. New therapeutic options are needed, including treatments for infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-positive organisms. Quinupristin-dalfopristin, the first formulation of a distinct class of antibiotics known as the streptogramins, has activity against a range of gram-positive bacteria that are usually resistant to other agents, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The pharmacodynamic (postantibiotic effect) and pharmacokinetic characteristics of quinupristin-dalfopristin allow dosing at eight- to 12-hour intervals. The safety profile of the formulation is generally favorable, with no demonstrable ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, or cardiovascular adverse effects. Reversible arthralgias, myalgias, and peripheral venous irritation are the formulation's major side effects. A potential for drug interactions exists because quinupristin-dalfopristin significantly inhibits the cytochrome P450-3A4 enzyme system. Quinupristin-dalfopristin has been shown to be effective in the management of documented severe infections caused by vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, nosocomial pneumonia, and infections related to the use of intravascular catheters.

### VRE and VSE bacteremia outcomes in the era of effective VRE therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c9f23b5d]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

The worse outcomes associated with VRE bacteremia compared to VSE bacteremia may also be linked to differences in the causative species as there may have been proportionately more patients with E. faecium than E. faecalis in the VRE bacteremia group when compared to the VSE bacteremia group.

Our results should be interpreted recognizing the systematic review's limitations. First, studies included within each meta-analysis were non-randomized observational studies, and accordingly, our results reflect association and not causation. Second, as discussed above, only a small number of studies adjusted for potential confounders, and thus confounding may have influenced the investigated associations. Third, our results may be limited by the exclusive review of English language reports published after January 1997, but it is unlikely such language restrictions biased our findings. Fourth, the majority of studies sampled immunocompromised hospital patient populations, which limited our ability to generalize our findings to all healthcare settings. Last, our funnel plot suggests that there may be publication bias. However, the 2 studies that contributed to this asymmetry had high standard error and odds ratios close to 1. Thus, if the asymmetry in the funnel plot is due to publication bias, it would bias the results towards the null hypothesis.

We conclude that using the best available evidence, VRE bacteremia remains associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality when compared with VSE bacteremia in the era of effective VRE therapy. Future research is needed to determine whether these results are related to unadjusted differences in the patient populations, differences in treatment effectiveness, or differences in proportions of patients with E. faecalis and E. faecium comprising the VRE and VSE bacteremias.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^f7ffe150]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the current case series, daptomycin was shown to be a safe and effective therapeutic option in the management of VRE UTIs. Because of the increasing prevalence of VRE infection and the limited treatment options available, we anticipate that management of VRE UTIs will continue to be challenging for the clinician. Based on our experience, we believe that daptomycin is a valuable treatment option for problematic UTIs. These findings must be confirmed in larger randomized clinical trials. However, despite the lack of data about therapeutic options for VRE UTIs and the intrinsic limitations of descriptive case reports, our positive experience with daptomycin may be of value to the clinical community.

### Epidemic and nonepidemic multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium [^7033ec1c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Enterococcus faecium has become an important nosocomial pathogen, especially in immunocompromised patients, creating serious limitations in treatment options because of cumulative resistance to antimicrobial agents. In the United States, the emergence of nosocomial E. faecium infections was characterized by increasing resistance to ampicillin in the 1980s and a rapid increase of vancomycin resistance in the next decade. The emergence of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREF) in the United States illustrates the transmission capacities of bacteria and the possibility of a postantibiotic era for nosocomial infections in critically ill patients.

The global epidemiology of VREF is not well understood. In the United States, prevalences of colonization and infection are high among hospitalized patients, but a community reservoir of VREF in healthy persons or animals seems to be absent. In contrast, in Europe, colonization and infection rates within hospitals remain low, although colonization among healthy persons and animals is prevalent.

Previous studies suggested host-specificity of VREF genogroups, and isolates associated with nosocomial outbreaks seemed to be genetically distinct from nonepidemic VREF isolated from humans and animals. The differences between epidemic and nonepidemic isolates were based on genetic relatedness, as determined by amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis (AFLP), and the presence of an identical sequence of the purK housekeeping gene in epidemic strains. A recently developed multilocus sequence typing scheme for E. faecium confirmed that epidemic isolates belonged to a specific genetic lineage. Moreover, a variant of the esp gene, which has been found to be more prevalent among isolates of E. faecalis associated with infections, was found in all but one epidemic hospital-derived VREF isolate and not among community-derived VREF. Subsequently, other investigators described the variant esp gene in vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium (VSEF), and this gene appeared to be predominantly present among clinical isolates. These findings suggest the existence of a specific subpopulation of E. faecium, comprising both VREF as well as VSEF, associated with hospital outbreaks and infections.

In this study, we further investigated the genetic relationship between VREF and VSEF isolates, derived from different epidemiologic sources, such as hospital outbreaks, infections, and colonization among hospitalized patients and healthy persons. The genetic relatedness was linked to the presence of the variant esp gene and antibiotic resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin. On the basis of our findings, we constructed an evolutionary scheme describing the sequential steps in the development and selection of ampicillin- and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains.

### Influence of minimum inhibitory concentration in clinical outcomes of Enterococcus faecium bacteremia treated with daptomycin: is it time to change the breakpoint? [^f6dab7c5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Daptomycin has become a front-line antibiotic for multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium bloodstream infections (BSIs). We previously showed that E. faecium strains with daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the higher end of susceptibility frequently harbor mutations associated with daptomycin resistance. We postulate that patients with E. faecium BSIs exhibiting daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL treated with daptomycin are more likely to have worse clinical outcomes than those exhibiting daptomycin MICs ≤ 2 µg/mL.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included adult patients with E. faecium BSI for whom initial isolates, follow-up blood culture data, and daptomycin administration data were available. A central laboratory performed standardized daptomycin MIC testing for all isolates. The primary outcome was microbiologic failure, defined as clearance of bacteremia ≥ 4 days after the index blood culture. The secondary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality.

Results

A total of 62 patients were included. Thirty-one patients were infected with isolates that exhibited daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL. Overall, 34 patients had microbiologic failure and 25 died during hospitalization. In a multivariate logistic regression model, daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL (odds ratio [OR], 4.7 [1.37–16.12]; P = 0.014) and immunosuppression (OR, 5.32 [1.20–23.54]; P = 0.028) were significantly associated with microbiologic failure. Initial daptomycin dose of ≥ 8 mg/kg was not significantly associated with evaluated outcomes.

Conclusions

Daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL in the initial E. faecium blood isolate predicted microbiological failure of daptomycin therapy, suggesting that modification in the daptomycin breakpoint for enterococci should be considered.

### Unmet needs and prospects for oritavancin in the management of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections [^b688463b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) has become an important clinical challenge and compromises the care of critically ill patients. A striking increase in the frequency of nosocomial isolation of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium has dramatically reduced the therapeutic alternatives because the majority of E. faecium isolates are resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin. Only 2 agents have US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of VRE (E. faecium) infections, namely, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D). However, the use of these compounds in severe VRE infections is hampered by the lack of in vivo bactericidal activity, reports of therapeutic failures with monotherapy, a requirement for central venous access for administration (Q/D), and adverse-effect profile. The lipopeptide antimicrobial daptomycin has in vitro bactericidal activity against VRE; however, clinical use of this compound for VRE has not been well studied, and the reports of resistance emerging during therapy at the approved doses are worrisome. Tigecycline has in vitro bacteriostatic activity against VRE, but its clinical use for serious enterococcal infections is unclear due to low serum levels and static effect. Thus, current reliable therapies for VRE appear to be limited, and clinical data that use the above compounds are certainly scant. Oritavancin is an investigational semisynthetic glycopeptide with potent in vitro activity against VRE (both VanA and VanB phenotypes). Although review of the available preclinical data indicates that this compound used as a single agent is likely to have important limitations for the treatment of a severe VRE infection (ie, endocarditis), combination of oritavancin with other agents such as aminoglycosides may offer promise and deserves further investigation, as does use of oritavancin for less serious infections as monotherapy for vancomycin-susceptible and multidrug-resistant enterococci.

### Strategies for managing today's infections [^0c2ad1a7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Bacterial infections are becoming more difficult to treat. At the present time c. 70% of nosocomial infections are resistant to at least one antimicrobial drug that previously was effective for the causative pathogen. Pathogens that are notorious for their virulence and ability to develop resistance include Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter species. Notable resistance patterns that have emerged include methicillin resistance in S. aureus, which started in the healthcare setting but has now moved into the community. Vancomycin resistance in enterococci is frequently seen, and vancomycin resistance in methicillin-resistant S. aureus is a public health threat. Resistance patterns seen in pseudomonal and Acinetobacter infections are rapidly shifting. The situation has become sufficiently serious for clinical opinion leaders to call upon governments for assistance in addressing the problem. In this worsening environment, in which patients are at progressively greater risk of untreatable infections, clear recommendations for prescribers are urgently needed. Severity of infection and underlying conditions are key issues, as patients with the most serious diseases are those in most urgent need, and improvements in our ability to predict likely infecting pathogens when empirical therapy is necessary are needed. Risk-factors and local resistance patterns must be accounted for, and initial empirical therapy should be adequately broad spectrum and adequately dosed. Agents must be highly active, able to penetrate adequately to the site of infection, safe, and well-tolerated.

### Linezolid [^927af454]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of linezolid for the treatment of pediatric patients with the following infections are supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients, and additional data from a comparator-controlled study of Gram-positive infections in pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 11 years [see Indications and Usage (1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)]:

- nosocomial pneumonia

- complicated skin and skin structure infections

- community-acquired pneumonia (also supported by evidence from an uncontrolled study in patients ranging in age from 8 months through 12 years)

- vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections

The safety and effectiveness of linezolid for the treatment of pediatric patients with the following infection have been established in a comparator-controlled study in pediatric patients ranging in age from 5 through 17 years [see Clinical Studies (14)]:

- uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only) or Streptococcus pyogenes

Pharmacokinetic information generated in pediatric patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts showed variable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) linezolid concentrations following single and multiple dosing of linezolid; therapeutic concentrations were not consistently achieved or maintained in the CSF. Therefore, the use of linezolid for the empiric treatment of pediatric patients with central nervous system infections is not recommended.

1.5 Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium Infections

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, including cases with concurrent bacteremia [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.6 Limitations of Use

- Linezolid Injection is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections. It is critical that specific Gram-negative therapy be initiated immediately if a concomitant Gram-negative pathogen is documented or suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- The safety and efficacy of Linezolid Injection formulations given for longer than 28 days have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studie s (14)].

1.7 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Linezolid Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Linezolid Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^ae292aa4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Statement 31

Antimicrobial resistance among enterococcal isolates (ampicillin, gentamcin or vancomycin resistance) is mostly found in nosocomial (postoperative or tertiary) peritonitis. In Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), treatment with linezolid (monomicrobial infection) or tigecycline (polymicrobial infection) is appropriate (Recommendation 1 B).

Among Gram-positive bacteria, Enterococci play a significant role in IAIs. Although they are found in community-acquired infections, they were far more prevalent in hospital-acquired infections. In the CIAOW Study, Enterococci (E. faecalis and E. faecium) were the most prevalent bacteria among all the aerobic Gram-positive bacteria isolated in the intra-operative samples, representing 15.9% of all aerobic isolates. Although Enterococci were also present in community-acquired infections, they were more prevalent in HA-IAIs (22.3% in HA-IAIs versus 13.9% in CA-IAIs). Some studies have demonstrated poor outcomes among patients with documented enterococcal infections, particularly in those with post-operative IAIs where Enterococci coverage should always be considered. Empirical coverage of Enterococci is not generally recommended for patients with CA-IAIs. The acquisition of glycopeptide resistance by enterococci has seriously affected the treatment and control of these organisms. Many factors can increase the risk of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection. These include previous antibiotic therapy, prolonged hospitalization, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, severe illness or underlying pathology, invasive procedures, gastrointestinal surgery, organ transplantation, and close proximity to other VRE-positive patients.

The majority of vancomicyn-resistant enterococcus infections have been attributed to E. faecium, though glycopeptide resistance occurs in E. faecalis and other Enterococcus spp. as well.

Options for treating vancomicyn-resistant enterococcus infections are linezolid or tigeciclyine.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^66cc1bbf]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

In this case series, patients with VRE UTIs were treated with daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that has rapid bactericidal activity against a variety of Gram-positive pathogens. Daptomycin acts by binding to bacterial cell membranes and inducing rapid depolarization, which inhibits DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and leads to cell death. In the 10 cases described here, daptomycin was chosen as the treatment option because of its efficacy profile, sensitivity testing, and low resistance rates for both major species of Enterococcus.

Another important consideration when appropriate treatment for VRE UTI is chosen is the presence of intact drug at the site of infection. Daptomycin is eliminated primarily by the kidney; approximately 52% is excreted unchanged into the urine after intravenous administration. Other agents active against VRE, such as linezolid, quinupristin–dalfopristin, and tigecycline, have a lower fraction of urinary excretion, which may potentially limit their effectiveness in the management of VRE UTIs.

Most strains of VRE are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin, although higher-dose ampicillin, doxycycline, and nitrofurantoin remain viable treatment options. More often, drug choices used to treat VRE include daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin–dalfopristin, and tigecycline. These compounds have similarly low MIC values against VRE species. All these antibiotics except daptomycin exhibit bacteriostatic properties; daptomycin is bactericidal. Daptomycin has similar MIC values for E. faecium and E. faecalis and is effective in treating either pathogen. Daptomycin resistance among VRE strains remains rare; numerous global surveillance studies have demonstrated higher susceptibility levels in VRE strains using daptomycin than in strains using linezolid or quinupristin–dalfopristin. Resistance to linezolid among VRE isolates has been well described and is of increasing clinical concern. Quinupristin–dalfopristin has limited activity against E. faecalis. In addition, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains have shown emerging resistance to quinupristin–dalfopristin; 3.4% of urinary tract isolates were resistant in a study at 28 medical centers in the United States. Use of quinupristin–dalfopristin is also limited by its potential systemic and infusion site–related adverse effects, including myalgia and arthralgia.

Enterococcus infective endocarditis (IE) caused by strains resistant to penicillin, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin — treatment and care team guidance include the following: Linezolid 600 mg IV or orally every 12 h for > 6 weeks is a Class IIb; Level of Evidence C option, and linezolid use may be associated with potentially severe bone marrow suppression, neuropathy, and numerous drug interactions; daptomycin 10–12 mg/kg per dose for > 6 weeks is also Class IIb; Level of Evidence C, and if daptomycin therapy is selected, then doses of 10 to 12 mg·kg−1.24 h−1 may be considered. Patients with IE attributable to Enterococcus species resistant to penicillin, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin should be managed by specialists in infectious diseases, cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, clinical pharmacy, and, if necessary, pediatrics (Class I; Level of Evidence C); patients with IE caused by these strains should be treated by a care team including specialists in infectious diseases, cardiology, cardiac surgery, clinical pharmacy, and, in children, pediatrics, and cardiac valve replacement may be necessary for cure. Combination therapy with daptomycin and ampicillin or ceftriaxone may be considered, especially in patients with persistent bacteremia or enterococcal strains with high MICs (ie, 3 μg/mL) to daptomycin within the susceptible range (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C).

Introduction:

Here, we present first real-life experience with i.v. fosfomycin in a subgroup of patients with cSSTI from an ongoing international study.

Methods:

Prospective, non-interventional and monitored European multicenter study (FORTRESS; NCT02979951). The primary objective is clinical success, defined as clinical cure or improvement incl. microbiological cure at end of fosfomycin treatment. cSSTI was defined according to common definitions (US, EU).

Results:

Twenty-four of 245 currently (Jan 20) enrolled patients with severe infections had cSSTI (11 female, 13 male; mean age 58y), of which 17 (71%) were treated in intensive care. Fourteen (58%) patients had at least one additional risk factor for cSSTI. Ten (42%) patients had sepsis or septic shock at baseline. Fourteen patients (58%) had surgical site infections, 18 (75%) non-necrotizing cSSTI, thereof 14 (78%) with abscess formation, and four (17%) necrotizing cSSTI (fasciitis, cellulitis/severe phlegmon, abscess). Twenty cases (83%) of cSSTI were considered as acute and four (17%) as chronic infections. Eighteen (75%) infections were microbiologically confirmed. Causative pathogens were mostly staphylococci (15/24 patients; 63%), particularly methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (n = 10/24 patients; 42%), E. faecium (1/24 patients; 4%), streptococci (n = 5/24 patients; 21%), and Gram-negative species (n = 12/24 patients; 50%). I.v. fosfomycin was used in a dose of 14 g/day (median) for a mean duration of 20 days, often in combination with carbapenems, penicillins or cephalosporins. Clinical success was reported in 19/24 (79%) patients, in 12/15 (80%) patients with abscess involvement, and in 8/10 (80%) patients with concomitant sepsis or septic shock. Fifteen adverse events were considered being related to fosfomycin treatment.

Conclusions:

These interim data from clinical practice emphasize that i.v. fosfomycin is a useful combination partner for treatment of cSSTI even in life-threatening cases.

### Accelerated treatment of endocarditis-the POET II trial: rationale and design of a randomized controlled trial [^d644a1a8]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic treatment length for infective endocarditis (IE) is uncertain. International guidelines recommend treatment duration of up to 6 weeks for patients with left-sided IE but are primarily based on historical data and expert opinion. Efficacies of modern therapies, fast recovery seen in many patients with IE, and complications to long hospital stays challenge the rationale for fixed treatment durations in all patients.

Objective

The objective was to conduct a noninferiority randomized controlled trial (acronym POET II) investigating the safety of accelerated (shortened) antibiotic therapy as compared to standard duration in patients with left-sided IE.

Methods

The POET II trial is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, noninferiority randomized controlled trial. Patients with definite left-sided IE due to Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus, or Enterococcus faecalis will be eligible for enrolment. Each patient will be randomized to accelerated antibiotic treatment or standard-length treatment (1:1) following clinical stabilization as defined by clinical parameters, laboratory values, and transesophageal echocardiography findings. Accelerated treatment will be between 2 and 4 weeks, whereas standard-length treatment will be between 4 and 6 weeks, depending on microbiologic etiology, complications, need for valve surgery, and prosthetic versus native valve endocarditis. The primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, relapse of bacteremia, or embolization within 6 months of randomization.

Conclusions

The POET II trial will investigate the safety of accelerated antibiotic therapy for patients with left-sided IE caused by Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus, or Enterococcus faecalis. The results of the POET II trial will improve the evidence base of treatment recommendations, and clinical practice may be altered.

### The rise of the Enterococcus: beyond vancomycin resistance [^326b5ee3]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2012). Medium credibility.

The genus Enterococcus includes some of the most important nosocomial multidrug-resistant organisms, and these pathogens usually affect patients who are debilitated by other, concurrent illnesses and undergoing prolonged hospitalization. This Review discusses the factors involved in the changing epidemiology of enterococcal infections, with an emphasis on Enterococcus faecium as an emergent and challenging nosocomial problem. The effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota and on colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci are highlighted, including how enterococci benefit from the antibiotic-mediated eradication of gram-negative members of the gut microbiota. Analyses of enterococcal genomes indicate that there are certain genetic lineages, including an E. faecium clade of ancient origin, with the ability to succeed in the hospital environment, and the possible virulence determinants that are found in these genetic lineages are discussed. Finally, we review the most important mechanisms of resistance to the antibiotics that are used to treat vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

### Editorial commentary: linezolid vs daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant enterococci: the evidence gap between trials and clinical experience [^d06051ce]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

There have been 3 independent systematic reviews of the literature with meta-analysis that sought to compare DAP or linezolid for treatment of VRE-BSI. Although the studies differed in some regards, all 3 meta-analysis suggested a survival benefit of linezolid over DAP. What was perhaps more impressive than the meta-analysis results was the fact that all 3 investigations found significant methodological limitations to the underlying literature. The limitations of prior studies included variable case definitions, limited sample size, heterogeneous patient populations, wide variation in outcome measures, insufficient DAP dosing, and documented but unadjusted treatment selection bias. The methodology of previous studies of VRE-BSI has not been robust and despite rigorous analysis of the literature, the data are not compelling to make sound therapeutic conclusions regarding the best available therapy for VRE-BSI.

Due to the limitations of available studies, the current manuscript by Britt et al represents a welcome contribution to the literature on VRE-BSI and a step forward in the quality of study design. The authors were able to harness the infrastructure of the Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic medical record to generate a multicenter national cohort investigation of the treatment of VRE-BSI. The authors were careful to choose patients only treated with DAP or linezolid, not those who received sequential treatment. Unlike other investigations, patients were treated with higher doses of DAP (6 mg/kg), although probably not optimal DAP doses for VRE. The authors supplemented electronic data extraction with detailed chart review, including identification of negative culture results, source of infection, and source control. The authors a priori defined outcomes measures that have "real-world" clinical relevance. The nuts and bolts of the study were sound, and the study was well designed.

### Antimicrobial agents-optimising the ecological balance [^1a3c3b25]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

What's new in the pipeline?

Since the approval of telavancin in 2009 and ceftaroline in 2010, five new antibiotics have been approved by the FDA, three of which have mainly gram-positive activity and two directed against gram-negative pathogens. Oritavancin and dalbavancin are long-acting, synthetic lipoglycopeptides with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and are approved for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Tedizolid, an oxazolidinone-class antibiotic similar to linezolid, is licensed for treatment of these infections, with treatment for other indications underway, including hospital-acquired pneumonia. While these new drugs have the advantage of being utilised in the outpatient setting, thus avoiding prolonged intravenous use and length of hospital stay, they are still costly and questions remain as to their utility in the treatment of more serious clinical infections such as bacteraemia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis and device-related infections. Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are approved for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections; nevertheless, the latter is only approved for use in patients with limited or no treatment options as it was the first drug to go through the recommended regulatory pathway and deemed to be an "unmet medical need drug". Both antibiotics have activity against extended spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC producers and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but only ceftazidime/avibactam has activity against Class A carbapenemases.

### Rational design of a hospital-specific phage cocktail to treat Enterobacter cloacae complex infections [^f2e7afc6]. Nature Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

To bridge the divide between broad-spectrum phage cocktails and personalized therapy, we designed a phage product that was targeted towards a high-risk, multiclonal outbreak of a nosocomial pathogen at a local hospital. We targeted Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC), which is an emerging group of nosocomial pathogens that pose a substantial threat to human health due to their acquisition of virulence and AMR determinants. Classified among the ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphyllococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species) pathogens, this complex encompasses the clinically relevant species E. cloacae, E. asburiae, E. hormaechei, E. kobei and E. ludwigii, which can cause diverse infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, intraabdominal infection and bacteraemia. Notably, these pathogens have considerable epidemic potential, having contributed to a global surge in carbapenem-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing phenotypes, and were responsible for numerous clonal hospital outbreaks with limited treatment options –. As a result, ECC is increasingly associated with severe AMR infections in healthcare settings and was associated with > 200,000 deaths globally in 2019 alone –.

The Alfred Hospital, a tertiary referral centre in Melbourne, Australia, has reported an ongoing outbreak of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales infections over the past decade. A retrospective analysis of bloodstream infections at this centre noted that ECC contributed ~20 cases per year, with a recent surge in ECC infections from 2018–2021. Given this clinical burden, there was an urgent need to develop alternative treatments against this endemic nosocomial AMR pathogen. To address this, we developed a tailored phage product that is suitable for frontline use against this ECC outbreak at The Alfred Hospital. We developed a standardized approach that combines academic phage research with clinical insights backed by an extensive collection of 206 clinical ECC isolates over the past decade. This enabled the creation of Entelli-02, an institution-specific phage cocktail that not only demonstrates frontline efficacy but also ensures rapid availability of an effective antimicrobial. Our approach bridges personalized phage therapy with broad-spectrum phage products that are tailored towards a given hospital's (that is, institution) pathogen profile and addresses the urgent need for effective treatment options against AMR pathogens in healthcare settings.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^db6409bf]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Because VRE, particularly E. faecium strains, exhibit resistance to many antimicrobials traditionally used to target vancomycin-susceptible isolates, the treatment of patients with VRE UTIs remains a challenge for the clinician. Indeed, no drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with VRE UTIs, and reliable clinical data about the optimal management of VRE UTIs are lacking in the scientific literature. Among the therapeutic options to be considered are those that have demonstrated activity against VRE in vitro, including older agents such as doxycycline, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin and newer agents such as daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin–dalfopristin, and tigecycline.

Daptomycin is a bactericidal cyclic lipopeptide approved by the FDA for the management of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible isolates of a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and for the management of bacteremia, including that associated with right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus. Although the approved use of daptomycin in enterococcal infections is limited to the treatment of patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by vancomycin-susceptible isolates of E. faecalis, 100% and 99.7% of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis and E. faecium, respectively, were susceptible to daptomycin in more than 700 nonurinary VRE strains collected in the United States between 2007 and 2008. The daptomycin minimal inhibitory concentration required for 90% inhibition (MIC 90) of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis was determined to be 1 μg/mL, whereas that for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was 2 μg/mL. The use of daptomycin is a particularly promising pharmacotherapeutic approach against VRE UTIs because 50% to 70% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine 24 hours after intravenous administration compared with 30% to 40% for linezolid, 15% to 19% for quinupristin–dalfopristin, and 20% to 30% for tigecycline. Moreover, another case series has described the successful use of daptomycin in patients with VRE UTIs.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^17879701]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Daptomycin — enterococcal infective endocarditis (IE) considerations: Enterococci are considered daptomycin susceptible with MIC ≤ 4 μg/mL, and although > 90% of enterococci are reportedly susceptible in vitro, daptomycin is FDA approved for treatment of S aureus infections but not for enterococcal infections and is not approved for pediatric patients; the number of published vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium IE cases treated with daptomycin is extremely small with variable success, including cure in 6 of 9 patients in one report and deaths in another series. Other investigators have suggested higher doses (8–10 mg·kg−1·d−1) and combination regimens; in vitro evaluations suggested that ampicillin and ceftriaxone with daptomycin demonstrate the greatest synergistic activity compared with other β-lactam–daptomycin combinations. In summary, there are insufficient data to recommend monotherapy with daptomycin for multidrug-resistant enterococcal IE; if selected, doses of 10 to 12 mg·kg−1.24 h−1 may be considered, and consideration may be given to combinations including ampicillin or ceftriaxone, particularly when MICs are within the susceptible range (< 4 μg/mL).

Infections due to Gram-positive Bacteria

A safety and efficacy study provided experience on the use of ZYVOX in pediatric patients for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and other infections due to Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium. Pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 11 years with infections caused by the documented or suspected Gram-positive bacteria were enrolled in a randomized, open-label, comparator-controlled trial. One group of patients received ZYVOX I.V. Injection 10 mg/kg every 8 hours followed by ZYVOX for Oral Suspension 10 mg/kg every 8 hours. A second group received vancomycin 10 to 15 mg/kg intravenously every 6 to 24 hours, depending on age and renal clearance. Patients who had confirmed VRE infections were placed in a third arm of the study and received ZYVOX 10 mg/kg every 8 hours intravenously and/or orally. All patients were treated for a total of 10 to 28 days and could receive concomitant Gram-negative antibacterial drugs if clinically indicated. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, there were 206 patients randomized to linezolid and 102 patients randomized to vancomycin. The cure rates for ITT, MITT, and clinically evaluable patients are presented in Table 16. After the study was completed, 13 additional patients ranging from 4 days through 16 years of age were enrolled in an open-label extension of the VRE arm of the study. Table 17 provides clinical cure rates by pathogen for microbiologically evaluable patients including microbiologically evaluable patients with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium from the extension of this study.

### Treatment of meningitis caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium: high-dose and combination daptomycin therapy [^b9b4d808]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report 3 successful treatments of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium meningitis in adults using daptomycin and either linezolid or gentamicin.

Case Summary

Three case reports involving males (aged 58–78 years) are presented; in each case (trigeminal nerve microvascular decompression and subdural hygroma; paraspinal abscess; and hydrocephalus with subsequent craniotomy and ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement) CSF examination revealed vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) susceptible to daptomycin, gentamicin, and/or linezolid. Threeto four-week treatment regimens with daptomycin 6–12 mg/kg and either gentamicin or linezolid led to clinical resolution and microbiological clearance of infection.

Discussion

Daptomycin has previously been shown to be successful in treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated meningitis and other serious VRE and enterococcal infections. Higher than approved doses of daptomycin were used in 2 cases where in theory higher CSF concentrations would thus be obtained. Gentamicin and linezolid were added to daptomycin therapy based on in vitro data synergy results and because of documented successful treatment for VRE meningitis, respectively.

Conclusions

The difficulty in treating VRE CSF infections involves both drug kinetics and microbial resistance factors, as well as external factors such as foreign bodies like shunts. This report highlighted 3 cases where daptomycin use in concert with either gentamicin or linezolid was successful in treating this infection. Additional controlled trials will be helpful in identifying the best strategies when using daptomycin to treat CSF infections.

### Efficacy of current agents used in the treatment of Gram-positive infections and the consequences of resistance [^3d1bd251]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

The proportion of pathogens causing hospital-onset infections that are resistant to antimicrobial agents continues to increase worldwide. Inadequate antimicrobial therapy is an important factor in the emergence of resistance and is associated with increased mortality. In the USA in 2000, the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system reported that > 50% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from intensive care units were resistant to methicillin (MRSA). The emergence of community-acquired MRSA is a new concern. MRSA are associated with adverse clinical outcomes and increased hospital costs. The increasing prevalence of MRSA contributes to the use of glycopeptides; however, isolates with intermediate and full resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin are now being reported. Newer agents, such as the oxazolidinone linezolid, are effective in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections; however, linezolid-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus have been reported. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for new agents with activity against Gram-positive pathogens. Daptomycin, a lipopeptide with a novel mode of action, was recently approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in the USA. The two case studies presented herein detail experience with the use of daptomycin in the USA.

The safety and effectiveness of ZYVOX for the treatment of pediatric patients with the following infection have been established in a comparator-controlled study in pediatric patients ranging in age from 5 through 17 years [see Clinical Studies (14)]:

uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only) or Streptococcus pyogenes

Pharmacokinetic information generated in pediatric patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts showed variable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) linezolid concentrations following single and multiple dosing of linezolid; therapeutic concentrations were not consistently achieved or maintained in the CSF. Therefore, the use of linezolid for the empiric treatment of pediatric patients with central nervous system infections is not recommended.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^6ed61279]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infections have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Many factors can increase the risk of colonization with VRE. These include previous antibiotic therapy (the number and duration of antibiotics received) prolonged hospitalization, hospitalization in an intensive care unit severity of illness, invasive procedures and devices, gastrointestinal surgery, transplantation, proximity to another VRE-positive patient.

Affected patients usually have multiple and relevant co-morbidities, with prolonged hospital stay and received long courses of broad spectrum antibiotics.

In the survey of Montravers and coworkers no differences in frequency of isolation of Candida spp were identified in community or hospital acquired IAIs, and the overall prevalence was under 5%, in contrast with other observations, especially those related to patients with recurrent gastrointestinal perforation/anastomotic leakage.

Although the epidemiological role of Candida spp in nosocomial peritonitis is not yet defined, the clinical role is significant, because Candidal isolation is normally associated to a poor prognosis.

The same study group on 2006 published an elegant retrospective, case-control study conducted in critically ill patients admitted to 17 French ICUs where the yielding of Candida spp from peritoneal specimen was a variable independently associated to mortality in the setting of nosocomial peritonitis.

More recently Montravers and coll. reported a mortality rate of 38% in a prospective cohort of 93 patients admitted to ICU with candidal peritonitis.

Therefore, like for Enterococci, the inclusion of an anticandidal drug in the empiric regimen of severe nosocomial acquired IAIs, seems appropriate as confirmed by IDSA guidelines.

The recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis don't comprise a chapter specifically dedicated to candidal peritonitis. However the expert panels generically favor the use of echinocandins as first line empirical therapy in severely ill patients, recommending fluconazole for less severe conditions.

Therefore, transferring this concept to the context of IAIs we might advise the proscription of echinocandins as first line treatment in severe nosocomial IAIs. The IDSA guidelines also recommend the transition from an echinocandin to fluconazole for patients clinically stable and who have isolates of Candida spp susceptible to fluconazole; so the final recommendation would be to start with an echinocandin and to de-escalate to fluconazole as soon as possible on a clinical or microbiological basis.

In appendices 9,10 are summarized the antimicrobial regimens for hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infections, recommended by WSES consensus conference.

### A rationally designed antigen elicits protective antibodies against multiple nosocomial Gram-positive pathogens [^b41a0117]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Enterococci are Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic microorganisms colonising a broad range of hosts, from invertebrates to mammals, including humans –. When the delicate host bacteria equilibrium is disturbed, Enterococcus sp. can cause life-threatening infections, which are often difficult to treat because of multiple intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistances. Indeed, enterococci are one of the major nosocomial pathogens, as they easily infect patients with recent surgery, organ transplantation, diabetes, malignancy, and renal insufficiency. E. faecium infections have high rates of antibiotic resistance and mortality, with more and more strains able to resist to most clinically available antibiotics. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has therefore declared vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREfm) a threat to humankind for which rapid actions are needed. Prevention of these infections through vaccines can reduce the usage of antibiotics, and decrease lengths of hospitalisations. Several vaccine antigen candidates against E. faecium have been investigated –, but there is so far no vaccine clinically available. Indeed, WHO has broadly categorised bacterial pathogens in four Pipeline Feasibility groups (A-D) in terms of feasibility of vaccine development, based on the progression of vaccine candidates in clinical and preclinical development. In this classification, E. faecium belongs to Pipeline Feasibility Group D (low), including "difficult" AMR priority pathogens for which no vaccine candidate has been identified in clinical or preclinical development.

### The WHO bacterial priority pathogens list 2024: a prioritisation study to guide research, development, and public health strategies against antimicrobial resistance [^bfb36aa3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Another notable update in the 2024 WHO BPPL is the reclassification of carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa from critical to high. This downgrade might reflect observed decreases in resistance trends in at least one WHO region, and aligns with other estimates, such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019 list, which categorises carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa as "serious" rather than "critical". Although the overall burden of carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa is lower than that of other critical Gram-negative pathogens, it remains an important concern in some populations and regions, particularly where resistance mechanisms are more prevalent. Therefore, reclassification to high priority does not lessen the urgency for sustained and targeted investments in research and development, which remain essential to develop effective treatments and diagnostics for carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa infections.

Several pathogens, including MRSA, remain in the high priority category. Despite its considerable global burden, MRSA's ranking reflects its designation as highly treatable in the MCDA assessment. However, inequitable access to treatments and prevention measures continues to exacerbate its burden, especially in resource-limited settings, and must be urgently addressed to mitigate the threat of MRSA and reduce global disparities. Another pathogen that remains in the high priority category is vancomycin-resistant E faecium. While often an asymptomatic coloniser, vancomycin-resistant E faecium can cause severe opportunistic infections, including endocarditis and bacteraemia. The emergence of vancomycin-resistant E faecium is driven by multiple factors. The horizontal transfer of vanA and vanB gene clusters via plasmids facilitates the spread of resistance, and the global dissemination of clonal complex 17 (CC17) strains, which are often multidrug resistant, significantly contributes to the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant E faecium in health-care settings; the epidemiology is further complicated by the potential for animal-to-human transmission. Compounded by limited access to molecular diagnostics and effective treatments, these factors underscore the increasing importance of vancomycin-resistant E faecium as a nosocomial pathogen.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^200ba6dc]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in infective endocarditis — epidemiology and agents: The rapid emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci has become a global issue of major clinical importance. Most of these strains are E faecium, and as many as 95% of strains express multidrug resistance to vancomycin, aminoglycosides, and penicillins; only about 3% of E faecalis strains are multidrug resistant, and many vancomycin-resistant E faecalis are penicillin susceptible. Enterococci are considered to be resistant to vancomycin if MICs are > 4 μg/mL. Linezolid and daptomycin are the only 2 antimicrobial agents currently available in the United States that may be useful for the treatment of multidrug-resistant E faecium IE; quinupristin-dalfopristin may be active in vitro only against strains of E faecium and is inactive against E faecalis, and tigecycline is active in vitro against some strains of multidrug-resistant enterococci, but there are minimal published data on its use clinically.

### Mortality in enterococcal bloodstream infections increases with inappropriate antimicrobial therapy [^a6e863e8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Enterococcus species are common in nosocomial bloodstream infections and their incidence is rising. Although well recognized in several serious bacterial infections, the influence of appropriate antimicrobial therapy in enterococcal bacteraemia has not been fully settled. The aim of the study was to determine whether administration of inappropriate antibiotics in enterococcal bacteraemia is an independent risk factor for mortality, among other known and suspected risk factors. We conducted a cohort study of E. faecalis/faecium bacteraemia during a 3-year period at a single tertiary care hospital in Denmark. Patients with growth of non-enterococcus co-pathogens apart from the enterococcal bacteraemia were also included, as were patients with repeated enterococcal bacteraemia. Time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy was counted from the first episode. Appropriate antibiotic therapy was defined as any therapy with documented clinical effect, in vitro activity and a minimum treatment length of 6 days. Multivariate regression models were built to determine the independent risk factors for mortality. We included 196 patients with enterococcal bacteraemia. Appropriate antibiotics for at least 6 days were administered in 146 of these (74%). Thirty-day mortality was 26%. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality: appropriate antimicrobial therapy for ≥ 6 days (odds ratio for mortality 0.33, 0.14–0.79), ICU admission (4.2, 1.7–10), thrombocytopenia (3.9, 1.6–9.3), chronic liver failure (3.3, 1.1–10) and age ≥ 60 years (2.2, 0.99–5.0). Antibiotics not appropriately covering enterococci are frequently administered empirically in suspected bloodstream infections. Inappropriate antibiotic therapy was an independent risk factor for mortality in enterococcal bacteraemia.

### Successful treatment of Enterococcus gallinarum infection in a neonate with vancomycin: a case report [^b099783b]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Enterococcus gallinarum (EG) is a predominant component of the normal flora in the intestinal tracts of avian species. Although its strains are seldom isolated from clinical specimens, EG, a facultative anaerobe, catalase-negative, chain-forming gram-positive D-group coccus, is occasionally found in human foods such as fish, meat, and cheese. In immunocompromised hosts, EG can lead to septicaemia. Despite some reports, the clinical epidemiology of EG remains poorly understood. Colonization and infection by species of the E. gallinarum group are less frequent than those of other well-known enterococcal species, such as E. faecalis and E. faecium. However, according to existing trends, their frequency may increase worldwide. Although the isolation of EG from cerebrospinal fluid is infrequent, its occurrence has been rising due to increased antibiotic use and invasive therapeutic interventions, particularly in NICUs. EG inherently exhibits resistance to vancomycin but shows high sensitivity to linezolid. Despite in vitro resistance, vancomycin has demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating EG meningitis.

### Linezolid (Zyvox) [^c9376143]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1	Nosocomial Pneumonia

ZYVOX is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates) or Streptococcus pneumoniae [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.2	Community-acquired Pneumonia

ZYVOX is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, including cases with concurrent bacteremia, or Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.3	Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

ZYVOX is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, including diabetic foot infections, without concomitant osteomyelitis, caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus agalactiae. ZYVOX has not been studied in the treatment of decubitus ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.4	Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

ZYVOX is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.5	Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium Infections

ZYVOX is indicated for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, including cases with concurrent bacteremia [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.6	Limitations of Use

ZYVOX is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections. It is critical that specific Gram-negative therapy be initiated immediately if a concomitant Gram-negative pathogen is documented or suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
The safety and efficacy of ZYVOX formulations given for longer than 28 days have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.7	Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZYVOX and other antibacterial drugs, ZYVOX should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Enterococcus faecium bacteremia… [^4976579d]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features and outcome of 53 patients with E faecium bacteremia. Results. Therapy recorded for E faecium bacteremia included information on the dosage and duration of all antimicrobial agents used. Documentation was made if single, dual, or no drug therapy was attempted. Data were also collected if other interventions were made in attempt to treat the infection and/or bacteremia. With respect to treatment, patients with VRE bacteremia were just as likely to receive some form of specific antimicrobial agent therapy as their VSE counterparts: 15 vs 24 patients, respectively. Combination therapy, usually with a β-lactam antibiotic or vancomycin plus an aminoglycoside, was given equally to the patients of both groups.

Not surprisingly, use of vancomycin therapy was significantly higher in the VSE group, with 18 patients with VSE receiving this agent compared with 4 patients with VRE. Ampicillin, given at high doses as a continuous infusion, was used more frequently in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by VRE. Unconventional and investigational therapies, such as a combination product of quinupristin and dalfopristin, 25 an experimental streptogramin, were used to treat patients in the VRE group. Central venous catheter removal as an additional therapy was significantly more common in patients with VRE bacteremia. There was no difference in surgical debridement of infected tissue between the 2 groups. Aside from this one report, accumulating evidence confirms that vancomycin resistance does indeed have a significant adverse impact on the outcome of patients who develop E faecium bacteremia.

A reasonable alternative to immediate institution of unconventional antimicrobial therapy is to observe these patients, repeat cultures, and perform other conservative measures, such as the removal or replacement of intravenous and urinary catheters. More aggressive therapeutic measures can then be undertaken if additional blood cultures are positive. In addition to the high mortality, we demonstrated substantial additional hospitalization costs associated with VRE bacteremia. In today's health care environment, understanding the financial impact of this multidrug-resistant organism is crucial since controlling infection with VRE becomes both medically necessary and economically important.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^f498824a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Probiotics for prevention of traveler's diarrhea — evidence summary and guideline stance: Despite their appeal, supporting data are not consistently strong and the guideline states we do not recommend them for this purpose. Enterococcus faecium did not prevent TD, while Saccharomyces boulardii given to 3,000 Austrian travelers produced a clinically modest dose-dependent benefit, most notable in travelers to North Africa and Turkey. Lactobacillus GG showed mixed results: among 276 Finnish travelers in Turkey, the diarrhea attack rate was 41% vs. 46.5% with placebo with protection 39.5% at one location and almost nil at the other; in a US study of 245 travelers, incidence per day at risk was 3.9% vs. 7.4% with a calculated protection rate of 47%. Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and a nonviable formulation of Lactobacillus acidophilus were ineffective.

### Comparison of the effectiveness and safety of linezolid and daptomycin in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bloodstream infection: a national cohort study of veterans affairs patients [^e3209285]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bloodstream infections (VRE-BSIs) are becoming increasingly common. Linezolid and daptomycin are the primary treatment options for VRE-BSI, but optimal treatment is unclear.

Methods

This was a national retrospective cohort study comparing linezolid and daptomycin for the treatment of VRE-BSI among Veterans Affairs Medical Center patients admitted during 2004–2013. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as a composite of (1) 30-day all-cause mortality; (2) microbiologic failure; and (3) 60-day VRE-BSI recurrence. Poisson regression was conducted to determine if antimicrobial treatment was independently associated with clinical outcomes.

Results

A total of 644 patients were included (linezolid, n = 319; daptomycin, n = 325). Overall, treatment failure was 60.9% (n = 392/644), and 30-day all-cause mortality was 38.2% (n = 246/644). Linezolid was associated with a significantly higher risk of treatment failure compared with daptomycin (risk ratio [RR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–1.67; P = 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors in Poisson regression, the relationship between linezolid use and treatment failure persisted (adjusted RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02–1.30; P = 0.026). Linezolid was also associated with higher 30-day mortality (42.9% vs 33.5%; RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04–1.32; P = 0.014) and microbiologic failure rates (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02–1.18; P = 0.011). No difference in 60-day VRE-BSI recurrence was observed between treatment groups.

Conclusions

Treatment with linezolid for VRE-BSI resulted in significantly higher treatment failure in comparison to daptomycin. Linezolid treatment was also associated with greater 30-day all-cause mortality and microbiologic failure in this cohort.

### Impact of antibiotic use on the evolution of Enterococcus faecium [^a9980fb7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

What traits confer fitness in an environment? The most obvious are those that contribute to the abilities to survive and proliferate. The ability to proliferate depends on many factors, among which are acquiring energy to drive cell division and acquiring or making nutrients necessary to assemble the constituents of a new cell (which, for enterococci, means importing about a dozen essential amino acids and vitamins). In nature, nutrient and energy availability fluctuate, so it is equally important to persist when not proliferating, and then to quickly take advantage of growth opportunities when they arise (ie, before a competing microbe does). This adaptability includes not only surviving troughs in nutrition availability but, for hospital-adapted enterococci, surviving in the harsh environment of the hospital between transmissions.

For commensal enterococci of the healthy human GIT, essential nutrients are provided by the diet and by other microbes within the normal human microbiome. The precise source of energy that drives cell division is unknown, but a recent report shows that operons for the use of different carbohydrates are among the greatest genetic differences between commensal E. faecium and those associated with infection. One carbohydrate pathway characteristic of infection-derived E. faecium was shown to provide a colonization advantage in the antibiotic-treated mouse gut. Possession of operons for use of different carbohydrate use is good evidence that, in the guts of antibiotic-treated patients, hospital strains of E. faecium obtain energy from a source different from that for commensals.

### Survival of patients with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteremia treated with conventional or high doses of daptomycin or linezolid is associated with the rate of bacterial clearance [^c714318b]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are important pathogens for healthcare-associated infections. Although linezolid is bacteriostatic and daptomycin is rapidly bactericidal against vancomycin-resistant enterococci in vitro, it is not clear whether they differ in their effect on bacterial clearance in patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream infections.

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

Two university hospitals and research laboratory.

Patients

Patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream infection proven by blood cultures were prospectively enrolled from January 2010 to July 2015.

Interventions

Sequential blood samples were collected. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to monitor bacterial loads.

Measurements and Main Results

One hundred eight patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream infection were enrolled. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were performed on 465 blood isolates. We found this method to be closely correlated with colony-forming units and more sensitive than culture. Sixty-three patients (58.3%) received "conventional dose" daptomycin (6-9mg/kg), 15 (13.9%) received high-dose daptomycin (≥ 9mg/kg), and 30 (27.8%) were treated with linezolid (600mg every 12 hr) as sole agents. The initial mean bacterial load was 1.03 log10 copies/mL and unrelated to survival. Survivors had a more rapid early bacterial clearance than nonsurvivors (Δ log10 copies/mL/d; -0.16 vs 0.31; p = 0.02). Multivariable logistic regression showed that a slower early bacterial clearance independently predicted increased mortality (odds ratio, 3.21; 95% CI, 1.03–10.02; p = 0.045). Conventional dose daptomycin was associated with a significantly slower rate of bacterial clearance than high-dose daptomycin (Δ log10 copies/mL/d; -0.04 vs -0.41; p < 0.001) and linezolid (-0.04 vs -0.56; p = 0.043).

Conclusions

We found that survivors of vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream infection had a significantly more rapid early bacterial clearance by quantitative polymerase chain reaction than nonsurvivors. High-dose daptomycin and linezolid were associated with more rapid bacterial clearance than conventional dose daptomycin. These results support recommendations that conventional dose daptomycin not be used for the treatment of patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream infection.
