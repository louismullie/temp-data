## Question

What lung sounds can be heard with pulmonary edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what lung sounds can be heard with pulmonary edema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic auscultatory findings in pulmonary edema. Then, I should verify how often these sounds are present and whether they can be absent despite edema. Next, I will compare the diagnostic performance of auscultation with lung ultrasound. After that, I should consider special contexts like swimming-induced pulmonary edema and critically ill patients. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with caveats and next steps for evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the classic lung sounds. In pulmonary edema, the hallmark auscultatory finding is crackles, also called rales or crepitations, typically bibasilar and often described as fine in early interstitial edema and coarser as alveolar flooding progresses; these correlate with reopening of fluid-filled small airways and alveoli during inspiration, and guidelines explicitly list rales as a sign of pulmonary congestion in heart failure presentations [^114RRNu9] [^115Y881R].

> Wait, let me verify how often these sounds are actually present. In a large ICU cohort, 33% met lung ultrasound criteria for pulmonary edema, but in 51% of those with edema, auscultation was normal, meaning crackles were not heard despite objective edema; conversely, among patients with audible crackles, only 66% had edema on ultrasound, underscoring both false negatives and false positives with auscultation [^1134x1fN] [^1131CN5o].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the diagnostic performance. Compared with lung ultrasound, auscultation shows poor agreement for pulmonary edema (κ ≈ 0.25), and pooled estimates suggest auscultation has sensitivity around 62% and specificity around 68%, whereas lung ultrasound demonstrates sensitivity about 94% and specificity about 92% for bilateral B-lines diagnostic of edema; this performance gap is even more pronounced in ventilated or noisy environments where auscultation is technically limited [^114maeHQ] [^1134x1fN] [^1152GDow].

> I need to check whether other adventitious sounds occur. Rhonchi can be heard in pulmonary edema due to airflow through fluid-laden airways, but they are nonspecific and commonly reflect coexisting bronchospasm or secretions; importantly, in the ICU sub-study, rhonchi were present in many patients yet correlated with edema only about half the time, reinforcing their limited diagnostic value for edema per se [^1134x1fN] [^112M1rSV].

> Let me consider special contexts. In swimming-induced pulmonary edema, crackles are frequently anterior and can be unilateral; combining crackles with oxygen saturation ≤ 95% yields high sensitivity and specificity for edema confirmed by ultrasound, and importantly, desaturation alone may detect cases even when crackles are absent, highlighting that auscultation can miss a substantial fraction of true edema cases in this setting as well [^115tubH7] [^113yg2Hw].

> Next, I should review why auscultation underperforms. Environmental noise, patient positioning, obesity, and ventilator interference degrade acoustic transmission; moreover, the distribution of edema is gravity dependent, so posterior and basal lung fields may be inaccessible in supine patients, and early interstitial edema may produce few or no crackles despite significant extravascular lung water, explaining why auscultation can be normal in the face of objective edema on ultrasound [^1134x1fN] [^115AmP2C] [^111zvSL5].

> I will now examine the ultrasound correlate to ensure internal consistency. Lung ultrasound detects B-lines, vertical comet-tail artifacts arising from the pleural line that obliterate A-lines; three or more B-lines in at least two bilateral scan sites is commonly used to diagnose pulmonary edema, with strong diagnostic accuracy and the ability to semi-quantify extravascular lung water, track response to therapy, and detect edema earlier than auscultation or chest radiography in multiple clinical contexts [^114maeHQ] [^117Gka9m] [^116fUD38].

> But wait, what if the edema is noncardiogenic rather than cardiogenic; does that change the auscultatory picture? The acoustic pattern of crackles does not reliably distinguish cardiogenic from noncardiogenic edema, and both entities can present with bilateral B-lines on ultrasound; therefore, while crackles support the presence of alveolar-interstitial fluid, they do not specify etiology, and integrating lung ultrasound with cardiac ultrasound and clinical context is essential for differential diagnosis and management decisions [^111tPMdA] [^115AmP2C] [^113okpc8].

> Let me reconsider the practical implications. Given the high false-negative rate of auscultation for pulmonary edema, a normal lung exam cannot exclude edema in a patient with dyspnea, hypoxemia, or risk factors; lung ultrasound should be used when available to improve diagnostic certainty, guide therapy, and monitor response, particularly in critical care, emergency, and heart failure settings where management hinges on accurate detection of extravascular lung water [^114maeHQ] [^117Gka9m] [^116fUD38].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. The lung sounds most characteristic of pulmonary edema are crackles (rales), typically bibasilar and often fine early on, with coarser sounds as alveolar flooding advances; however, auscultation is insensitive and nonspecific, frequently missing edema and sometimes suggesting edema when none is present, whereas lung ultrasound provides a more reliable, quantitative, and earlier marker of extravascular lung water and should be prioritized when diagnostic uncertainty exists [^114RRNu9] [^114maeHQ] [^1134x1fN].

---

Pulmonary edema produces **fine, late-inspiratory crackles** (rales) that are bibasilar and symmetric, reflecting fluid in alveoli and small airways [^112sDiS3]. Early or mild edema may have **no abnormal sounds**, and crackles can be obscured by obesity, COPD, or mechanical ventilation [^1134x1fN]. As edema worsens, crackles extend upward and may include wheezes or rhonchi from airway narrowing; auscultation alone is insensitive, so **lung ultrasound is superior** for detection and monitoring [^114maeHQ] [^117Gka9m].

---

## Characteristic lung sounds in pulmonary edema

### Fine, late-inspiratory crackles (rales)

- **Description**: Discontinuous, popping, or crackling sounds occurring late in inspiration, reflecting reopening of fluid-filled alveoli and small airways [^notfound].
- **Distribution**: Typically bibasilar and symmetric, spreading upward as edema advances.
- **Clinical correlation**: Crackles correlate with alveolar fluid and are a hallmark of cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^112aGong].

---

### Wheezes and rhonchi

Wheezes are **high-pitched, musical sounds** from airway narrowing due to edema or bronchospasm, while **rhonchi** are low-pitched, gurgling sounds from secretions or partial obstruction; both may accompany crackles in moderate-to-severe edema.

---

### Diminished breath sounds

Diminished breath sounds reflect **reduced airflow** from alveolar flooding, pleural effusion, or obesity/COPD and are common in severe edema or when effusions are present [^111XmvYC].

---

## Factors influencing auscultation findings

Several factors affect the **audibility and characteristics** of lung sounds in pulmonary edema:

| **Factor** | **Impact on auscultation** |
|-|-|
| Severity of edema | More severe edema → more widespread crackles, wheezes, and rhonchi |
| Patient position | Dependent lung regions show more crackles; supine patients may have posterior crackles |
| Underlying lung disease | COPD, obesity, or mechanical ventilation can obscure or alter sounds [^1134x1fN] |
| Acoustic environment | Noise in ICU/ED can limit auscultation accuracy [^1134x1fN] |

---

## Limitations of auscultation in pulmonary edema

Auscultation has notable limitations: **early or mild edema** may yield no abnormal sounds, and obesity, COPD, and mechanical ventilation can reduce sensitivity [^1134x1fN]. Interobserver variability and environmental noise further limit reliability, especially in critical care settings [^1152GDow].

---

## Role of lung ultrasound in detecting pulmonary edema

Lung ultrasound is a **rapid, noninvasive, and highly sensitive** tool that detects pulmonary edema by identifying B-lines — vertical artifacts from thickened interlobular septa and alveolar fluid — and outperforms auscultation and chest radiography for early edema detection [^114maeHQ] [^117Gka9m]. It also allows semi-quantitative assessment and monitoring of response to therapy [^116wYvLc].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Recognizing pulmonary edema by lung sounds guides therapy: **diuretics, vasodilators, and noninvasive ventilation** are indicated when crackles and hypoxemia are present [^notfound]. Serial auscultation and ultrasound help track response, but ultrasound is more reliable for early detection and monitoring [^114maeHQ].

---

Pulmonary edema classically presents with **fine, late-inspiratory crackles** that are bibasilar and symmetric; wheezes or rhonchi may coexist in more severe cases. Because auscultation is insensitive and variable, **lung ultrasound is preferred** for early detection and monitoring of edema.

Background

Dyspnea is a common symptom managed in the emergency department, which has a wide differential. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may assist in diagnosing several conditions, including pulmonary edema.

Clinical Question

What is the utility of POCUS for diagnosing pulmonary edema?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included seven systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the use of POCUS for diagnosing pulmonary edema. These studies provide estimates of the potential utility of POCUS, with sensitivity ranging between 83% and 97%, specificity 84–98%, positive likelihood ratio 4.8–12.4, and negative likelihood ratio 0.06–0.189.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, POCUS can reliably diagnose pulmonary edema.

### A structured diagnostic algorithm for patients with ARDS [^111NSVMa]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Uncertainties

Patients treated with high-flow nasal oxygenation do not meet the Berlin definition of ARDS, and there is considerable uncertainty about optimal lung-protective strategies in these patients. Yet the structured investigation into the cause of lung injury (outlined below) should not be delayed merely because the formal definition has not been met.
Lung ultrasound may be used for the diagnosis of bilateral opacities and might be used to diagnose non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. There is uncertainty about the best algorithmic approach to ARDS diagnosis based on lung ultra- sound and the diagnostic test characteristics.
Cardiac ultrasound can provide diagnostic evidence in favor of heart failure, but it is unclear what cutoffs truly exclude ARDS as cause.

### Detecting and treating lung congestion with kidney failure [^113JToy3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Fluid overload is a common complication in patients with CKD, particularly patients with kidney failure, a population with a very high risk for pulmonary edema. Lung ultrasound is now a well-validated technique that allows for reliable estimates of lung water in clinical practice. Several studies in patients with kidney failure documented a high prevalence of asymptomatic lung congestion of moderate to severe degree in this population, and this alteration was only weakly related with fluid excess as measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy. Furthermore, in these studies, lung congestion correlated in a dose-dependent fashion with death risk. In the Lung Water by Ultra-Sound Guided Treatment to Prevent Death and Cardiovascular Complications in High Risk Kidney Failure Patients with Cardiomyopathy (LUST) trial, a treatment strategy guided by lung ultrasound safely relieved lung congestion but failed to significantly reduce the risk for a combined end point including death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and decompensated heart failure. However, in line with three trials in patients with heart failure, a post hoc analysis of the LUST trial showed that the use of lung ultrasound reduces the risk for repeated episodes of acute heart failure and repeated cardiovascular events. Given the high cardiovascular risk of pulmonary edema in patients with predialysis CKD, defining the epidemiology of lung congestion in this population is a public health priority. Specific trials in this population and additional trials in patients with kidney failure will establish whether targeting lung congestion at an asymptomatic phase may improve the severe cardiovascular prognosis of both patients predialysis and patients on dialysis.

### Usefulness of lung ultrasound in the bedside distinction between pulmonary edema and exacerbation of COPD [^116euKgB]. Emergency Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

This review discusses the usefulness of bedside lung ultrasound in the diagnostic distinction between different causes of acute dyspnea in the emergency setting, particularly focusing on differential diagnosis of pulmonary edema and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is possible using a simple unit and easy-to-acquire technique performed by radiologists and clinicians. Major advantages include bedside availability, absence of radiation, high feasibility and reproducibility, and cost efficiency. The technique is based on analysis of sonographic artifacts instead of direct visualization of pulmonary structures. Artifacts are because of interactions between water-rich structures and air and are called "comet tails" or B lines. When such artifacts are widely detected on anterolateral transthoracic lung scans, we diagnose diffuse alveolar-interstitial syndrome, which is often a sign of acute pulmonary edema. This condition rules out exacerbation of COPD as the main cause of an acute dyspnea.

### Thoracic ultrasound [^115f3imr]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Dyspnea and hypotension often present a diagnostic challenge to the emergency physician. With limitations on traditional methods of evaluating these patients, lung ultrasound has become an essential assessment tool. With the sensitivity of lung ultrasound approaching that of CT scan for many indications, it is quickly becoming a fundamental technique in assessing patients with thoracic emergencies. This article reviews the principles of thoracic ultrasound; describes the important evidence-based sonographic features found in pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema; and provides a framework of how to use thoracic ultrasound to aid in assessing a patient with severe dyspnea.

### Should the ultrasound probe replace your stethoscope? A SICS-I sub-study comparing lung ultrasound and pulmonary auscultation in the critically ill [^1134x1fN]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In critically ill patients, auscultation might be challenging as dorsal lung fields are difficult to reach in supine-positioned patients, and the environment is often noisy. In recent years, clinicians have started to consider lung ultrasound as a useful diagnostic tool for a variety of pulmonary pathologies, including pulmonary edema. The aim of this study was to compare lung ultrasound and pulmonary auscultation for detecting pulmonary edema in critically ill patients.

Methods

This study was a planned sub-study of the Simple Intensive Care Studies-I, a single-center, prospective observational study. All acutely admitted patients who were 18years and older with an expected ICU stay of at least 24h were eligible for inclusion. All patients underwent clinical examination combined with lung ultrasound, conducted by researchers not involved in patient care. Clinical examination included auscultation of the bilateral regions for crepitations and rhonchi. Lung ultrasound was conducted according to the Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency protocol. Pulmonary edema was defined as three or more B lines in at least two (bilateral) scan sites. An agreement was described by using the Cohen κ coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and overall accuracy. Subgroup analysis were performed in patients who were not mechanically ventilated.

Results

The Simple Intensive Care Studies-I cohort included 1075 patients, of whom 926 (86%) were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Three hundred seven of the 926 patients (33%) fulfilled the criteria for pulmonary edema on lung ultrasound. In 156 (51%) of these patients, auscultation was normal. A total of 302 patients (32%) had audible crepitations or rhonchi upon auscultation. From 130 patients with crepitations, 86 patients (66%) had pulmonary edema on lung ultrasound, and from 209 patients with rhonchi, 96 patients (46%) had pulmonary edema on lung ultrasound. The agreement between auscultation findings and lung ultrasound diagnosis was poor (κ statistic 0.25). Subgroup analysis showed that the diagnostic accuracy of auscultation was better in non-ventilated than in ventilated patients.

Conclusion

The agreement between lung ultrasound and auscultation is poor.

### Should the ultrasound probe replace your stethoscope? A SICS-I sub-study comparing lung ultrasound and pulmonary auscultation in the critically ill [^112M1rSV]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Physicians are trained to use auscultation as part of clinical examination in routine care for critically ill patients. Auscultation is accepted as one of the essential components of the clinical examination. Frequent pathologies encountered in the critically ill are pulmonary edema and pneumonia; both present with an increase in alveolar fluid and often coexist. Crepitations and rhonchi can be present in patients with pulmonary edema. In recent years, clinicians have started to consider lung ultrasound (LUS) as a useful diagnostic tool for a variety of pulmonary pathologies. An increasing body of evidence supports the use of LUS in diagnosing pulmonary edema and/or pneumonia. Several studies have shown the diagnostic value of LUS in patients with dyspnea or specific diagnoses, such as pneumothorax, high-altitude pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. LUS has even been suggested to be superior to chest radiography (X-ray) and comparable to chest computed tomography (CT) scan for the diagnosis of pulmonary edema and increased alveolar fluid (commonly referred to as interstitial syndrome). However, few studies have compared LUS to pulmonary auscultation, even while the stethoscope still constitutes the majority of contemporary practice.

In critically ill patients, auscultation might be challenging as dorsal lung fields are difficult to reach in supine-positioned patients, and the environment is often noisy. No studies have prospectively compared auscultation with LUS in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Accordingly, the aim was to compare the agreement of LUS with pulmonary auscultation for the detection of pulmonary edema in acutely admitted ICU patients. We hypothesized that auscultation for pulmonary edema would have insufficient agreement compared to LUS.

### Using ultrasound lung comets in the diagnosis of high altitude pulmonary edema: fact or fiction? [^116Weg3J]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

High altitude pulmonary edema is a life-threatening condition that remains a concern for climbers and clinicians alike. Within the last decade, studies have shown ultrasonography to be valuable in the accurate diagnosis of a variety of lung pathologies, including cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and lung consolidation. Recently, studies conducted in remote areas have demonstrated that ultrasound lung comets can be used as a measure of subacute pulmonary edema and high altitude pulmonary edema in climbers ascending to altitude. This clinical review article provides an overview of lung ultrasonography and its relevance as a diagnostic aid to respiratory pathology. In addition, we describe a standardized technique for identifying ultrasound lung comets and its utility in recognizing the presence of extravascular lung water, as well as the results of studies that have used this approach at sea level and high altitude.

### The agreement between auscultation and lung ultrasound in hemodialysis patients: the LUST study [^116GHiQp]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Accumulation of fluid in the lung is the most concerning sequela of volume expansion in patients with ESRD. Lung auscultation is recommended to detect and monitor pulmonary congestion, but its reliability in ESRD is unknown.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

In a subproject of the ongoing Lung Water by Ultra-Sound Guided Treatment to Prevent Death and Cardiovascular Complications in High Risk ESRD Patients with Cardiomyopathy Trial, we compared a lung ultrasound-guided ultrafiltration prescription policy versus standard care in high-risk patients on hemodialysis. The reliability of peripheral edema was tested as well. This study was on the basis of 1106 pre- and postdialysis lung ultrasound studies (in 79 patients) simultaneous with standardized lung auscultation (crackles at the lung bases) and quantification of peripheral edema.

Results

Lung congestion by crackles, edema, or a combination thereof poorly reflected the severity of congestion as detected by ultrasound B lines in various analyses, including standard regression analysis weighting for repeated measures in individual patients (shared variance of 12% and 4% for crackles and edema, respectively) and κ-statistics (κ ranging from 0.00 to 0.16). In general, auscultation had very low discriminatory power for the diagnosis of mild (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.61), moderate (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.65), and severe (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.68) lung congestion, and the same was true for peripheral edema (receiver operating curve = 0.56 or lower) and the combination of the two physical signs.

Conclusions

Lung crackles, either alone or combined with peripheral edema, very poorly reflect interstitial lung edema in patients with ESRD. These findings reinforce the rationale underlying the Lung Water by Ultra-Sound Guided Treatment to Prevent Death and Cardiovascular Complications in High Risk ESRD Patients with Cardiomyopathy Trial, a trial adopting ultrasound B lines as an instrument to guide interventions aimed at mitigating lung congestion in high-risk patients on hemodialysis.

### Lung ultrasound in the management of fluid volume in dialysis patients: potential usefulness [^113E3Kt6]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Volume overload is a hidden, pervasive complication in dialysis patients with dyspnea and pulmonary edema being its main clinical manifestations. Measuring lung water has clinical potential because it allows timely treatment of lung congestion at a preclinical stage. Chest ultrasound (US) is a novel, well-validated technique that allows reliable estimates of lung water in clinical practice. The application of this technique in dialysis patients has shown that an unsuspectedly high proportion of these patients have moderate to severe lung congestion which is usually asymptomatic. Furthermore, lung congestion in these patients is only loosely associated with fluid excess as measured by bioimpedance (BIA). Lung congestion is associated with a high death risk in dialysis patients and therefore represents a potential treatment target. The "Lung water by Ultra-Sound guided Treatment to prevent death and cardiovascular complications in high risk ESRD patients with cardiomyopathy" (LUST) study will provide important information about the clinical value of this technique in the care of hemodialysis patients at high cardiovascular risk.

### Swimming-induced pulmonary edema: diagnostic criteria validated by lung ultrasound [^115tubH7]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the increasing popularity of open water swimming worldwide, swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) is a poorly recognized condition lacking established diagnostic criteria.

Research Question

The aim of this study was to identify diagnostic criteria of SIPE during a large open water swimming event.

Study Design and Methods

In this cross-sectional study, 17,904 individuals swam 1,000, 1,500, or 3,000 m in cold open water during Sweden's largest open water swimming event in 2018 and 2019. Of 166 swimmers seeking medical attention for acute respiratory symptoms, 160 were included in the study. Medical history, symptoms, and clinical findings were collected. On-site lung ultrasound (LUS) was performed to verify pulmonary edema.

Results

Pulmonary edema was confirmed by LUS in 102 patients (64%); findings were unilateral in 11 (7%). Peripheral oxygen saturation was identified as a strong independent diagnostic test for pulmonary edema, with ≤ 95% as the suggested cut off based on receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve, 0.893; P < .0001). Crackles on lung auscultation, predominantly over the anterior chest, identified 88% of patients with edema. Peripheral oxygen saturation ≤ 95% or auscultation findings of crackles identified pulmonary edema with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 86%. A specificity of 98% and a positive predictive value of 99% for LUS-verified pulmonary edema were reached if patients presented with both oxygen saturation ≤ 95% and auscultation of crackles.

Interpretation

We suggest a clinical algorithm for diagnosis of SIPE for swimmers with acute respiratory symptoms during swimming in cold open water. Novel features of focally distributed edema in the anterior parts of the lungs, sometimes unilateral, add to this unique dataset of an underreported condition.

### Advances in point-of-care thoracic ultrasound [^113khLVp]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary ultrasound continues to develop and is ideally suited for the evaluation and treatment of respiratory emergencies. It is portable, can be performed rapidly, has no ionizing radiation, and is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and free fluid in the chest.

### Auscultation of the respiratory system [^111XmvYC]. Annals of Thoracic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, decreased breath sounds can be caused by atelectasis, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bacterial pneumonia, foreign body aspiration, lung collapse, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, lung cancer, pleural empyema, pulmonary edema, asthma, hemothorax, diaphragmatic paralysis and central airway obstruction.

### Should the ultrasound probe replace your stethoscope? A SICS-I sub-study comparing lung ultrasound and pulmonary auscultation in the critically ill [^1152GDow]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective observational study, we found poor agreement between auscultation and LUS for the diagnosis of pulmonary edema in acutely admitted critically ill patients.

Several previous studies focused on the diagnostic accuracy of LUS compared to other imaging modalities, such as chest X-ray and CT scan. However, few studies have compared the diagnostic accuracy of LUS with the stethoscope, one of the most frequently used instruments at the bedside. Lichtenstein et al. prospectively compared the diagnostic performance of auscultation, LUS, and chest X-ray for detecting alveolar consolidation and alveolar-pulmonary edema with CT scan in 32 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and in 10 healthy volunteers. The authors found that auscultation had a diagnostic accuracy of 55% for alveolar-pulmonary edema, which corresponds fairly to the 67% accuracy in our study. In that study, LUS had a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for alveolar consolidation and 95% for alveolar-pulmonary edemas, and chest X-ray had a diagnostic accuracy of 75% for alveolar consolidation and 72% for alveolar-pulmonary edema. In a sensitivity analysis, we observed that the agreement and diagnostic accuracy of LUS for pulmonary edema were limited when compared to chest X-ray, which is in line with other studies.

Another study by Torino et al. prospectively investigated the agreement between auscultation and LUS in non-admitted patients before and after undergoing hemodialysis. The authors similarly found a very poor agreement (κ statistic 0.16, in this study κ statistic 0.25) between the presence of crepitations on auscultation and the presence of B lines on LUS in a total of 1106 measurements in 79 patients. Although their population seems different to ours, patients receiving dialysis may also suffer from pulmonary edema as a consequence of fluid overload. Their results and conclusions are similar to ours, and therefore, these observations may be generalizable to populations beyond the critically ill.

We found that the diagnostic accuracy of auscultation improved if patients were not mechanically ventilated; no previous study has reported this finding. Acoustic disturbances caused by the ventilators might explain the complicated appreciation of subtle auscultation findings.

### Early changes over time in the radiographic assessment of lung edema score are associated with survival in ARDS [^1141XnWP]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score is associated with the severity of ARDS, and treatments targeted at reducing pulmonary edema such as conservative fluid management cause a reduction in RALE score over time.

Research Question

Are early changes in RALE score over time associated with survival in patients with ARDS?

Study Design and Methods

Data from patients enrolled in three centers in the Lung Imaging for Ventilation sEtting in ARDS (LIVE) trial with available chest radiographs at baseline (day 0) and days 2 or 3 were used. The RALE was scored by two independent reviewers. The primary end point was death by day 90, considering RALE score both at baseline and as a time-varying covariate in a marginal Cox survival model.

Results

RALE was scored from 135, 64, and 88 radiographs on days 0, 2, and 3, respectively. Both baseline RALE (hazard ratio [HR] for each one-point increment, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.08; p = 0.006) and the change in RALE over time (HR for each one-point decrease per unit of time, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99–0.99; p = 0.03) were associated with death by day 90, even after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, vasopressor use, and total volume of fluids received since study entry.

Interpretation

The change in RALE during the first days after ARDS onset is independently associated with survival and may be useful as a surrogate end point in future clinical trials of new therapeutics in ARDS.

### Should the ultrasound probe replace your stethoscope? A SICS-I sub-study comparing lung ultrasound and pulmonary auscultation in the critically ill [^1131CN5o]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

This SICS-I sub-study started on September 15, 2015, and continued until July 22, 2017, during which 1009 patients were included. A total of 149 patients (15%) were excluded because no bilateral or less than 2 scan sites were scanned due to emphysema, drains, or wound dressings hampering the ultrasound windows, leaving 926 patients (85%) for the analysis (Fig. 2). Baseline characteristics of all patients are shown in Table 1.

Fig. 2
Flowchart. Less than two scan sites meaning if less than two out of six scan sites or no bilateral scan sites of LUS were available, the presence of pulmonary edema could not be assessed

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of all included patients

Findings of lung ultrasound and auscultation

The criteria for pulmonary edema diagnosed by LUS were met in 307 of 926 patients (33%). In 156 of these patients (51%), auscultation was normal. A total of 302 of 926 patients (32%) had pulmonary edema diagnosed by pulmonary auscultation. From these patients, 151 patients (50%) had pulmonary edema on LUS. Of the 302 patients with pulmonary edema on auscultation, 130 patients had crepitations and 209 patients had rhonchi.

From 130 patients with crepitations, 86 patients (66%) had pulmonary edema on LUS, and of the 209 patients with rhonchi, 96 patients (46%) had pulmonary edema on LUS. The agreement between auscultation and LUS was poor (κ statistic 0.25).

### High positive end-expiratory pressure: only a dam against oedema formation? [^11167oJ7]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Reasons why high PEEP and low V T do not cause pulmonary oedema, despite resulting in extremely large lung inflation, are not known. On one side, avoidance of large V T (and high inspiratory flows) may have a major role as lungs behave as viscoelastic bodies that will fail if elongated too much (and too rapidly). On the other side, high PEEP may have a direct protective effect, diminishing inherent pulmonary heterogeneity and local stress amplification.

Our present and past results support maximal lung recruitment and minimal tidal ventilation, as during low-frequency positive-pressure ventilation with extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal. However, caution is advised in translating data from pre-clinical experience to humans with injured lungs. For instance, another strategy based on the same sound rationale − high-frequency oscillatory ventilation − recently failed to benefit patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, despite promising pre-clinical results.

Some limitations of this study deserve a comment. First, only five animals were enrolled because, even in such a small group, results were highly consistent and reproducible. Second, haemodynamic monitoring did not include echocardiography. Although some degree of tricuspid regurgitation may have occurred during the first part of the study (undermining cardiac output measurement), this likely reversed once PEEP had been removed. By that time, not only cardiac output but several other haemodynamic variables (for instance, blood pressure, diuresis, urinary electrolytes, arteriovenous oxygen difference and lactatemia) were normal (or even above normal). The bulk of the data strongly suggest that low cardiac output was not an issue, at least during the second part of the study. Third, integrity and permeability of the blood-gas barrier were not directly assessed and minor changes cannot be completely excluded; but still, pulmonary oedema, de facto, never occurred. Finally, lung injury may have rapidly reversed once overinflation had been suddenly removed; however, lowering mean airway pressure once the blood-gas barrier has been damaged usually causes alveolar flooding, with precipitous deterioration of lung mechanics and gas exchange.

### Response of acoustic transmission to positive airway pressure therapy in experimental lung injury [^113554Zi]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure on the sound filtering characteristics of injured lungs.

Design and Setting

Prospective experimental study in the animal laboratory in an academic medical center.

Patients and Participants

Six 35- to 45-kg anesthetized, intubated pigs.

Interventions

Acute lung injury with intravenous oleic acid.

Measurements and Results

We injected a multifrequency broad-band sound signal into the airway while recording transmitted sound at three locations bilaterally on the chest wall. Oleic acid injections effected a severe pulmonary edema predominantly in the dependent lung regions, with an average increase in venous admixture from 16 ± 14% to 57 ± 13% and a reduction in static respiratory system compliance from 31 ± 6 to 16 ± 3 ml/cm H(2)O. A significant concomitant increase in sound transfer function amplitude was seen in the dependent and lateral lung regions; little change occurred in the nondependent areas. The application of PEEP resulted in a decrease in venous admixture, increase in respiratory system compliance, and return of the sound transmission to preinjury levels.

Conclusions

Acute lung injury causes regional acoustic transmission abnormalities that are reversed during alveolar recruitment with PEEP.

### New international guidelines and consensus on the use of lung ultrasound [^116aRyuU]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Guidelines

Use standardized terminology to describe artifacts and signs in LUS based on current or future dictionaries (eg, vertical artifacts [B Lines]/confluent B line/white lung syndrome, pleural thickness [mm], pleural irregularities, horizontal lines [A‐lines]).

Future Developments

Develop a common ontology (dictionary) to be used to standardize reporting of LUS findings and measurements of diaphragm function. Include supportive images and videos. Promote and develop studies to better understand the mechanism of LUS interaction with lung tissue and of artifacts generation and meaning. Promote studies for the definition of safety indices in LUS examination.

Over the past three decades, various respiratory pathophysiological conditions have been shown to alter the acoustic properties of the lung, thus making it accessible for US exploration.,

Going beyond its established role in the management of pleural effusion, US has been widely applied in the approach to the patient with various pleuro‐pulmonary conditions, such as pneumonia, pneumothorax, cardiogenic and non‐cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, US can be used to study diaphragmatic function.

Yet, despite a wide use of the technique, there is a need for consensus for the terminology used to describe LUS artifacts and signs.

A lines and B lines are two separate and distinct artifacts which can be found as a consequence of acoustic interactions with the lung surface during US examination.

Horizontal artifacts, commonly referred to as "A lines", are hyperechoic horizontal lines that appear parallel to the pleural line, which represents how the intercostal–tissue to lung–surface interface is visualized on LUS images. In this sense, the pleural line does not fully coincide with an anatomical representation of the pleura but cannot be considered an artifact as it still represents an anatomical landmark. A lines are equidistant from each other and their depth is equal to multiples of the distance between the probe and the pleural line. Horizontal artifacts can be found in normal peripheral US patterns, states of pulmonary over‐distension, and in the case of pneumothorax (in this latter case, US diagnosis will also be supported by the absence of sliding of the pleural line and by the finding of the lung point). The genesis of horizontal artifacts is well known. They can be in fact associated to reverberation phenomena occurring between the probe and the lung surface.

Future Developments

Obtain information from high quality large studies to define optimal time intervals at which LUS should be repeated for monitoring in specific clinical situations.

The possibility to assess pulmonary congestion and cardiogenic pulmonary edema by LUS is well‐documented. When evaluating pulmonary edema, B‐line artifacts, their number, gravitational gradient and bilateral occurrence can be qualitatively analyzed by visual analysis of the US clips. The term "interstitial syndrome", indicating the presence of fluid in the interstitial space, has been proposed (be aware of the non‐specificity of interstitial syndrome for the diagnosis of pulmonary edema as interstitial space density can be altered not only by fluid increase but also by others pathological conditions, eg, collagen deposition). Interstitial syndrome has been defined by the presence of multiple B‐line artifacts in a single scan (be aware that number of vertical artifacts can vary depending on machine type and settings, frequency and incidence angle used. See technical statements). The appearance of these patterns can be linked to the increase of fluids in the interstitial space. In fact, fluid may seep into alveoli, filling them to various degrees. During an US assessment, two signs are searched for: the alveolar‐interstitial syndrome (AIS) and white lung that, respectively, indicate a more advanced involvement that is secondary to the progression of pulmonary edema. In the US assessment of patients with pulmonary edema, attention is also paid to the regularity of the pleural line and its continuity, as the presence of irregular pleural line together with vertical artifacts must lead to think to an overlap of pneumogenic pathological condition. Pleural effusion may be a co‐occurring sign.

LUS is considered to be very helpful for the monitoring of patients with pulmonary edema in a hospital setting. In patients hospitalized due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema, correlation has been reported between the number of B‐lines and the NYHA functional class, NT‐proBNP level, and other echocardiographic parameters. The applicability of LUS for the ambulatory monitoring of patients with congestive heart failure have also been documented, with positive effects on the reduction of hospitalizations reported.

Statement 10 (Clinical Statement)

LUS should be performed on the largest possible area of the chest that is available during LUS examination (the limitation of the examination area should be justified by the patient's clinical condition).

Key Points

Question

How does the accuracy of lung ultrasound compare with chest radiography for diagnosing cardiogenic pulmonary edema in patients presenting to any clinical setting with dyspnea?

Findings

In this systematic review with meta-analysis of 6 prospective cohort studies representing 1827 patients, lung ultrasonography was found to be more sensitive than chest radiography for the detection of cardiogenic pulmonary edema and had comparable specificity.

Meaning

Lung ultrasonography appeared to be useful as an adjunct imaging study in patients presenting with dyspnea at risk for heart failure.

### Lung ultrasound: a useful tool in the assessment of the dyspnoeic patient in the emergency department. fact or fiction? [^117HpQn5]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with respiratory distress present a frequent and challenging dilemma for emergency physicians (EPs). The accurate diagnosis and treatment of the underlying pathology is vitally important in these sick patients to ensure the best outcome and minimise harm from unnecessary treatments. Within the last decade, studies have shown lung ultrasonography (LU) to be valuable in the accurate diagnosis of a variety of lung pathologies, including cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, haemothorax and pneumonia. However, despite advances in techniques and the evidence for the use of LU in the diagnosis of respiratory pathology, it remains poorly understood and rarely used by EPs. This clinical review article provides an overview of LU and its relevance as a diagnostic aid to the detection of respiratory pathology in the Emergency Department (ED).

### Nuts and bolts of lung ultrasound: utility, scanning techniques, protocols, and findings in common pathologies [^113BNTgu]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Point of Care ultrasound (POCUS) of the lungs, also known as lung ultrasound (LUS), has emerged as a technique that allows for the diagnosis of many respiratory pathologies with greater accuracy and speed compared to conventional techniques such as chest x-ray and auscultation. The goal of this narrative review is to provide a simple and practical approach to LUS for critical care, pulmonary, and anesthesia providers, as well as respiratory therapists and other health care providers to be able to implement this technique into their clinical practice. In this review, we will discuss the basic physics of LUS, provide a hands-on scanning technique, describe LUS findings seen in normal and pathological conditions (such as mainstem intubation, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pneumonia, aspiration, COPD exacerbation, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, ARDS, and pleural effusion) and also review the training necessary to achieve competence in LUS.

LUS is also important in differentiating between congestive heart failure and COPD exacerbation. In the former, there will be bilateral homogenous pathologic B-lines on LUS, often associated with the presence of pleural effusion, while with the latter, the predominant finding will be multiple A-lines. This distinction will be described in more detail in the "examination protocol" section of this article. Another important application is the diagnosis of pulmonary edema during spontaneous breathing trial, where the appearance or the increase in number of B-lines may signify an increased risk of weaning failure.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

In ARDS, the ultrasound findings depend on the severity and stage of the disease. Early in the exudative phase of the disease, there is an accumulation of alveolar and interstitial fluid with findings of pathologic B-lines characteristic of pulmonary edema but with a more heterogeneous distribution. These LUS findings are followed either by recovery or the development of poorly defined hypoechoic areas similar in appearance to consolidation with dynamic air bronchograms and with occasional loss of lung sliding and the presence of an irregular pleural line in the affected areas.

The importance of LUS has been highlighted in the new global definition of ARDS where LUS by a well-trained operator has been added as one of the imaging modalities to diagnose bilateral opacities in ARDS. LUS is not only important in diagnosis, but it can also be used to predict and monitor response to various interventions as lung recruitment and prone positioning. For example, the presence of areas of normally aerated lung and lower LUS score (described below) were found to predict a more favorable response to prone positioning.

### Evaluating the utility of chest X-rays for non-traumatic chest pain in Australia-a retrospective cohort study [^115AmP2C]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Findings of hemoptysis in the context of NTCP can be associated with pneumonia, lung abscess, cancer, or pulmonary embolism. Auscultation findings of diminished lung sounds can stem from either weak sound generation or impaired transmission from obstruction. Possible causes are obstructive respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or shallow breathing upon examination. Our definition of rales included coarse and fine crackles or crepitations, with fine crackles being heard in conditions like early congestive heart failure and interstitial lung disease. Coarse crackles are heard in conditions like asthma, COPD, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. However, even though the auscultation findings were found to be associated with clinically significant abnormal CXRs, they are highly variable as clinical features to utilize. Auscultation is subject to differing clinical expertise, external noise level, and patient factors like body habitus, or effort of breathing during the examination. Oxygen saturations are in comparison more reliable as a clinical marker for disease.

### New international guidelines and consensus on the use of lung ultrasound [^115sXTZ4]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Guidelines

Perform a complete scan of the thorax, specifically on a plane from the xiphoid‐sternal line to the mid‐clavicular, mid‐axillary, and posterior‐axillary lines. Partial examination may be performed depending on the condition of the patient.

In the case of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, use a center frequency of 5–6 MHz, gain up to 50%, depending on patients' features, without harmonic imaging. Convex or linear probes may be used. These settings may apply to other conditions with a similar clinical presentation. In patients with exercise dyspnea and heart failure, it is recommended to repeat the US examination of the lungs during the exercise test.

### Lung ultrasound diagnosis of pulmonary edema resulting from excessive fluid absorption during hysteroscopic myomectomy: a case report [^111sjarh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that we utilized ultrasound to monitor the patient's lung in our case. At the first decrease in oxygen saturation (from 99 to 95%), we detected the B-lines through pulmonary ultrasound when there was no obvious hemodynamic change was observed. We strongly suspect that there has been a liquid overload at this time. To further support this diagnosis, we have conducted an ABG analysis. Pulmonary ultrasound plays a vital role in detecting early signs of pulmonary edema resulting from fluid overload. This early identification is essential for ensuring prompt and precise treatment.

For many years, ultrasound technology was considered ineffective for imaging the lungs due to the scattering of sound waves by air, hindering accurate transmission. However, the discovery of B-lines has revolutionized the use of ultrasound for monitoring and diagnosing pulmonary edema. Recent advancements in lung ultrasound technology have revealed that diffuse white lung is an early ultrasonic characteristic of acute pulmonary edema. Real-time monitoring of B-lines can guide fluid resuscitation treatment for critically ill patients. Studies have shown a strong correlation between B-lines artifacts and increased extravascular lung water (EVLW), a clinical indicator of pulmonary edema. Lung ultrasound has demonstrated high accuracy in comparison to CT scans and PiCCO monitoring. B-lines can even be detected in the early stages of pulmonary edema before functional injury occurs. Additionally, the correlation between the number of B-lines, and clinical pulmonary edema is well-established, with quantitative algorithms based on B-line counts expected to provide a valuable clinical tool for evaluating pulmonary edema.

Future Developments

Investigate to use LUS as first line diagnostic tool for monitoring of disease/conditions such as pleural effusion, chronic heart failure, and community acquired pneumonia.

The primary care physician/general practitioner (GP) in his/her office has limited diagnostic possibilities and often finds himself/herself in a situation where the medical history and physical examination need to be supplemented with additional examinations, including imaging examinations. Point‐of‐care US in the GP office is enjoying increasing popularity. The use of LUS at the stage of outpatient diagnostics is beneficial for not only the patient and physician, indeed given its cost‐effectiveness it should also be viewed in light of its potential for health care system costs reduction. Numerous examples of the use of US in the diagnostics of adults and children in outpatient treatment and even during home visits have been described. The use of US in the GP office reduces the time to make an accurate diagnosis, helps in making therapeutic decisions and may improve the patient's prognosis. Moreover, LUS used as point‐of‐care examination method may reduce disproportions in the quality of medical services depending on the place of residence and reduce the costs of patient care. In everyday practice, LUS can provide support for a quick differentiation of the causes of such common symptoms as dyspnea or cough. The main pathologies that can be quickly assessed with LUS are pleural fluid, cardiogenic or non‐cardiogenic pulmonary edema, subpleural consolidation in the course of pneumonia, and pneumothorax. Compared with the classic physical examination, LUS is characterized by greater accuracy in the assessment of changes in the course of lower respiratory tract infection and the presence of fluid in the pleural cavities. Moreover, compared with classic imaging examinations of the respiratory system (X‐ray and CT of the chest), LUS is characterized by high or comparable sensitivity and specificity in detecting pulmonary parenchyma pathology in various clinical situations. LUS is also used as a reference method in the diagnosis of the presence of free fluid in the pleural cavities.

### New international guidelines and consensus on the use of lung ultrasound [^111E3SVz]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In particular, the possibility of differentiating between primary cardiogenic and pulmonary SIS was proposed to the differential diagnosis of cardiogenic edema, ARDS, and pulmonary fibrosis.

After 2010, pulmonologists and pediatricians began extensively exploring the point of care applications of thoracic US in their fields of interest.

Beyond the differential diagnosis between cardiogenic and primary pulmonary dyspnea, the interest of pulmonologists has also recently extended to the bedside evaluation of fibrosing interstitial lung diseases.,

Furthermore, the recent COVID‐19 pandemic has determined an exponential growth of research that confirmed the role of LUS as a useful point‐of‐care tool for diagnosis support, prognostic stratification and monitoring of COVID‐19 pneumonias.,

The pathologies that benefit most from LUS examination are dyspnea, thoracic trauma, COVID‐19, pneumonia, pleural pathology (effusions and pneumothorax), and heart failure. The role of bedside US is relevant both in the diagnostic and in patient monitoring phases.

Clinicians should thus use LUS as a "point of care" examination in case of patient with dyspnea, chest pain and any chest symptom.

Point‐of‐care US examination of the chest remained for many years within the limits of a uniform assessment of the critically ill, regardless of the setting and pathology.

Instead, the most recent observations, both clinical and experimental, lead us to believe that both indications and specialist‐settings, in which the point‐of‐care examination is performed, should be taken into consideration. This also applies to US scanners imaging settings, the selected probe and the number and distribution of scans to be acquired.,

As an example, whether an algorithmic approach focused on the analysis of B‐lines may be adequate for the interpretation of cardiogenic dyspnea in the emergency room or ICU, the dyspnea of a chronically ill patient in pulmonary medicine settings requires a different evaluation of the US clips. Clinical integration and adaptation of the methodology to the specific setting is already ongoing.

### Incidence of swimming-induced pulmonary edema: a cohort study based on 47, 600 open-water swimming distances [^113yg2Hw]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Different diagnostic criteria contribute to the discrepancy in reported incidence of SIPE. Acute onset of cough, dyspnea, and breathlessness during open-water swimming often are the basic criteria, sometimes limited to sputa or hemoptysis. However, objective clinical findings indicative for pulmonary edema, for example, desaturation, auscultation, or radiologic findings of edema, are not always presented. Because SIPE most frequently occurs during open-water swimming events, a set of criteria to use at the river or seaside would be preferable. We recently suggested a diagnostic algorithm for SIPE based on clinical findings of crackles on lung auscultation and peripheral saturation of ≤ 95%. The rapid development of flexible ultrasound equipment makes LUS an attractive addition to on-site diagnostics. A uniform set of criteria for SIPE diagnosis would advance knowledge of SIPE by comparison between populations and settings. In the presented data, the diagnostics of SIPE varied from 2016 through 2019. The lesson learned in 2017 was the presence of auscultation of crackles over the anterior chest in swimmers with SIPE. In 2018 and 2019, we concluded that desaturation of ≤ 95% was associated with pulmonary edema on LUS, even without auscultation of crackles.LUS apparently is more sensitive than the human ear in detecting pulmonary edema. Using the algorithm, patients with desaturation of ≤ 95% will be characterized as having SIPE, which minimizes the risk to missing patients with severe pulmonary edema. The consistency of SIPE incidence over the 4 years of this study strengthens the data, despite differences in diagnostics. In 2019, the low temperatures probably contributed to a higher incidence. A lower water temperature in believed to trigger SIPE by enhanced peripheral vasoconstriction. SIPE is known as a transient condition, usually resolving within 24 to 48 h. In our data, the number of distances defined a person at risk and was the denominator in incidence calculation. Recurrent episodes of SIPE within days could reflect lack of recovery between races and were not counted.

### Bedside ultrasound versus chest radiography for detection of pulmonary edema: a prospective cohort study [^116YdQfN]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Chest radiography has been the preferred imaging study to assess pulmonary congestion. However, chest radiography interpretation is influenced by the level of expertise and high interobserver variability. Lung ultrasound (US) may produce more objective findings through evaluation of vertical comet tail artifacts known as B-lines, which are created by a decrease in the ratio of alveolar air to fluid pulmonary content. Few studies have directly compared chest radiography to bedside US against a reference standard for the diagnosis of pulmonary edema. This study compared the sensitivity and specificity of bedside US and chest radiography in diagnosing pulmonary edema.

Methods

This prospective observational cohort study involved adult patients presenting to the emergency department of an urban tertiary hospital with dyspnea. The primary outcome was the presence or absence of pulmonary edema, as indicated by B-lines on a bedside lung US examination or radiologist-interpreted chest radiography. Patients underwent a US examination within about 1 hour of chest radiography. The final diagnosis from the discharge summary served as the reference standard.

Results

Ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 32.3% had congestive heart failure, and 40.4% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bedside US showed significantly higher sensitivity (96%) compared to chest radiography (65%; P < .001). Of 18 patients with negative radiographic findings and a discharge diagnosis of pulmonary edema, 16 (89%) had positive US findings (P < .001).

Conclusions

Bedside US has the potential to identify pulmonary edema more accurately than chest radiography. As current practice within the United States uses chest radiography, reflecting American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines for management of heart failure, the results of this study warrant further evaluation.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113d8vmd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Timing, Risk Factors, and Extrapulmonary Factors

The committee agreed that the current time frame for the diagnosis of ARDS should be retained: acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure is defined as occurring within 1 week of the onset of the predisposing risk factor or within 1 week of new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Prolonging the time to onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure was considered, as protracted symptoms may precede progression to frank respiratory failure, as in the case of COVID-19; however, expanding the definition to include HFNO (detailed below) should allow earlier diagnosis, so the time frame of 1 week for acute onset of respiratory failure was maintained. The acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema should not be exclusively or primarily attributable to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or fluid overload, atelectasis or lung collapse, pleural effusion, or pulmonary embolism. ARDS can be diagnosed in the presence of these conditions if a predisposing risk factor for ARDS is also present, and the clinician believes that these other conditions (e.g. fluid overload, atelectasis) are unlikely to be the primary causes of the hypoxemia. ARDS also can be diagnosed in the presence of chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary hypertension, providing that acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is not primarily attributable to these underlying conditions. Further rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E2 and Tables E1 and E2.

Chest Imaging

The committee agreed that chest imaging criteria should include bilateral radiologic (chest radiography or computed tomography) or ultrasound findings suggestive of loss of lung aeration that are not fully explained by effusions, atelectasis, or nodules/masses. Although the identification of bilateral opacities by chest radiography has poor interrater reliability, chest radiography is the most common imaging modality in critically ill patients, which contributed to the recommendation to retain it in the definition despite its limitations. In addition, the committee recommended that ultrasound be accepted as a modality for identifying signs of loss of lung aeration consistent with (noncardiogenic) pulmonary edema or lung consolidation, especially when chest radiography or computed tomography is not available. There is evidence that ultrasound can be reliable if the operator is trained to detect bilateral consolidations and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, an approach that should have value, especially in resource-limited areas. Further discussion of the rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E3.

### Ultrasound of extravascular lung water: a new standard for pulmonary congestion [^113ypUxA]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Extravascular lung water (EVLW) is a key variable in heart failure management and prognosis, but its objective assessment remains elusive. Lung imaging has been traditionally considered off-limits for ultrasound techniques due to the acoustic barrier of high-impedance air wall. In pulmonary congestion however, the presence of both air and water creates a peculiar echo fingerprint. Lung ultrasound shows B-lines, comet-like signals arising from a hyper-echoic pleural line with a to-and-fro movement synchronized with respiration. Increasing EVLW accumulation changes the normal, no-echo signal (black lung, no EVLW) into a black-and-white pattern (interstitial sub-pleural oedema with multiple B-lines) or a white lung pattern (alveolar pulmonary oedema) with coalescing B-lines. The number and spatial extent of B-lines on the antero-lateral chest allows a semi-quantitative estimation of EVLW (from absent, ≤ 5, to severe pulmonary oedema, > 30 B-lines). Wet B-lines are made by water and decreased by diuretics, which cannot modify dry B-lines made by connective tissue. B-lines can be evaluated anywhere (including extreme environmental conditions with pocket size instruments to detect high-altitude pulmonary oedema), anytime (during dialysis to titrate intervention), by anyone (even a novice sonographer after 1 h training), and on anybody (since the chest acoustic window usually remains patent when echocardiography is not feasible). Cardiologists can achieve much diagnostic gain with little investment of technology, training, and time. B-lines represent ' the shape of lung water '. They allow non-invasive detection, in real time, of even sub-clinical forms of pulmonary oedema with a low cost, radiation-free approach.

### A structured diagnostic algorithm for patients with ARDS [^113okpc8]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of ARDS

The diagnosis of ARDS is largely based on hypoxic respiratory failure and the detection of pulmonary edema, from which hydrostatic cardiogenic pulmonary edema must be excluded. It is therefore essential that false positive results are excluded as much as possible by means of non-invasive imaging. Ultrasound of the lungs is superior to chest X-ray for detecting and ruling out pleural effusion. The chest X-ray can give the illusion that the lung is consolidated when there is a large effusion and this can result in a false positive diagnosis, but the treatment differs. Transthoracic ultrasound of the heart can facilitate the diagnosis of acute heart failure. In general, acute heart failure is sufficient explanation for pulmonary edema and treatment should be focused on decongestion. However, a complicating factor is that cardiomyopathy due to a hyperinflammatory state can be associated with ARDS (and thus non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Usually, these are patients with sepsis, with a high a priori risk of ARDS who should also be diagnosed with ARDS.

Practical steps

Determine that the patient meets the ARDS criteria according to the 'Berlin definition' and report the diagnosis of ARDS in the status (Table 1), both when the cause is evident and when the cause is unclear, as ARDS is a descriptive — and not causal — diagnosis. The presence of ARDS should trigger both a standardized set of evidence-based interventions (e.g. lung protective ventilation, restrictive fluid therapy) and, importantly, an investigation into the cause of the pulmonary injury.
Perform ultrasound of the lungs to rule out pulmonary effusion as the cause for the bilateral consolidations. Finding pleural abnormalities with lung ultrasound strongly suggests an inflammatory cause of the pulmonary edema.
Perform transthoracic cardiac ultrasound to exclude acute heart failure as a cause of pulmonary edema. Ultrasound evidence of cardiomyopathy does not exclude ARDS in an underlying condition with a high pre-probability of ARDS (such as sepsis) and in this case ARDS should be diagnosed despite the contribution of acute heart failure to the onset of pulmonary edema.

Future Developments

Harmonize specific protocols by disease/setting of use, such as lung congestion, pulmonary embolism, subpleural consolidation, ICU patient, and athlete after exertion by describing
the image acquisition protocol (including the imaging settings);
the typical LUS patterns w.r.t. the specific disease/setting.

Point‐of‐care US is performed by clinicians at bedside, followed by immediate visual interpretation and clinical integration of the imaging results.

Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (E‐FAST) scan protocol was the first point‐of‐care US examination performed in patients with recent chest trauma.

Starting from the work of Lichtenstein et al, chest ultrasound examination (LUS) has become a widespread practice in the emergency room and intensive care, for the diagnosis of dyspnea.

In particular, since the second decade of the 2000s, many publications were produced on the use of US for the bedside diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema, ARDS, and pneumonia.,

The main users were the emergency physicians and the intensivists, who benefited from the use of US scanners in different areas: emergency rooms, intensive care units, particular environmental rescue conditions.

The main object of interest was the differential diagnoses of dyspnea. LUS was utilized as an effective differential diagnostic tool between heart failure and pleuro‐pulmonary involvement, as well as for questioning pulmonary embolism.

Moreover, the greater sensitivity of US compared with chest X‐ray for detecting subpleural inflammatory consolidations, fostered the wide spreading of bedside diagnoses of pneumonia.

At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, several studies started indicating the possibility of improving the low specificity of the sonographic interstitial syndrome (SIS), which encompasses all vertical artifacts, that is, B‐lines and white lung.

Criteria for Identifying Cases of SIPE

Diagnostic criteria for SIPE at Vansbrosimningen have been evaluated and refined over the years of the study. During the entire study, lung auscultation findings of crackles and peripheral oxygen saturation were noted for all patients with acute respiratory symptoms. In 2018 and 2019, lung ultrasound (LUS) was used to confirm pulmonary edema. Physicians on site were blinded to LUS results to evaluate the association of clinical findings related to objective signs of pulmonary edema.SIPE diagnosis at the MMU in 2017 and 2018 was based on findings of crackles during lung auscultation, and/or a peripheral oxygen saturation ≤ 95%. In 2019, we decided to use LUS findings for on-site diagnosis.

Data from 2018 and 2019 were assessed to create a diagnostic algorithm for SIPE (e-Fig 1). In the absence of LUS, this algorithm establishes SIPE on the basis of a combination of crackles during lung auscultation and/or peripheral oxygen saturation ≤ 95%.

In the present study, a 10-day follow-up was conducted on the basis of SIPE diagnosis at the MMU (Table 1). Before the 30-month follow-up, we reevaluated SIPE diagnosis for all patients to standardize diagnostics. SIPE diagnosis was based on LUS findings of pulmonary edema, or, in the absence of LUS data, the clinical algorithm was applied (e-Fig 1). This strategy identified 29 additional SIPE cases, the majority of which were patients from 2017 who appeared without crackles but with peripheral oxygen saturation ≤ 95% (n = 21) (Fig 1).

Lung ultrasound

Lung ultrasound is a versatile tool not only for identifying pneumothorax, as discussed earlier, but also for detecting pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and lung consolidation. These findings assist trauma and critical care clinicians in diagnosing conditions related to initial injury or complications arising during hospitalization.

Technique

Given that the pleura and lungs are typically within 8 cm of the skin surface, a high-frequency linear probe is preferred. However, a deeper-penetrating probe may be necessary depending on the body habitus. Most protocols recommend imaging six regions on each side of the chest, dividing the hemithorax into anterior, lateral, and posterior zones. Alternative approaches, such as an eight-region anterolateral or even a two-region anterior-only protocol, may be used based on clinical circumstances.

Findings

A-lines: hyperechoic horizontal lines within the lung parenchyma, representing normal reverberation artifacts of aerated lungs. Pulmonary edema or other abnormalities may obscure these lines.
B-lines: vertical lines extending from the pleural surface to the image depth. They move with lung sliding, obliterate A-lines, and indicate interstitial thickening (eg, pulmonary edema or fibrosis). B-lines are absent in obstructive airway diseases, making them useful for differentiating pulmonary edema from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma in cases of respiratory failure. A greater number of B-lines corresponds to increased lung water.
Consolidation: areas of lung consolidation appear hyperechoic (hepatization) with hyperechoic linear or pinpoint opacities representing air bronchograms. Dynamic, inspiratory movement of air bronchograms is highly specific (though only ~61% sensitive) for pneumonia.
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema versus acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Unlike cardiac-related edema, ARDS often shows pleural thickening, coarse pleural lines, and areas of sparing — features typically absent in cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

The key findings of the lung ultrasound are summarized in figure 3.

### Lung ultrasound: a promising tool to monitor ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients [^116uWdj9]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Typically, the surfaces of the visceral and parietal pleurae slide forward and backward against each other during respiration. Ultrasound waves are reflected by the interface of the pleurae, which generate a hyperechoic, sliding line termed the pleural line with lung sliding (Fig. 1a). In addition, using the time-motion mode of ultrasound, lung sliding below the pleural line appears as a homogenous granular pattern called a sandy sign (Fig. 1a). On the far side of the pleural line, the lungs generate linear images called A lines, which are parallel to the pleural line because of the high acoustic impedance of air, wave reflection, and reverberation. The white and hyperechoic A lines, which become less intense with depth, are static and appear at regular intervals (Fig. 1a). The combination of a pleural line, bilateral lung sliding, and an A line indicate normal lung aeration (Fig. 1a; Additional file 1: Video S1). It is noteworthy, however, that a normal lung pattern can be observed in those with emphysema or asthma. The B line is a long, vertical, hyperechoic, and dynamic line that originates from the pleural line, moves with lung sliding, and spreads to the edge of the screen without fading the A lines (Fig. 1b; Additional file 2: Video S2). B lines represent a reverberation artifact through thickened subpleural interlobular septa by deposition of fibrous tissues, inflammatory cells, or pulmonary edema. Thus, a B line can be detected in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), interstitial lung diseases, pneumonia, etc. The presence of multiple vertical B lines more than 7 mm apart (spaced B lines) indicates a moderate decrease in lung aeration due to thickened interlobular septa. The presence of coalescent B lines less than 3 mm apart (alveolar interstitial syndromes) indicates a more severe decrease in lung aeration due to partial filling of alveolar spaces. It should be noted that detection of fewer than three isolated B lines in dependent regions of a normal lung could have no pathological significance. Lung consolidations are characterized by a tissue-like echotexture similar to that observed in liver parenchyma on LUS (Fig. 1c; Additional file 3: Video S3). They are detected in pneumonia, lung atelectasis, lung contusion, ARDS, etc. The presence of lung consolidation indicates complete loss of lung aeration because the alveolar space is filled with exudates and cellular debris or is collapsed by the proliferation of neoplastic tissue or pleural effusion. Within the consolidation, a branch-shaped or horizontal bronchogram containing air or fluid can be observed (Fig. 1c). In such cases, an inspiratory reinforcement corresponding to penetration of air into the bronchial tree, called a dynamic air bronchogram, can be occasionally observed. The pneumothorax is characterized by the "lung point", disappearance of lung sliding, and the "barcode sign" in the time-motion mode on LUS (Fig. 2b). The lung point is a characteristic marker of the pneumothorax (Fig. 1d). It is the transition between normal lung sliding and the absence of lung sliding at the pneumothorax border. By using the time-motion mode of ultrasound, the absence of lung sliding appears as strictly horizontal lines, called the barcode sign (Fig. 1d). The absence of lung sliding or B lines is helpful to exclude the pneumothorax with a 100% negative predictive value because these two signs indicate the movement of intact visceral pleura against parietal pleura. Lung effusion appears as an echo-free zone on LUS, which helps to differentiate the presence of fluids or consolidation, leading to the opacity of the hemithorax in ICU patients (Fig. 1e; Additional file 4: Video S4). It is noteworthy that lung effusion is usually accompanied by another condition such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Thus, understanding the etiology of pleural effusion through LUS is important.

Interstitial fluid and pulmonary oedema

Quantification of B-lines (vertical artefacts that result from an increase in interstitial density; FIG. 1b) has been shown to be useful for the diagnosis, monitoring, and risk assessment of patients with known or suspected AHF –. Either curvilinear or phased array transducers can be used, typically at an imaging depth of 18 cm. Although the assessment of eight or more anterior and lateral thoracic zones (four on each hemithorax) has been recommended in a consensus statement, a subsequent study demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy with examination of only six thoracic regions. The visualization of three or more B-lines in two or more intercostal spaces bilaterally should be considered diagnostic for pulmonary oedema, with sensitivity of 94% (95% CI 81–98%) and specificity of 92% (95% CI 84–96%). By contrast, physical examination and chest radiography have a sensitivity of only 62% (95% CI 61–64%) and 57% (95% CI 55–59%), and a specificity of 68% (95% CI 67–69%) and 89% (95% CI 88–90%) for a diagnosis of pulmonary oedema, respectively. The presence of multiple bilateral B-lines in AHF has been well-correlated with natriuretic peptide levels, and only variably correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and measures of extravascular lung water. Given that studies to assess the incremental diagnostic value of LUS compared with natriuretic peptides for the identification of AHF in patients with dyspnoea reported variable results in different cohorts, this topic warrants further investigation. The number of B-lines is thought to decrease with treatment for AHF and, therefore, this technique is potentially useful in the monitoring of pulmonary oedema in response to therapy. For serial assessments, patient positioning (sitting versus supine) should be kept consistent. Importantly, a higher number of B-lines on LUS at the time of discharge from hospital might help to identify patients with heart failure who have a worse prognosis.

Pleural effusion

Similarly to B-lines, the presence of pleural effusions can be assessed using curvilinear or phased array transducers in the posterior–axillary line(FIG. 1d). Current data regarding the diagnostic utility of pleural effusions identified on ultrasonography in patients with AHF are less robust, but have been reported with sensitivities of 79–84% and specificities of 83–98% in small studies of patients with dyspnoea.

Pulmonary edema assessment in humans — imaging modalities (chest radiograph, computed tomography [CT], and Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema [RALE] score lung ultrasound) provide semiquantitative measurement of radiographic edema, and the RALE score is validated by gravimetric assessment in human explants and clinical outcomes, but limitations include that they are insensitive to quantity of edema, offer broad assessment (not site-specific), and do not differentiate edema from heart failure. A thermodilution approach using cold saline injected through a femoral venous catheter with temperature measured at the femoral arterial catheter tip is validated by gravimetric assessment in experimental animal studies, but it is invasive (requires central venous and arterial catheters) and may overestimate extravascular lung water (EVLW).

### Ultrasound of extravascular lung water: a new standard for pulmonary congestion [^113Fs7aH]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

B-lines for imaging pulmonary congestion

Pulmonary congestion is an almost universal finding in patients with acute heart failure. It may be related to heterogeneous mechanisms such as fluid retention with weight gain in patients with reduced ejection fraction and/or fluid redistribution to the lungs, usually without weight variation, in patients with preserved ejection fraction and a noncompliant cardiovascular system. Clinical symptoms and signs of pulmonary congestion resulting in interstitial and alveolar oedema are a late event in acute heart failure syndrome. The identification of pulmonary congestion with a reliable and objective non-invasive imaging biomarker would confer a pathophysiological, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic advantage to the clinical cardiologist. In patients with impending acute heart failure syndrome, there is often a relatively long incubation period, of days and weeks, during which there is a gradual accumulation of extravascular lung water (EVLW), a term used to describe water within the lungs but outside pulmonary vasculature. Detection and treatment of pulmonary congestion before it is clinically evident can prevent hospitalization and progression of heart failure. Post-discharge freedom from pulmonary congestion is associated with a better prognosis. Therefore, the possibility to image pulmonary oedema at a sub-clinical stage remains an attractive and elusive goal. Several clinical, radiological, and non-imaging methods are currently used for evaluating pulmonary fluid retention, but they are late and inaccurate (physical examination), insensitive and imprecise (chest X-ray), too complex for real time, repeated measurements in sick patients (computerized tomography), or inadequately validated and not widely available (conductance measurements with cardiac devices). Lung ultrasound (LUS) assessment of EVLW by B-lines provides an excellent alternative, expanding the already established role of transthoracic echocardiography in heart failure.B-lines can be visualized using the cardiac transducer and appear on the antero-lateral chest scan as multiple laser-like signals arising from the hyper-echoic pleural line, changing throughout the respiratory cycle, with a to-and-fro movement synchronized with respiration (Figure 1). The normal lung is black (no signal); the abnormal wet lung with interstitial pulmonary oedema is black and white (with some B-lines departing from the pleural line); and the lung with alveolar pulmonary oedema is white (confluent B-lines in a fully echogenic lung).

### Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [^111FnRWM]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary edema is differentiated into two categories — cardiogenic and noncardiogenic. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is due to changes in permeability of the pulmonary capillary membrane as a result of either a direct or an indirect pathologic process. It is a spectrum of illness ranging from the less severe form of ALI to the severe ARDS. The mainstay of treatment is mechanical ventilation with maximization of ventilation and oxygenation through the judicious use of PEEP. Newer ventilation techniques, such as high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and partial fluid ventilation, are promising but are in the early stages of clinical testing. Mortality rates remain high despite increasing intensive care unit care.

### Ultrasound of extravascular lung water: a new standard for pulmonary congestion [^1116tH8B]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

B-lines are a sign of interstitial syndrome of mixed origin (fibrosis, inflammation, and congestion), and in acute or chronic heart failure patients they mostly represent the direct, positive image of lung water, for a long time a forbidden fruit for the clinical cardiologist. Through the lung water teaser, the cardiologist will become familiar with the new diagnostic world of LUS, a friendly neighbour of transthoracic echocardiography, of critical help in many different and frequent clinical situations, from diagnosis and semi-quantification of pleural effusion to fluid management in cardiogenic shock to pneumothorax identification in differential diagnosis of dyspnoea. The rapidly dynamic nature of B-lines separates wet B-lines made by water (decreased by diuretics) from dry B-lines made of connective tissue. B-lines can be used anywhere (even in extreme environmental conditions with pocket size devices), by anyone (including novice sonographer) on anybody (since the superficial acoustic window that is required usually is feasible even when echocardiography is not feasible). Rarely, in cardiac imaging, we have so much diagnostic gain with so little technological, training, and time pain. Lung ultrasound can quantify lung oedema noninvasively in real time, even at an early subclinical stage, with user-friendly, low cost, radiation-free, and direct imaging of EVLW.

### Efficacy and safety of non-invasive ventilation in the treatment of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema – a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112aGong]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs focusing on the effect of CPAP and NPPV in the treatment of ACPE was undertaken. The methodological approach included the development of selection criteria, definition of search strategies, quality assessment of the studies, data abstraction and statistical data analysis.

Selection criteria

The study selection criteria were defined before data collection, in order to properly identify high quality studies eligible for the analysis.

The following inclusion criteria were defined. Patient population: adult patients presenting to hospital with ACPE, defined as existence of dyspnea of sudden onset, increased respiratory rate, a compatible physical examination (bilateral crackles on pulmonary auscultation, elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound on cardiac auscultation), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph plus significant hypoxemia. Study design: prospective randomized parallel trials with independent randomization of ACPE patients. Interventions: use of CPAP (delivered using any device) and medical therapy compared with standard medical therapy alone; use of NPPV (with any device) and medical therapy compared with standard medical therapy alone; or use of CPAP and medical therapy compared with NPPV and medical therapy. Outcomes: need for ETI as decided by trialists, all-cause mortality and risk of newly developed AMI after delivery of study interventions.

To improve the internal validity of this meta-analysis, we decided to consider separately trials of NPPV and CPAP, because these two methods have different technical, physiological and clinical characteristics. Pooling those two interventions in a single 'non-invasive ventilation' intervention may not be appropriate and could have led to additional heterogeneity and patient overlap in trials with three arms. Also, trials that included both acute respiratory failure and ACPE patients were included only if there was independent stratified randomization of therapies for this sub-group.

### Bedside lung ultrasound: a case of neurogenic pulmonary edema [^116XEP5o]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is an acute life-threatening complication associated with many forms of central nervous system injury. NPE usually appears within minutes to hours after injury and has a high mortality rate if not recognized and treated appropriately. Lung ultrasound quickly provides at the bedside relevant information on the state of aeration and ventilation of the lung.

Methods

We describe a case report of acute respiratory insufficiency after posterior cranial fossa surgery.

Results

The patient underwent a subtotal meningiomectomy. Postoperative course was complicated by respiratory failure with unstable hemodynamic parameters. The pulmonary edema was suspected, and sonography examination was performed. Lung ultrasound showed typical signs for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Transthoracic echocardiography showed preserved left ventricle systolic function, but signs of the severe hypovolemia were found. We corrected for the preload and ventilator support settings. Within 24 h, her respiratory status improved with a resolution of the pulmonary edema.

Conclusions

Lung ultrasound at the bedside can provide accurate information on lung status in neurocritically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. The addition of transthoracic echocardiography to lung sonography provides an additive insight on the eventual pulmonary involvement. Lung ultrasound has the potential to become a reference tool for bedside dynamic respiratory monitoring in the Neuro ICU.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of heart failure [^115Y881R]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of volume overload, which may include peripheral edema and pulmonary rales. Heart failure has high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in older persons. Many conditions, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, can cause or lead to decompensation of chronic heart failure. Up to 40 to 50 percent of patients with heart failure have diastolic heart failure with preserved left ventricular function, and the overall mortality is similar to that of systolic heart failure. The initial evaluation includes a history and physical examination, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and laboratory assessment to identify causes or precipitating factors. A displaced cardiac apex, a third heart sound, and chest radiography findings of venous congestion or interstitial edema are useful in identifying heart failure. Systolic heart failure is unlikely when the Framingham criteria are not met or when B-type natriuretic peptide level is normal. Echocardiography is the diagnostic standard to confirm systolic or diastolic heart failure through assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction. Evaluation for ischemic heart disease is warranted in patients with heart failure, especially if angina is present, given that coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure.

### Resolution of sonographic B-lines as a measure of pulmonary decongestion in acute heart failure [^116wYvLc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective noninvasive measures of dyspnea in patients with acute heart failure are lacking. In this review, we describe lung ultrasound as a tool to estimate the degree of pulmonary congestion in patients presenting with acute heart failure and to monitor therapeutic efficacy. Serial semiquantitative measures of sonographic B-lines in acute heart failure patients can be converted to pulmonary edema scores obtained at admission and hospital discharge. These scores provide prognostic information for short-term clinical outcomes. Lung ultrasound has the potential to measure changes in pulmonary edema during acute heart failure management and improve risk stratification.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of point-of-care ultrasound examinations [^111tPMdA]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

AIUM point-of-care lung ultrasound — key interpretive findings for lung sliding, loss of sliding, B-lines, and consolidation are described as follows. The finding of lung sliding is 100% sensitive for the exclusion of pneumothorax present at a given interspace, but multiple rib interfaces should be examined if the suspicion of pneumothorax is high, and a small apical pneumothorax may be missed because of shadowing from bone; if the presence of lung sliding is unclear in a patient with a high pretest probability, a further evaluation should be performed. When this pattern is present, pneumothorax cannot be ruled out, and examples of disease processes that cause loss of lung sliding without pneumothorax include pleurodesis, severe emphysema with bullous lung disease, a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome pattern, opposing main-stem intubation, and apnea. A B-line pattern can be present in, but not specific to, cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and the thickness of the pleura and the location of the B-line pattern may aid in the differentiation of these two disease processes. The clinician may be able to differentiate between atelectasis and pneumonia causing the consolidation.

### A narrative review on lung injury: mechanisms, biomarkers, and monitoring [^113PADEy]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical markers indicative of lung injury

Symptoms such as cough with phlegm suggest upper airway involvement, common in infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia, while chest tightness, pain, and shortness of breath indicate alveolar issues like fluid accumulation or pulmonary embolism. Abnormal breath sounds like wheezes indicate airway obstruction (e.g. asthma), while crackles signify fluid or secretion in airways (e.g. bronchitis, pneumonia). Velcro crackles denote diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Lung percussion reveals resonant sounds normally, hyperresonance in emphysema, and dullness in conditions like pleural effusion. Imaging techniques like X-rays and CT scans show low attenuation in emphysema and high attenuation in inflammatory states, consolidation, or general interstitial lung abnormalities. Lung function tests detect obstructive patterns (e.g. reduced FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio) and restrictive patterns (e.g. reduced lung capacities), while blood gas analysis assesses gas exchange impairments like low PaO 2 indicating ventilation issues and elevated PaCO 2 indicating gas exchange problems. OI values < 300 mmHg suggest acute lung injury, < 100 mmHg may indicate ARDS. These assessments provide insights into lung conditions but do not fully capture cellular injury or predict disease outcomes, highlighting the need for comprehensive monitoring strategies.

### Nuts and bolts of lung ultrasound: utility, scanning techniques, protocols, and findings in common pathologies [^113Fxtsc]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Examination protocols, scoring systems and a framework for LUS

Several protocols have been developed to facilitate a structured approach to LUS. Most of these protocols also incorporate a more comprehensive ultrasound examinations of the heart, abdomen and venous system to aid in patient diagnosis and timely management. A full discussion of these applications is beyond the scope of this article but have been recently reviewed.

One of the most commonly used LUS protocols is the "the bedside lung ultrasound in emergency" (BLUE) protocol which is used for the rapid diagnosis of acute respiratory failure and includes lung as well as vascular ultrasound when indicated. It is integrated with vital signs and other clinical data for maximal efficiency. The BLUE protocol provides accuracy approaching 90% (81%-100%) in diagnosing different lung pathologies such as pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pneumothorax, and COPD or asthma, however it is worth mentioning that it was a single-center study by two highly experienced operators.

The (BLUE) protocol, first published in 2008, consisted of scanning 3 zones on each side (anterior, lateral and posterolateral chest walls) and each zone was further divided into upper and lower halves resulting in 6 scanning points on each side. This protocol was then modified into a more simplified approach consisting of scanning at only three standardized points called the "Blue points" seen and described in Supplemental Fig. 11. The initial step in the modified BLUE-protocol is looking for lung sliding on both sides. The algorithm in Fig. 5 is then followed, and this categorizes the patients into different disease profiles including pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pneumothorax, and COPD or asthma. An A-profile associates Lung sliding with A-lines, a B-profile associates Lung sliding with B-lines, an A/B-profile is characterized by an A-profile in one lung and B-profile in the other, a C-profile is characterized by the presence of Anterior lung consolidation, an A'-profile is an A profile with negative lung sliding, and finally a B'-profile which is B profile with negative lung sliding. It is important to note that for many practical algorithms that facilitate clinical diagnoses, including the BLUE protocol, there is often significant overlap between findings seen in various pathological conditions making dichotomic categorization challenging. For instance, it can be challenging to difference between cardiogenic pulmonary edema and ARDS given that the B-profile may be seen in early ARDS before it progresses towards a consolidative pattern (C-pattern) as it progresses towards severe ARDS.

Cardiovascular Morbidities

Cardiovascular morbidities are frequently present in patients experiencing ECOPDs, and thus a patient history is important to assess their presence or impact. Chest pain/discomfort, fluid retention, or irregular pulse suggest a cardiovascular cause as an alternative or contributing diagnosis to an ECOPD.

Acute HF

Acute HF is defined by worsening of dyspnea at rest (particularly while supine) or during exertion and/or fatigue, together with signs of fluid retention such as pulmonary congestion, increased jugular vein distension, or ankle swelling, with objective evidence of an abnormality of the structure or function of the heart. Some of these clinical findings can make distinguishing ECOPD from acute HF difficult. In addition, COPD is present in up to 50% of patients with HF, and HF occurs in roughly 20% of individuals with COPD because of overlapping risk factors (aging and smoking) and underlying mechanisms (systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and muscular atrophy). Furthermore, an HF diagnosis is often difficult to confirm in patients with preserved ejection fraction, which is common in patients with COPD. Hypoxemia and tachycardia in ECOPD can promote decompensation in HF, whereas pulmonary fluid retention in HF can worsen airway obstruction. In addition, wheezing is common in acute HF (approximately 30%), whereas COPD can mask the presence of basilar crackles. However, their presence, coupled with evidence of leg edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, and a third heart sound increases the likelihood of HF being the cause of, or a contributor to, the acute event.

Symptoms and Detection of Heart Failure

Many normal symptoms in pregnancy may mimic HF Signs such as peripheral edema, palmar erythema, systolic murmur, and a third heart sound, further complicate detection of cardiac decompensation. Signs that warrant further investigation for cardiac disease are cyanosis, clubbing, resting tachycardia, any type of arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, hypoxia, tachypnea, elevated jugular venous pressure, diastolic murmur, murmur radiating beyond the left sternal edge, murmur associated with a thrill, marked peripheral edema, or evidence of pulmonary edema; symptoms such as shortness of breath and orthopnea also indicate a need for further consideration. Pregnant women with HF commonly displayed dyspnea, cough, bilateral pitting pedal edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound, and tender hepatomegaly. Most patients with HF presented with bibasal crepitations. To help clinicians identify cardiac disease in pregnancy the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative and California Department of Public Health created a California Quality Improvement Toolkit on cardiovascular screening and assessment. This framework gives providers clear guidance on what signs and symptoms are cause for concern and how to proceed with diagnostic testing and further management. Application of the toolkit evidenced that 88% of pregnancy‐related cardiovascular mortalities could have been identified before death with the use of this screening tool. It is now recommended that all women should be assessed for cardiovascular disease in the antepartum and postpartum periods using this toolkit algorithm. Family history and other underlying medical conditions can also help guide medical judgment.

### Three-view bedside ultrasound for the differentiation of acute respiratory distress syndrome from cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^112aUw7t]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Bedside ultrasound is being increasingly used by emergency physicians (EPs) for the differentiation of acute dyspnea in critically ill patients. Lung ultrasound is emerging as a highly sensitive tool in diagnosing alveolar interstitial edema with the presence of diffuse "B-lines" arising from the pleural line. However, when used independently, lung ultrasound is unable to differentiate between cardiogenic and noncardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema. This case report describes a rapid 3-view or "triple scan" sonographic examination to differentiate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

A previously completely fit and well 62-year-old man presented with a 4-week history of lethargy and increasing shortness of breath. This had been preceded by a flu-like illness that had been treated in the community with ciprofloxacin to no effect. There was no history of smoking, tuberculosis exposure or significant exposure to birds. Clinically the patient appeared well and was comfortable and conversant with no peripheral oedema. Chest auscultation revealed normal breath sounds and a loud pansystolic murmur over the cardiac apex. A chest radiograph and a subsequent CT scan showed widespread fibrotic and bronchiectatic changes, predominantly in the right upper lobe, with bilateral pleural effusions. Echocardiography revealed a posterior mitral valve prolapse. He was treated with loop diuretics and a mitral valve repair that resolved his symptoms and radiographic findings. This is the first English language case report of pulmonary oedema causing bronchiectatic lung appearances.

ACC/AHA heart failure data elements — chest radiography defines the data element as "Documented findings from the radiological examination of the chest", with permissible values including "Pulmonary vascular redistribution, pulmonary congestion, or pulmonary edema", "Cardiomegaly, chamber enlargement", "Pleural effusion(s)", and "No abnormalities related to HF". Pulmonary edema is defined as "Accumulation of fluid in the lung tissues causing disturbance of the gas exchange that may lead to respiratory failure. It is caused by direct injury to the lung parenchyma or congestive HF". Cardiomegaly/chamber enlargement is "Abnormal enlargement of the heart", and pleural effusion(s) are described as "Increased amounts of fluid within the pleural cavity. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. It is usually caused by lung infections, congestive HF; pleural and lung tumors, connective tissue disorders, and trauma".

4 PULMONARY CONGESTION DIAGNOSIS BY LUNG ULTRASOUND IN PATIENTS

LUS has now been used in the diagnosis of ARDS, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, COPD, asthma, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. In particular, LUS B‐lines could indicate the presence of pulmonary congestion in patients with pulmonary edema, ARDS, and pneumonia(Table 5).

TABLE 5
Association between various diseases and B‐lines

LUS is usually performed by qualified researchers with national training experience and certificate. LUS examinations should be performed with the patient in the supine position. The B‐lines could be assessed by 4‐, 6‐, 8‐ or 28‐point methods through scanning the anterior and lateral chest, the transducer should orientate parallel to the ribs (Figure 2). In each intercostal space, the number of B‐lines should be quantified real‐time, counted one by one. Offline image analysis could be performed by video recognition by two investigators with experience in LUS analysis. The LUS area with the largest number of B‐lines should be selected.

### The clinical usefulness of extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability index to diagnose and characterize pulmonary edema: a prospective multicenter study on the quantitative differential diagnostic definition for acute lung injury / acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112YCz1M]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary edema is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the extravascular space of the lungs and is a common finding in critically ill patients. This pathological condition may develop due to an increase in the pulmonary capillary permeability (acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)), an increase in the pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure (hydrostatic or cardiogenic pulmonary edema), or both. Pulmonary edema can be detected by clinical evaluation of factors such as patients' history, physical findings, and routine laboratory examinations, and is confirmed by the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltration on chest radiography. However, interpretation of these factors is often limited by a certain degree of subjectivity that might cause inter-observer variation even among experts, particularly in critically ill patients. Moreover, intensive care physicians may find it difficult to determine the cause of the extravascular lung water (EVLW) increase.

### Pulmonary oedema in the emergency room: what is hidden beyond an apparently common presentation [^113BDB2q]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic flash pulmonary oedema is a common and potentially fatal cause of acute respiratory distress. Although it often results from acute decompensated heart failure, abrupt-onset aortic regurgitation can sharply rise cardiac filling pressure and, consequently, pulmonary venous pressure, leading to rapid fluid accumulation in the interstitial and alveolar spaces. We report a case of a 64-year-old woman admitted to the emergency department with a flash pulmonary oedema; a careful clinical investigation subsequently revealed a rare aetiology for this 'common' presentation. After a detailed auscultation that unmasked a diastolic cardiac murmur, an acute severe aortic insufficiency was further confirmed by echocardiography, showing inflammation and thickening of the entire aorta wall. The patient was submitted to valve replacement surgery, and histological examination, to our surprise, showed features of aortitis, remarkable for the presence of giant cells. A diagnosis of idiopathic aortitis versus inaugural giant cell arteritis was proposed and treatment started with corticosteroids.

Methodological quality of included studies

Study quality assessment considered two types of criteria: general and specific. The general quality criteria are presented in Table 2. The studies had generally small sample sizes (median, 40 patients; range, 22 to 130); the total number of patients included was 938. Most of them had adequate randomization concealment and adequate selection criteria. Four out of 17 did not report an intention-to-treat analysis. Only one study blinded physicians, nurses and patients to the intervention by covering the control panel of the ventilator. Almost none of the studies reported or commented on blinding strategies. Most of them reported on strategies for standardization of co-interventions and had complete follow-up details for all participants. Six out of 17 studies had inadequate or unclear outcome definitions.

The specific quality criteria are presented in Table 3. There were several different definitions of ACPE (see Table 3), but most of them included the basic criteria considered in our definition (existence of dyspnea of sudden onset, increased respiratory rate, a compatible physical examination, bilateral crackles on pulmonary auscultation, elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound on cardiac auscultation, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph plus significant hypoxemia). Inclusion and exclusion criteria had some variability (Table 3), with some studies including much selected groups of patients. Baseline co-morbidities differed between studies and in some studies the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or AMI was considered as exclusion criteria (Table 3). The frequency of AMI at baseline, for each study, is presented in Table 3. Major differences were found among studies regarding the methods of implementation and technical characteristics of the ventilation devices (Table 3) and regarding the definition and adequacy of criteria for ETI (Table 3).

The analysis of safety issues will mainly focus on comparisons of AMI risk among interventions. Some other adverse events of non-invasive ventilation were reported sporadically by authors (facial erythema, nasal skin necrosis, vomiting, gastric distension, pulmonary aspiration, barotrauma and asphyxia), but were always described as rare events.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure (HF) — common symptoms and signs are enumerated and an objective marker is proposed to complement symptom-based diagnosis. Common symptoms and signs of HF are listed in Table 6, with typical symptoms including breathlessness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue (tiredness with increased time to recover after exercise), and ankle swelling; less typical symptoms include nocturnal cough, wheezing, bloated feeling, postprandial satiety, loss of appetite, decline in cognitive function or confusion (especially in the elderly), depression, and dizziness or syncope. Signs more specific for HF include elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound, summation gallop with third and fourth heart sounds, cardiomegaly with a laterally displaced apical impulse, hepatojugular reflux, and Cheyne Stokes respiration in advanced HF, whereas less specific signs include peripheral edema, pulmonary rales, unintentional weight gain (> 2 kg/week), weight loss in advanced HF with muscle wasting and cachexia, cardiac murmur, reduced air entry and dullness to percussion at lung bases suggestive of pleural effusion, tachycardia or irregular pulse, tachypnea, hepatomegaly/ascites, cold extremities, oliguria, and narrow pulse pressure. The current ACCF/AHA Classification of HF includes 2 presymptomatic stages, A and B; although the definition of the syndrome of HF is restricted to being a symptomatic clinical condition, a new categorization of Stages A and B into "at risk" and "pre-HF" is proposed. To strengthen diagnostic consistency, the incorporation of an objective measurement in addition to the symptoms in the HF definition is proposed.

Methods — Delphi process for ALI measurement prioritization across domains: similar to the 2011 workshop, a Delphi method was used, with a list of 50 participants finalized; in Round 1, "the 50 participants were asked to complete an electronic survey" addressing the four domains. In Round 2, participants rated each measurement "using a scale of 0–5 (0 = minimal importance, 5 = maximal importance)", with items grouped by domain-specific categories (histology: alveolar spaces, alveolar epithelium, vasculature, alveolar septae, interstitium; barrier alteration: endothelial injury or dysfunction, epithelial injury or dysfunction, lung edema, transfer of plasma or lung constituents; inflammatory response: soluble mediator profiles, inflammatory cellular composition and characteristics, consequences of inflammation; physiologic dysfunction: gas exchange, lung mechanics, vital signs, other aspects). In Round 3, participants chose "the top 4–5 features" per domain; features "selected as 'most relevant' by 30% or more of the respondents were considered 'relevant'", and "a 30% cutoff resulted in at least five measurements named as 'most relevant' in each of the four domains".

### A deep learning model enables accurate prediction and quantification of pulmonary edema from chest X-rays [^113qoeBk]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary edema is one of the most common findings in chest radiographs and has important clinical consequences. By impeding the gas exchange and reducing lung compliance, severe pulmonary edema is potentially life threatening. Measuring and monitoring pulmonary edema is useful in many, but especially important in critically ill patients.

Technically, the attenuation of X-rays should be proportional to the amount of lung water, and thus, a chest radiograph should be a valuable tool in monitoring the amount of pulmonary edema. Commonly, radiologists rate the severity on a categorical scale. A quantitative measure for pulmonary edema widely used for critically ill patients is the extravascular lung water (EVLW) which is defined as the amount of water accumulating in the lungs outside of the pulmonary vasculature. Measurement of EVLW by transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD), although invasive, shows good correlation with the gold standard ex vivo method of gravimetry. However, mixed results have been reported in the literature with the grade of correlation of clinicians' chest X-ray reports or clinicians' scores to extravascular lung water (EVLW), ranging from good over modest to poor.

Recently Horng et al. used a radiologist-based categorical four grade severity score to train a deep learning classification system on chest radiographs and report a high performance. To our knowledge, our present study is the first to explore the usefulness of deep learning in predicting the quantitative pulmonary edema measure EVLW from chest radiographs.

Although there was no bacterial organisms in sputum culture, meropenem was administered for anti-infection. Several hours later, breathe sound was obviously better except the bottoms of bilateral lung with tiny rale. After 48 h of supportive care in ICU, the pulmonary edema resolved rapidly, reexamined chest CT demonstrated the most of lung field was clean except bilateral lower lobe alveolar infiltrates and consolidation (Fig. 4).

### Focused liquid ultrasonography in dropsy protocol for quantitative assessment of subcutaneous edema [^116VLnuq]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Critically ill patients have many risk factors for the development of subcutaneous edema, such as increased vascular permeability due to the inflammatory response, fluid resuscitation and fluid overload, cardiac insufficiency, and renal impairment. Danziger et al. found that 18% of critically ill patients had subcutaneous edema when admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 6% had both pulmonary and subcutaneous edema. Patients with subcutaneous edema tended to be older, with a greater prevalence of heart failure, diabetes, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, sepsis, and acute kidney injury.

Although it is common practice to examine hospitalized patients for subcutaneous edema, this aspect of the job has not received adequate attention (7). There is also a lack of studies on the subcutaneous edema state in critically ill patients. The main reason is that there is no internationally unified standard for the evaluation and measurement of subcutaneous edema in critically ill patients, and the existing methods are unsuitable for assessing the overall systemic edema state of critically ill patients. Nowadays, the pitting test (PT) represents the most extensive physical examination and grading method for subcutaneous edema. The severity of edema, from slight to very marked, is traditionally reported on a four-point scale that reflects the amount of time for the skin to return to normal after applying pressure. However, the grading of pitting edema is subjective. The development of alternative objective assessment tools is required.

While ultrasound has been widely used in assessing pulmonary edema, its application in the evaluation of subcutaneous tissue edema, especially in critically ill patients, has rarely been reported. Ultrasound emits sound waves to create images of subcutaneous tissues. When the sound wave reaches the boundary of an acoustically different tissue, such as fluid or soft tissue, part of the energy is reflected back in a manner dependent on the acoustic difference. This allows the exploration of subcutaneous structures and their changes by high-frequency ultrasound probes. This led to investigations of the feasibility and reliability of ultrasonography for assessing subcutaneous edema in specific body parts. However, data on its value in assessing the systemic edema state of critically ill patients are still limited. Therefore, the aims of the present study were: (1) to explore the strategy of systematic assessment of subcutaneous edema by ultrasound; (2) to observe the distribution characteristics of subcutaneous edema and identify factors associated with its occurrence; and (3) to evaluate its impact on ICU mortality.

### Pulmonary ultrasound-guided management of delayed pulmonary edema secondary to nitric acid fumes inhalation: a case report [^116f1tPj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The 52-year-old female patient is a chemical plant worker. According to the patient's description, she accidentally inhaled nitric acid fumes at work. At first, she only had a mild cough. About 8 h later, she developed chest tightness, shortness of breath, expectoration, and the sputum was yellow foamy, accompanied by nausea, so she went to the emergency room. Physical examination at the time of admission: pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, blood pressure 188/99 mmHg, and peripheral oxygen saturation 97% (nasal cannula 5 L/min). At this time, the patient's P/F ratio was measured at 277 mmHg. The patient was conscious, the pharyngeal mucosa was not edematous, and the lips were not cyanotic. Auscultation revealed symmetrical breathing sounds in both lungs, and moist rales could be heard. The admission diagnosis was inhalation of toxic gas pneumonia and hypertension.

### Ultrasound of extravascular lung water: a new standard for pulmonary congestion [^117Phvma]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

B-lines also have a striking prognostic value, shown in patients with heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, and dialysis. Persistent B-lines at pre-discharge assessment are associated with a more malignant prognosis than B-lines on admission only. End-stage kidney disease patients with concomitant heart failure with very severe congestion (> 60 B-lines) had a 4.2-fold increased risk of death, compared with patients having no or mild congestion (< 15 B-lines). The prognostic value is independent and additive over established clinical, imaging, and laboratory markers, such as NYHA class of dyspnoea, pulmonary congestion signs such as crackles, left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, or cardiac natriuretic peptide levels.

Lung ultrasound also provides a useful biomarker to assess the time course of lung water changes following interventions, since within minutes or a few hours, B-lines in heart failure patients are substantially reduced after diuretics, or following dialysis.

### Lung ultrasound for the cardiologist [^111zCbLg]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

For a cardiologist, lung ultrasound is an add-on to transthoracic echocardiography, just as lung auscultation is part of a cardiac physical examination. A cardiac 3.5- to 5.0-MHz transducer is generally suitable because the small footprint makes it ideal for scanning intercostal spaces. The image quality is often adequate, and the lung acoustic window is always patent. The cumulative increase in imaging time is < 1 min for the 2 main applications targeted on pleural water (pleural effusion) and lung water (pulmonary congestion as multiple B-lines). In these settings, lung ultrasound outperforms the diagnostic accuracy of the chest radiograph, with a low-cost, portable, real-time, radiation-free method. A "wet lung" detected by lung ultrasound predicts impending acute heart failure decompensation and may trigger lung decongestion therapy. The doctors of tomorrow may still listen with a stethoscope to their patient's lung, but they will certainly be seeing it with ultrasound.

Results

At the conclusion of survey 3, panelists reached consensus on 80 of 135 items (59%). The full questionnaire and scores are presented in e-Table 1.

Patients With ILD Who Are Likely to Benefit From Early Diagnosis and Screening for PH

Panelists reached consensus that, if an FDA-approved therapy for PH in patients with ILD became available, earlier evaluations for PH than are done in current practice are likely to benefit patients, with a mean consensus score ± SD of 4.56 ± 0.70. Early diagnosis and treatment for PH-ILD would be beneficial for a wide array of ILDs (Fig 1). Early diagnosis and treatment would also be beneficial for patients with progressive ILD, patients who require supplemental oxygen, and patients with symptoms or signs disproportionate to the severity of their ILD, especially when changes in symptoms are not explained by progression of ILD (Fig 1).

Delphi consensus scores for ILD types and disease characteristics that could benefit from earlier diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension if a Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment is available. Items that reached consensus. Vertical rectangles indicate the mean consensus score for each item. Horizontal error bars depict the SD. Consensus was defined as a mean score ≥ 2.5 with an SD that does not cross 0. FDA = United States Food and Drug Administration; ILD = interstitial lung disease; PH = pulmonary hypertension.

Triggers for Suspicion of PH

In the initial Delphi survey, panelists suggested 19 signs and symptoms as possible triggers for suspicion of PH in patients with ILD. In survey 3, panelists reached consensus on nine of these signs and symptoms: syncope, jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, ascites, altered heart sounds (especially loud P2 or S2), hepatomegaly, history of pulmonary embolism, dizziness, and palpitations (Fig 2). Development or worsening of these symptoms should prompt further evaluation. No consensus was reached for the signs and symptoms of weight gain, dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, arrhythmias, abnormal arterial blood gases, fatigue, signs of left heart failure, hemoptysis, Raynaud's disease, or increased heart rate response to exercise (e-Fig 1).

### Combination of lung ultrasound (a comet-tail sign) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in differentiating acute heart failure from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma as cause of acute dyspnea in prehospital emergency setting [^111ohXWn]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute congestive heart failure (CHF) is one of the main causes of acute dyspnea encountered in prehospital emergency settings and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The early and correct diagnosis presents a significant clinical challenge and is of primary importance, as misdiagnosis can result in deleterious consequences to patients. Rapid bedside tests, especially brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), help in determining the cause of acute dyspnea in the prehospital setting. Point-of-care bedside lung ultrasound has also become a useful method for diagnosing CHF. The technique is based on the recognition and analysis of sonographic artefacts caused by the interaction of water-rich structures and air, called comet tails or B lines. When such artefacts are widely detected on anterolateral transthoracic lung scans, diffuse alveolar-interstitial syndrome can be diagnosed and the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), another important cause of acute dyspnea, can be ruled out. Lichtenstein et al. first described comet-tail signs or B lines indicating interstitial pulmonary edema, and Lichtenstein and Mezière described a systematic approach to lung ultrasound. Volpicelli et al. proposed a simplified ultrasound approach to diagnosing the alveolar-interstitial syndrome at bedside. Liteplo et al. combined emergency thoracic ultrasound and NT-proBNP to differentiate CHF from COPD in the emergency department.

The aim of our study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of bedside lung ultrasound (bilateral comet-tail sign or multiple vertical B lines, referred to as "lung rockets"), NT-proBNP and clinical assessment in differentiating heart failure (HF)-related acute dyspnea from pulmonary (COPD/asthma)-related acute dyspnea in the prehospital setting (that is, in the field).

### Utility of lung ultrasound in near-drowning victims [^1173z2nX]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Drowning and near-drowning are common causes of accidental death worldwide and respiratory complications such as non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia are often seen. In other settings lung ultrasound can accurately diagnose these conditions; hence lung ultrasound may have a potential role in the evaluation of drowning or near-drowning victims. In this case report the authors describe a 71-year-old man who was brought to hospital with acute respiratory failure after a near-drowning accident. Lung ultrasound showed multiple B-lines on the anterior and lateral surfaces of both lungs, consistent with pulmonary oedema. Focus assessed transthoracic echocardiography showed no pericardial effusion and a normal global left ventricular function. Based on these findings the patient was diagnosed as having non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Subsequent chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary oedema. The case report emphasises the clinical value of lung ultrasound in the evaluation of a near-drowning victim.

### Swimming-induced pulmonary edema [^114YiG6d]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary edema of water immersion, which is not associated with aspiration or a closed glottis, is infrequently described in the literature. Swimming-induced pulmonary edema is a syndrome whose pathophysiologic characteristics have not been fully elucidated. Immersion alone has marked effects on central vascular volume, redistribution of pulmonary blood flow, and lung volumes. These changes are more prominent in cold water. These changes, coupled with an elevated cardiac output, may expose regions of the capillary bed to high pressures that favor the extravasation of fluid by hydrostatic forces and potential stress failure of the capillaries. Patients with swimming-induced pulmonary edema present with dyspnea, cough, hypoxemia, and occasionally hemoptysis. Physical examination and chest radiographs usually reveal evidence of pulmonary edema. Treatment is symptomatic and conservative. Improvement and resolution of symptoms are usually rapid, with radiographic normalization in 24 to 48 hours. We describe here 3 cases of swimming-induced pulmonary edema.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of point-of-care ultrasound examinations [^116bBDQN]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Point-of-care thoracic ultrasound — limitations are highlighted for trauma and pneumothorax evaluation, noting that ultrasound may be technically limited in the trauma patient because of obesity, subcutaneous emphysema, patient positioning, the degree of injury, adhesions from prior surgery, and patients who are either in pain or combative. The main limitation of the point-of-care thoracic examination is that the operator must be knowledgeable in its clinical use. For pneumothorax assessment, limitations include main-stem bronchus intubation, failure to recognize the lung pulse as cardiac-induced movement, patients after pleurodesis, and patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other lung pathology inhibiting adequate visualization of lung sliding. Although the sensitivity in the detection of pneumothorax is very high, it is important to note that small apical or localized pneumothoraces may not be visualized even in a focused thoracic ultrasound examination. In addition, limitations in the evaluation of the B-line pattern include the ability to differentiate between cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema producing a similar appearance.

### Prognostic value of the physical examination in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation: insights from the AF-CHF trial (atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure) [^114GarqX]. JACC: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to assess the prognostic value of physical examination in a modern treated heart failure population.

Background

The physical examination is the cornerstone of the evaluation and monitoring of patients with heart failure. Yet, the prognostic value of congestive signs (i.e., peripheral edema, jugular venous distension, a third heart sound, and pulmonary rales) has not been assessed in the current era.

Methods

A post-hoc analysis was conducted on all 1,376 patients, 81% male, mean age 67 ± 11 years, with symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction enrolled in the AF-CHF (Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure) trial. The prognostic value of baseline physical examination findings was assessed in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.

Results

Peripheral edema was observed in 425 (30.9%), jugular venous distension in 297 (21.6%), a third heart sound in 207 (15.0%), and pulmonary rales in 178 (12.9%) patients. Death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 357 (25.9%) patients over a mean follow-up of 37 ± 19 months. All 4 physical examination findings were associated with cardiovascular mortality in univariate analyses (all p values < 0.01). In multivariate analyses, taking all 4 signs as potential covariates, only rales (hazard ratio 1.41; 95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 1.86; p = 0.013) and peripheral edema (hazard ratio: 1.25; 95% confidence interval: 1.00 to 1.57; p = 0.048) were associated with cardiovascular mortality, independent of other variables.

Conclusions

In the modern era, congestive signs on the physical examination (i.e., peripheral edema, jugular venous distension, a third heart sound, and pulmonary rales) continue to provide important prognostic information in patients with congestive heart failure.

Acute cough algorithm — adult initial management, red flags, and follow-up: The figure applies to "patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting ≤ 3 weeks" and instructs to "Always screen for the presence of red flags as a clue to a potentially life-threatening condition". Listed life-threatening causes include "Pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease". It also advises to "Always consider the presence of TB in endemic areas or high-risk populations even if chest radiographs are normal" and to "Remember to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and routinely follow patients 4–6 weeks after initial visit". Red flags include "Hemoptysis", "Smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance", "Adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years", "Prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night", "Hoarseness", "Systemic symptoms" (with "Fever", "Weight loss", "Peripheral edema with weight gain"), "Trouble swallowing when eating or drinking", "Vomiting", "Recurrent pneumonia", and "Abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough".

Other qualities of dyspnea and overall perception — sensations of effort, tightness, and air hunger are more reliably characterized than others, and the mechanisms above do not adequately explain dyspnea from vascular problems such as congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary vascular receptors (J-receptors?) may play a role, but only suggestive evidence is available. Multiple distinguishable sensations seldom occur in isolation, and multiple uncomfortable sensations are often present and together produce the overall perception of dyspnea; even specific laboratory stimuli generally stimulate more than one afferent pathway. Assessment with magnitude scales may be more sensitive than binary choices, though reports of dyspnea are not as consistent as reports of colors or sounds.

Reexpansion pulmonary edema is a rare complication that may occur after drainage of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A number of factors have been identified that increase the risk of developing reexpansion pulmonary edema, and pathophysiologic mechanisms have been postulated. Patients may present with radiographic findings alone or may have signs or symptoms that prompt evaluation and diagnosis. Clinical presentations range from mild cough to respiratory failure and hemodynamic compromise. Treatment strategies are supportive, and should be tailored to match the severity of the condition.

Data Collection and Outcome Measures

On arrival at the MMU, wetsuits were removed and patients were warmed with blankets. Medical history, clinical parameters, and symptoms were documented. Clinical symptoms were noted by the physician as yes or no for dyspnea, cough, sputum, or hemoptysis. Treatment with CPAP or PEP device was applied as described separately. To evaluate which measures could indicate successful treatment outcome, data for the following four measures were collected: Sp 2, crackles on pulmonary auscultation, findings of pulmonary edema on LUS, and patient-reported respiratory symptoms. The latter three outcome measures were added over the study period (Table 1). Sp 2 was measured with a pulse oximeter (Nellcor Oximax N-65; Covidien). Pulmonary auscultation findings were reported by the attending physician as normal breathing sounds, crackles, and other findings. LUS examination was performed by two experienced consultant anesthesiologists as described previously (BK Medical Flex Focus 500 with a curved probe [BK Medical type 8823] of 2–6 MHz; BK Medical AB). Eight chest regions were scanned for B-lines. For each lung region, a clip of 2 s was recorded, and later reviewed in a masked fashion by the other physician. Bilateral or unilateral presence of two or more positive regions (≥ 3 B-lines) was defined as pulmonary edema. Six different patient-reported respiratory symptoms were assessed by a numerical rating scale (0–10) (e-Fig 1): two symptoms typically occurring in patients with SIPE (cough and mucus in the airways) as well as four different qualities of dyspnea, modified from the multidimensional dyspnea profile instrument (air hunger, physical breathing effort, tightness of the chest, and anxiety).

### Lung ultrasound score assessing the pulmonary edema in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome received continuous hemofiltration therapy: a prospective observational study [^1142dHQd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is one of the main forms of presentation caused by non-cardiogenic factors such as shock, sepsis, pneumonia, and other in ARDS. Reduction of pulmonary edema is critical for improving pulmonary function, and assessment of pulmonary edema is effective method in monitoring and guidance of therapy in patients with ARDS.

Though lung computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for noninvasive evaluation of pulmonary edema, it is unsuitable to perform repeatedly in children with severe ARDS due to its radioactive hazard and safety. Extravascular lung water (EVLW) which results in pulmonary edema reflects the severity of ARDS. But detection of EVLW by a pulse indicator continuous cardiac output (PiCCO 2) device is invasive and inconvenient. Moreover, evidences demonstrated that the relationship between EVLW and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio or oxygenation index (OI) was weak. Otherwise, LUS could determine nearly all of pulmonary pathologic abnormalities. Recent reports indicated that LUS score is used as an alternative method for evaluating pulmonary edema and EVLW in ARDS. However, there is no report about the relationship between LUS score and pulmonary function in children with ARDS. Our previous study and other report indicated that patients with ARDS received CRRT had better outcome than that without CRRT.

We hypothesized that LUS score could assess accurately lung function and improvement of pulmonary edema during CRRT in pediatric ARDS.

### Ultrasound lung comets: a clinically useful sign of extravascular lung water [^111oARJB]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2006). Low credibility.

Assessment of extravascular lung water is a challenging task for the clinical cardiologist and an elusive target for the echocardiographer. Today chest x-ray is considered the best way to assess extravascular lung water objectively, but this requires radiology facilities and specific reading expertise, uses ionizing energy, and poses a significant logistic burden. Recently, a new method was developed using echocardiography (with cardiac probes) of the lung. An increase in extravascular lung water-as assessed independently by chest computed tomography, chest x-ray, and thermodilution techniques-is mirrored by appearance of ultrasound lung comets (ULCs). ULCs consist of multiple comet tails originating from water-thickened interlobular septa and fanning out from the lung surface. The technique requires ultrasound scanning of the anterior right and left chest, from the second to the fifth intercostal space. It is simple (with a learning curve of < 10 examinations) and fast to perform (requiring < 3 minutes). ULC assessment is independent of the cardiac acoustic window, because the lung on the anterior chest is scanned. It requires very basic 2-D technology imaging, even without a second harmonic or Doppler. ULCs probably represent an ultrasonic equivalent of radiologic Kerley B-lines. On still-frame assessment, cardiogenic watery comets can be difficult to distinguish from pneumogenic fibrotic comets, although the latter are usually more localized and are not dissolved by an acute diuretic challenge. Functionally, ULCs are a sign of distress of the alveolar-capillary membrane, often associated with reduced ejection fraction and increased pulmonary wedge pressure. The ULC sign is quantitative, reproducible, and ideally suited to complement conventional echocardiography in the evaluation of heart failure patients in the emergency department (for the differential diagnosis of dyspnea), in-hospital evaluation (for tailoring diuretic therapy), home care (with portable ultrasound), and stress echocardiography lab (as a sign of acute pulmonary congestion during stress). In conclusion, ULCs represent a useful, practical, and appealingly simple way to image directly extravascular lung water.

### Changes in the mechanical properties of the respiratory system during the development of interstitial lung edema [^111gxLaz]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Comparison to previous studies on lung edema

Previous studies correlating the development of lung edema with changes of lung mechanics were focused mainly either on the effects of pulmonary congestion only or on the effects of later stages of acute lung edema.

When the perturbation was limited to pulmonary congestion, mechanical properties of the lung were found to be minimally affected in the range of lung volume considered in our study. The slight changes previously observed (i.e. decrease in compliance and an increase in pulmonary resistance), are, however, in the same direction as the changes reported in the present study.

Conversely, a major impact on lung mechanics was found when later stages of lung edema were induced by either volume loading, increase in microvascular permeability increase in left atrial pressure or aortic occlusion. However, these models caused pulmonary congestion, alveolar fluid accumulation, small airways compression/occlusion, conditions that clearly impact on the overall mechanical properties of the respiratory system including, of course, airways resistance and lung compliance. A further complication in the evaluation of respiratory mechanics during edema development is the repeated use of BAL that may cause ventilation heterogeneities.

### Pulmonary edema in pneumonia and its treatment… [^112mGnpd]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Edema of the lungs becomes a clinical condition when there is such an accumulation of tissue fluid in the tissue spaces that it transudes into the alveoli. Thus the patient's lung tends to fill with fluid to the exclusion of air, and actually approximates the condition in drowning. The edema appears first in the lower lobes and the middle lobe, and not till the late stages does it extend to any great degree to the upper lobes. The first distinctive signs are dyspnea and large liquid râles over the lower lobes. In severe degrees of edema the breathing is that of suffocation, there is cyanosis, and there exudes or is expectorated from the mouth a thin serous frothy fluid often tinged with blood. This fluid contains protein, and is recorded as amounting to as much as 2 liters. Edema of the lungs may present itself in BASTEDO WA. PULMONARY EDEMA IN PNEUMONIA AND ITS TREATMENT.

### Lung sounds for the clinician… [^113TaRKW]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Recent interest in lung sound physiology has led to a sharp increase in the publication of articles that describe new techniques of examining lung sounds. Although most of the results of these investigations are of interest primarily to other researchers, several have practical value and should be of interest to the clinician because of the objective support that they lend to various aspects of the physical examination. This short review provides an outline of recent work relating to vesicular lung sounds, crackles, and wheezes. The information is presented with emphasis on practical applications. Kraman SS.

wheezingListen to pronunciationA high-pitched, whistling sound that can occur during breathing when the airways in the lungs become narrowed or blocked. Wheezing is a sign that a person may be having trouble breathing. There are many causes of wheezing, but the most common causes are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, and pulmonary edema. Other causes include cystic fibrosis, pneumonia or other respiratory infections, breathing a foreign object into the lungs, congestive heart failure, vocal cord problems, acid reflux disease, allergies, severe allergic reactions, certain medicines, smoking, or a tumor in the lung or airway.
