## Question

Depakote dosing for siezures

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Depakote (divalproex sodium) dosing for seizures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug formulations and labeled indications. Then, I should verify the universal mg/kg dosing framework and titration cadence. Next, I will examine dose adjustments by seizure type, including complex partial, absence, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. After that, I need to check special populations such as pediatrics, the elderly, hepatic and renal impairment, and pregnancy. I will then review drug–drug interactions that alter levels and require monitoring. Finally, I should confirm safety thresholds, monitoring, and a practical dosing algorithm, and I will double-check any conflicting sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the formulation landscape and labeled uses, because dosing and titration differ between delayed-release and extended-release products and by indication. Depakote delayed-release is indicated for complex partial seizures and absence seizures, and as adjunctive therapy in multiple seizure types, whereas Depakote ER is indicated for complex partial seizures and absence seizures, with some sources listing generalized tonic-clonic seizures as an additional indication, though I should verify whether that is on-label or commonly used off-label in practice [^1172xcpE] [^111tGydh].

> I need to verify the universal dosing framework. The FDA labeling consistently recommends starting at 10–15 mg/kg/day and titrating by 5–10 mg/kg/week toward a usual effective range below 60 mg/kg/day, with therapeutic total valproate concentrations typically falling between 50 and 100 mcg/mL; if control is inadequate, levels should be checked and dosing adjusted accordingly, keeping in mind the nonlinear relationship between dose and total concentration due to saturable protein binding [^112FyKgB] [^1172xcpE] [^112xbxiv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about seizure-type specifics. For complex partial seizures, both monotherapy and adjunctive therapy follow the 10–15 mg/kg/day start with 5–10 mg/kg/week titration, targeting below 60 mg/kg/day and using divided doses when the total exceeds 250 mg/day; I should confirm that this applies across DR and ER formulations, which it does in the FDA materials [^112FyKgB] [^1172xcpE] [^1126DBKB].

> For absence seizures, I initially thought the starting dose was uniformly 15 mg/kg/day, but wait, let me verify the formulation nuance. The DR labeling recommends 15 mg/kg/day with 5–10 mg/kg/week increases, whereas the ER monograph aligns with the 10–15 mg/kg/day start for epilepsy broadly; practically, many clinicians use 15 mg/kg/day for absence seizures given the traditional guidance, but I should note that the ER epilepsy sections still anchor to the 10–15 mg/kg/day framework, so I will present both and emphasize clinical judgment and level monitoring [^112xbxiv] [^113scHBc].

> For generalized tonic-clonic seizures, I should confirm whether the ER formulation provides explicit dosing. The ER monograph includes a fixed-dose adult regimen starting at 250 mg daily with maintenance commonly 1,000–2,000 mg daily, which is a practical approach when weight-based dosing is less critical or when converting from other regimens; I need to ensure this is framed as an ER-specific pathway rather than replacing the mg/kg framework used for other indications [^116hhomY] [^113scHBc].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with pediatrics. Children 10 years and older follow the same mg/kg principles as adults, and younger children have slower clearance early in life, necessitating cautious titration; pediatric PK studies of ER show similar exposure profiles to adults with once-daily dosing, supporting the same mg/kg framework in older children and adolescents, though I should double-check that the ER formulation is appropriate for the specific seizure type and age [^1172xcpE] [^1149mV9g] [^113YKDNw].

> For older adults, I need to ensure dose reduction and slower titration are emphasized. The FDA advises lower starting doses, slower titration, and closer monitoring for somnolence, dehydration, and nutrition, reflecting reduced unbound clearance and increased sensitivity; I should confirm that this applies across formulations, which it does in the general dosing advice sections [^113PzMM2] [^113N3aCt].

> Hepatic impairment requires a strict contraindication, and I should confirm that both DR and ER carry this warning. The labels advise against use in patients with significant liver disease due to risk of hepatotoxicity and hyperammonemia, so I need to ensure baseline liver function testing and ongoing surveillance are standard, and avoid use when liver disease is present [^114RxkH6] [^111oE42m].

> Renal impairment is different; I should verify whether dose adjustment is needed. The FDA materials indicate no routine dose adjustment is required for renal impairment, though clinical monitoring remains prudent, particularly for fluid status and concomitant medications that may affect clearance or protein binding [^114afqCx].

> Pregnancy warrants a dedicated pause, because I need to ensure teratogenic risk counseling and preconception planning are front and center. Guidelines recommend optimizing ASM selection and dosing preconception, favoring lower teratogenic-risk options when feasible, and if valproate is necessary, using the lowest effective dose with close monitoring; I should confirm that this is a Level B recommendation in the AAN/AES/SMFM guidance, which it is [^112kgXuY].

> I will now examine drug–drug interactions that materially alter valproate exposure and thus dosing strategy. Enzyme-inducing AEDs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital increase valproate clearance and may necessitate higher doses and more frequent level checks; conversely, felbamate can raise valproate levels and may require dose reduction, and carbapenems can markedly decrease valproate concentrations and are generally not recommended with valproate; estrogen-containing contraceptives can also increase valproate clearance, so I should confirm level monitoring when these are introduced or withdrawn [^1149mV9g] [^1167r9Ko] [^116mKG2F] [^116HURsU].

> Safety thresholds and monitoring must be explicit. Thrombocytopenia risk rises significantly at total trough valproate concentrations above about 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males, so I should confirm that levels are checked when control is suboptimal or adverse effects emerge; baseline and periodic CBC, liver function tests, and coagulation parameters are advised, with heightened vigilance in the elderly and those with nutritional compromise [^1172xcpE] [^113PzMM2] [^115Dddgm].

> Let me consider formulation-specific practicalities, because absorption and peak/trough behavior can influence tolerability and once-daily feasibility. ER formulations provide smoother exposure and may permit once-daily dosing in some patients, but I should confirm that dose adjustments may be needed when switching from DR to ER; clinical data suggest that maintaining similar total levels may require a modest increase in total daily dose when converting DR to ER, so I should plan for level checks after switching and adjust accordingly [^1164UgPn] [^111P3Qfn] [^114dAgiJ].

> I should double-check the practical dosing algorithm to ensure it is coherent and actionable. Start at 10–15 mg/kg/day, titrate by 5–10 mg/kg/week toward control or a maximum of 60 mg/kg/day, divide doses when the total exceeds 250 mg/day, and check trough valproate levels if seizures persist or adverse effects occur; adjust to the 50–100 mcg/mL range while integrating clinical response, and modify for special populations and interactions as above [^112FyKgB] [^1172xcpE] [^1149mV9g].

> But wait, what if a source conflicts with this synthesis? Some ER summaries list generalized tonic-clonic seizures as an indication, yet the core FDA epilepsy sections for ER emphasize complex partial and absence seizures; I should clarify that GTCC dosing appears in ER materials and is clinically used, but it may be off-label in some contexts, so I will present it as an ER-specific regimen with the caveat to verify local formularies and payer policies [^111tGydh] [^113scHBc].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the plan remains patient-centered and safety-focused: use the mg/kg framework with slow titration, monitor levels when control is inadequate, avoid valproate in significant liver disease, adjust for age and interacting drugs, and apply the GTCC fixed-dose ER pathway when appropriate; this balances efficacy with the key risks of hepatotoxicity, hyperammonemia, thrombocytopenia, and teratogenicity, and aligns with FDA labeling and contemporary guidance [^112FyKgB] [^1172xcpE] [^112kgXuY].

Depakote (divalproex sodium) dosing for seizures is **10–15 mg/kg/day** [^112FyKgB] orally in divided doses, titrated by 5–10 mg/kg/week [^1172xcpE] to a usual maintenance of 30–60 mg/kg/day [^116bJQgH], not exceeding 60 mg/kg/day [^113scHBc]. For absence seizures, start at **15 mg/kg/day** [^112xbxiv] and titrate similarly. Monitor trough valproate levels [^1172xcpE] to guide dosing, targeting 50–100 mcg/mL [^1172xcpE]; adjust for clinical response and tolerability. In elderly patients, start lower and titrate more slowly due to increased sensitivity [^113PzMM2]. Avoid abrupt discontinuation to prevent status epilepticus [^112xbxiv].

---

## Initial dosing

- **Standard initial dose**: 10–15 mg/kg/day orally, divided into two or three doses [^112FyKgB] [^1172xcpE].
- **Absence seizures**: Start at 15 mg/kg/day [^112xbxiv], divided into two or three doses.
- **Maximum initial dose**: 60 mg/kg/day [^113scHBc].

---

## Titration and maintenance dosing

- **Titration**: Increase by 5–10 mg/kg/day at weekly intervals [^112FyKgB] based on clinical response and tolerability [^1172xcpE].
- **Maintenance dose**: Typically 30–60 mg/kg/day [^116bJQgH], divided into two or three doses.
- **Maximum maintenance dose**: 60 mg/kg/day [^113scHBc].

---

## Therapeutic drug monitoring

Therapeutic range: **50–100 mcg/mL** [^1172xcpE] (total valproate concentration) [^117VZMkH]. Monitoring: Check trough levels [^117VZMkH] when steady state is reached (approximately 3–4 days after initiation or dose change) [^notfound] and adjust dosing to maintain therapeutic levels [^1172xcpE].

---

## Special populations

### Elderly patients

Start lower and titrate more slowly due to increased sensitivity and risk of adverse effects [^113PzMM2]. Monitor closely for **sedation, dehydration, and nutritional status** [^113PzMM2].

---

### Pediatric patients

Pharmacokinetics in older children and adolescents are similar to adults, allowing once-daily dosing with extended-release formulations [^114LUt6p]. Younger children may require more frequent dosing due to shorter half-life and faster clearance [^notfound].

---

### Patients with hepatic impairment

Contraindicated in patients with significant hepatic disease due to risk of hepatotoxicity [^114RxkH6] [^111oE42m].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Abrupt discontinuation**: Avoid to prevent status epilepticus [^112xbxiv].
- **Drug interactions**: Valproate interacts with other antiepileptic drugs (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine) [^1172xcpE], necessitating careful monitoring and dose adjustments [^1149mV9g].
- **Adverse effects**: Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal disturbances, weight gain, tremor, and sedation [^115CwVNh] [^113qQYDB].

Conversion to Monotherapy

Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50–100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Depakote therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

Adjunctive Therapy

Depakote may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

2.2 Epilepsy

Depakote tablets are administered orally. Depakote is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. As the Depakote dosage is titrated upward, concentrations of clonazepam, diazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, tolbutamide, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Complex Partial Seizures

For adults and children 10 years of age or older.

Monotherapy (Initial Therapy)

Depakote has not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males. The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^112xbxiv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Simple and Complex Absence Seizures

The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentrations for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As the Depakote dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.

In epileptic patients previously receiving valproic acid therapy, Depakote tablets should be initiated at the same daily dose and dosing schedule. After the patient is stabilized on Depakote tablets, a dosing schedule of two or three times a day may be elected in selected patients.

2.3 Migraine

Depakote is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults.

Depakote tablets are administered orally. The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily. Some patients may benefit from doses up to 1,000 mg/day. In the clinical trials, there was no evidence that higher doses led to greater efficacy.

Figure 2

The second study assessed the capacity of valproate to reduce the incidence of CPS when administered as the sole AED. The study compared the incidence of CPS among patients randomized to either a high or low dose treatment arm. Patients qualified for entry into the randomized comparison phase of this study only if 1) they continued to experience 2 or more CPS per 4 weeks during an 8 to 12 week long period of monotherapy with adequate doses of an AED (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or primidone) and 2) they made a successful transition over a two week interval to valproate. Patients entering the randomized phase were then brought to their assigned target dose, gradually tapered off their concomitant AED and followed for an interval as long as 22 weeks. Less than 50% of the patients randomized, however, completed the study. In patients converted to Depakote monotherapy, the mean total valproate concentrations during monotherapy were 71 and 123 mcg/mL in the low dose and high dose groups, respectively.

The following table presents the findings for all patients randomized who had at least one post-randomization assessment.

Figure 3 presents the proportion of patients (X axis) whose percentage reduction from baseline in complex partial seizure rates was at least as great as that indicated on the Y axis in the monotherapy study. A positive percent reduction indicates an improvement (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative percent reduction indicates worsening. Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for a more effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for a less effective treatment. This figure shows that the proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction was consistently higher for high dose valproate than for low dose valproate. For example, when switching from carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital or primidone monotherapy to high dose valproate monotherapy, 63% of patients experienced no change or a reduction in complex partial seizure rates compared to 54% of patients receiving low dose valproate.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption/Bioavailability

Equivalent oral doses of Depakote (divalproex sodium) products and valproic acid capsules deliver equivalent quantities of valproate ion systemically. Although the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation administered (liquid, solid, or sprinkle), conditions of use (e.g., fasting or postprandial) and the method of administration (e.g., whether the contents of the capsule are sprinkled on food or the capsule is taken intact), these differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy.

However, it is possible that differences among the various valproate products in Tmaxand Cmaxcould be important upon initiation of treatment. For example, in single dose studies, the effect of feeding had a greater influence on the rate of absorption of the tablet (increase in Tmaxfrom 4 to 8 hours) than on the absorption of the sprinkle capsules (increase in Tmaxfrom 3.3 to 4.8 hours).

While the absorption rate from the G. I. tract and fluctuation in valproate plasma concentrations vary with dosing regimen and formulation, the efficacy of valproate as an anticonvulsant in chronic use is unlikely to be affected. Experience employing dosing regimens from once-a-day to four-times-a-day, as well as studies in primate epilepsy models involving constant rate infusion, indicate that total daily systemic bioavailability (extent of absorption) is the primary determinant of seizure control and that differences in the ratios of plasma peak to trough concentrations between valproate formulations are inconsequential from a practical clinical standpoint. Whether or not rate of absorption influences the efficacy of valproate as an antimanic or antimigraine agent is unknown.

2.4 General Dosing Advice

Dosing in Elderly Patients

Due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Dose-Related Adverse Reactions

The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.

G. I. Irritation

Patients who experience G. I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level.

2.5 Dosing in Patients Taking Rufinamide

Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^1149mV9g]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The relationship between dose and total valproate concentration is nonlinear; concentration does not increase proportionally with the dose, but rather, increases to a lesser extent due to saturable plasma protein binding. The kinetics of unbound drug are linear.

Elimination

Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for total valproate are 0.56 L/hr/1.73 m2and 11 L/1.73 m2, respectively. Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free valproate are 4.6 L/hr/1.73 m2and 92 L/1.73 m2. Mean terminal half-life for valproate monotherapy ranged from 9 to 16 hours following oral dosing regimens of 250 to 1,000 mg.

The estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems. For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn.

Specific Populations

Effect of Age

Neonates

Children within the first two months of life have a markedly decreased ability to eliminate valproate compared to older children and adults. This is a result of reduced clearance (perhaps due to delay in development of glucuronosyltransferase and other enzyme systems involved in valproate elimination) as well as increased volume of distribution (in part due to decreased plasma protein binding). For example, in one study, the half-life in children under 10 days ranged from 10 to 67 hours compared to a range of 7 to 13 hours in children greater than 2 months.

### Divalproex sodium (divalproex sodium extended-release) [^111GYCgb]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Conversion to Monotherapy

Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50–100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

Adjunctive Therapy

Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day.

Depakote was statistically significantly superior to placebo on all three measures of outcome. An exploratory analysis for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or gender.

A comparison of the percentage of patients showing ≥ 30% reduction in the symptom score from baseline in each treatment group, separated by study, is shown in Figure 1.

14.2 Epilepsy

The efficacy of valproate in reducing the incidence of complex partial seizures (CPS) that occur in isolation or in association with other seizure types was established in two controlled trials.

In one, multi-clinic, placebo controlled study employing an add-on design (adjunctive therapy), 144 patients who continued to suffer eight or more CPS per 8 weeks during an 8 week period of monotherapy with doses of either carbamazepine or phenytoin sufficient to assure plasma concentrations within the "therapeutic range" were randomized to receive, in addition to their original antiepilepsy drug (AED), either Depakote or placebo. Randomized patients were to be followed for a total of 16 weeks. The following table presents the findings.

Figure 2 presents the proportion of patients (X axis) whose percentage reduction from baseline in complex partial seizure rates was at least as great as that indicated on the Y axis in the adjunctive therapy study. A positive percent reduction indicates an improvement (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative percent reduction indicates worsening. Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. This figure shows that the proportion of patients achieving any particular level of improvement was consistently higher for valproate than for placebo. For example, 45% of patients treated with valproate had a ≥ 50% reduction in complex partial seizure rate compared to 23% of patients treated with placebo.

The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males. The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.

Conversion to Monotherapy Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of divalproex sodium therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

Adjunctive Therapy Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^115BP49r]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Co-administration of oral valproate products with food and substitution among the various Depakote and valproic acid formulations should cause no clinical problems in the management of patients with epilepsy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Nonetheless, any changes in dosage administration, or the addition or discontinuance of concomitant drugs should ordinarily be accompanied by close monitoring of clinical status and valproate plasma concentrations.

Distribution

Protein Binding

The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin). Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) for more detailed information on the pharmacokinetic interactions of valproate with other drugs].

CNS Distribution

Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10% of total concentration).

Metabolism

Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver. In adult patients on monotherapy, 30–50% of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. Mitochondrial β-oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40% of the dose. Usually, less than 15–20% of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Simple and Complex Absence Seizures

The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentrations for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As the divalproex sodium dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.

In epileptic patients previously receiving valproic acid therapy, divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets should be initiated at the same daily dose and dosing schedule. After the patient is stabilized on divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, a dosing schedule of two or three times a day may be elected in selected patients.

2.3 Migraine

Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults.

Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are administered orally. The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily. Some patients may benefit from doses up to 1,000 mg/day. In the clinical trials, there was no evidence that higher doses led to greater efficacy.

Carbapenem Antibiotics

A clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction is not well understood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

Estrogen-Containing Hormonal Contraceptives

Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives may increase the clearance of valproate, which may result in decreased concentration of valproate and potentially increased seizure frequency. Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing estrogen containing products.

Felbamate

A study involving the co-administration of 1,200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with epilepsy (n = 10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 to 115 mcg/mL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase). A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.

Methotrexate

Methotrexate may decrease serum valproate levels and potentially result in increased frequency of seizures or bipolar symptoms. Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing methotrexate and adjust valproate dosage, if necessary.

Rifampin

A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate. Valproate dosage adjustment may be necessary when it is co-administered with rifampin.

6.2 Epilepsy

Based on a placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive therapy for treatment of complex partial seizures, Depakote was generally well tolerated with most adverse reactions rated as mild to moderate in severity. Intolerance was the primary reason for discontinuation in the Depakote-treated patients (6%), compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients.

Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions which were reported by ≥ 5% of Depakote-treated patients and for which the incidence was greater than in the placebo group, in the placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive therapy for treatment of complex partial seizures. Since patients were also treated with other antiepilepsy drugs, it is not possible, in most cases, to determine whether the following adverse reactions can be ascribed to Depakote alone, or the combination of Depakote and other antiepilepsy drugs.

Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions which were reported by ≥ 5% of patients in the high dose valproate group, and for which the incidence was greater than in the low dose group, in a controlled trial of Depakote monotherapy treatment of complex partial seizures. Since patients were being titrated off another antiepilepsy drug during the first portion of the trial, it is not possible, in many cases, to determine whether the following adverse reactions can be ascribed to Depakote alone, or the combination of valproate and other antiepilepsy drugs.

The following additional adverse reactions were reported by greater than 1% but less than 5% of the 358 patients treated with valproate in the controlled trials of complex partial seizures:

Body as a Whole: Back pain, chest pain, malaise.

14.3 Migraine

The results of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials established the effectiveness of Depakote in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache.

Both studies employed essentially identical designs and recruited patients with a history of migraine with or without aura (of at least 6 months in duration) who were experiencing at least 2 migraine headaches a month during the 3 months prior to enrollment. Patients with cluster headaches were excluded. Women of childbearing potential were excluded entirely from one study, but were permitted in the other if they were deemed to be practicing an effective method of contraception.

In each study following a 4-week single-blind placebo baseline period, patients were randomized, under double blind conditions, to Depakote or placebo for a 12-week treatment phase, comprised of a 4-week dose titration period followed by an 8-week maintenance period. Treatment outcome was assessed on the basis of 4-week migraine headache rates during the treatment phase.

In the first study, a total of 107 patients (24 M, 83 F), ranging in age from 26 to 73 were randomized 2:1, Depakote to placebo. Ninety patients completed the 8-week maintenance period. Drug dose titration, using 250 mg tablets, was individualized at the investigator's discretion. Adjustments were guided by actual/sham trough total serum valproate levels in order to maintain the study blind. In patients on Depakote doses ranged from 500 to 2,500 mg a day. Doses over 500 mg were given in three divided doses (TID). The mean dose during the treatment phase was 1,087 mg/day resulting in a mean trough total valproate level of 72.5 mcg/mL, with a range of 31 to 133 mcg/mL.

The relationship between dose and total valproate concentration is nonlinear; concentration does not increase proportionally with the dose, but rather, increases to a lesser extent due to saturable plasma protein binding. The kinetics of unbound drug are linear.

Elimination

Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for total valproate are 0.56 L/hr/1.73 m2and 11 L/1.73 m2, respectively. Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free valproate are 4.6 L/hr/1.73 m2and 92 L/1.73 m2. Mean terminal half-life for valproate monotherapy ranged from 9 to 16 hours following oral dosing regimens of 250 to 1000 mg.

The estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems. For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn.

Special Populations

Effect of Age

Pediatric

The valproate pharmacokinetic profile following administration of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets was characterized in a multiple-dose, non-fasting, open label, multi-center study in children and adolescents. Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets once daily doses ranged from 250–1750 mg. Once daily administration of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in pediatric patients (10–17 years) produced plasma VPA concentration-time profiles similar to those that have been observed in adults.

2.4 General Dosing Advice

Dosing in Elderly Patients

Due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Dose-Related Adverse Reactions

The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.

 G. I. Irritation

Patients who experience G. I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level.

2.5 Dosing in Patients Taking Rufinamide

Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

1.1 Mania

Divalproex sodium is a valproate and is indicated for the treatment of the manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Typical symptoms of mania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas, grandiosity, poor judgment, aggressiveness, and possible hostility.

The efficacy of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets was established in 3-week trials with patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for bipolar disorder who were hospitalized for acute mania [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets for long-term use in mania, i.e., more than 3 weeks, has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, healthcare providers who elect to use divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets for extended periods should continually reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

1.2 Epilepsy

Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of patients with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are also indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures, and adjunctively in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures.

Simple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness accompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs. Complex absence is the term used when other signs are also present.

Antiepileptic drugs — divalproex sodium extended-release (ER) — In a randomized Class I placebo-controlled 12-week trial, ER divalproex sodium 500–1,000 mg/day reduced the 4-week migraine headache rate from 4.4/week to 3.2/week (−1.2 attacks/week) versus 4.2/week to 3.6/week (−0.6 attacks/week) with placebo (CI 0.2–1.2; p = 0.006), and no significant differences were detected between groups in treatment-emergent AEs; contextually, "In most headache trials, patients taking divalproex sodium or sodium valproate reported no more AEs than those on placebo", but "weight gain has been clinically observed with divalproex sodium long-term use", and "Treatment with these agents requires careful follow-up and testing because of pancreatitis, liver failure, and teratogenicity risks".

Figure 1

The second study assessed the capacity of divalproex sodium to reduce the incidence of CPS when administered as the sole AED. The study compared the incidence of CPS among patients randomized to either a high or low dose treatment arm. Patients qualified for entry into the randomized comparison phase of this study only if 1) they continued to experience 2 or more CPS per 4 weeks during an 8 to 12 week long period of monotherapy with adequate doses of an AED (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or primidone) and 2) they made a successful transition over a two week interval to divalproex sodium. Patients entering the randomized phase were then brought to their assigned target dose, gradually tapered off their concomitant AED and followed for an interval as long as 22 weeks. Less than 50% of the patients randomized, however, completed the study. In patients converted to divalproex sodium monotherapy, the mean total valproate concentrations during monotherapy were 71 and 123 mcg/mL in the low dose and high dose groups, respectively.

The following Table presents the findings for all patients randomized who had at least one post-randomization assessment.

Figure 2 presents the proportion of patients (X axis) whose percentage reduction from baseline in complex partial seizure rates was at least as great as that indicated on the Y axis in the monotherapy study. A positive percent reduction indicates an improvement (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative percent reduction indicates worsening. Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for a more effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for a less effective treatment. This Figure shows that the proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction was consistently higher for high dose divalproex sodium than for low dose divalproex sodium. For example, when switching from carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital or primidone monotherapy to high dose divalproex sodium monotherapy, 63% of patients experienced no change or a reduction in complex partial seizure rates compared to 54% of patients receiving low dose divalproex sodium.

### Valproate sodium [^1175gU5h]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Epilepsy

Valproate Sodium Injection is for intravenous use only.

Use of Valproate Sodium Injection for periods of more than 14 days has not been studied. Patients should be switched to oral valproate products as soon as it is clinically feasible.

Valproate Sodium Injection should be administered as a 60 minute infusion (but not more than 20 mg/min) with the same frequency as the oral products, although plasma concentration monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary.

In one clinical safety study, approximately 90 patients with epilepsy and with no measurable plasma levels of valproate were given single infusions of Valproate Sodium Injection (up to 15 mg/kg and mean dose of 1184 mg) over 5 to 10 minutes (1.5 to 3 mg/kg/min). Patients generally tolerated the more rapid infusions well [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. This study was not designed to assess the effectiveness of these regimens. For pharmacokinetics with rapid infusions, see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).

Initial Exposure to Valproate

The following dosage recommendations were obtained from studies utilizing oral divalproex sodium products.

Complex Partial Seizures

For adults and children 10 years of age or older.

Monotherapy (Initial Therapy)

Valproate Sodium Injection has not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males. The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.

### Divalproex sodium in children with partial seizures: 12-month safety study [^114mV3MK]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

This phase III, open-label, multicenter, outpatient study evaluated the 12-month safety of valproate using divalproex sodium sprinkle capsules for partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in children aged 3–10 years (n = 169). Laboratory parameters and vital signs were assessed, and the Wechsler Scales of Intelligence, the Developmental Profile-II, movement-related items from the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser, and the Behavior Assessment System for Children were administered. Efficacy was measured by the 4-week seizure rate. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the 169 study patients were typical childhood illnesses: pyrexia (18%), cough (17%), and nasopharyngitis (14%). The most common adverse events not considered typical childhood illnesses were vomiting (14%), tremor (9%), somnolence (8%), and diarrhea (8%). Of the 169 patients, 11 (6.5%) were hospitalized with serious treatment-emergent adverse events. Although elevated ammonia levels were observed in 31 treated patients, and mean increases in uric acid concentrations and decreases in platelets were observed, the majority of patients were asymptomatic. Except for tremor, no increases in movement-related adverse effects were observed. Small numeric improvements were reported in the Wechsler Scales and the Behavior Assessment System for Children. The safety findings in this 12-month study are generally consistent with previous reports of valproate in adult and pediatric epilepsy patients.

### Valproic acid [^115segDx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to divalproex sodium tablets, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Simple and Complex Absence Seizures

The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As the valproic acid dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.

The following table is a guide for the initial daily dose of valproic acid oral solution (15 mg/kg/day):

### Divalproex-ER pharmacokinetics in older children and adolescents [^114LUt6p]. Pediatric Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Valproic acid pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability after administration of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets was characterized in older children and adolescents. In this multiple-dose, open-label, pharmacokinetic study, the patients were divided into two age groups, 8–11 years (older children; n = 15) and 12–17 years (adolescents; n = 14). Once-daily administration of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets (doses ranged from 250 to 1750 mg) in older children and adolescents produced relatively flat plasma valproic acid concentration-time profiles over the entire 24-hour dosing interval, similar to the pharmacokinetic performance of this formulation in adults. The mean (standard deviation) oral clearance values for unbound valproic acid were 94.3 (51.8) and 82.3 (28.2) mL/h/kg and for total valproic acid were 11.2 (3.77) and 9.06 (2.03) mL/h/kg in older children and adolescents, respectively. Two patients discontinued for administrative reasons, whereas one discontinued for an adverse event (flulike syndrome). Adverse events reported by three or more patients were flu syndrome (5 patients, 17.2%) and headache (3 patients, 10.3%). Reported adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and similar to those reported in previous divalproex studies. This study demonstrates that in older children and adolescents, once-daily administration of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets may potentially be used to sustain plasma valproic acid concentrations within the usually accepted therapeutic ranges for various indications.

### Comparative absorption profiles of divalproex sodium delayed-release versus extended-release tablets – clinical implications [^111P3Qfn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The distinct absorption characteristics of the conventional enteric-coated, delayed-release (DR) and the novel extended-release (ER) divalproex sodium formulations are not well recognized.

Objective

To quantitatively and qualitatively differentiate the absorption characteristics of divalproex-DR and -ER formulations.

Methods

Healthy volunteers (N = 28) received single 1000 mg doses of divalproex-DR and divalproex-ER tablets in a crossover fashion. Noncompartmental and compartmental analyses were used to estimate valproic acid (VPA) pharmacokinetics from the plasma concentration-time profiles determined from intensive blood sampling over 48 hours.

Results

VPA was not absorbed from divalproex-DR in the first 2 hours (absorption lag-time) after dosing. After VPA release in the intestine, approximately 63% of the dose was absorbed in less than 1 hour, that is, 2.9 hours (mean absorption time) from dosing. Maximum concentration (C(max)) was achieved approximately 4 hours after dosing. VPA absorption was complete (approximately 93% of dose) within 3 absorption half-lives (approximately 4.5 h) post-absorption lag-time, that is, 6–7 hours from dosing. In contrast, VPA absorption from divalproex-ER starts immediately after administration, initially at a modest rate, followed by slow and extended absorption at a constant rate for more than 20 hours; VPA concentrations at 1 and 2 hours were 28% and 40% of C(max). Approximately 53% of the dose was absorbed within 12 hours (mean absorption time); complete absorption occurred over more than 20 hours without any dose dumping.

Conclusions

VPA absorption from enteric-coated divalproex-DR is rapid following a lag-time of approximately 2 hours and is complete within 6–7 hours of dosing. In contrast, VPA absorption from divalproex-ER starts immediately after administration, but occurs at a slow, approximately constant rate over more than 20 hours.

### Meropenem [^116mKG2F]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Seizure Potential

Seizures and other adverse CNS experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

During clinical investigations, 2904 immunocompetent adult patients were treated for non-CNS infections with the overall seizure rate being 0.7% (based on 20 patients with this adverse event). All meropenem-treated patients with seizures had pre-existing contributing factors. Among these are included prior history of seizures or CNS abnormality and concomitant medications with seizure potential. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or adult patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, placed on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and re-examine the dosage of meropenem to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued.

5.5 Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid

The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of meropenem is necessary, consider supplemental anti-convulsant therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Divalproex sodium [^116KxcNG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

 Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide

Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon coadministration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.

 Clonazepam

The concomitant use of valproate and clonazepam may induce absence status in patients with a history of absence type seizures.

 Diazepam

Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism. Coadministration of valproate (1,500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90% in healthy volunteers (n = 6). Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate. The elimination half-life of diazepam remained unchanged upon addition of valproate.

 Ethosuximide

Valproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide. Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone. Patients receiving valproate and ethosuximide, especially along with other anticonvulsants, should be monitored for alterations in serum concentrations of both drugs.

### Lower effectiveness of divalproex versus valproic acid in a prospective, quasi-experimental clinical trial involving 9, 260 psychiatric admissions [^1146iuzD]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors examined clinical differences between divalproex sodium and generic immediate-release valproic acid.

Method

This 6-year prospective, quasi-experimental clinical trial compared the effectiveness and tolerability of divalproex and valproic acid. The dependent variables were length of hospital stay, rehospitalization rate, and adverse drug reactions in 9,260 psychiatric admissions.

Results

Inpatients who initially received divalproex sodium had a 32.7% longer hospital stay and 3.8% higher readmission rate than did patients who initially received valproic acid. Initial treatment with divalproex prolonged length of stay by 30.3% in patients treated with divalproex and valproic acid during different admissions. After other variables were controlled by multiway analysis of variance, the hospital stay of patients who continued the initial medication was 15.2% longer (2.0 days) for divalproex than valproic acid. Switching medications was more common for valproic acid, partly because of study design. Medication intolerance occurred in approximately 6.4% more patients taking valproic acid than divalproex. However, switching from valproic acid to divalproex did not significantly prolong length of stay, over that for continuous divalproex, or increase the rehospitalization rate.

Conclusions

Lower peak valproate concentrations with divalproex sodium may have enhanced tolerability but may also explain the lower effectiveness. Extended-release divalproex could lower effectiveness further and require higher doses. Thus, inpatients are better served by beginning with generic valproic acid and by changing to delayed-release divalproex only if intolerance occurs. This would save up to one-third of inpatient costs and two-thirds of a billion dollars yearly in medication costs.

### An open trial of divalproex sodium in autism spectrum disorders [^114Yvith]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Autism spectrum disorders are characterized by core deficits in social interaction and speech/communication skills, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. Other abnormalities include seizures, electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities, affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression. Divalproex sodium is indicated as both an anticonvulsant in epilepsy and a mood stabilizer in bipolar illness and thus might be useful for these complicating symptoms in autism.

Method

A retrospective pilot study was conducted to determine whether divalproex sodium was effective in treating core dimensions and associated features of autism. Fourteen patients who met DSM-IV criteria for autism, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, both with and without a history of seizure disorders or EEG abnormalities, were openly treated with divalproex sodium. Improvement was assessed via the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale.

Results

Of 14 patients who completed a trial of divalproex sodium, 10 (71%) were rated as having sustained response to treatment. The mean dose of divalproex sodium was 768 mg/day (range, 125–2500 mg/day), and it was generally well tolerated. Improvement was noted in core symptoms of autism and associated features of affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression.

Conclusion

Divalproex sodium may be beneficial to patients with autism spectrum disorders, particularly those with associated features of affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression as well as those with a history of EEG abnormalities or seizures. Of note, all patients with an abnormal EEG and/or seizure history were rated as responders. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution, given the open retrospective nature of the study. Controlled trials are needed to replicate these preliminary findings.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^113gWzYH]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — anticonvulsants for agitation and behavioral symptoms: Carbamazepine is not recommended for the routine treatment of agitation in patients with dementia, and routine use of valproate to treat behavioral symptoms in dementia is not recommended based on the current evidence; most randomized placebo-controlled trials showed no benefit of valproate compared with placebo and a 2004 Cochrane review concluded that valproate formulations were no more effective than placebo and that side effects were more common. Nonetheless, a therapeutic trial of carbamazepine or valproate may be considered in individual cases, and given the potential toxicity of both agents it is important to identify and monitor target symptoms and to discontinue the medication if no improvement is observed. If used, carbamazepine may be given in two to four doses per day, started at a total dosage of 50–100 mg/day, and increased gradually as warranted by behavioral response and side effects or until blood levels reach 8–12 ng/ml; divalproex sodium may be given in two or three doses per day and should be started at 125–250 mg/day, with gradual increases based on behavioral response and side effects or until blood levels reach 50–60 ng/ml (or, in rare cases, 100 ng/ml). Principal adverse effects of carbamazepine include ataxia, falls, sedation, and confusion, with drug interactions through the cytochrome P450 system and rare bone marrow suppression or hyponatremia; valproate's principal side effects are sedation, gastrointestinal disturbances, and confusion.

US vs non-US patients.

The KM-estimated exit rates for the US subgroup were greater than those for the non-US subgroup (figure 2A). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis confirmed that US patients were significantly more likely to exit the study (p < 0.001; figure 2C). The time to exit for US patients exhibited a dose-response relationship; the rate was lower with ESL 1,600 mg vs 1,200 mg. For US patients taking 2 baseline AEDs, or with secondarily generalized seizures before or during the baseline period, the difference in exit rates between dose groups was particularly marked. For all 4 subgroups (US and non-US patients taking ESL 1,600 and 1,200 mg), the UCLs of the exit rates were lower than the 65.3% historical control threshold.

### Valproate sodium [^117VZMkH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Valproate sodium exists as the valproate ion in the blood. The mechanisms by which valproate exerts its therapeutic effects have not been established. It has been suggested that its activity in epilepsy is related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The relationship between plasma concentration and clinical response is not well documented. One contributing factor is the nonlinear, concentration dependent protein binding of valproate which affects the clearance of the drug. Thus, monitoring of total serum valproate cannot provide a reliable index of the bioactive valproate species.

For example, because the plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent, the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Higher than expected free fractions occur in the elderly, in hyperlipidemic patients, and in patients with hepatic and renal diseases.

Epilepsy

The therapeutic range in epilepsy is commonly considered to be 50 to 100 mcg/mL of total valproate, although some patients may be controlled with lower or higher plasma concentrations.

Equivalent doses of Valproate Sodium Injection and divalproex sodium yield equivalent plasma levels of the valproate ion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

 Data

Human

In a published study, breast milk and maternal blood samples were obtained from 11 epilepsy patients taking valproate at doses ranging from 300 mg/day to 2,400 mg/day on postnatal days 3 to 6. In 4 patients who were taking valproate only, breast milk contained an average valproate concentration of 1.8 mcg/mL (range: 1.1 mcg/mL to 2.2 mcg/mL), which corresponded to 4.8% of the maternal plasma concentration (range: 2.7% to 7.4%). Across all patients (7 of whom were taking other AEDs concomitantly), similar results were obtained for breast milk concentration (1.8 mcg/mL, range: 0.4 mcg/mL to 3.9 mcg/mL) and maternal plasma ratio (5.1%, range: 1.3% to 9.6%).

A published study of 6 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs measured serum valproate levels during maternal treatment for bipolar disorder (750 mg/day or 1,000 mg/day). None of the mothers received valproate during pregnancy, and infants were aged from 4 weeks to 19 weeks at the time of evaluation. Infant serum levels ranged from 0.7 mcg/mL to 1.5 mcg/mL. With maternal serum valproate levels near or within the therapeutic range, infant exposure was 0.9% to 2.3% of maternal levels. Similarly, in 2 published case reports with maternal doses of 500 mg/day or 750 mg/day during breastfeeding of infants aged 3 months and 1 month, infant exposure was 1.5% and 6% that of the mother, respectively.

A prospective observational multicenter study evaluated the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of AED use on children. Pregnant women receiving monotherapy for epilepsy were enrolled with assessments of their children at ages 3 years and 6 years. Mothers continued AED therapy during the breastfeeding period. Adjusted IQs measured at 3 years for breastfed and non-breastfed children were 93 (n = 11) and 90 (n = 24), respectively. At 6 years, the scores for breastfed and non-breastfed children were 106 (n = 11) and 94 (n = 25), respectively (p = 0.04). For other cognitive domains evaluated at 6 years, no adverse cognitive effects of continued exposure to an AED (including valproate) via breast milk were observed.

### Pilot comparison of extended-release and standard preparations of divalproex sodium in patients with bipolar and schizoaffective disorders [^1175Qge5]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors compared the new extended-release and standard preparations of divalproex sodium.

Method

Twelve patients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder who were clinically stable while taking the standard form of divalproex participated in the study. These patients were given a single daily dose of the extended-release preparation of divalproex in an open 6-week trial. Clinical symptoms and adverse effects were rated weekly. Doses were adjusted to maintain steady serum valproate concentrations.

Results

The medication change was associated with negligible changes in clinical status and tolerability. To maintain serum drug levels, however, 21% higher doses of the extended-release preparation were required.

Conclusions

Use of extended-release divalproex once a day was as well tolerated as the standard preparation, with no change in efficacy within 6 weeks, but the daily dose needed to maintain stable serum valproic acid concentration was 21% higher.

### Practice parameter for the psychiatric assessment and management of physically ill children and adolescents [^116m1aqj]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic medication selection and pharmacokinetics in physically ill children and adolescents emphasize that "psychotropic medication levels are not consistent indicators of either efficacy or toxicity in physically ill patients" and "it is generally preferable to choose a medication with a short half-life and attempt to avoid introducing more than one medication at a time". When possible, medications "should be selected that can be administered in a single or divided dose, are easily titrated to an ideal dose, and do not require frequent laboratory monitoring", and "Multiple medications and demanding treatment regimens threaten adherence". It is helpful to follow the maxim "start low, go slow" when initiating medication in children with "hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiac diseases", and to consider routes and side effects; medications can be given by "oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal, transdermal, and sublingual" routes. Most psychoactive drugs are "80% to 95% bound to protein" "with the exception of lithium, methylphenidate, venlafaxine, divalproex sodium, gabapentin, and topiramate"; "The unbound drug is typically pharmacologically active" and reduced "albumin binding… necessitating adjustments to medication dosages". Medications are "absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and excreted through the kidneys", and clinicians should be aware of effects on hepatic metabolism, renal excretion, and discontinuation effects such as "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation syndrome". For interactions, "The hepatic CYP450 system is responsible for most metabolic drug interactions", uridine glucuronosyltransferase enzymes generally play "a minor metabolic role" though lamotrigine, morphine, and lorazepam are primarily metabolized by them, and "P-glycoproteins… function as 'gatekeepers' for CYP3A4 metabolism".

### Valproic acid poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^116E5QRy]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

A review of US poison center data for 2004 showed over 9000 ingestions of valproic acid. A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with a suspected ingestion of valproic acid by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of valproic acid might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of valproic acid ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to the acute ingestion and acute-on-chronic ingestion of immediate-release and extended-release dosage forms of valproic acid, divalproex, and valproate sodium alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This review focuses on the ingestion of more than a single therapeutic dose and the effects of an overdose. Although therapeutic doses of valproic acid can cause adverse effects in adults and children, some idiosyncratic and some dose-dependent, these cases are not considered. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions might be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in whom a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) Patients who are symptomatic (more than somnolence or exhibiting coma or seizures) after a valproic acid ingestion should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 3) Asymptomatic patients with an unintentional acute ingestion of 50 mg/kg or more or asymptomatic patients who are taking the drug therapeutically and who take an additional single acute ingestion of 50 mg/kg or more of any valproic acid formulation should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). 4) Patients with unintentional ingestions of immediate-release valproic acid formulations, who are asymptomatic, and more than 6 hours has elapsed since the time of ingestion, can be observed at home (Grade C). 5) Patients with unintentional ingestions of delayed-release or extended-release formulations of valproic acid who are asymptomatic, and more than 12 hours has elapsed since the time of ingestion, can be observed at home (Grade C). 6) Pregnant women who ingest below the dose for emergency department referral and do not have other referral conditions should be directed to their primary care obstetrical provider for evaluation of potential maternal and fetal risk. Routine referral to an emergency department for immediate care is not required (Grade D). 7) Do not induce emesis (Grade C). 8) Activated charcoal can be administered to asymptomatic patients who have ingested valproic acid within the preceding hour (Grade C). Prehospital activated charcoal administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Poison centers should follow local protocols and experience with its use. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grades D). 9) In patients who have ingested valproic acid and who are comatose, naloxone can be considered for prehospital administration in the doses used for treatment of opioid overdose, particularly if the patient has respiratory depression (Grade C). 10) A benzodiazepine can be administered by EMS personnel if convulsions are present and if authorized by EMS medical direction, expressed by written treatment protocol or policy, or if there is direct medical oversight (Grade C).

### Weight change associated with valproate and lamotrigine monotherapy in patients with epilepsy [^116ykkxM]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence and magnitude of change in body weight associated with lamotrigine or divalproex sodium monotherapy in patients with epilepsy.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind study with 8-week escalation phase and 24-week maintenance phase was conducted. Target maintenance dosage was 200 mg/day (lamotrigine) and 20 mg/kg/day (valproic acid), with adjustment from 100 to 500 mg/day (lamotrigine) and 10 to 60 mg/kg/day (valproate) based on investigators' judgment. Eligible patients were ≥ 12 years old with new-onset or previously diagnosed partial or generalized seizures. Weight change was primary and seizure frequency and tolerance were secondary outcome measures.

Results

For the lamotrigine group, 65 patients (mean age 34.5 years) were investigated; for the valproate group, 68 patients (mean age 30.1 years) were investigated. Weight remained stable in lamotrigine-treated patients. Significant weight gain occurred in valproate-treated patients by the 10th week of treatment; weight continued to increase throughout the study. After 32 weeks of treatment, mean weight gain was significantly higher in valproate-treated (12.8 ± 9.3 lb) than lamotrigine-treated (1.3 ± 11.9 lb) patients. Similar proportions of patients in lamotrigine (29%) and valproate (26%) groups were seizure-free. Overall frequency of adverse events was similar between the two treatment groups. Mean time to withdrawal from the study due to adverse events was 103 ± 70 days for the lamotrigine group and 79 ± 48 days for the valproate group.

Conclusion

Valproate monotherapy was associated with significantly greater weight gain than lamotrigine monotherapy. Weight gain associated with valproate was significant within 10 weeks after initiating therapy and continued throughout the study. Efficacy of lamotrigine was comparable with that of valproate; lamotrigine tended to be better tolerated.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111jeoSb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and weight effects — We recommend considering weight gain potential in choosing an AED for any given patient and using shared decision-making with quantitative estimates of expected weight effects. AEDs associated with weight loss are felbamate, topiramate, and zonisamide; AEDs associated with weight gain are gabapentin, pregabalin, valproic acid, vigabatrin, and carbamazepine; weight-neutral AEDs are lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and phenytoin. Valproic acid studies reported mild-to-moderate weight gain (5 to 10% of baseline weight) in 24% of patients and marked weight gain (> 10% gain of baseline weight) in 47% of patients. In a gabapentin cohort of 44 patients, 57% gained more than 5% of baseline body weight and 10 patients (23%) gained more than 10%. A systematic review suggested weight gain with gabapentin (2.2 kg after 1.5 mo of use) and divalproex (relative risk for weight gain, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.30, 6.02). For carbamazepine, 66.7% had gained an average of 1.5 kg at a 6- to 8-month follow-up visit.

### A randomized trial of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in migraine prophylaxis [^116oGHmD]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended-release divalproex sodium compared with placebo in prophylactic monotherapy treatment of migraine headache.

Methods

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects with more than two migraine headache attacks during a 4-week baseline were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio at each center to receive either extended-release divalproex sodium or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks. Subjects initiated treatment on 500 mg once daily for 1 week, and the dose was then increased to 1,000 mg once daily with an option, if intolerance occurred, to permanently decrease the dose to 500 mg during the second week. Reduction from baseline in 4-week migraine headache rate was the primary efficacy variable. Migraine headaches separated by a < 24-hour headache-free interval were counted as single migraines in calculating migraine headache rates. Tolerance and safety were also evaluated.

Results

The mean reductions in 4-week migraine headache rate were 1.2 (from a baseline mean of 4.4) in the extended-release divalproex sodium group and 0.6 (from a baseline mean of 4.2) in the placebo group (p = 0.006); reductions with extended-release divalproex sodium were significantly greater than with placebo in all three 4-week segments of the treatment period. No significant differences were detected between treatment groups in either the overall incidence or in the incidence of any specific treatment-emergent adverse event; 8% of subjects treated with extended-release divalproex sodium and 9% of those treated with placebo discontinued for adverse events.

Conclusion

Extended-release divalproex sodium is an efficacious, well-tolerated, safe, and easy-to-use once-a-day prophylactic antimigraine medication.

### A pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of switching patients with bipolar I disorder from delayed-release to extended-release divalproex [^114dAgiJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the optimal strategy for converting stable bipolar patients from twice-daily divalproex delayed release (DR) to once-daily divalproex extended release (ER).

Method

This prospective, open-label, crossover study compared 4 divalproex regimens in euthymic outpatients with bipolar I disorder (DSM-IV diagnosis confirmed by Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview). Serum valproic acid levels were collected 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours after the last bedtime dose of the following regimens: DR twice daily (DR b.i.d.) during week 1; total daily DR dose once daily (DR q.h.s.) during week 2; once-daily ER at equal daily DR dose (ER 1:1) during week 3; and once-daily ER with the dose increased by 500 mg (ER + 500) during week 4. Patients continued on ER + 500 for 4 additional weeks after the pharmacokinetic phase. Side effects and psychiatric symptoms were assessed at weeks 1 through 4, 6, and 8. Twenty-one patients were enrolled from July 2002 to July 2004.

Results

Of the regimens tested, DR q.h.s. produced the widest fluctuations in valproic acid levels, with the highest 12-hour (82 mug/mL) and lowest 24-hour (44 mug/mL) levels. The ER + 500 dose was the only regimen that maintained the mean minimum valproic acid concentration above 50 mug/mL. Each regimen was well tolerated, and no significant changes in psychometric indices were observed.

Conclusions

When converting stable bipolar patients from twice-daily divalproex DR to once-daily ER, we recommend increasing the total daily dose by 250 to 500 mg to ensure maintenance of therapeutic valproic acid levels.

### Rapid oral loading of extended release divalproex in patients with acute mania [^115Zc59K]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Oral loading with the delayed release formulation of divalproex sodium is widely used for the treatment of patients with acute mania and produces rapid attainment of therapeutic serum levels. Recently, an extended release formulation of divalproex sodium (divalproex ER) was approved for treatment of migraine headaches. This formulation may be a useful treatment option for patients with acute mania.

Method

A retrospective review of medical records was conducted on 14 inpatients with acute mania whose treatment included initiation of divalproex ER at a dose of 30 mg kg(-1) day(-1) in a single dose. Doses, serum levels and side effects associated with this treatment were recorded from the medical records of these patients.

Results

The average dose of divalproex ER was 2034 mg day(-1) (range, 1500–3000 mg day(-1)). Two of the 14 patients (14%) had documented side effects, none of which were severe. The average level obtained on day 3 after initiation of divalproex ER treatment was 93.2 mug ml(-1) (range, 47–136 mug ml(-1)), and in all but three patients valproate levels at this time point were within the therapeutic range of 50–125 mug ml(-1). In no case was divalproex ER discontinued due to a perceived lack of efficacy.

Conclusion

The results suggest that divalproex ER can be safely administered by oral loading in inpatients with acute mania and that using a standard loading protocol can result in therapeutic serum levels in most patients in 3 days or less.

### Epilepsy benchmarks area III: improved treatment options for controlling seizures and epilepsy-related conditions without side effects [^1157Mw1d]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Taken to its logical albeit futuristic conclusion, one might envision a paradigm shift from ASMs in the form of multiple doses of a drug per day and steady-state blood levels (with attendant side effects) to delivery systems that provide anticonvulsants to the brain at the site they are needed and only when they are needed, improving the quality of life of the patient. Further, each patient's treatment would be customized based on genetic and molecular profiles. This form of precision medicine would eliminate the need for chronic and systemic nonspecific and side effect-laden pharmacotherapy, improving efficacy and possibly reducing the development of pharmacoresistance.

### Valproate (valproic acid or sodium valproate or a combination of the two) for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults [^114knbnR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some antiepileptic drugs but not others are useful in clinical practice for the prophylaxis of migraine. This might be explained by the variety of actions of these drugs in the central nervous system. The present review is part of an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated (conclusions not changed) in 2007.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of valproate (valproic acid or sodium valproate or a combination of the two) for preventing migraine attacks in adult patients with episodic migraine.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (current week, 15 January 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2013) and handsearched Headache and Cephalalgia through January 2013.

Selection Criteria

Studies were required to be prospective, controlled trials of valproate taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks, to improve migraine-related quality of life, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For headache frequency data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) between valproate and comparator (placebo, active control, or valproate in a different dose) for individual studies and pooled these across studies. For dichotomous data on responders (patients with ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency), we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and, in select cases, risk ratios (RRs); we also calculated numbers needed to treat (NNTs). We calculated MDs for Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) scores. We also summarised data on adverse events from placebo-controlled trials and calculated risk differences (RDs) and numbers needed to harm (NNHs).

Main Results

Ten papers describing 10 unique trials met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of data from two trials (63 participants) showed that sodium valproate reduced headache frequency by approximately four headaches per 28 days as compared to placebo (MD -4.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.32 to -0.30). Data from four trials (542 participants) showed that divalproex sodium (a stable combination of sodium valproate and valproic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio) more than doubled the proportion of responders relative to placebo (RR 2.18; 95% CI 1.28 to 3.72; NNT 4; 95% CI 2 to 11). One study of sodium valproate (34 participants) versus placebo supported the latter findings (RR for responders 2.83; 95% CI 1.27 to 6.31; NNT 3; 95% CI 2 to 9). There was no significant difference in the proportion of responders between sodium valproate versus flunarizine (one trial, 41 participants) or between divalproex sodium versus propranolol (one trial, 32 participants). Pooled analysis of post-treatment mean headache frequencies in two trials (88 participants) demonstrates a slight but significant advantage for topiramate 50 mg over valproate 400 mg (MD -0.90; 95% CI -1.58 to -0.22). For placebo-controlled trials of sodium valproate and divalproex sodium, NNHs for clinically important adverse events ranged from 7 to 14.

Authors' Conclusions

Valproate is effective in reducing headache frequency and is reasonably well tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine.

8.1 Medical evaluation and laboratory investigations

A complete medical history including assessment of BMI and baseline laboratory investigations (Table 23) should be performed prior to initiating pharmacological treatment for BD or, in the case of an acute clinical situation, as soon as the patient is cooperative. For more detail, readers are referred to comprehensive guidelines for safety monitoring in BD. 652 In women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be ruled out, and they should be counselled about the possibility of lamotrigine and carbamazepine affecting the efficacy of oral contraceptives before initiating pharmacotherapy.

Table 23
Baseline laboratory investigations in patients with bipolar disorder

For those on maintenance therapy with lithium, thyroid and renal function as well as plasma calcium 799 should be assessed at 6 months and at least annually thereafter or as clinically indicated. Menstrual history (to assess for polycystic ovary syndrome), haematology profile, and liver function tests should be obtained at 3‐6 month intervals during the first year, and yearly thereafter and as clinically indicated, in patients on maintenance treatment with divalproex. Patients initiated on lamotrigine or carbamazepine should be routinely educated about the risks of skin rashes and the potential for Stevens‐Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). They should be advised to contact the treating physician if they observe any type of skin rashes or mucosal ulcers as they require urgent medical evaluation to determine the nature of rashes/ulcers and implementation of most appropriate treatment options which might include discontinuation of these medications and instituting other therapeutic strategies to treat serious rashes and prevent destabilization of BD. Further, prior to commencing carbamazepine, patients with ancestry in genetically at‐risk populations such as Han Chinese and other Asian patients should have genotyping performed to ensure that they do not have the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)‐B✱1502 allele, which confers a high risk for SJS/TEN with carbamazepine. 800 In addition, those on carbamazepine therapy should have serum sodium levels measured at least annually and as clinically indicated given the risk of hyponatraemia with this compound. Patients on atypical antipsychotics should have their weight monitored monthly in the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. Blood pressure, fasting glucose and lipid profile should be assessed at 3 and 6 months, and yearly thereafter. Children under 10 years of age, seniors, medically ill patients, and patients on combination treatments should receive more frequent monitoring. Re‐emergence of clinical symptoms, as well as signs of haematological, hepatic, cardiovascular, and neurological dysfunction, should also signal the need for additional investigations.

### Valproate sodium [^116f1p8P]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Conversion to Monotherapy

Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Valproate Sodium Injection therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

Adjunctive Therapy

Valproate Sodium Injection may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Linear relationship of valproate serum concentration to response and optimal serum levels for acute mania [^113s6TeB]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Several studies have shown that achieving adequate serum valproate levels is critical to rapid stabilization of acute mania, but estimates of the target therapeutic level have been imprecise. A post hoc analysis of pooled intent-to-treat data from three randomized, placebo-controlled studies of divalproex treatment for acute mania was performed to test a hypothesized linear relationship between serum concentration and response and to determine optimal blood levels for treatment of acute mania.

Method

Subjects (N = 374) were stratified into seven groups (six valproate serum level ranges and placebo), and effect size was determined for each. Linearity of dose response was tested with both parametric and nonparametric techniques. ANOVA was used to compare the response at each serum level range with that of placebo as well as the lowest valproate level (≤ 55.0 microg/ml). The mean serum valproate level was then determined for all subjects with an effect size greater than or equal to the maximal effect derived from linear modeling.

Results

The fit of blood level and response to a linear model was good. Efficacy was significantly greater than placebo beginning at the 71.4–85.0 microg/ml range and for all higher valproate levels; the 94.1–107.0 and > 107.0 microg/ml groups were superior to the lowest valproate serum level group. The effect size associated with highest serum levels (> 94 microg/ml) was 1.06 (0.59 after placebo correction). Subjects obtaining this effect or greater (N = 84) had a mean serum level of 87.5 microg/ml. Blood levels in the lowest effective range were 60% more effective than placebo and in the higher ranges were 120% more effective. Tolerability appeared similar for all groups.

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that there is a linear relationship between valproate serum concentration and response and that the target blood level of valproate for best response in acute mania is above 94 microg/ml.

Fluoxetine is typically administered in oral capsules or liquid form, with initial doses ranging from 10 to 20 mg daily, and the dose can be gradually increased depending on the patient's response and tolerance (Sohel et al.). Other SSRIs, such as sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro), have also been used off‐label for IED (Edinoff et al; Sanchez, Reines, and Montgomery). These drugs share similar mechanisms of action as fluoxetine, but they differ in terms of adverse effect profiles and individual response rates. For instance, while all SSRIs enhance serotonergic transmission, the incidence of side effects such as nausea, insomnia or sexual dysfunction may vary across medications, and treatment decisions are often tailored to patient‐specific needs (Chu and Wadhwa).

In addition to SSRIs, mood stabilizers are another prominent class of drugs used in managing IED, particularly when impulsive aggression is severe or coexists with mood dysregulation (Gould, Chen, and Manji). Lithium, valproate (Depakote) and carbamazepine (Tegretol) are the most commonly used mood stabilizers in this context (Coccaro and McCloskey). Lithium, in particular, has been widely studied and is known to modulate neurotransmitter activity, specifically balancing dopamine and serotonin, which helps regulate mood swings and reduce aggression (Malhi et al.). However, lithium's use requires close monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic window and significant side effects, such as hand tremors, polyuria (Gitlin; Malhi et al.) and potential long‐term effects on the kidneys and thyroid (Boivin et al.). Regular blood tests are necessary to prevent toxicity, which could result in neurological complications (Gitlin).

### Drug dosing recommendations for all patients: a roadmap for change [^1128X56M]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: Clinical specialist (e.g. cardiology, neurology, and clinical pharmacology‐pharmacy) societies should create a high priority drug‐disease target list where more precise dosing is likely to result in improved patient outcome. High priority criteria should be created by physicians and pharmacists who use the drugs to treat patients. General criteria to consider are drug‐disease targets dosing risks include death and/or significant morbidity from underdosing or overdosing and also where patient characteristics are known to significantly influence drug PKs and/or PDs. It is important to create/maintain a drug‐disease model public library, including computer code and prospective qualification testing. 31

3 Pediatric efficacy‐safety drug dosing experience. The pediatric special population drug development experience over the past 20 years is also informative for other patient special groups (e.g. very old and pregnancy) and for prediction purposes. US legislation empowers the FDA to both require drug companies to perform pediatric studies leading to pediatric labeling and providesa company 6‐month additional patent exclusivity for completing specifically requested work. The clinical and scientific benefits from this program include providing a systemic mechanism for conducting pediatric research on new drugs, establishing an efficacy, safety, and PK basis for use and dosing for children (from premature infants through adolescents), as well as stimulating research on how best to conduct such studies. A major success was establishing a disease similarity link (i.e. extrapolation) between children and adults with partial onset seizures. This enables a less expensive and more successful PK bridging study to be used for approval. Other successes include the development of a regulatory approval pathway to extrapolate data from animal studies to children when clinical studies are not feasible, and providing useful pediatric labeling information for many drugs useful in seizures, diabetes, and HIV. 1, 2, 31 There have also been significant limitations to this approach, including the fact that it takes 7 or more years after a drug was initially approved for the label to reflect pediatric dosing and use, and the rate of requested study completion has been low (28.8% for efficacy studies and 55.9% for PK studies). Therefore, pediatric labeling changes for some priority indications may not occur. Based on data from completed studies, there is now a reasonably good ability to predict pediatric PKs for major clearance pathways. 26 Pharmaceutical companies have an estimated 680% median return on investment for doing requested pediatric studies as a result of gaining 6 months of additional patent exclusivity. 32 Based on this pediatric experience, some have suggested that we should replicate this regulatory model for the patient groups, such as those who are very old, pregnant, or patients at the extremes of body size. 33, 34 If PK predictions can be applied assuming the exposure target is similar, dosing recommendations could be provided in the initial label when the drug is first approved. However, for these "special" patient populations, as well as in pediatrics, instead of requiring discrete prospective studies to detect differences in drug efficacy and safety, perhaps it would be feasible (or preferable) to focus on RWD from EHR and claims data. Funding clinical sites to collect enriched clinical RWD for regulatory efficacy, safety, and dosing questions might generate data from larger, more diverse patient groups than prospective clinical studies (e.g. Sentinel Network).

### Teratogenesis, perinatal, and neurodevelopmental outcomes after in utero exposure to antiseizure medication: practice guideline from the AAN, AES, and SMFM [^112kgXuY]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

AAN/AES/SMFM antiseizure medication in pregnancy — Recommendation 1 statements and context: 1(A) Clinicians should engage in joint decision-making with PWCEP, taking individual preferences into account when selecting ASMs and monitoring their dosing (Level B); 1(B) when treating PWCEP, clinicians should recommend ASMs and doses that optimize both seizure control and fetal outcomes should pregnancy occur, at the earliest possible opportunity preconceptionally (Level B); this is underscored by risks associated with discontinuing or changing ASMs, that more than 65% of pregnancies among PWCEP are unintended, and that the ASM regimen in unplanned pregnancy is often the regimen at conception.

### Valproic acid for agitation in dementia [^112ivDTi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Agitation affects up to 70% of older people with dementia. Valproic acid has been used for the past 10 years to control agitation in dementia, but no systematic review of the effectiveness of this drug has been published to date. The current study examines three randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the effect of valproic acid on older people with dementia who were agitated.

Objectives

To determine whether evidence supports the use of valproic acid in the treatment of agitation of people with dementia.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 10 July 2003 using the terms ("agitat" or "distur" or "behavi" or "aggress") and "valproic" or "valproate" or "divalpro". This Register contains articles from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases and is regularly updated. The reviewers contacted the authors of publications and drug companies manufacturing valproic acid for additional information.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials with concealed allocation where agitation and dementia of participants were assessed

Data Collection and Analysis

1. Two reviewers extracted data from published trials. 2. Odds ratios of average differences were calculated. 3. Only "intention to treat" analyses were included. 4. Analysis compared participants treated with valproic acid with controls.

Main Results

Meta-analysis of the pooled results of the included trials could not be performed because of the following problems. In Porsteinsson 2001, although the physicians having direct responsibility for patient care were blinded, a non-blinded physician, who had no direct contact with these physicians, adjusted divalproex sodium dosage on the basis of reports from blinded raters. Therefore, because the physician who controlled therapy knew which patients were receiving divalproex, the trial did not satisfy the criterion of concealed allocation. In Tariot 2001, 54% of the treated patients dropped out compared with 29% of control patients. Of all treated patients, 22% dropped out because of adverse effects, and the study had to be discontinued prematurely. The third trial (Sival 2002) had a cross-over design. No results from the first phase of the study were available, and although the statistical section stated, "the t-test for independent samples is used to analyze the two-period cross-over trial", because the samples were not independent - they are the same patients in the treatment and placebo groups - a question must be raised about the correctness of the analyses. The type of valproate used in the trials varied - one used short-acting sodium valproate, one long-acting divalproex sodium, and the third early-onset acting divalproex sodium. Average doses differed (480mg/d - 1000mg/d), as did duration of therapy (3 wks - 6 wks), and ways of evaluating patients and their response to therapy. A limited meta-analysis, pooling the results concerning adverse effects (Porsteinsson 2001, Tariot 2001) revealed the following: Sedation occurred more frequently in patients treated with valproic acid than in controls Urinary tract infection was more common among patients treated with valproic acid than controls Because of differences in identifying adverse effects it was not possible to pool other observations concerning adverse effects between the two studies that were examined.

Reviewers' Conclusions

The trials reviewed should be regarded as preliminary. Individual reports suggest that low dose sodium valproate is ineffective in treating agitation among demented patients, and that high dose divalproex sodium is associated with an unacceptable rate of adverse effects. More research on the use of valproate preparations for agitation of people with dementia is needed. On the basis of current evidence, valproate preparations cannot be recommended for the treatment of agitation in dementia.

### Methylphenidate and continuous spike and wave during sleep in a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^116KgEWE]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is the most common neurobehavioral disorder in children and frequently associated with epilepsy. For patients with both conditions, methylphenidate remains a mainstay in the treatment of behavioral problems. Most studies demonstrate that methylphenidate is effective in treating children with well-controlled epilepsy, and that methylphenidate does not increase the risk of having seizures in patients with EEG abnormalities without epilepsy. However, in patients with active seizures, the results are somewhat contradictory. This article presents the case of a young girl with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and behavioral problems on Depakote (valproic acid) who had an abnormal EEG with left centroparietal spikes but no history of electrographic seizures. She experienced a convulsion the day after her first dose of methylphenidate, and repeat EEG demonstrated continuous spike and slow wave during sleep. This case report suggests that children with continuous spike and slow wave during sleep may have a higher risk of developing seizures with methylphenidate treatment.

### Gabapentin dosing in the treatment of epilepsy [^112RcHUo]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is considered a safe and well-tolerated antipileptic drug (AED) with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and a broad therapeutic index. However, recent studies have used higher doses and faster titration schedules than those used in the pivotal trials that established the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of partial seizures.

Objective

The purposes of this review were to assess the gabapentin titration and dosing regimens that have been published in peer-reviewed journals, to develop dosing recommendations to maximize antiseizure efficacy without compromising tolerability, and to formulate guidelines for an adequate therapeutic assessment of gabapentin dosage efficacy.

Methods

In the absence of sufficient placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, a formal evidence-based assessment could not be performed. However, a MEDLINE search using the search terms gabapentin and epilepsy, spanning back to the year 1986, produced numerous published reports from randomized, placebo-controlled and open-label trials, as well as case reports. These were reviewed to assess the range of dosing and titration schedules reported. Reports that employed gabapentin doses and titration schedules were selected for review.

Results

Our review of this literature suggests improved seizure control at higher gabapentin maintenance dosages (≤ 3600 mg/d) than are used today in clinical practice (1800 mg/d) without an increase in the incidence of adverse reactions. Most of the patients who received high dosages (eg, 3600 mg/d) or experienced fast titration rates tolerated gabapentin well. Side effects occurred around the onset of dosing and were reported in some studies to be transient.

Conclusions

Based in the literature here, in most adult patients, gabapentin may be initiated at a dosage of 900 mg/d and titrated to maintenance dosages ≥ 3600 mg/d. Children may be treated with gabapentin 23 to 78 mg/kg per day. Based on controlled and open trials, the majority of patients will tolerate gabapentin well enough for an adequate therapeutic assessment. Titration to effect can be accomplished rapidly, if necessary; however, as with other AEDs, optimal seizure control may take months to achieve.

### Dose-ranging effect of adjunctive oral cannabidiol vs placebo on convulsive seizure frequency in dravet syndrome: a randomized clinical trial [^111Eiscb]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Dravet syndrome is a rare treatment-resistant developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, caused by pathogenic variants in SCN1A (OMIM), the gene encoding the sodium channel α subunit 1 in approximately 80% of diagnosed patients. An estimated 1 in 15 500 children have SCN1A -related Dravet syndrome. Onset generally occurs by 15 months of age in infants with normal development, and typically begins with febrile hemiclonic or generalized status epilepticus often triggered by fever. Multiple seizure types evolve, including hemiclonic, tonic-clonic, focal impaired awareness, absence, myoclonic, and rarely atonic seizures. Development is normal in the first year of life but then slows, leading to intellectual disability of variable severity. Patients with Dravet syndrome have a high mortality risk due to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and status epilepticus. Worse seizure control is associated with more comorbidities and lower quality of life. Despite treatment with multiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), patients with Dravet syndrome often remain treatment resistant.

Highly purified cannabidiol (approved as Epidiolex in the United States and Epidyolex in the European Union) was the first medicine to receive approval in the United States for treating seizures in Dravet syndrome. Valproate sodium and clobazam are commonly used to manage seizures; however, neither is approved for Dravet syndrome. Stiripentol is approved in Europe for patients with Dravet syndrome taking clobazam and valproate and has recently been approved in the United States for patients with Dravet syndrome taking clobazam.

In previous randomized clinical trials, cannabidiol demonstrated efficacy with an acceptable safety profile as add-on antiepileptic treatment in patients with Dravet syndrome at a dose of 20 mg/kg/dand in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg/d. Although doses as high as 20 mg/kg/d are approved for Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, the US prescribing information indicates 10 mg/kg/d as the recommended maintenance dose, although data on this dose were unavailable for Dravet syndrome. This trial is, to our knowledge, the first to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of cannabidiol (10 and 20 mg/kg/d) in children with Dravet syndrome.

### Valproate-associated hyperammonemic encephalopathy [^11138EBV]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The use of valproic acid (VPA) (also known as Depakote, Depakene, and others) frequently results in elevated plasma ammonia. In some people, hyperammonemia may be clinically significant, resulting in hyperammonemic encephalopathy, which may be severe. Valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy may occur in people with normal liver function, despite normal doses and serum levels of VPA. We describe 2 cases of valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy in patients with supratherapeutic VPA levels, although the condition has been described in people with normal VPA levels. With the increasing indications and off-label uses of VPA, family physicians should be aware of this potential complication of VPA and check ammonia levels in patients taking VPA who present with alterations in mental status. Treatment with L-carnitine may be beneficial in reducing ammonia levels.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures: approved by the ACEP board of directors, April 17, 2024 [^1134Njz6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Known seizure disorder — route of antiepileptic medication resumption in the emergency department (ED) is addressed with Level C guidance. Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: None specified. Level C recommendations: When resuming antiepileptic medication in the ED is deemed appropriate, the emergency physician may administer intravenous (IV) or oral medication at their discretion. The emergency physician is often faced with determining how best to resume antiepileptic medications in patients with known seizure disorders, and strategies often become an issue under one of 2 circumstances: the patient could in theory benefit from rapid administration of prescribed medication (loading) to improve the likelihood of a safe, seizure-free discharge, or the patient has a contraindication to oral administration medications; patients who might potentially benefit from loading include those noted to have a subtherapeutic serum level of medication or to be noncompliant with a medication when a serum level cannot be readily assessed. The literature reviewed for this clinical question is limited because the only studies found did not use early seizure recurrence as a primary outcome measure, and most studies investigated loading dose strategies with attainment of drug levels, using serum levels as a surrogate outcome measure for efficacy.

### Strategy for utilization of new antiepileptic drugs [^112FtGcN]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The paper reviews strategies to incorporate new antiepileptic drugs into the treatment arsenal for patients with epilepsy.

Recent Findings

Ten new antiepileptic drugs have been developed in the last two decades, making selection of optimal therapy complex; they have not been shown to have better efficacy but generally seem to be better tolerated. Newer antiepileptic drugs offer new opportunities to patients who have not had a favorable response to the old ones. Many new antiepileptic drugs exhibit a broad spectrum of activity while only one of the older ones (valproate) has a broad-spectrum profile. There are therefore more choices when trying to match treatment with epileptic seizures and syndromes. The side-effect profiles of the newer antiepileptic drugs differ from the older ones with fewer systemic reactions and better pharmacokinetics for the most part.

Summary

Comparative studies are needed to elucidate the specific weaknesses and strengths of each of the new antiepileptic drugs compared with the older ones. Most clinical trials do not help the physician in deciding drug, dose, or titration schedules. Thus the physician needs to understand efficacy spectrum and side-effect profiles of each new antiepileptic drug in order to be able to treat each patient optimally.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^115SDtkX]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)/sodium channel blocker overdose — prehospital care emphasizes airway support, sodium bicarbonate for conduction toxicity, hemodynamic support, agitation management, and seizure management: "Consider early airway management"; "If widened QRS (100 msec or greater), consider sodium bicarbonate 1–2 mEq/kg IV, this can be repeated as needed to narrow QRS and improve blood pressure"; for hypotension, "Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg)" and "Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation (1–2 liters of crystalloid) for the hypotensive patient [See Shock Guideline]"; for agitation, "For agitation, consider midazolam" with adult dosing "Adult: midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 5 mg" and "Reduce by 50% for patients 69 years or older", and pediatric dosing "Pediatric: midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 4 mg or midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IN to maximum single dose of 10 mg"; seizures: "For seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline".

### Limitations of monotherapy trials in epilepsy [^115hikTj]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Monotherapy is considered optimal management for most patients with epilepsy, but designing monotherapy trials in epilepsy has proved to be a complex endeavor. Consideration of the validity of evidence for efficacy, potential risks to patients, clinical applicability of results, and effects of dosing and titration rates on efficacy and tolerability creates unique challenges. This article reviews pertinent aspects of trials of conversion to monotherapy in refractory patients and equivalence trials in newly diagnosed patients to better understand their limitations. Despite the inherent difficulties in designing monotherapy trials in epilepsy, previous monotherapy studies have provided important information for clinical management with new treatments.
