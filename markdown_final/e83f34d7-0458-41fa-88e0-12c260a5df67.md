## Question

Pt coming in and says: feels a mass and has pain in the upper part of the stomach by 3 weeks. Things to ask in patient encounter and alarm signs.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what questions to ask during the patient encounter and which alarm signs to look for in a patient reporting "feeling a mass" with epigastric pain for 3 weeks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the "mass" is truly palpable on exam or a subjective sensation. Then, I should characterize the epigastric pain and screen for alarm features. Next, I will review systemic risk factors, perform a focused physical exam, and define thresholds for urgent endoscopy and cross‑sectional imaging. After that, I need to reconcile differences between BSG and ACG/CAG guidance and acknowledge the limits of alarm features. Finally, I will outline an initial diagnostic pathway and safety‑netting while keeping a high index of suspicion for neoplastic and subepithelial lesions when a mass is present.

> Let me first confirm the nature of the "mass". Wait, let me verify whether this is a true, reproducible epigastric lump on examination versus a subjective intra‑abdominal fullness sensation, because functional dyspepsia by definition should not generate a palpable mass and, if a discrete mass is present, organic pathology such as gastric cancer, GIST, or a pancreatic process becomes much more likely and mandates expedited work‑up [^116xfwW3] [^115iGuYn] [^114uoLGH].

> I need to check the time course and whether duration alone dictates the pathway. I initially thought that symptoms beyond about 4 weeks push us out of a "self‑limited" bucket, but hold on, I should verify Rome and guideline thresholds; Rome IV‑based clinical criteria for functional dyspepsia require bothersome symptoms for more than 8 weeks, so at 3 weeks this patient does not meet FD duration criteria, and the presence of a suspected mass already steers away from FD regardless of duration, which means I should not delay objective evaluation if other red flags or a true mass are present [^116xfwW3] [^113aLotS].

> Next, I will characterize the epigastric pain carefully: onset (sudden vs gradual), pattern (constant vs intermittent), quality (burning or gnawing vs sharp), severity, radiation (especially to the back for pancreatobiliary causes), temporal relation to meals, nocturnal awakening, and response to antacids or PPIs, while documenting NSAID, aspirin, alcohol, and caffeine exposures that raise ulcer risk; I need to ensure I do not prematurely close on "ulcer" if there is a mass or progressive course, which would raise concern for infiltrative or obstructive lesions rather than functional disease [^111kDKdj] [^116xfwW3].

> I should screen systematically for associated upper GI symptoms with high alarm value: dysphagia or odynophagia, persistent vomiting (especially with blood), early satiety or postprandial fullness that is new or progressive, hematemesis or melena, and reflux symptoms that might coexist; dysphagia and weight loss notably increase the probability of malignancy in referral cohorts, so if present I should escalate without delay [^112hFMyA] [^1121zB2v].

> Hold on, I should verify systemic red flags and risk factors that lower the threshold for urgent investigation: unintentional weight loss, iron‑deficiency anemia symptoms, fevers or night sweats, exact age, family history of gastric or esophageal cancer, origin from high‑risk regions, and medications including antithrombotics or anticoagulants that could also produce intramural hematoma masquerading as a mass; per BSG, age 55 or older with dyspepsia and weight loss warrants a 2‑week‑wait endoscopy, and individuals older than 40 from high‑risk regions or with a family history also merit urgent endoscopy, whereas ACG/CAG advises against using alarm features alone to fast‑track endoscopy in patients under 60 because of low discriminative value in low‑risk settings, a nuance I need to reconcile with clinical context and pre‑test probability [^1121zB2v] [^114bqFEh] [^114dcSe4].

> On physical examination, I will now examine for a discrete, localized, epigastric mass and describe its location, size, consistency, mobility, and tenderness; I should also check for pallor and tachycardia suggesting anemia, look for Virchow's node or other lymphadenopathy, and assess for distension, guarding, or rebound that would shift urgency toward acute surgical or perforated pathology; a hard, irregular, non‑tender mass is worrisome for malignancy and would push me to cross‑sectional imaging promptly before endoscopic tissue diagnosis [^111kDKdj] [^114uoLGH].

> If any alarm sign is present — especially a true palpable mass, dysphagia, GI bleeding, persistent vomiting, or weight loss in an older adult — I should confirm the need for urgent endoscopy; but wait, with a palpable or suspected mass I should first obtain a contrast‑enhanced CT abdomen/pelvis to define anatomy, assess resectability, and identify extraluminal disease, followed by EGD with biopsy or endoscopic ultrasound for subepithelial lesions as guided by ACG subepithelial lesion recommendations [^114uoLGH] [^113NoZTN] [^115iGuYn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the predictive power of alarm features alone; I should double‑check the evidence base showing that alarm features have limited sensitivity and variable specificity, and that relying solely on them risks missing early, potentially curable esophagogastric cancers, meaning a low threshold for endoscopy is prudent when clinical gestalt is concerning or a mass is suspected despite the absence of multiple classic alarms [^113nyxyz] [^112VHsUY] [^111W7Fzp].

> Let me think about the key differentials if a true mass is confirmed or strongly suspected: gastric adenocarcinoma including linitis plastica, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, subepithelial lesions such as leiomyoma or lipoma, pancreatic head or body lesions abutting the stomach, and rarer mimics like intramural hematoma in anticoagulated patients or even parasite‑related granulomatous disease; this breadth reinforces why CT first can be decisive, followed by endoscopic staging and directed biopsy or EUS for subepithelial processes [^115iGuYn] [^1163oQt6] [^114dcSe4] [^114GgtTH].

> I should confirm the imaging sequence that balances diagnostic yield and radiation: for undifferentiated or nonlocalized significant abdominal pain with a suspected mass, CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is typically first‑line given accuracy and ability to rapidly alter management, while ultrasound can be a low‑risk adjunct in selected scenarios but risks false reassurance if used alone; conditional strategies using CT after non‑diagnostic ultrasound improve sensitivity and reduce missed urgent conditions, a trade‑off I need to discuss with the patient based on risk and pretest probability [^114uoLGH] [^113NoZTN] [^112EpQGz].

> Now, let me reconcile guideline pathways for dyspepsia when a mass is not confirmed on exam. If the patient is younger than 60 with dyspepsia and no convincing alarms or mass, ACG/CAG supports noninvasive H. pylori test‑and‑treat and a PPI trial rather than immediate endoscopy, but I need to ensure close follow‑up and rapid escalation if symptoms progress or any alarm features emerge; conversely, under BSG/NICE, age 55 or older with weight loss or individuals over 40 with high‑risk background or family history should be offered urgent endoscopy, which I should not delay when clinical suspicion is high despite the mixed performance of alarm features [^114bqFEh] [^1121zB2v] [^112kWzpK].

> Finally, I should double‑check safety‑netting and documentation: if the patient's "mass" is subjective and the exam is negative, I must re‑examine, verify vitals and labs including CBC and iron studies, and provide explicit return precautions for bleeding, vomiting, dysphagia, or weight loss, because missing an evolving neoplastic process is costlier than early endoscopy in atypical cases; acknowledging the limited diagnostic value of symptoms alone in distinguishing functional from organic disease helps prevent premature closure and supports a lower threshold for investigation when the story is atypical or progressive [^116xfwW3] [^113nyxyz] [^116PHHVY].

For a patient with a palpable upper abdominal mass and three weeks of pain, obtain a focused history of **pain characteristics** (onset, location, radiation, severity, quality, timing, triggers, relieving factors); associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, early satiety, weight loss, anorexia, dysphagia, jaundice, fever, night sweats, GI bleeding); and systemic symptoms (fatigue, malaise) [^114bfdyR] [^113aLotS]. Review past medical and surgical history; medications (especially NSAIDs, anticoagulants, steroids); family history of GI malignancy; and social history (alcohol, tobacco, occupational exposures). On exam, evaluate for **vital instability** (tachycardia, hypotension, fever), peritonitis, a palpable mass, organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, jaundice, or ascites [^111kDKdj]. Alarm signs — including unintentional weight loss, persistent vomiting, GI bleeding, anemia, jaundice, early satiety, dysphagia, night sweats, fever, or a rapidly enlarging mass — warrant **urgent evaluation and imaging** [^113NoZTN] [^1121zB2v] [^112hFMyA].

## Key history questions

### Pain characteristics

- **Onset**: Sudden or gradual; exact timing.
- **Location**: Precise site; radiation (back, shoulder, chest).
- **Severity**: Numeric scale (0–10); impact on daily activities.
- **Quality**: Sharp, dull, cramping, burning, pressure-like.
- **Timing**: Constant or intermittent; relation to meals, position, activity.
- **Triggers/relievers**: Food, position, medications, activity [^1149qknL].

---

### Associated gastrointestinal symptoms

- **Nausea/vomiting**: Frequency, severity, presence of blood (hematemesis).
- **Early satiety**: Feeling full after small meals [^116xfwW3].
- **Weight loss**: Unintentional; amount and duration.
- **Anorexia**: Loss of appetite.
- **Dysphagia**: Difficulty swallowing solids or liquids [^112hFMyA].
- **Jaundice**: Yellowing of skin or eyes [^111kDKdj].
- **Bowel changes**: Diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia.

---

### Systemic symptoms

Assess for **fever** or **chills** (with duration), **night sweats** (frequency and severity), and **fatigue** or **malaise** (generalized weakness or tiredness) [^1131ooS8].

---

### Past medical and surgical history

Review gastrointestinal history for **peptic ulcer disease**, gastritis, **pancreatitis**, hepatitis, gallstones, inflammatory bowel disease, and prior **GI malignancy**. Obtain a surgical history, including prior abdominal operations (e.g. bariatric procedures, cholecystectomy, appendectomy). Document medications — especially **NSAIDs**, anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants — and elicit **family history** of gastrointestinal malignancy and hereditary cancer syndromes (e.g. Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis) [^114HA7ey].

---

### Social history

Assess **alcohol use** (quantity, frequency, duration); document **tobacco use** (smoking history, pack-years); and ask about **occupational exposures** to chemicals, asbestos, or radiation [^1149qknL].

---

## Physical examination

### General appearance and vital signs

Note the patient's **general appearance** (ill-appearing, cachexia, distress) and **vital signs** (fever, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension) [^111kDKdj].

---

### Abdominal examination

On abdominal examination, **inspect** for distension, visible masses, surgical scars, and jaundice. Palpate to define **mass characteristics** (size, consistency, mobility, tenderness, pulsatility) and check for organomegaly, ascites, and peritoneal signs such as guarding or rebound tenderness. Percuss for areas of dullness suggesting mass or **ascites**. Auscultate **bowel sounds**, noting whether they are hyperactive, hypoactive, or absent [^114bfdyR].

---

### Other systems

Examine for **lymphadenopathy** (supraclavicular [Virchow's node], axillary, inguinal). Perform a **cardiopulmonary assessment** for signs of metastasis or systemic disease, and inspect the skin for **jaundice**, spider angiomas, and palmar erythema [^112hFMyA].

---

## Alarm signs and symptoms ("red flags")

Alarm signs indicate serious pathology and require urgent evaluation [^113nyxyz] [^1121zB2v]:

| **Alarm sign** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Unintentional weight loss | - Malignancy <br/> - Chronic infection <br/> - Systemic disease |
| Persistent vomiting | - Gastric outlet obstruction <br/> - Malignancy <br/> - Severe gastritis |
| Gastrointestinal bleeding (hematemesis, melena, hematochezia) | - Peptic ulcer disease <br/> - Malignancy <br/> - Varices |
| Anemia (iron deficiency) | - Chronic blood loss <br/> - Malignancy |
| Jaundice | - Hepatobiliary disease <br/> - Pancreatic malignancy |
| Early satiety | - Gastric malignancy <br/> - Large gastric mass |
| Dysphagia | Esophageal or gastric malignancy |
| Night sweats, fever | - Night sweats <br/> - Fever |
| Rapidly enlarging mass | - Malignancy <br/> - Abscess <br/> - Aneurysm |
| Severe pain with peritoneal signs | - Perforation <br/> - Peritonitis <br/> - Acute pancreatitis |

---

## Initial diagnostic evaluation

Based on history, exam, and alarm features, **initiate**:

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CMP, LFTs, lipase, amylase, ESR/CRP, coagulation profile, H. pylori testing, tumor markers (CEA, CA 19–9) if malignancy suspected [^114bfdyR].
- **Imaging studies**: Abdominal ultrasound (initial), CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast (definitive), MRI if CT contraindicated, endoscopy (EGD) if upper GI pathology suspected [^117PDmzo] [^114uoLGH].
- **Specialized tests**: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for submucosal lesions, biopsy of suspicious lesions [^115iGuYn].

---

## Indications for urgent referral or hospitalization

Urgent referral or hospitalization is warranted for **hemodynamic instability** (hypotension, tachycardia, shock) or severe pain with peritoneal signs (guarding or rebound tenderness). Other triggers include active **gastrointestinal bleeding** (hematemesis, melena, hematochezia), **obstructive symptoms** with persistent vomiting or inability to tolerate oral intake, a **rapidly enlarging mass** suggesting malignancy or abscess, and **severe anemia** (hemoglobin < 7 g/dL or symptomatic anemia).

---

A patient with a palpable upper abdominal mass and three weeks of pain requires a focused history and exam to identify **alarm features**. These findings should prompt **urgent evaluation and management** — including labs, imaging, and possible endoscopy — to expedite diagnosis and treatment [^113NoZTN].

Regarding screening and diagnosis for gastric cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for testing, the BSG 2022 guidelines recommend performing urgent endoscopy in the following patients if no other upper gastrointestinal alarm symptoms or signs are reported:

- **Age ≥ 55 years**: Dyspepsia and weight loss.
- **Age > 40 years**: Coming from an area at an increased risk of gastric cancer or having a family history of gastroesophageal cancer.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^114bfdyR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

As with FGIDs in general, a comprehensive patient assessment is needed to rule out red flags and characterize FACP. We recommend that the assessment includes an evaluation of family history (especially for malignancy, gastrointestinal diseases, and other conditions that could affect management), recent medication, characteristics of pain (nature, location, duration, quality, frequency, and severity), and eating/bowel habits (including known food allergies, intolerances, and triggers).

In selected patients and at the discretion of the doctor, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination) and limited laboratory tests may be appropriate. Psychosocial assessment may also be helpful, particularly if the patient has preexisting psychiatric comorbidities or there are indicators of significant psychological stress. The physical examination should assess the pain location and whether there is a palpable mass, abnormal or absent bowel sounds, rebound tenderness, rigidity/resistance, distension, and/or guarding.

Experience in IBS shows that relevant laboratory tests might include complete blood cell counts and other targeted blood tests (e.g. erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and/or celiac serology), thyroid and liver function tests, and stool studies (e.g. fecal calprotectin and/or occult blood test), as indicated. Abdominal ultrasound investigations can sometimes be helpful; they are cheap and simple to undertake in most settings. There are also certain other signs and symptoms that may require additional investigation.

### Predictive value of alarm features in a rapid access upper gastrointestinal cancer service [^112hFMyA]. Gut (2005). Low credibility.

Aims - **To determine the value**: Of individual alarm features for predicting cancer in subjects referred to a rapid access upper gastrointestinal cancer service. The study also aimed to develop a clinical prediction model for cancer and prospectively validate this model in a further patient cohort.

Methods - **Patient demographics**: Referral indications, and subsequent diagnoses were recorded prospectively. Logistic regression analyses were employed to determine the predictive value of individual alarm features in an evaluation cohort of 1,852 consecutive cases. The potential impact of applying a modified set of referral criteria was then examined in a validation cohort of 1,785 patients.

Results - **Evaluation cohort**: The mean age was 59 years; cancer prevalence was 3.8%; and serious benign pathology was 12.8%. Dysphagia (odds ratio (OR) 3.1), weight loss (OR 2.6), and age > 55 years (OR 9.5) were found to be significant predictive factors for cancer. However, the value of other accepted alarm features was more limited. In particular, uncomplicated dyspepsia in those over 55 years was a negative predictive factor for cancer within this high-risk cohort (OR 0.1).

- **Validation cohort**: The clinical prediction model would have selected 92% of cancer patients for fast track investigation while reducing the "two week rule" workload by 572 cases (31%).

Conclusions - **Fast track endoscopy**: In subjects fulfilling criteria for suspected upper gastrointestinal malignancy results in a significant yield of cancer (approximately 4%) and serious benign diseases such as peptic ulceration, strictures, and severe esophagitis.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^113NoZTN]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5–10% of visits to the emergency department. Rapid and accurate detection of urgent conditions is vital for managing patients and ensuring efficient patient throughput. Decision-making in patients with abdominal pain, based on clinical and laboratory evaluation alone, can result in unnecessary interventions or delayed treatment of urgent conditions. Several forms of imaging, such as ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT), are often used to assist in clinical decision-making. Imaging has been shown to positively affect the accuracy of clinical diagnoses, lead to changes in management decisions, and increase the level of diagnostic certainty in patients with acute abdominal pain. The use of early CT in patients with abdominal pain has been shown to reduce the number of serious diagnoses missed.

Over the years, diagnostic imaging in the emergency department has been responsible for an increase in hospital costs, and CT has been a growing source of radiation exposure in adult patients. This calls for a rational, evidence-based approach to imaging in patients with abdominal pain. The American College of Radiology has provided guidelines for imaging in patients with abdominal pain and specific locations of abdominal tenderness. However, this differentiation in imaging use with patient-tailored guidelines may not suffice to cover the wide spectrum of clinical presentations of abdominal pain.

An optimal imaging strategy in patients with abdominal pain would lead to timely identification.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^113aLotS]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

Clinical history taking in a patient with dyspepsia should commence with the collection of information concerning the duration and nature of the symptoms. The clinician should elucidate the actual commencement of symptoms, as the patient tends to remember only when symptoms got worse. This is particularly important because a longer symptom duration favors functional dyspepsia (FD) over organic disease. The patient should be asked about all possible upper gastrointestinal symptoms, including "red flags" or alarm symptoms and signs.

The clinician should inquire about epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, postprandial fullness, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, haematemesis, belching, regurgitation, dysphagia — including the level at which food sticks — and rumination, ensuring the patient understands what is meant by these terms. There is some evidence that using pictograms can facilitate understanding of these terms by patients. Weight loss is reported frequently by patients with FD. Depending on the patient's age, this may be considered an alarm symptom; therefore, attention should be paid to obtaining objective evidence of this.

In the context of dyspepsia, guidelines for the assessment of patients with suspected gastro-oesophageal cancer from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that an urgent 2-week wait endoscopy should be offered to patients aged ≥ 55 years with dyspepsia and weight loss. Non-urgent endoscopy should be considered in patients aged ≥ 55 years with treatment-resistant dyspepsia or dyspepsia with either.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study.

Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain. The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### Emergency laparoscopy — current best practice [^116ni8gB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Whilst most patients presenting with abdominal pain will be diagnosed within a short period of assessment, there remains a cohort in whom the clinical picture is equivocal. In these patients, depending on the severity of their symptoms, laparoscopy plays a significant role. If the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are relatively less concerning, then a period of observation may allow clarification of a diagnosis or simply cessation of the pain. However, in cases where observation is not safe due to the severity of the clinical findings, we advocate diagnostic laparoscopy. The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, converted-to-open cases have similar outcomes to primary laparotomy, thus minimizing potential negative effects of laparoscopy. Secondly, as discussed above, many common pathologies that may be the underlying cause of the non-specific abdominal pain are now best managed laparoscopically.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^112GUZQH]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with acute abdominal pain at the emergency department need to be diagnosed correctly and treated accordingly. As the majority of patients will have self-limiting pathology not requiring surgical intervention, most will not require admission to the hospital. Patients with abdominal pathology requiring surgical treatment, however, should not be missed.

Many diagnostic modalities can complement the "basic" clinical evaluation of patient history, physical examination, and blood and urine analysis to diagnose patients with abdominal pain. Ultrasound, CT, laparoscopy, and clinical observation have all been reported in the literature. Ultrasound, for example, can assist in diagnosing many gastrointestinal causes of acute abdominal pain, and its routine use by surgeons for such patients has been shown to increase diagnostic accuracy. Computer tomography has also been reported to increase diagnostic accuracy and reduce hospital admissions by 24%, and it is said to be the best predictor of the need for an urgent intervention.

However, the use of cross-sectional imaging for all patients presenting with acute abdominal pain is costly, time-consuming, and, in the case of CT, exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The last issue is important as the growing use of CT is steadily increasing the collective dose of medical radiation to which patient populations are subjected. Even though the cancer risk from an abdominal CT is small for the individual, the increasing use of the modality may create a future health concern.

### Alarm symptoms and identification of non-cancer diagnoses in primary care: Cohort study [^1131ooS8]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The interpretation of our findings will depend, to a large extent, on the clinical context in which the alarm symptom is presented and, in particular, on the presence of other symptoms or signs that may or may not add to the diagnostic probability of a serious organic problem. Patients with haemoptysis who are febrile and coughing up infected sputum are clearly more likely to have an infective cause for their symptoms than someone with haemoptysis experienced in the context of acute onset of pleuritic chest pain. When accompanied by dysuria and urinary frequency, haematuria is clearly more likely to be related to a urinary tract infection than the same symptom occurring without pain and without disturbance of bladder function. Dysphagia in the absence of symptoms suggestive of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, particularly when progressive, should clearly be taken seriously, and our data suggest that dysphagia is an important alarm symptom for the diagnosis of cancer or oesophageal stricture.

Rectal bleeding remains problematic, and it is a difficult matter of clinical judgment as to whether the rather lower diagnostic rates at 90 days and at three years indicate investigation. Because of the frequent co-existence of perianal and more serious large bowel lesions, the presence of perianal pain or local bleeding should not be taken to exclude colon cancer, and it is probable that persistent, otherwise unexplained rectal bleeding merits urgent investigation. It is not clear from our data whether rectal bleeding is a valuable alarm symptom for the presence of inflammatory bowel disease or other non-cancer diagnoses.

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings, leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality.

This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain without vomiting, guarding, or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra-abdominal pathology and, therefore, can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function tests were helpful in pointing out the possibility of biliary colic, as was microscopic hematuria, which may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illnesses, which have no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However, high white blood cell (WBC) counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years. Indeed, for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain, the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness, pain migration, and vomiting may help differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease. In such cases, patients tend to have a raised white cell count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically, and commonly, patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful in these diagnostic scenarios.

### Intramural hematoma of the esophagus mimicking hemorrhaging esophageal cancer [^114dcSe4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

A 77-year-old male presented with severe epigastric pain, hematemesis, hemorrhagic shock, and respiratory failure due to aspiration. Apart from a two-week history of intermittent epigastric pain, there was no recent history of dysphagia, weight loss, or anorexia. His past history includes a previous stroke, for which he took clopidogrel regularly. He was intubated for ventilatory support immediately. Blood products were also administered. Physical examination was unremarkable except for bibasal crackles.

Gastroscopy was performed to achieve hemostasis and revealed marked luminal occlusion by diffuse mucosal ulceration with active ooze, initially suspected to be malignancy. A biopsy was taken for histological examination. After stabilization, a computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast revealed a thickened esophagus extending from T1 down to the stomach near the gastro-esophageal junction. The esophageal lumen was almost completely obliterated.

- **Gastroscopy findings**: Initial gastroscopy showed diffuse abnormality with areas of active bleeding.

- **CT findings**: The sagittal view of the CT thorax showed a long segment of heterogeneous esophageal wall thickening with almost complete luminal occlusion.

The diagnosis of intramural hematoma of the esophagus (IHE) was made based on the history of anti-coagulant use and CT findings of esophageal wall thickening without any evidence of perforation. This was further supported by histological confirmation of esophagitis. He was conservatively managed; nutrition was provided parenterally, and he continued to remain stable.

### Gastric adenocarcinoma in a 13-year-old boy: A diagnosis not often seen in this age group [^111MGJ7F]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastric adenocarcinoma is not uncommon in the adult population; however, in the pediatric population, it is an extremely rare entity. A 13-year-old boy was referred to a pediatric oncology unit for evaluation of a tumor in the upper abdomen. Further investigation revealed an advanced stage gastric carcinoma with metastases suggestive of a hereditary cause. Awareness of uncommon diagnoses is a key issue regarding accurate treatment and overall prognosis.

### Postprandial symptoms originating from the stomach in functional dyspepsia [^116hSMFd]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is characterized by chronic epigastric symptoms. The stomach has been held responsible for the generation of symptoms. However, the latest reports indicate that the duodenum may also be implicated in the pathophysiology. This study aimed to elucidate which dyspeptic symptoms originate from the stomach and/or from the small intestine following a meal.

- **Methods**: Two hundred eighty-four FD patients underwent a gastric emptying breath test. Breath samples were taken, and the intensity of six dyspeptic symptoms (fullness, bloating, belching, nausea, epigastric burning, and epigastric pain) was scored before a meal and at 15-minute intervals for a period of 240 minutes postprandially. Time curves of each symptom were analyzed, and severity scores during the gastric and intestinal phases were compared.

- **Key results**: Time curves for fullness, bloating, belching, and nausea displayed a significant negative slope, while symptom severity of epigastric burning and epigastric pain did not decrease over time. Numerical analysis revealed that scores for fullness, bloating, and belching were higher during the gastric phase compared with the intestinal phase. In contrast, the intensities of nausea, epigastric burning, and epigastric pain were similar during both phases.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: The intensities of fullness, bloating, and belching decrease as food moves from the stomach to the small intestine, indicating that the stomach plays a crucial role in the generation of these symptoms. In contrast, the symptom severity of epigastric burning and… (The text appears to be truncated here.)

### Gastric perforation mimicking ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^111ZbWMw]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 70-year-old Indonesian man presented at the emergency room (ER) with epigastric discomfort that had persisted for one month and worsened over the last five days, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Twelve hours prior to his admission to the ER, the epigastric pain became very intense. The patient described the pain as sharp, constant, and non-radiating. Four hours later, the pain became dull and spread throughout the abdomen, accompanied by additional symptoms of fever, lethargy, abdominal fullness, constipation, and inability to pass wind. The patient did not experience any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath, and no modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease were found. The patient had a history of surgery due to gastric perforation two years ago and was later diagnosed with a gastric ulcer, attributed to habitual self-medication with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and frequent consumption of spicy food, even after surgery.

A 25-year-old woman presented with a history of abdominal pain. An endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract revealed a tumor that protruded into the prepyloric antrum. After resection, a 'high-risk' gastrointestinal stromal tumor was histologically confirmed.

- **Investigations**: Endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, hemigastrectomy, [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-PET/CT scan, histological examination, immunohistochemistry, cardiac MRI, high-resolution CT with electrocardiogram gating, CT angiography, and cardiac surgery.

- **Diagnosis**: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor, epicardial paraganglioma, and Carney's syndrome.

- **Management**: Abdominal ultrasound and endoscopy combined with endoscopic ultrasound, and an annual FDG-PET/CT scan.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^112fTbZk]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with undiagnosed hereditary angioedema (HAE) with gastrointestinal symptoms are likely to present across many care settings, including both primary care and specialist clinics. Inclusion of HAE as part of the differential diagnosis in patients with unexplained severe abdominal pain — often recurring and sometimes accompanied by skin manifestations — may improve the rate of HAE diagnosis. Careful history-taking and physical examination, along with selected imaging studies and laboratory testing, are vital to making the diagnosis. By including HAE in the differential diagnosis, providers can make the appropriate referral to a physician experienced in managing HAE, thus shortening the time to diagnosis and effective treatment and reducing the burden of disease.

A patient in her late 20s presented with severe epigastric pain. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to exclude an upper gastrointestinal perforation, revealing findings of perigastric appendagitis. This is a rare cause of severe upper abdominal pain. The patient was treated with oral and intravenous analgesia medication and discharged the next day. No surgical intervention was required.

### Use of alarm symptoms to select dyspeptics for endoscopy causes patients with curable esophagogastric cancer to be overlooked [^112VHsUY]. Surgical Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

In August 2004, the United Kingdom Department of Health advisory body published dyspepsia referral guidelines for primary care practitioners. These guidelines advised empiric treatment with antisecretory medications and referral for endoscopy only in the presence of alarm symptoms. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of these guidelines on the detection of esophagogastric cancer.

- **Methods**: The study reviewed a prospectively compiled database of 4,018 subjects who underwent open access gastroscopy from 1990 to 1998. The main outcome measures for the study were cancer detection rates, International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stage, and survival.

- **Results**: Gastroscopy identified esophagogastric carcinoma in 123 (3%) of the 4,018 subjects. Of these 123 patients, 104 (85%) with esophagogastric cancer had "alarm" symptoms (anemia, mass, dysphagia, weight loss, vomiting) and would have satisfied the referral criteria. The remaining 15% would not have been referred for initial endoscopic assessment because their symptoms were those of uncomplicated "benign" dyspepsia. The patients with "alarm" symptoms had a significantly more advanced tumor stage (metastatic disease in 47% vs 11%; p < 0.001), were less likely to undergo surgical resection (50% vs 95%; p < 0.001), and had poorer survival (median, 11 vs 39 months; p = 0.01) than their counterparts without such symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: The use of alarm symptoms to select dyspeptics for endoscopy identifies patients with advanced and usually incurable esophagogastric cancer. Patients with early curable esophagogastric cancer are often overlooked under these guidelines.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^114UTqsE]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

Over the last 35 years, definitions of dyspepsia have evolved from a broad one, which included any symptom felt to be attributable to the stomach and duodenum, including heartburn, nausea, or vomiting, to one that includes only the cardinal symptoms of epigastric pain or burning, postprandial fullness, or early satiation (the feeling of fullness during ingestion of a meal, which acts as a terminating factor). Recent definitions recognize that belching, nausea, or upper abdominal bloating can also be present. However, heartburn alone is not a symptom of dyspepsia, although it can coexist. Vomiting is atypical and, if present, should prompt consideration of another disorder.

FD is diagnosed in the absence of a structural abnormality to explain the symptoms. Therefore, to make a diagnosis, by definition, patients need to have been investigated to exclude evidence of organic, systemic, or metabolic disease. Symptoms alone are not reliable in distinguishing functional from organic causes of dyspepsia. Nevertheless, 80% of people with dyspepsia will be diagnosed with FD following endoscopy.

- **Symptom-based diagnostic criteria**: FD is defined according to symptom-based diagnostic criteria developed by the Rome Foundation and is classified into two distinct subtypes: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS). Clinically, the EPS subtype separates those with epigastric pain or burning, often present regardless of meals, from those with PDS who report early satiation and postprandial fullness, mainly triggered by meals.

Postprandial pain, which starts soon after eating and lasts for an hour or so, often requiring people to take to their bed, may indicate that the person is trying to eat too much at one sitting. Rarely, it indicates mesenteric ischaemia. Postprandial dizziness, light-headedness, nausea, bloating, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea may suggest dumping syndrome or reactive hypoglycemia but are also symptoms commonly caused by SIBO.

Significant weight loss is common after upper GI surgery. It may be a consequence of the catabolic state from surgery, radiotherapy, systemic therapies, cancer recurrence, or an imbalance between calorific requirements and dietary intake. Poorly controlled GI symptoms also contribute. Weight loss, although easy to record, may not be as important as changes to body composition or sarcopenia.

Non-specific symptoms are common in this patient group, and inadequate investigation risks missing treatable causes. If IBS was not present before surgery, it is unreasonable to attribute symptoms to IBS afterward. Nocturnal waking to defecate and steatorrhea are never features of IBS. A systematic investigative approach can be very effective in diagnosing the potential multiple coexisting diagnoses, including BAD, PEI, SIBO, overflow diarrhea, jejunostomy feed-related diarrhea, malabsorption syndromes, and late dumping syndrome. Further contributing factors may include alimentary and lifestyle issues, such as too much or too little fiber, excessive alcohol, excessive caffeine, excess consumption of drinks containing artificial sweeteners, or side effects of prescribed medications.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute nonlocalized abdominal pain [^114uoLGH]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The range of pathology in adults that can produce abdominal pain is broad and necessitates an imaging approach to evaluate many different organ systems. Although localizing pain prompts directed imaging/management, clinical presentations may vary and result in nonlocalized symptoms. This review focuses on imaging the adult population with nonlocalized abdominal pain, including patients with fever, recent abdominal surgery, or neutropenia.

Imaging of the entire abdomen and pelvis to evaluate for infectious or inflammatory processes of the abdominal viscera and solid organs, abdominal and pelvic neoplasms, and screen for ischemic or vascular etiologies is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Often the first-line modality, CT quickly evaluates the abdomen/pelvis, providing for accurate diagnoses and management of patients with abdominal pain. Ultrasound and tailored MRI protocols may be useful as first-line imaging studies, especially in pregnant patients. In the postoperative abdomen, fluoroscopy may help detect anastomotic leaks/abscesses. While often performed, abdominal radiographs may not alter management.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation).

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^114C2HGQ]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The electronic database search and citation tracking identified 13,669 unique titles for fracture and 3,092 for malignancy (see Fig. 1). After screening the titles and abstracts, we retrieved full-text copies of 68 articles related to fracture and 70 full-text articles related to malignancy. Fourteen discrete studies were included in the reviews, with eight related to fracture and nine to malignancy (three studies dealt with both conditions).

- **Flow diagram of search strategies**: The flow diagram for studies evaluating red flags to screen for spinal fracture and malignancy in patients presenting with low back pain is provided.

For each included study, details on the design, setting, population, reference standard, index tests used, and definition of the target condition are available in Tables B and C in the appendix. Most studies (eight) were set in primary care, two in secondary care, and the four remaining in tertiary care (three in emergency departments and one in a spinal surgical unit). Three studies investigated red flags for both fracture and malignancy. Five of the eight primary care studies were prospective in design, whereas three were retrospective chart reviews (two for fracture, one for malignancy). Standard radiographs were the most common reference standard for diagnosing fracture, while the most common reference standards used for malignancy were magnetic resonance imaging or long-term clinical follow-up.

- **Quality assessment**: Appendix Table D shows the individual results of the quality assessment for included studies. The items that were not adequately dealt with are discussed in the appendix.

### Gastric sensorimotor function and its clinical measurement [^11587ZHE]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Low credibility.

- **Gastric motility disorders**: Epigastric symptoms thought to be caused by disorders of gastroduodenal sensorimotor function are highly prevalent. The symptom pattern may include early satiation, postprandial fullness, bloating, epigastric pain or burning, nausea, vomiting, and belching. There may be associated symptoms of loss of appetite, weight loss, and postprandial fatigue or dizziness. Disorders of gastric sensorimotor function underlie conditions such as functional dyspepsia (FD), gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting disorders, and dumping syndrome.

	- The Rome IV consensus defines FD by the presence of gastroduodenal symptoms (early satiation, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning) in the absence of organic, systemic, or metabolic disease likely to explain symptoms. The global prevalence is estimated at approximately 7%. The Rome consensus distinguishes two FD subgroups: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS), characterized by early satiation or postprandial fullness, and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), with symptoms of epigastric pain and burning. The PDS group accounts for up to 85% of FD cases and overlaps with EPS in approximately 15%. FD is heterogeneous, and subgroups of patients have impaired gastric accommodation, disordered gastric emptying, gastric myoelectrical abnormalities, or hypersensitivity to gastric distention. The correlation between symptom pattern and severity and disordered gastric function is generally weak. Analyses of large patient subgroups have shown associations of early satiation and weight loss with impaired accommodation.

### A patient presenting with stress-induced epigastric pain [^114HmrZm]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The median arcuate ligament passes over the truncus coeliacus, superior to its ostium. If it is thickened and located too low, it can cause external compression and stenosis of the truncus coeliacus, leading to postprandial abdominal pain and vomiting. This combination of symptoms is called median arcuate ligament syndrome. We report the case of a 79-year-old patient who suffered from chronic epigastric pain, initially assumed to be caused by either coronary artery disease or atherosclerotic stenosis of the coeliac artery. Angiography excluded coronary artery disease but showed severe external stenosis of the truncus. The patient underwent a laparoscopic release of the median arcuate ligament, resulting in relief of his symptoms. The median arcuate ligament syndrome should be considered in patients with stress-induced epigastric pain. Further underlying pathologies, especially coronary artery disease, as a life-threatening diagnosis, have to be initially excluded.

### Red-flag signs and symptoms for earlier diagnosis of early-onset colorectal cancer [^116Y6d3G]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

Prompt detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) among individuals younger than age 50 years (early-onset CRC) is a clinical priority because of its alarming rise.

- **Methods**: We conducted a matched case-control study of 5075 incident early-onset CRC cases among US commercial insurance beneficiaries (113 million adults aged 18–64 years) with two or more years of continuous enrollment (2006–2015). This was done to identify red-flag signs and symptoms occurring between three months to two years before the index date among 17 prespecified signs and symptoms. We assessed diagnostic intervals according to the presence of these signs and symptoms before and within three months of diagnosis.

- **Results**: Between three months and two years before the index date, four red-flag signs and symptoms (abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and iron deficiency anemia) were associated with an increased risk of early-onset CRC, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.34 to 5.13. Having one, two, or at least three of these signs and symptoms was associated with a 1.94-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.76 to 2.14), 3.59-fold (95% CI = 2.89 to 4.44), and 6.52-fold (95% CI = 3.78 to 11.23) risk (Ptrend < .001), respectively, with stronger associations for younger ages (Pinteraction < .001) and rectal cancer (Pheterogeneity = .012). The number of different signs and symptoms was predictive of early-onset CRC beginning 18 months before diagnosis. Approximately 19.3% of patients had their first sign or symptom occur between three months and two years before diagnosis (median diagnostic interval = 8.7 months), and approximately 49.3% had the first sign or symptom within the same period.

### Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is a late and fatal complication of gastric signet ring cell carcinoma: A systematic review and case-control study [^112K5EQC]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

A 36-year-old previously healthy woman was admitted to a major academic medical center following a presyncopal episode associated with nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. She also endorsed a 1-week history of new lower back pain. She denied any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding. Initial vital signs were temperature of 100.5°F, blood pressure 107/45 mmHg, respiratory rate 16/minute, and oxygen saturation (SaO₂) of 100% on room air. Physical examination was notable for tenderness in the lumbar area with no neurological abnormalities.

Laboratory results indicated hemoglobin at 6.8 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 97.6 fL, platelets at 116 × 10³/μL, total bilirubin 3.4 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.3 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 729 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 204 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 64 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 34 U/L, and reticulocyte count greater than 18%, consistent with a consumptive hemolytic process. Coagulation studies included a normal prothrombin time of 11.5 s, partial thromboplastin time 25.4 s, and fibrinogen 424 mg/dL. A peripheral blood smear showed schistocytes and macrocytic anemia. The direct Coombs test was negative. Additional workups were negative for antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus anticoagulant, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Although lumbar radiographs were normal, computerized tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis identified supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and lytic lesions of the L1 vertebral body with endplate compression fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, abdomen, and pelvis revealed multifocal enhancing osseous lesions throughout the spine consistent with metastatic cancer. Tumor markers CEA and…

### Abdominal pain in the elderly [^114wGRxk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Elderly patients who have abdominal pain remain one of the most challenging patient populations. Signs and symptoms of serious diseases are often nonspecific, and atypical presentations are common in elderly patients. In addition, the higher incidence of serious pathology in this population requires emergency physicians to be vigilant and thorough in their work-up. Vascular catastrophes are more likely to be seen in this population, necessitating a broad differential diagnosis to be considered.

### Limited value of alarm features in the diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal malignancy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nyxyz]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Alarm features such as dysphagia, weight loss, or anemia raise concern of an upper gastrointestinal malignancy in patients with dyspepsia. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of alarm features in predicting malignancy by performing a meta-analysis based on the published literature.

- **Methods**: English-language studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and CINAHL. Cohort studies that measured alarm features and compared them with the endoscopic findings were included. Studies were screened for inclusion by two authors who independently extracted the data. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated by comparing the alarm feature with the endoscopic diagnosis. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve method was used to summarize test characteristics across studies. Individual alarm features were also assessed when the study report permitted.

- **Results**: Eighty-three of 2,600 studies met the initial screening criteria; 15 met inclusion criteria after detailed review. These 15 studies evaluated a total of 57,363 patients, of whom 458 (0.8%) had cancer. The sensitivity of alarm symptoms varied from 0% to 83% with considerable heterogeneity between studies. The specificity also varied significantly from 40% to 98%. A clinical diagnosis made by a physician was very specific (range, 97%-98%) but not very sensitive (range, 11%-53%).

- **Conclusions**: Alarm features have limited predictive value for an underlying malignancy. Their use in dyspepsia management strategies needs to be reassessed.

### Cost of detecting malignant lesions by endoscopy in 2741 primary care dyspeptic patients without alarm symptoms [^116PHHVY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend empirical, noninvasive approaches to manage dyspeptic patients without alarm symptoms, but concerns about missed lesions persist; the cost savings afforded by noninvasive approaches must be weighed against treatment delays. We investigated the prevalence of malignancies and other serious abnormalities in patients with dyspepsia and the cost of detecting these by endoscopy.

- **Methods**: We studied 2741 primary-care outpatients, 18–70 years in age, who met Rome II criteria for dyspepsia. Patients with alarm features (dysphagia, bleeding, weight loss, etc) were excluded. All patients underwent endoscopy. The cost and diagnostic yield of an early endoscopy strategy in all patients were compared with those of endoscopy limited to age-defined cohorts. Costs were calculated for a low, intermediate, and high-cost environment.

- **Results**: Endoscopies detected abnormalities in 635 patients (23%). The most common findings were reflux esophagitis with erosions (15%), gastric ulcers (2.7%), and duodenal ulcers (2.3%). The prevalence of upper gastrointestinal malignancy was 0.22%. If all dyspeptic patients 50 years or older underwent endoscopy, 1 esophageal cancer and no gastric cancers would have been missed. If the age threshold for endoscopy were set at 50 years, at a cost of $500/endoscopy, it would cost $82,900 (95% CI, $35,714-$250,000) to detect each case of cancer.

- **Conclusions**: Primary care dyspeptic patients without alarm symptoms rarely have serious underlying conditions at endoscopy. The costs associated with diagnosing an occult malignant lesion through endoscopy in this patient population are significant.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^116xfwW3]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

In the absence of alarm symptoms or signs, functional dyspepsia (FD) is highly probable when epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, and/or postprandial fullness are reported, in line with the Rome IV criteria, and endoscopy is unlikely to change the diagnosis, even though a normal endoscopy is required as part of these diagnostic criteria. In routine clinical practice, clinicians can use the recently proposed Rome IV clinical criteria, which require the presence of one or more of these four cardinal symptoms if reported as bothersome for more than 8 weeks. Other symptoms can coexist but should not be predominant. Information about the characteristics of pain should be recorded.

Usually, in FD, pain is in the upper abdomen or epigastrium and may be present in fasting conditions and/or precipitated or exacerbated by meal ingestion. Unlike in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), abdominal pain in FD is unrelated to the need to defecate. This may help differentiate patients with FD from those with IBS or identify patients with FD with overlapping IBS, which can be of any subtype and is reported to occur in up to 50% of patients. In this situation, the patient will report the presence of two different types of abdominal pain, one related to defecation and one unrelated.

Other functional bowel disorders, including functional diarrhea, functional constipation, or functional abdominal bloating and distension, can also overlap with FD. Gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms coexist in approximately one-third of patients with FD. In these cases, evidence suggests that clinicians tend to favor a certain diagnosis or approach.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^116qjTKf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The problem representation is an abstract one-sentence summary that elaborates the key features of the case. It triggers plausible diagnostic hypotheses and directs exploration of further historical elements, physical examination features, and diagnostic testing. In complex cases, it is often necessary to consider more than one problem representation. Here the competing versions might be: (1) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with a subacute febrile illness and headaches associated with LUQ abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting; or (2) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with acute onset of sharp, unremitting LUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting. Using the first problem representation, the clinician would likely consider serious intracranial infections and mass lesions. In the second problem representation, the LUQ pain is the focal point that directs further data gathering. It is often useful to explore competing problem representations to avoid "premature closure". Premature closure is the failure to consider other plausible diagnoses after an initial working diagnosis is reached. It is one of the most common clinical reasoning errors made by clinicians.

### Epigastric pain as presentation of an addisonian crisis in a patient with Schmidt syndrome [^114kzXNN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A 39-year-old woman presented with a 10-day history of epigastric pain accompanied by persistent fatigue and loss of appetite for 3 months. She had presented several weeks earlier with adhesive capsulitis, treated by local infiltration of corticosteroids. She was not taking any other medications. Results of heart, lung, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable, except for mild epigastric tenderness. Purple stretch marks were observed on examination of the skin. The only blood chemistry abnormalities were hyponatremia (125 mEq/L) and hyperkalemia (6.8 mEq/L). Based on the clinical and biological picture, adrenal insufficiency was suspected. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and received hydrocortisone intravenously for 3 days. She was then given oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Biologic abnormalities reversed entirely; the final diagnosis was primary autoimmune adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) associated with autoimmune hypothyroidism (Schmidt syndrome). Adrenal insufficiency should be considered in patients with abdominal pain, especially when associated with electrolyte abnormalities.

### Targeting patient-derived orthotopic gastric cancers with a fluorescent humanized anti-CEA antibody [^1163oQt6]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Patient-derived gastric cancer specimens were obtained from two individuals who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The first patient, KG8, was a 45-year-old male presenting with early satiety and weight loss. Imaging revealed diffuse thickening of the stomach and numerous enlarged lymph nodes, accompanied by an elevated serum CEA level of 176. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) exposed a circumferential friable tumor consistent with linitis plastica. Given the patient's inability to tolerate enteral feeding, upfront surgery was performed.

The second specimen, KG10, was obtained from a 66-year-old female with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, presenting with epigastric pain. Imaging and EGD identified an obstructing polypoid-type mass in the gastric remnant, though her serum CEA level was normal at 5.7. Although neoadjuvant therapy was planned prior to resection, gastrointestinal bleeding from the tumor necessitated immediate surgical intervention.

- **Figures and imaging**:
	- **KG8**:
		- Axial CT images showed thickening of the gastric cardia and enlarged perihepatic lymph nodes.
		- Endoscopic images depicted a circumferential friable tumor extending from the cardia to the antrum, aligning with linitis plastica.
	- **KG10**:
		- Axial and coronal CT images revealed a ~3 cm polypoid mass at the pylorus.
		- Endoscopic images showed an obstructing mass. Indicators used: red arrow denoting the tumor and blue arrow indicating the enlarged lymph node.

### Case report: COVID-19 masquerading as an acute surgical abdomen [^1172wPH7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can present with various clinical features, among which gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and mild abdominal pain have been reported. Recognition of rare presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection has increased over time. These atypical and rare presentations may lead to difficulties in establishing the diagnosis in a timely manner; furthermore, they may lead to unnecessary investigations, extended hospital stays, adverse outcomes, and more strain on healthcare resources. We present three cases admitted to our hospital with a picture that mimicked an acute abdomen, necessitating surgical assessment and evaluation. All cases turned out to be SARS-CoV-2 positive and did not require surgical management. We discuss the management course, highlight the importance of abdominal symptoms in the setting of COVID-19, and discuss the implications of this association for medical practice amid the pandemic in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is required to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article discusses several diagnoses, including can't-miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or if this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and, given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit.

We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can provide clues about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered, along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Gastrointestinal pain [^114UY3kK]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) pain, a form of visceral pain, is common in disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, and pancreatitis. Identifying the cause of GI pain represents a diagnostic challenge, as the clinical presentation is often blurred by concomitant autonomic and somatic symptoms. GI pain can be nociceptive, neuropathic, and associated with cancer. In many cases, multiple etiologies coexist in an individual patient.

The mechanisms of GI pain are complex and include both peripheral and central sensitization, as well as the involvement of the autonomic nervous system, which plays a role in generating the symptoms that frequently accompany pain. Treatment of GI pain depends on the precise type of pain and the primary disorder in the patient. It can include pharmacological therapy, cognitive behavioral therapies, invasive surgical procedures, endoscopic procedures, and lifestyle alterations.

Due to major differences between organ involvement, disease mechanisms, and individual factors, treatment must always be personalized. Some data suggest that phenotyping and subsequent individual management of GI pain might be options in the future.

In this series, a clinician extemporaneously discusses the diagnostic approach to sequentially presented clinical information. Additional commentary on the diagnostic reasoning process is integrated throughout the discussion.

- **Clinical information**: A 43-year-old Mexican woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Her illness had begun 1 week earlier with fevers to 38.9°F and intermittent frontal headache without photophobia or other neurological symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, she began having left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain described as sharp, unremitting, and radiating to the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant, and left flank. The pain did not change with eating, but she did report episodic nausea and vomiting. She denied hematemesis, dysuria, or diarrhea. Her last menstrual period had begun 3 weeks earlier, and she denied recent sexual activity. One day prior, she had been diagnosed with gallstones at another emergency department and treated with oral metoclopramide and hydrocodone-acetaminophen.

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^111p4GSv]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

A 15-year-old male patient presented with acute abdominal pain, prompting an investigation into potential underlying causes. The clinical approach focused on differential diagnosis, considering possible conditions such as appendicitis, gastrointestinal infections, and other abdominal pathologies. Diagnostic imaging and laboratory tests were instrumental in narrowing down the diagnosis. Through a comprehensive evaluation, the medical team aimed to provide targeted treatment and alleviate the patient's symptoms.

### Anisakidosis: A fortuitous mimicker of gastrointestinal malignancy [^114GgtTH]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old woman presented with epigastric pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Her sister was recently diagnosed with duodenal adenocarcinoma, manifesting similar symptoms. Imaging revealed a thickened gastric antrum with enlarged local lymph nodes. Endoscopy illustrated three worms embedded in the antral wall, identified as Anisakis simplex larvae. The removal of larvae and a two-week albendazole regimen treated the symptoms.

With the globalization of cultural culinary practices, physicians must be vigilant of anisakidosis. Its ability to mimic peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, and malignancy necessitates broader differential diagnoses and lower thresholds for endoscopy.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: Recent developments and new guidelines [^113qea4V]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

If symptoms were a good discriminator for the likelihood of a patient with dyspepsia having an underlying organic pathology, this would greatly aid the physician in their clinical assessment; however, unfortunately, this is not the case. A previous systematic review of diagnostic test studies demonstrated convincingly that a physician's opinion, based on symptoms reported by the patient, had limited diagnostic ability to discriminate between organic causes of dyspepsia and functional dyspepsia (FD).

Historically, FD was referred to as non-ulcer dyspepsia, creating the impression that the diagnosis was based on the absence of specific underlying organic pathology, thereby encouraging the use of investigations in all patients. Although more recently the terminology has changed, FD still remains a diagnosis of exclusion. The Rome Foundation, the expert group responsible for the classification of all functional GI disorders, defines FD using the Rome IV criteria as bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, or epigastric burning, in the absence of structural disease, including at upper GI endoscopy, which would explain the symptoms.

According to these criteria, the condition is subgrouped into two separate syndromes: epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS). EPS consists of intermittent pain or burning in the epigastrium, occurring at least once per week. The pain may be either induced or relieved by eating but may also occur while fasting; however, it should not fulfill biliary pain criteria.

### A rare case of primary gastric Hodgkin lymphoma in an adolescent with Nijmegen breakage syndrome [^1136A8By]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old male of Eastern European descent was referred to pediatric gastroenterology for severe malnutrition and epigastric abdominal pain initially attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease. He had been experiencing eight months of daily postprandial periumbilical abdominal pain. At the time of the initial GI assessment in the clinic, he was taking omeprazole for the past few months with some improvement in abdominal pain, but he had experienced a 9% weight loss over the past six months with his weight below the 3rd percentile (Z-score < -6).

His past medical history is notable for NBS, which was diagnosed at six months of age, with a combined immunodeficiency phenotype, low B cell, and poor T cell function. He was diagnosed after his older sister underwent genetic testing and was found to have an NBS1 657del5 mutation. His family history is notable for two siblings with NBS along with a first cousin.

He has associated microcephaly, short stature with height below the 3rd percentile (Z-score < -2), bronchiectasis, and lymphopenia with IgG deficiency, requiring routine IVIG infusions. He has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which was diagnosed at age eight during a hospitalization for pneumonia and pleural effusion.

On initial labs, he was noted to have elevated uric acid of 7.2 mg/dL and LDH of 2711 U/L, leading to further diagnostic work-up. MRI of the chest revealed a large right chest mass and multiple lesions in his kidneys, spleen, pelvis, and tibias. Bone marrow biopsies revealed patchy tumor involvement, and he was treated with appropriate medical interventions.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy in patients with low-back pain [^116RpSsG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The identification of serious pathologies, such as spinal malignancy, is one of the primary purposes of the clinical assessment of patients with low-back pain (LBP). Clinical guidelines recommend awareness of "red flag" features from the patient's clinical history and physical examination to achieve this. However, there are limited empirical data on the diagnostic accuracy of these features, and there remains very little information on how best to use them in clinical practice.

- **Objectives**: To assess the diagnostic performance of clinical characteristics identified by taking a clinical history and conducting a physical examination ("red flags") to screen for spinal malignancy in patients presenting with LBP.

- **Search methods**: We searched electronic databases for primary studies (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL) and systematic reviews (PubMed and Medion) from the earliest date until 1 April 2012. Forward and backward citation searching of eligible articles was also performed.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered studies if they compared the results of history taking and physical examination on patients with LBP with those of diagnostic imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, myelography).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the quality of each included study with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool and extracted details on patient characteristics, study design, index tests, and reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy data were presented as sensitivities and specificities with 95% confidence intervals.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions, ranging from benign and self-limited diseases to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis. Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful (e.g. constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction), whereas others are of little value (e.g. anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis).

The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain; and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^112kWzpK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The risk of malignancy predominantly relates to increasing age, and previous guidelines have recommended routine upper GI endoscopy for dyspepsia in patients aged 55 years and older. The ACG/CAG guideline has now raised this age threshold to 60 years, based on a cost-effectiveness analysis. This analysis demonstrates that, at all ages, upper GI endoscopy was dominated by alternative management strategies, and using a threshold of 55 years, the evidence for cost-effectiveness was borderline. Currently, the age threshold in NICE guidance remains at 55 years or older. It is important to note that cost-effectiveness decisions may vary between countries due to differences in patient populations and healthcare systems.

In the ACG/CAG guideline, the investigation of patients aged < 60 years presenting with alarm features is not recommended. The authors acknowledge that alarm features are poor predictors of malignancy, and the baseline risk of malignancy for someone < 60 years old is so low that reporting an alarm feature does not justify endoscopic investigation.

- **Alarm features in patients with dyspepsia**: The analysis, adapted from Talley and Ford, identifies alarm features. However, it is noted that the investigation for patients under 60, even with alarm features, is not justified due to the negligible increase in risk.

- **Pooled prevalence of underlying pathology**: The study reports the pooled prevalence of underlying pathology identified at upper GI endoscopy in patients with dyspepsia, adapted from Ford and colleagues. This data underscores the findings that routine endoscopies may not be necessary for younger populations.

The updated guidelines reflect a shift based on newer analyses, emphasizing careful consideration of age and local healthcare economic assessments before deciding on endoscopic investigations for dyspepsia.

### Abdominal pain in the emergency department: Missed diagnoses [^111FXtYL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common chief complaint in the Emergency Department. It is caused by a variety of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal disorders. Some frequently missed conditions include biliary pathology, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and urogenital pathology. The emergency medicine clinician must consider all aspects of the patient's presentation, including history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging. If no diagnosis is identified, close reassessment of pain, vital signs, and physical examination is necessary to ensure safe discharge. Strict verbal and written return precautions should be provided to the patient.

### Red flags for appropriate referral to the gastroenterologist and the rheumatologist of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and spondyloarthritis [^114Sugv8]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2019). Low credibility.

Collaboration between gastroenterologists and rheumatologists is recommended for the correct management of patients with associated spondyloarthritis (SpA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to establish the appropriateness of several red flags for a prompt specialist referral. A systematic review of the literature was performed using the GRADE method to describe the prevalence of co-existing IBD-SpA and the diagnostic accuracy of red flags proposed by a steering committee. A consensus among expert gastroenterologists and rheumatologists, comprising 10 members in the steering committee and 13 in the expert panel, was obtained using the RAND method to confirm the appropriateness of each red flag as 'major' (one sufficient for patient referral) or 'minor' (at least three needed for patient referral) criteria for specialist referral.

The review of the literature confirmed the high prevalence of co-existing IBD-SpA. Positive and negative predictive values of red flags were not calculated due to the lack of available data. A consensus among gastroenterology and rheumatology specialists was used to confirm the appropriateness of each red flag.

- **Major criteria to refer patients with SpA to the gastroenterologist**: Rectal bleeding, chronic abdominal pain, perianal fistula or abscess, chronic diarrhoea, and nocturnal symptoms.

- **Major criteria to refer patients with IBD to the rheumatologist**: Chronic low back pain, dactylitis, enthesitis, and pain/swelling of peripheral joints.

Several major and minor red flags have been identified for the diagnosis of co-existing IBD-SpA.

### Gastric adenocarcinoma presenting with thromboembolism in a 13-year-old boy [^116KyoCC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a frequent complaint in the pediatric emergency department. A 13-year-old boy presented with complaints of abdominal pain, hematemesis, headache, and leg pain. Further investigation revealed an advanced-stage gastric adenocarcinoma with multiple thromboembolisms, including the greater saphenous vein and nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. This case highlights the challenges of diagnosing this rare condition and treating the primary tumor and thromboembolisms in the setting of both a hypercoagulable state and gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Prognostic significance of alarm symptoms in patients with gastric cancer [^111W7Fzp]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and spectrum of alarm symptoms in patients with newly diagnosed gastric cancer, and to examine the relationship between symptoms and outcome.

- **Methods**: Three hundred consecutive patients with gastric adenocarcinoma were studied prospectively. The outcomes of 40 patients (13.3 percent) without alarm symptoms (21 men; median age 69 years) were compared with those of the 260 patients (86.7 percent) with alarm symptoms (175 men; median age 72 years).

- **Results**: It was possible to perform an R0 gastrectomy more often in patients without alarm symptoms (21 patients; 52 percent) than in those with alarm symptoms (71 patients; 27.3 percent) (chi(2) = 10.35, 1 d.f. P = 0.001). The cumulative survival rate at 5 years was 38 percent for patients without alarm symptoms versus 15.0 percent for those with alarm symptoms (chi(2) = 10.18, 1 d.f. P = 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, distant metastasis (hazard ratio (HR) 2.73 (95 percent confidence interval (c.i.) 2.04 to 3.66); P < 0.001), overall stage of cancer (HR 1.83 (95 percent c.i. 1.53 to 2.19); P < 0.001) and persistent vomiting at diagnosis (HR 1.66 (95 percent c.i. 1.26 to 2.18); P < 0.001) were independently associated with length of survival.

- **Conclusion**: Alarm symptoms are absent in a significant minority of patients with gastric cancer at diagnosis; these patients stand a better chance of curative surgery and long-term survival than those with alarm symptoms.

### A 32-year-old woman with chronic abdominal pain [^111fULgg]. JAMA (2008). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a highly prevalent disorder that accounts for 5% of visits to primary care clinicians. It frequently coexists with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia, including epigastric pain, early satiety, and postprandial nausea, are nonspecific, making its diagnosis difficult. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder involving a number of different pathophysiologic processes, culminating in both gastrointestinal sensory and motor dysfunction. Although functional dyspepsia does not impart any increased risks to long-term health, it significantly affects both individuals and society. The economic burden of evaluating and treating functional dyspepsia is estimated to be at least $1 billion per year, and patients with functional dyspepsia experience a markedly reduced quality of life. Using the case of Ms. C, we apply an evidence-based approach to highlight knowledge in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of functional dyspepsia.

### Back pain "red flags": Which are most predictive of serious pathology in the emergency department [^112en16w]. European Spine Journal (2020). Low credibility.

To determine the frequency of red flag signs and symptoms in patients presenting with back pain to the Emergency Department (ED) and their association with serious pathologies and investigations performed, a retrospective observational study was conducted. This study evaluated consecutive patients presenting with back pain to a Melbourne ED over a 14-month period. Data regarding red flags, patient characteristics, ED-initiated investigations, and diagnoses were extracted from medical records. The prevalence of each red flag and sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for diagnosing serious spinal or non-spinal pathology were calculated.

An analysis was undertaken on 1,000 eligible participants with back pain. Of these, 69% exhibited red flags. Participants were categorized into diagnostic groups: musculoskeletal (80.6%), serious spinal (3.3%), and serious non-spinal (14.6%) pathologies. Several red flags had positive likelihood ratios (LR) greater than 5, indicating a higher probability of serious pathology (both spinal and non-spinal). These red flags included:

- **General serious pathology indicators**:
	- Fever (LR+ 68.8)
	- Tuberculosis history (LR+ 13.8)
	- Known nephrolithiasis/abdominal aortic aneurysm (LR+ 10.2)
	- Unexplained weight-loss (LR+ 9.2)
	- Writhing in pain (LR+ 6.9)
	- Urinary symptoms (LR+ 5.4)
	- Flank pain (LR+ 5.2)

- **Serious spinal pathology indicators**:
	- Saddle anaesthesia (LR+ 11.0)
	- Tuberculosis history (LR+ 9.8)
	- Intravenous drug-use (LR+ 6.9)
	- Acute-onset urinary retention (LR+ 6.4)
	- Anal tone loss (LR+ 6.3)

In conclusion, the majority of this study cohort had back pain of a benign cause. Some red flags were observed.

### Age and alarm symptoms do not predict endoscopic findings among patients with dyspepsia: a multicentre database study [^112fJaVu]. Gut (2001). Low credibility.

Symptoms of dyspepsia are common, but most patients do not exhibit major upper gastrointestinal pathology. Endoscopy is recommended for dyspeptic patients over the age of 45 or those presenting with certain "alarm" symptoms. We have evaluated the effectiveness of age and "alarm" symptoms in predicting major endoscopic findings across six endoscopy centers.

- **Methods**: Clinical variables of consecutive patients with dyspepsia symptoms undergoing upper endoscopy examinations were recorded using a common endoscopy database. Patients who had no previous upper endoscopy or barium radiography were included. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was utilized to identify predictors of endoscopic findings. The accuracy of these predictors in forecasting endoscopic findings was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of age thresholds ranging from 30 to 70 years were assessed.

- **Results**: Major pathology, including tumors, ulcers, or strictures, was identified at endoscopy in 787 out of 3,815 (21%) dyspeptic patients. Age, male gender, bleeding, and anemia were significant yet weak independent predictors of endoscopic findings. A multivariate prediction rule based on these elements revealed poor predictive accuracy (c statistic = 0.62). Implementing a simplified prediction rule of age ≥ 45 years or the presence of any "alarm" symptom resulted in sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 26%. Modifying the age cutoff did not significantly enhance predictive accuracy.

- **Conclusions**: Age and the presence of "alarm" symptoms are not effective predictors of endoscopic findings in patients with dyspepsia.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^113ZqdX9]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

A subgroup analysis was performed for sex, age, additional radiological imaging on the day of evaluation, the diagnosis of "nonspecific abdominal pain" (NSAP) after the initial evaluation (D1 or CD1), and the resident's degree of certainty for the initial clinical diagnosis. Female patients had more strategy changes than male patients (P < 0.05), and patients older than 16 years had significantly more strategy changes than children (P < 0.0001). When patients underwent additional imaging (US and/or CT) on the day of initial evaluation, they had fewer diagnostic changes compared to those who did not (P = 0.0002). However, this did not lead to a significant change in management (P = 0.106). Patients whose abdominal complaints could not be differentiated and were given the diagnosis of "nonspecific abdominal pain" (NSAP) after initial evaluation (n = 90) had more diagnostic changes at re-evaluation (P = 0.006). This occurred irrespective of whether they underwent additional radiological imaging on the day of initial evaluation: 39 of the 90 patients (43%).

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^112EpQGz]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: In this study, relying solely on clinical diagnosis would have led to a high number of false positive urgent diagnoses. Conversely, using ultrasonography as the only imaging investigation would have resulted in an unacceptably high number of missed urgent conditions. In comparison, computed tomography (CT) following clinical evaluation demonstrated better accuracy. The use of CT, conditional on a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography result, showed the highest sensitivity for detecting urgent conditions and minimized overall radiation exposure. Utilizing imaging based on patients' characteristics or location of pain would have decreased accuracy compared to the conditional CT strategy.

- **Potential limitations**: We acknowledge several potential limitations of this analysis. The study design, involving a comprehensive diagnostic investigation in all enrolled patients with carefully collected data and a diagnosis assigned after each step, permitted the comparisons presented here without conducting a randomized clinical trial with 11 groups. Our approach enabled a comparison of imaging strategies but did not allow direct evaluation of the effects of imaging on patients' management and outcomes. In this study, management decisions after completing the diagnostic protocol were consistently based on the results of all diagnostic tests.

This study included a pre-imaging selection of patients, which should be considered when attempting to generalize the results. Most patients were referred to the emergency department by general practitioners, and patients discharged without imaging from the emergency department were not included in the analysis.
