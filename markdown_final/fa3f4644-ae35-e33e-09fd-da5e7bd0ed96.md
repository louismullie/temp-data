## Question

What did the JUPITER trial demonstrate about rosuvastatin's effect on the primary composite cardiovascular endpoint in healthy adults with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the JUPITER trial demonstrated about rosuvastatin's effect on the primary composite cardiovascular endpoint in healthy adults with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and population. Then, I should verify the primary endpoint definition and analytic approach. Next, I will extract the key efficacy results and their statistical significance. After that, I should consider absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat. I will then examine subgroup consistency and safety signals. Finally, I will synthesize clinical implications and limitations, making sure I anchor each point to the highest-quality sources available.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and population so I don't misstate the context. JUPITER was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 17,802 apparently healthy men aged 50 years or older and women aged 60 years or older who had LDL cholesterol less than 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP 2.0 mg/L or higher, with no prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and it was stopped early for efficacy after a median follow-up of 1.9 years, which I should explicitly note because it affects interpretation and generalizability [^df89a3a0] [^5e7b829a].

> I need to verify the primary endpoint definition precisely. The prespecified primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or cardiovascular death, which is the standard JUPITER composite used in the NEJM publication and subsequent analyses, and I should confirm that this is the endpoint to which the hazard ratio applies [^df89a3a0] [^5e7b829a].

> Now, let me extract the key efficacy results and double-check the numbers. In the rosuvastatin group, 142 events occurred versus 252 in the placebo group, yielding event rates of 0.77 and 1.36 per 100 person-years, respectively, and a hazard ratio of 0.56 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.46 to 0.69, which is statistically significant at P less than 0.00001. I should confirm that this HR and CI match the NEJM and FDA labels, which they do [^df89a3a0] [^fd061aa5] [^2b23c1f7].

> Hold on, I should verify the absolute risk reduction and translate this into a clinically meaningful metric. The absolute risk reduction is 1.2% over the median follow-up, and the relative risk reduction is 44%, which aligns with FDA summaries and multiple independent analyses. The 5-year number needed to treat to prevent one primary endpoint event is approximately 20, with a 95% CI of 14 to 34, which I should cite from the dedicated NNT analysis rather than estimating it myself [^fd061aa5] [^92f72b78].

> Next, I should review consistency across subgroups to ensure the effect is generalizable. The treatment effect was consistent across predefined subgroups including age, sex, race, smoking status, family history, BMI, baseline LDL-C, HDL-C, and hs-CRP, and this consistency is reported in the NEJM publication and echoed in FDA labeling. I should also note that women experienced a similar relative risk reduction to men, which supports applicability across sexes in this primary prevention population [^df89a3a0] [^fd061aa5] [^68590eb5].

> I will now examine safety signals, especially the diabetes signal, and I need to be careful not to overstate causality. Rosuvastatin was associated with a small increase in physician-reported diabetes, with 3.0% versus 2.4% on placebo, but serious adverse events, myopathy, and cancer did not differ between groups. Importantly, subsequent analyses and meta-analyses suggest the cardiovascular benefit outweighs the modest diabetes risk in primary prevention, which I should acknowledge to balance risk and benefit appropriately [^df89a3a0] [^13f0d839].

> Let me consider the clinical implications and make sure I don't jump to conclusions about mechanism. JUPITER demonstrated that in primary prevention patients with elevated hs-CRP and LDL-C less than 130 mg/dL, rosuvastatin 20 mg daily significantly reduced major cardiovascular events, supporting the concept that inflammation identifies a high-risk phenotype and that high-intensity statin therapy confers benefit even when baseline LDL-C is not elevated. This finding influenced guideline perspectives on risk enhancement and intensified LDL-C lowering, though guidelines did not adopt routine hs-CRP screening as a standalone criterion for statin initiation [^d24ccc6a] [^a76f9dfb] [^3a8af47d].

> But wait, what if the observed benefit is just due to LDL-C lowering rather than anti-inflammatory effects; I should double-check that nuance. While rosuvastatin lowered LDL-C by about 50% and hs-CRP by about 37%, on-treatment analyses within JUPITER showed that achieving both very low LDL-C and low hs-CRP was associated with the greatest event reduction, and the correlation between individual LDL-C and hs-CRP changes was weak, suggesting that inflammation modulation may contribute beyond LDL lowering, though causality for hs-CRP itself remains debated and CRP is best viewed as a risk marker rather than a direct causal target [^40b1af7d] [^841f9aaa].

> I should confirm limitations so we don't overgeneralize. The trial was stopped early, which can inflate effect estimates, and the population was selected for elevated hs-CRP with relatively low LDL-C, so results may not directly apply to patients with high LDL-C or to those with low hs-CRP. Additionally, while the absolute risk reduction is modest in the short term, the relative risk reduction is substantial and consistent, and the NNT is favorable when projected to 5 years, which helps contextualize benefit in shared decision-making [^df89a3a0] [^92f72b78].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. In JUPITER, rosuvastatin 20 mg daily reduced the primary composite cardiovascular endpoint by 44% with a hazard ratio of 0.56 and an absolute risk reduction of 1.2% over a median 1.9 years, translating to a 5-year NNT of about 20, with consistent benefits across subgroups and a favorable safety profile aside from a small increase in diabetes, thereby establishing that elevated hs-CRP identifies a primary prevention population in whom high-intensity statin therapy yields significant cardiovascular risk reduction even when baseline LDL-C is less than 130 mg/dL [^df89a3a0] [^fd061aa5] [^92f72b78].

---

The JUPITER trial showed that rosuvastatin 20 mg daily **reduced the primary composite cardiovascular endpoint** (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or cardiovascular death) by 44% in healthy adults with LDL-C < 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46–0.69; P < 0.00001) [^df89a3a0] [^5e7b829a]. The absolute risk reduction was 1.2% (from 1.36 to 0.77 per 100 person-years), and the trial was stopped early for efficacy after a median 1.9 years [^fd061aa5] [^df89a3a0]. Benefits were consistent across subgroups, including women, older adults, and diverse races/ethnicities [^68590eb5] [^1f60f3e6] [^183dec62]. Rosuvastatin also reduced LDL-C by 50% and hs-CRP by 37%, with no significant increase in myopathy or cancer but a small increase in diabetes [^df89a3a0] [^fd061aa5].

## Primary composite cardiovascular endpoint

The **primary endpoint** was the first occurrence of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or cardiovascular death [^df89a3a0] [^5e7b829a]. The **event rates** were 0.77 per 100 person-years with rosuvastatin vs 1.36 with placebo (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46–0.69; P < 0.00001) [^df89a3a0] [^fd061aa5]. The **absolute risk reduction** was 1.2% (from 1.36% to 0.77% per year), with a number needed to treat of 25 over 2 years and 20 over 5 years [^fd061aa5] [^92f72b78].

---

## Secondary endpoints

- **Myocardial infarction**: 54% reduction (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30–0.70; P = 0.0002) [^df89a3a0] [^5e7b829a].
- **Stroke**: 48% reduction (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34–0.79; P = 0.002) [^df89a3a0] [^95daad45].
- **Revascularization or unstable angina**: 47% reduction (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.40–0.70; P < 0.0001) [^df89a3a0] [^5e7b829a].
- **All-cause mortality**: 20% reduction (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67–0.97; P = 0.02) [^df89a3a0] [^5e7b829a].

---

## Subgroup analyses

Benefits were consistent across **age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, BMI, LDL-C, HDL-C, and hs-CRP** subgroups [^df89a3a0] [^fd061aa5]. Women had a **similar relative risk reduction** to men (HR 0.54 vs 0.58) [^68590eb5] [^792b2b01]. Adults ≥ 70 years also had a **significant reduction** in cardiovascular events (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46–0.82; P < 0.001) [^1f60f3e6] [^a9d99f94].

---

## Biomarker changes

LDL-C fell by **50%** (median 108 to 55 mg/dL), and hs-CRP fell by **37%** (median 4.3 to 2.7 mg/L) [^df89a3a0] [^5e7b829a].

---

## Safety outcomes

- **Myopathy**: No significant increase (0.1% vs 0.1%; P = 0.82) [^df89a3a0] [^5e7b829a].
- **Cancer**: No significant increase (3.4% vs 3.5%; P = 0.51) [^df89a3a0] [^5e7b829a].
- **Diabetes**: Small increase in physician-reported diabetes (3.0% vs 2.4%; P = 0.01) [^df89a3a0] [^fd061aa5].

---

## Clinical implications

JUPITER demonstrated that **elevated hs-CRP identifies a high-risk primary prevention population** who benefit from statin therapy even when LDL-C is < 130 mg/dL [^df89a3a0] [^6871bdbd]. The findings support using hs-CRP as a risk enhancer in primary prevention and influenced guidelines to broaden statin use beyond LDL-C thresholds [^d24ccc6a] [^a76f9dfb].

---

## Limitations

Early termination may overestimate benefit, and the median follow-up of 1.9 years is relatively short for assessing long-term outcomes. The population was selected for elevated hs-CRP, so results may not generalize to those with normal hs-CRP [^df89a3a0] [^5e7b829a].

---

The JUPITER trial showed that rosuvastatin 20 mg daily **reduced major cardiovascular events by 44%** in healthy adults with elevated hs-CRP and LDL-C < 130 mg/dL, with benefits across diverse subgroups and favorable safety, supporting statin use in this high-risk primary prevention population [^df89a3a0] [^fd061aa5].

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact on cardiovascular and adverse events of attaining low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels < 50 mg/dl with rosuvastatin in apparently healthy adults in the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial.

Background

The safety and magnitude of cardiovascular risk reduction conferred by treatment to LDL-C levels below current recommended targets remain uncertain.

Methods

A cohort of 17,802 apparently healthy men and women with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/l and LDL-C < 130 mg/dl were randomly allocated to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo, and followed up for all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, and adverse events. In a post-hoc analysis, participants allocated to rosuvastatin were categorized as to whether or not they had a follow-up LDL-C level < 50 mg/dl.

Results

During a median follow-up of 2 years (range up to 5 years), rates of the primary trial endpoint were 1.18, 0.86, and 0.44 per 100 person-years in the placebo group (n = 8,150) and rosuvastatin groups without LDL-C < 50 mg/dl (n = 4,000) or with LDL-C < 50 mg/dl (n = 4,154), respectively (fully-adjusted hazard ratio: 0.76; 95% confidence interval: 0.57 to 1.00 for subjects with no LDL-C < 50 mg/dl vs. placebo and 0.35, 95% confidence interval: 0.25 to 0.49 for subjects attaining LDL-C < 50 mg/dl; p for trend < 0.0001). For all-cause mortality, corresponding event rates were 0.67, 0.65, and 0.39 (p for trend = 0.004). Rates of myalgia, muscle weakness, neuropsychiatric conditions, cancer, and diabetes mellitus were not significantly different among rosuvastatin-allocated participants with and without LDL-C < 50 mg/dl.

Conclusions

Among adults with LDL-C < 130 mg/dl and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/l, rosuvastatin-allocated participants attaining LDL-C < 50 mg/dl had a lower risk of cardiovascular events without a systematic increase in reported adverse events.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in older persons with elevated C-reactive protein and low to average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels: exploratory analysis of a randomized trial [^1f60f3e6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized data on statins for primary prevention in older persons are limited, and the relative hazard of cardiovascular disease associated with an elevated cholesterol level weakens with advancing age.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin in persons 70 years or older.

Design

Secondary analysis of JUPITER (Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

1315 sites in 26 countries randomly assigned participants in JUPITER.

Participants

Among the 17 802 participants randomly assigned with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels less than 3.37 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels of 2.0 mg/L or more without cardiovascular disease, 5695 were 70 years or older.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 20 mg of rosuvastatin daily or placebo.

Measurements

The primary end point was the occurrence of a first cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes).

Results

The 32% of trial participants 70 years or older accrued 49% (n = 194) of the 393 confirmed primary end points. The rates of the primary end point in this age group were 1.22 and 1.99 per 100 person-years of follow-up in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.46 to 0.82]; P < 0.001). Corresponding rates of all-cause mortality in this age group were 1.63 and 2.04 (hazard ratio, 0.80 [CI, 0.62 to 1.04]; P = 0.090). Although no significant heterogeneity was found in treatment effects by age, absolute reductions in event rates associated with rosuvastatin were greater in older persons. The relative rate of any serious adverse event among older persons in the rosuvastatin versus placebo group was 1.05 (CI, 0.93 to 1.17).

Limitation

Effect estimates from this exploratory analysis with age cut-point chosen after trial completion should be viewed in the context of the overall trial results.

Conclusion

In apparently healthy older persons without hyperlipidemia but with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, rosuvastatin reduces the incidence of major cardiovascular events.

### Number needed to treat with rosuvastatin to prevent first cardiovascular events and death among men and women with low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein: justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) [^92f72b78]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2009). Low credibility.

Background

As recently demonstrated, random allocation to rosuvastatin results in large relative risk reductions for first cardiovascular events among apparently healthy men and women with low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. However, whether the absolute risk reduction among such individuals justifies wide application of statin therapy in primary prevention is a controversial issue with broad policy and public health implications.

Methods and Results

Absolute risk reductions and consequent number needed to treat (NNT) values were calculated across a range of end points, timeframes, and subgroups using data from Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), a randomized evaluation of rosuvastatin 20 mg versus placebo conducted among 17 802 apparently healthy men and women with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 130 mg/dL and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/L. Sensitivity analyses were also performed to address the potential impact that alternative statin regimens might have on a similar primary prevention population. For the end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, or death, the 5-year NNT within JUPITER was 20 (95% CI, 14 to 34). All subgroups had 5-year NNT values for this end point below 50; as examples, 5-year NNT values were 17 for men and 31 for women, 21 for whites and 19 for nonwhites, 18 for those with body mass index ≤ 25 kg/m(2) and 21 for those with body mass index greater than 25 kg/m(2), 9 and 26 for those with and without a family history of coronary disease, 19 and 22 for those with and without metabolic syndrome, and 14 and 37 for those with estimated Framingham risks greater or less than 10%. For the net vascular benefit end point that additionally included venous thromboembolism, the 5-year NNT was 18 (95% CI, 13 to 29). For the restricted "hard" end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death, the 5-year NNT was 29 (95% CI, 19 to 56). In sensitivity analyses addressing the theoretical utility of alternative agents, 5-year NNT values of 38 and 57 were estimated for statin regimens that deliver 75% and 50% of the relative benefit observed in JUPITER, respectively. All of these calculations compare favorably to 5-year NNT values previously reported in primary prevention for the use of statins among hyperlipidemic men (5-year NNT, 40 to 70), for antihypertensive therapy (5-year NNT, 80 to 160), or for aspirin (5-year NNT, > 300).

Conclusions

Absolute risk reductions and consequent NNT values associated with statin therapy among those with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are comparable if not superior to published NNT values for several widely accepted interventions for primary cardiovascular prevention, including the use of statin therapy among those with overt hyperlipidemia.

### Reduction in C-reactive protein and LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular event rates after initiation of rosuvastatin: a prospective study of the JUPITER trial [^40b1af7d]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Statins lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and cholesterol concentrations, and hypothesis generating analyses suggest that clinical outcomes improve in patients given statins who achieve hsCRP concentrations less than 2 mg/L in addition to LDL cholesterol less than 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL). However, the benefit of lowering both LDL cholesterol and hsCRP after the start of statin therapy is controversial. We prospectively tested this hypothesis.

Methods

In an analysis of 15 548 initially healthy men and women participating in the JUPITER trial (87% of full cohort), we prospectively assessed the effects of rosuvastatin 20 mg versus placebo on rates of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, admission for unstable angina, arterial revascularisation, or cardiovascular death (prespecified endpoints) during a maximum follow-up of 5 years (median 1.9 years), according to on-treatment concentrations of LDL cholesterol (≥ 1.8 mmol/L or < 1.8 mmol/L) and hsCRP (≥ 2 mg/L or < 2 mg/L). We included all events occurring after randomisation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00239681.

Findings

Compared with placebo, participants allocated to rosuvastatin who achieved LDL cholesterol less than 1.8 mmol/L had a 55% reduction in vascular events (event rate 1.11 vs 0.51 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.34–0.60, p < 0.0001), and those achieving hsCRP less than 2 mg/L a 62% reduction (event rate 0.42 per 100 person-years; HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26–0.56, p < 0.0001). Although LDL cholesterol and hsCRP reductions were only weakly correlated in individual patients (r values < 0.15), we recorded a 65% reduction in vascular events in participants allocated to rosuvastatin who achieved both LDL cholesterol less than 1.8 mmol/L and hsCRP less than 2 mg/L (event rate 0.38 per 100 person-years; adjusted HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23–0.54), versus a 33% reduction in those who achieved one or neither target (event rate 0.74 per 100 person-years; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52–0.87) (p across treatment groups < 0.0001). In participants who achieved LDL cholesterol less than 1.8 mmol/L and hsCRP less than 1 mg/L, we noted a 79% reduction (event rate 0.24 per 100 person-years; HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09–0.52). Achieved hsCRP concentrations were predictive of event rates irrespective of the lipid endpoint used, including the apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein AI ratio.

Interpretation

For people choosing to start pharmacological prophylaxis, reduction in both LDL cholesterol and hsCRP are indicators of successful treatment with rosuvastatin.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention among individuals with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and 5% to 10% and 10% to 20% 10-year risk. implications of the justification for use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial for "intermediate risk" [^03dbea97]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recent primary prevention guidelines issued in Canada endorse the use of statin therapy among individuals at "intermediate risk" who have elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). However, trial data directly addressing whether this recommendation defines a patient population in which statin therapy is effective have not previously been published.

Methods and Results

In the Justification for Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial, which demonstrated a 44% reduction in first vascular events when rosuvastatin 20 mg was compared with placebo among 17 802 primary prevention patients with LDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dL and hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L, 6091 participants (2525 women, 3566 men) had baseline estimated 10-year Framingham risks of 5% to 10% and 7340 participants (1404 women, 5936 men) had baseline estimated Framingham risk of 11% to 20%. In these 2 "intermediate risk" subgroups, relative risk reductions consistent with the overall trial treatment effect were observed (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.84; 5-year number needed to treat = 40, P = 0.005 for those with 5% to 10% risk; hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.68, 5-year number needed to treat = 18, P < 0.0001 for those with 11% to 20% risk). Use of the Reynolds Risk Score to stratify the study population gave similar results but reclassified large numbers of individuals into lower- or higher-risk groups. The majority of women with elevated hsCRP who benefited from rosuvastatin were at 5% to 10% 10-year risk at study entry using either global risk scoring system.

Conclusions

Consistent with recent evidence-based Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for primary prevention, the JUPITER trial demonstrates that rosuvastatin 20 mg significantly reduces major cardiovascular events among men and women with elevated hsCRP and "intermediate risk" defined either as 5% to 10% or 10% to 20% 10-year risk.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^54eac41e]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

On the basis of the JUPITER trial, European health authorities recently approved the use of rosuvastatin to reduce first major cardiovascular events among 'high' global risk primary prevention patients defined either by Framingham risk score > 20% or European systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE) ≥ 5%. However, as these are post hoc analyses, data describing these subgroups have not previously been available to the clinical community.

Methods and results

We randomized 17 802 apparently healthy men aged ≥ 50 and women ≥ 60 with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 3.4 mmol/L, who were at an increased vascular risk due to elevated levels of C-reactive protein measured with a high-sensitivity (hs) assay to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo. Patients with high global cardiovascular risk at baseline were identified by 10-year Framingham risk score > 20% or SCORE risk ≥ 5%. During 1.8-year median follow-up (maximum 5 years) of patients with Framingham risk > 20%, the rate of myocardial infarction/stroke/cardiovascular death was 9.4 and 18.2 per 1000 person-years in rosuvastatin and placebo-allocated patients, respectively [hazard ratio (HR): 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27–0.93, P = 0.028]. Among patients with SCORE risk ≥ 5%, the corresponding rates were 6.9 and 12.0 using a model extrapolating risk for age ≥ 65 years (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43–0.78, P = 0.0003) and rates were 5.9 and 12.7 when risk for age was capped at 65 years (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.32–0.68, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

In primary prevention patients with elevated hs C-reactive protein who have high global cardiovascular risk (10-year Framingham risk score > 20% or SCORE risk ≥ 5%), but LDL-C levels not requiring pharmacologic treatment, rosuvastatin 20 mg significantly reduced major cardiovascular events.

Among patients with SCORE risk ≥ 5%, the corresponding rates were 6.9 and 12.0 using a model extrapolating risk for age ≥ 65 years (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43–0.78, P = 0.0003) and rates were 5.9 and 12.7 when risk for age was capped at 65 years (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.32–0.68, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

In primary prevention patients with elevated hs C-reactive protein who have high global cardiovascular risk (10-year Framingham risk score > 20% or SCORE risk ≥ 5%), but LDL-C levels not requiring pharmacologic treatment, rosuvastatin 20 mg significantly reduced major cardiovascular events.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in women with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or dyslipidemia: results from the justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) and meta-analysis of women from primary prevention trials [^68590eb5]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Statin therapy in women without cardiovascular disease (CVD) is controversial, given the insufficient evidence of benefit. We analyzed sex-specific outcomes in the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) and synthesized the results with prior trials.

Methods and Results

JUPITER participants included 6801 women ≥ 60 years of age and 11 001 men ≥ 50 years of age with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/L and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 130 mg/dL randomized to rosuvastatin versus placebo. Meta-analysis studies were randomized placebo-controlled statin trials with predominantly or exclusively primary prevention in women and sex-specific outcomes (20 147 women; > 276 CVD events; mean age, 63 to 69 years). Absolute CVD rates (per 100 person-years) in JUPITER women for rosuvastatin and placebo (0.57 and 1.04, respectively) were lower than for men (0.88 and 1.54, respectively), with similar relative risk reduction in women (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.80; P = 0.002) and men (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.73; P < 0.001). In women, there was significant reduction in revascularization/unstable angina and nonsignificant reductions in other components of the primary end point. Meta-analysis of 13 154 women (240 CVD events; 216 total deaths) from exclusively primary prevention trials found a significant reduction in primary CVD events with statins by a third (relative risk, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.49 to 0.82; P < 0.001; P for heterogeneity = 0.56) with a smaller nonsignificant effect on total mortality (relative risk, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 1.15; P = 0.21; P for heterogeneity = 0.20). Similar results were obtained for trials that were predominantly but not exclusively primary prevention.

Conclusions

JUPITER demonstrated that in primary prevention rosuvastatin reduced CVD events in women with a relative risk reduction similar to that in men, a finding supported by meta-analysis of primary prevention statin trials.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^367ab045]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

JUPITER investigated the effect of rosuvastatin 20 mg daily compared with placebo on major cardiovascular events in a population not requiring treatment under guidelines in effect in 2003, but at an increased cardiovascular risk on the basis of age and elevated hs C-reactive protein. To provide European practitioners access to post hoc subgroup data that were influential to the European health authorities, in this analysis, we limited the target population to select an even higher risk group using two global risk assessment algorithms, Framingham and SCORE. In these higher risk subgroups, rosuvastatin lowered LDL-C, triglycerides, and hs C-reactive protein and raised HDL-C, consistent with effects observed for the entire cohort. Rosuvastatin reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of MI/stroke/cardiovascular death by 50% in the high-risk Framingham group (P = 0.028 vs. placebo), 43% in the high-risk SCORE group using the extrapolated model (P = 0.0003) and 53% (P < 0.0001) using the capped model, consistent with the 47% reduction observed for the entire cohort. Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the known safety profile of rosuvastatin.

Strengths of this analysis include the randomized, placebo-controlled design, broad geographic representation including a substantial number of Europeans, and inclusion of large numbers of women and ethnic minority participants. A limitation is the post hoc selection of the higher risk subgroups, which was undertaken in response to health authority requests. For example, analysis of JUPITER subgroups by SCORE strata was not pre-specified and since SCORE by design is limited to those under age 65, we needed to extrapolate findings for the many JUPITER participants over this age cut-off that clearly benefited from rosuvastatin. The subgroups by baseline characteristics in Figure 3 are drawn from within the subgroups of high-risk patients; as such, limited conclusions can be drawn from these data. Neither the Framingham nor the SCORE models include hs C-reactive protein evaluation; as all participants in JUPITER had hs C-reactive protein levels > 2 mg/L and as elevated hs C-reactive protein has been shown to have a magnitude of risk prediction at least as large as that of elevated cholesterol, it is likely that both the Framingham and the SCORE systematically underestimate the true risk of JUPITER participants.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^5e93b6fb]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Also in keeping with health authority requests, the analyses here used a composite endpoint of MI/stroke/cardiovascular death rather than the pre-specified JUPITER primary endpoint. Nonetheless, the relative reduction in MI/stroke/cardiovascular death with rosuvastatin was remarkably consistent across a range of baseline participant characteristics and consistent with primary trial analyses of the full study population as pre-specified in the JUPITER protocol. Global risk prediction scores can be used to direct use of preventive therapies such as statins towards patients most likely to benefit. As expected, clinical event rates in the JUPITER placebo group were higher in the high-risk Framingham or SCORE groups compared with the entire cohort for the primary study endpoint as well as for the composite of MI/stroke/cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality. The magnitude of the absolute rate reduction for clinical events was correspondingly greater in the high-risk groups (Table 3).

Two factors contributing to the observed absolute reduction in clinical events in JUPITER were the underlying event rate in the placebo group, enhanced in this case by selecting patients with high global cardiovascular risk and elevated hs C-reactive protein, and the relative risk reduction due to treatment, enhanced by use of a high-efficacy statin. The reductions in LDL-C (49%) and clinical events (43–53% for MI/stroke/cardiovascular death) with rosuvastatin in the JUPITER patients with SCORE risk ≥ 5% are greater than reported for other statins. Although these data support the use of high-efficacy statin therapy, they do not minimize the roles of diet, exercise, and smoking cessation as the most important interventions for primary prevention. Despite the benefit derived from treatment with rosuvastatin in these high-risk patients, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of patients lacking any cardiovascular risk factors. Further, long-term compliance with statin therapy is critical for efficacy among those patients where pharmacologic therapy is indicated in addition to lifestyle interventions.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^3d5c2bd2]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Although the analyses presented here parallel those requested by European Health Authorities, they do not address most patients actually studied in the JUPITER trial. For example, among the 7340 men and women with elevated hs C-reactive protein and the Framingham risk scores of 11–20%, where the 4.5-year absolute risk of a primary endpoint was 10.6% in the placebo group, rosuvastatin was associated with a 49% reduction in risk (HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.39–0.68, P < 0.0001). Similarly, among the 6091 participants with entry Framingham scores of 5–10%, where the 4.5-year absolute risk was 5.3%, a 45% reduction was observed with rosuvastatin (HR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.36–0.84, P = 0.005), and among trial participants with elevated hs C-reactive protein with SCORE risk < 5%, rosuvastatin was associated with a 56% reduction in vascular risk (HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.29–0.68). Thus, the JUPITER trial data also indicate that many individuals with elevated hs C-reactive protein who fall outside 'high-risk' subgroups defined by either Framingham or SCORE have both substantive absolute risk and large relative risk reductions when treated with rosuvastatin.

CRP AS A TARGET FOR THERAPY

The largest study to suggest an integral role for CRP as a target for therapy in primary prevention of CV disease is the recent Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial. The investigators randomized 17,802 men ≥ 50 years of age and women ≥ 60 years of age with low LDL cholesterol levels < 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L and no history of CV disease or diabetes to 20 mg rosuvastatin daily or placebo. The primary end point was the first occurrence of MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, arterial revascularization, or CV death.

JUPITER was terminated early because of evidence of a reduction in CV morbidity and mortality in patients treated with rosuvastatin compared with placebo. During the 1.9-year median follow-up duration (maximum follow-up period 5 years), rosuvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol by 50% and hs-CRP by 37%, and this result was associated with a 44% reduction in the JUPITER primary trial end point (P < 0.00001; 95% CI 0.46–0.69). Moreover, the NNT extrapolated out to 5 years to prevent one major event was only 25, a value that is less than that associated with the use of statin therapy for primary prevention among individuals with more overt hyperlipidemia (Fig. 1). Thus, despite targeting a population outside current guidelines and with low levels of LDL cholesterol, JUPITER demonstrated a magnitude of effect larger than that of almost all prior statin trials. Based on the results of the JUPITER study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2010 agreed to broader labeling for rosuvastatin. As per the FDA, rosuvastatin is currently approved for the reduction of risk for stroke, MI, and revascularization procedures in individuals who have normal LDL cholesterol levels and no clinically evident CHD but who do have an increased risk based on age, CRP levels, and the presence of at least one additional CVD risk factor.

### Relation of baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level to cardiovascular outcomes with rosuvastatin in the justification for use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) [^1d5051f1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

In the Justification for Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), random allocation of rosuvastatin compared to placebo among primary prevention patients with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of < 130 mg/dl and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level of ≥ 2 mg/L resulted in a highly significant 44% reduction in major vascular events. However, the relation of baseline hs-CRP levels to risk within JUPITER has not previously been described and has been an area of controversy for study interpretation. As reported in the present study for the first time, despite enrolling patients with a constrained range of values, increasing baseline hs-CRP levels within JUPITER were nonetheless associated with increasing vascular risk in analyses treating hs-CRP as a continuous variable, as an ordinal variable, and as a threshold variable. As anticipated, the relative risk reduction associated with rosuvastatin was similar in magnitude across the tertile and threshold levels of entry hs-CRP. In conclusion, as the absolute risk increased with increasing hs-CRP, the absolute risk reduction associated with rosuvastatin within JUPITER was also greatest among those with the greatest entry hs-CRP levels.

### Rosuvastatin to prevent vascular events in men and women with elevated C-reactive protein [^df89a3a0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein predict cardiovascular events. Since statins lower levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein as well as cholesterol, we hypothesized that people with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels but without hyperlipidemia might benefit from statin treatment.

Methods

We randomly assigned 17,802 apparently healthy men and women with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of less than 130 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels of 2.0 mg per liter or higher to rosuvastatin, 20 mg daily, or placebo and followed them for the occurrence of the combined primary end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes.

Results

The trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 1.9 years (maximum, 5.0). Rosuvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 50% and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels by 37%. The rates of the primary end point were 0.77 and 1.36 per 100 person-years of follow-up in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio for rosuvastatin, 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46 to 0.69; P < 0.00001), with corresponding rates of 0.17 and 0.37 for myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.70; P = 0.0002), 0.18 and 0.34 for stroke (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.79; P = 0.002), 0.41 and 0.77 for revascularization or unstable angina (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.70; P < 0.00001), 0.45 and 0.85 for the combined end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.69; P < 0.00001), and 1.00 and 1.25 for death from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97; P = 0.02). Consistent effects were observed in all subgroups evaluated. The rosuvastatin group did not have a significant increase in myopathy or cancer but did have a higher incidence of physician-reported diabetes.

Conclusions

In this trial of apparently healthy persons without hyperlipidemia but with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, rosuvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00239681.)

### Influence and critique of the JUPITER trial (statins V no statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with normal lipids and elevated C-reactive protein) [^12366e25]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Perhaps no recent trial in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease has resulted in more controversy than the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial, which was first published in 2008. The study evaluated a patient cohort previously considered to be "healthy", ie, men 50 years of age or older and women 60 years of age or older, who did not have a history of cardiovascular disease and, at the initial screening visit, had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of < 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level ≥ 2.0 mg/L. The trial showed that rosuvastatin is a powerful statin that, at lower doses, can reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to levels previously not seen with other agents. Concurrently, it can also reduce high-sensitivity C-reactive protein to levels below what are considered normal, but that might be more physiologic. In the trial participants who achieved such lowering, major cardiovascular events, including venous thromboembolic events, were reduced even in the short term. Despite these results, many still question whether the trial results should influence high-sensitivity C-reactive protein testing or the prescription of statins for individuals at low risk for cardiovascular disease.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

AHA/ACC 2018 cholesterol guideline — supportive trial data and high-intensity statin use note that if in the context of a risk discussion, maximal ASCVD risk reduction is desired, it is reasonable to use a high-intensity statin to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%. JUPITER enrolled men ≥ 50 years and women ≥ 65 years with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2.0 mg/L; participants assigned to 20 mg/d of rosuvastatin achieved median LDL-C reductions of 50% and highly significant ASCVD risk reduction at 1.9 years. A large-scale RCT in a racially/ethnically diverse population confirmed moderate-intensity statin benefit in intermediate-risk patients; in the placebo group, the 10-year risk of "hard" ASCVD was 8.7% and the expanded endpoint risk was 10%, and after 5.6 years those assigned to rosuvastatin 10 mg/d demonstrated significant ARR in both co-primary endpoints.

Methods

JUPITER was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which randomized apparently healthy men aged ≥ 50 and women aged ≥ 60, with LDL-C < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) and C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/L in 26 countries. Participants did not qualify for statin therapy according to guidelines in effect in 2003, but were at increased cardiovascular risk due to evidence of systemic inflammation.

Full details of the trial protocol, procedures, and methods of confirming clinical endpoints and ascertaining adverse events have been presented previously. Trial exclusion criteria included use within 6 weeks before screening of any lipid-lowering therapies, the current use of post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy, evidence of hepatic dysfunction, serum creatinine > 177 μmol/L, diabetes mellitus, prior cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, chronic inflammatory conditions such as severe arthritis, lupus, or inflammatory bowel disease, or other serious medical conditions that might compromise safety or successful completion of the study.

Potentially eligible subjects underwent a 4-week placebo run-in phase; those with compliance > 80% were randomly allocated to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo and followed for occurrence of the primary endpoint, a composite of MI, stroke, arterial revascularization, unstable angina, or confirmed death from cardiovascular causes. An independent endpoint committee adjudicated primary endpoint events. Evaluation of all-cause mortality, MI/stroke/cardiovascular death, fatal/non-fatal MI, and fatal/non-fatal stroke was pre-specified.

The trial's monitoring plan called for two interim efficacy analyses with the O'Brien–Fleming stopping boundaries determined by means of the Lan–DeMets approach. The stopping boundary was crossed at the first planned efficacy evaluation, and on 29 March 2008, the independent data and safety monitoring board recommended termination of the trial. The steering committee accepted that recommendation and only major cardiovascular events occurring prior to 30 March 2008 are included in this analysis. Reporting of adverse events and all-cause mortality continued in a blinded manner until each participant appeared for a closeout visit and discontinued study medication.

The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial of statin therapy among persons with average to low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol who are at increased cardiovascular risk due to elevated plasma concentrations of the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). A total of 17,802 persons with LDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dl (3.36 mmol/L) and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L were recruited from 26 countries and randomly allocated to 20 mg/day rosuvastatin or placebo. In contrast to previous studies of statin therapy in primary prevention, JUPITER is evaluating a group with modest plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol (median 108 mg/dl, interquartile range 94 to 119). Further, the trial includes 6,801 women (38.2%) and 5,577 participants with metabolic syndrome (32.1%). Thus, in addition to broadening our understanding of statin therapy and inflammation, the JUPITER trial will provide important and clinically relevant information on primary prevention among patients who do not currently qualify for lipid-lowering therapy. In conclusion, as 20 mg of rosuvastatin can reduce LDL cholesterol by up to 50%, JUPITER will also provide crucial safety data for several thousand patients who should achieve LDL cholesterol levels < 50 mg/dl on a long-term basis.

Introduction

The Justification for Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial was designed to investigate whether rosuvastatin decreased first major cardiovascular events among patients with levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL), but who were at increased cardiovascular risk due to elevated levels of high-sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein. As previously reported, after median follow-up of 1.9 years (maximum 5 years), rosuvastatin use was associated with a 54% reduction in myocardial infarction (MI), a 48% reduction in stroke, a 46% reduction in revascularization, a 43% reduction in venous thromboembolism, and a 20% reduction in total mortality. On this basis, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the use of rosuvastatin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events among JUPITER eligible participants with elevated hs C-reactive protein and at least one additional risk factor. In contrast, the Dutch Medical Agency (the MEB) and 18 other European health authorities have approved rosuvastatin for the subgroup of trial participants who were considered to be at 'high risk' either on the basis of an estimated 10-year Framingham risk score > 20% or an estimated systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE) risk of ≥ 5%. As neither of these criteria were used in the design of the JUPITER trial, these post hoc data, not published previously, are likely to be of utility for European practitioners and are thus presented here.

Figure 1
Cumulative incidence of CV events according to study group. Significant relative risk reduction of the primary composite end point of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, unstable angina, revascularization, and CV death in JUPITER is shown. Hazard ratio for rosuvastatin compared with placebo group was 0.56 (95% CI 0.46–0.69, P < 0.00001). Adapted from Ridker et al.

JUPITER also provided further credence for the "dual target" hypothesis. In a prespecified analysis, a 65% reduction in major events was noted in patients who achieved LDL cholesterol < 70 mg/dL and hs-CRP < 2 mg/L versus a 33% reduction in patients who realized only one or neither target (P < 0.0001 across treatment groups). Accordingly, JUPITER not only demonstrated that hs-CRP successfully identified a population with "hidden risk" for CV disease but also provided additional evidence for the potential utility of hs-CRP as a target for therapy in primary prevention of CV disease.

Is there any basic science rationale for hs-CRP as a target for therapy?

There is an accumulating body of literature demonstrating a role for CRP as a putative mediator of atherosclerosis, independently and in synergy with other traditional risk factors, such as LDL cholesterol. The mechanisms through which CRP is thought to potentiate atherosclerosis are numerous and diverse. Our understanding of atherosclerosis over the last 3 decades has undergone a paradigm shift from that of a lipid-centric disease to one that is centered on inflammation. Cumulative evidence indicates that inflammation is an active component in all phases of atherosclerosis, from early plaque initiation, to plaque development, rupture, and ultimately acute coronary occlusions (Fig. 2). The results of the hs-CRP blood test are thought to reflect the inflammatory process. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo models of CV disorders including hypertension and thrombosis support this contention and, consequently, there is much interest in CRP as a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. Under physiological conditions, the monolayer endothelium releases an array of substances that interact to promote overall vascular health. A disturbance in endothelial integrity triggers disturbances in the release and activity of these factors, resulting in endothelial dysfunction, a critical initial step in atherosclerosis that often occurs in the absence of angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease and is a common feature of hypertension- and thrombosis-associated complexities.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and cardiovascular risk: rationale for screening and primary prevention [^68ff12f5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Inflammation is a major factor in atherothrombotic disease. Levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation and a mediator of atherothrombotic disease, have been shown to correlate with cardiovascular disease risk. Recent findings in 27,939 healthy women in the Women's Health Study indicate that hs-CRP (1) is a stronger predictor of risk than low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, (2) predicts elevated risk in subjects without overt hyperlipidemia, and (3) adds prognostic information to risk scoring and LDL cholesterol categories. Other data from this cohort show that hs-CRP level adds prognostic information to the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome. Taken together with other data in men on the association of hs-CRP with vascular risk, a strong argument is provided for screening in the primary prevention population. With regard to potential treatment, statins have been found to reduce hs-CRP levels, and data from statin treatment trials raise the possibility that subjects with elevated hs-CRP levels may derive greater benefit from treatment than do patients without elevated hs-CRP. The Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial is planned to examine the effects of rosuvastatin treatment in preventing cardiovascular events in 15,000 healthy subjects with elevated hs-CRP levels in the absence of overt hyperlipidemia.

These findings among individuals with no standard modifiable risk factor other than elevated hsCRP are highly relevant today given findings that have emerged from contemporary global cardiovascular epidemiology. First, the major modifiable risk factors account for an aggregate population attributable fraction for cardiovascular disease of only 57.2% among women and 52.6% among men. As such, to make progress in prevention, we must be open to novel nontraditional pathways. Second, among participants who have no classic risk factors, the lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease remains substantial, estimated at 13% among women and 21% among men.

### Rosuvastatin to prevent vascular events in men and women with elevated C-reactive protein [^5e7b829a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

The study JUPITER was published by Ridker PM and colleagues in 2008 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Unstable angina, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the JUPITER study, the trial question was: what is the role of rosuvastatin in preventing vascular events among healthy males and females with elevated CRP? In the JUPITER study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the JUPITER study, the population was: 17802 patients (6801 female, 11001 male). The inclusion criteria were healthy males and females with LDL-C levels < 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP levels ≥ 2.0 mg/L. The key exclusion criteria were previous or current use of lipid-lowering therapy, current use of postmenopausal hormone-replacement therapy, evidence of hepatic dysfunction, diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and a recent history of alcohol or drug abuse. In the JUPITER study, the interventions were: n = 8901 rosuvastatin (20 mg daily) n = 8901 placebo (matching placebo daily). In the JUPITER study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes (0.77/100 py vs. 1.36/100 py; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.69). In the JUPITER study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the incidence of myocardial infarction (0.17/100 py vs. 0.37/100 py; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.7) Significant decrease in the incidence of stroke (0.18/100 py vs. 0.34/100 py; HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.79) Significant decrease in myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (0.45 vs. 0.85; HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.69). In the JUPITER study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events (15.2% vs. 15.5%, p = 0.60), myopathy (0.1% vs. 0.1%, p = 0.82) or cancer (3.4% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.51). significant differences in physician-reported diabetes (3.0% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.01). In the JUPITER study, the conclusion was: in healthy males and females with LDL-C levels < 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP levels ≥ 2.0 mg/L, rosuvastatin was superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes.

### HDL cholesterol and residual risk of first cardiovascular events after treatment with potent statin therapy: an analysis from the JUPITER trial [^3ccb008d]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

HDL-cholesterol concentrations are inversely associated with occurrence of cardiovascular events. We addressed, using the JUPITER trial cohort, whether this association remains when LDL-cholesterol concentrations are reduced to the very low ranges with high-dose statin treatment.

Methods

Participants in the randomised placebo-controlled JUPITER trial were adults without diabetes or previous cardiovascular disease, and had baseline concentrations of LDL cholesterol of less than 3.37 mmol/L and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein of 2 mg/L or more. Participants were randomly allocated by a computer-generated sequence to receive rosuvastatin 20 mg per day or placebo, with participants and adjudicators masked to treatment assignment. In the present analysis, we divided the participants into quartiles of HDL-cholesterol or apolipoprotein A1 and sought evidence of association between these quartiles and the JUPITER primary endpoint of first non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, hospitalisation for unstable angina, arterial revascularisation, or cardiovascular death. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00239681.

Findings

For 17,802 patients in the JUPITER trial, rosuvastatin 20 mg per day reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint by 44% (p < 0.0001). In 8901 (50%) patients given placebo (who had a median on-treatment LDL-cholesterol concentration of 2.80 mmol/L [IQR 2.43–3.24]), HDL-cholesterol concentrations were inversely related to vascular risk both at baseline (top quartile vs bottom quartile hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.35–0.83, p = 0.0039) and on-treatment (0.55, 0.35–0.87, p = 0.0047). By contrast, among the 8900 (50%) patients given rosuvastatin 20 mg (who had a median on-treatment LDL-cholesterol concentration of 1.42 mmol/L [IQR 1.14–1.86]), no significant relationships were noted between quartiles of HDL-cholesterol concentration and vascular risk either at baseline (1.12, 0.62–2.03, p = 0.82) or on-treatment (1.03, 0.57–1.87, p = 0.97). Our analyses for apolipoprotein A1 showed an equivalent strong relation to frequency of primary outcomes in the placebo group but little association in the rosuvastatin group.

Interpretation

Although measurement of HDL-cholesterol concentration is useful as part of initial cardiovascular risk assessment, HDL-cholesterol concentrations are not predictive of residual vascular risk among patients treated with potent statin therapy who attain very low concentrations of LDL cholesterol.

### Rosuvastatin in the prevention of stroke among men and women with elevated levels of C-reactive protein: justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) [^95daad45]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Prior primary prevention trials of statin therapy that used cholesterol criteria for enrollment have not reported significant decreases in stroke risk. We evaluated whether statin therapy might reduce stroke rates among individuals with low levels of cholesterol but elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

Methods and Results

In Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), 17 802 apparently healthy men and women with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels < 130 mg/dL and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels ≥ 2.0 mg/L were randomly allocated to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo and then followed up for the occurrence of a first stroke. After a median follow-up of 1.9 years (maximum, 5.0 years), rosuvastatin resulted in a 48% reduction in the hazard of fatal and nonfatal stroke as compared with placebo (incidence rate, 0.18 and 0.34 per 100 person-years of observation, respectively; hazard ratio 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.79; P = 0.002), a finding that was consistent across all examined subgroups. This finding was due to a 51% reduction in the rate of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.81; P = 0.004), with no difference in the rates of hemorrhagic stroke between the active and placebo arms (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.24 to 1.88; P = 0.44).

Conclusions

Rosuvastatin reduces by more than half the incidence of ischemic stroke among men and women with low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels who are at risk because of elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

At study closure (median follow-up 1.8 years; maximal follow-up 5 years), the occurrence of MI/stroke/cardiovascular death was lower among high-risk subjects allocated to rosuvastatin compared with placebo (HR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.27–0.93 for Framingham risk score > 20%; HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43–0.78 for SCORE risk ≥ 5% extrapolated model; HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.32–0.68 for SCORE risk ≥ 5% capped model; Figure 1, Table 3). The proportional reduction in MI/stroke/cardiovascular death with rosuvastatin was similar for patients with Framingham risk score above or below 20% (P for interaction = 0.95), or SCORE risk above or below 5% (P for interaction = 0.37 capped model, 0.25 extrapolated model).

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^a76f9dfb]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statin intensity and LDL-C lowering in primary prevention describes that an RCT enrolling men ≥ 55 years and women ≥ 65 years with at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor had placebo 10-year 'hard ASCVD' risk 8.7% and expanded endpoint 10%, and after 5.6 years rosuvastatin 10 mg per day produced significant absolute risk reduction. If maximal ASCVD risk reduction is desired, it is reasonable to use a high-intensity statin to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with increased benefit especially when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 20%. In JUPITER, men ≥ 50 and women ≥ 60 with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2.0 mg/L and LDL-C < 130 mg/dL assigned rosuvastatin 20 mg per day achieved a median LDL-C reduction of 50% and highly significant ASCVD risk reduction at 1.9 years, and the magnitude of percent LDL-C reduction achieved determined benefit.

Methods

Study Population

The study population is derived from a primary prevention randomized, controlled clinical trial of rosuvastatin versus placebo (JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]; NCT00239681). 20 The JUPITER trial investigators randomized 17 802 individuals (women ≥ 60 years, men ≥ 50 years) without past history of coronary disease, stroke, or diabetes mellitus, all of whom had low or normal LDL‐C (< 130 mg/dL), but elevated high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (≥ 2.0 mg/L), to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily versus placebo. Individuals with triglycerides > 500 mg/dL were excluded from trial entry. The study enrolled a multiethnic population of women and men. The relative risk reduction in the primary composite incident ASCVD end point was 44% with rosuvastatin. After trial completion, in a subset of randomly selected JUPITER participants with sufficient plasma available, we performed 400‐MHz proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H‐NMR) spectroscopy‐based lipoprotein analysis of fasting blood samples collected at baseline (pretreatment) and at 12 months (on study drug). Data were analyzed from 9423 participants with all measures of interest at both time points. The design of this secondary analysis is observational in nature. Institutional approval was granted and subjects provided informed consent.

### Justification for the use of statins in primary prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) – can C-reactive protein be used to target statin therapy in primary prevention? [^5126ea0a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The most important action of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) is their ability to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Statins have proved highly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in both primary and secondary prevention studies. However, the magnitude of risk reduction associated with statins is greater than that predicted on the basis of LDL cholesterol lowering alone. A likely explanation for this effect is the anti-inflammatory action of statins. Following the observation that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular events, investigators in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) and Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) trials demonstrated that the magnitude of risk reduction associated with statin therapy was higher among those with elevated hs-CRP levels. In addition, there is accumulating evidence that statins lower plasma levels of hs-CRP in a manner largely independent of LDL cholesterol lowering. In contrast, little benefit has been demonstrated for statin therapy in the absence of both hyperlipidemia and inflammation. Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) is a large multinational, long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial designed to assess directly whether statin therapy (rosuvastatin 20 mg/day) should be given to apparently healthy individuals with low LDL cholesterol levels but elevated hs-CRP levels — a critical issue for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Support for the concept behind the JUPITER trial is also now available from several recent trials comparing different intensities of statin therapy on disease progression as well as clinical end points. These studies indicate that the hs-CRP level achieved after initiation of statin therapy may be as important as the LDL cholesterol level achieved. All of these data raise the possibility that hs-CRP could be used to target high-risk patients who may benefit from early statin use. Ongoing work will determine whether hs-CRP reduction, independent of LDL cholesterol reduction, results in a net clinical benefit.

### Another look at the results of the JUPITER trial [^3d9ce297]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) was a placebo-controlled trial undertaken on "apparently healthy" subjects selected primarily on the basis of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations ≥ 2.0 mg/L. JUPITER showed that rosuvastatin reduced the incidence of cardiac events compared to a control group. The study population (median age 66 years) included men and women with the metabolic syndrome (about 41%), median blood pressures in the prehypertensive range, current smoking (about 15%), median body mass indexes higher than normal, and Framingham 10-year risk > 10% (about 50%). The presence of these risk factors indicates that a significant proportion of subjects were not "healthy" and warranted aggressive management under current guidelines, without the measurement of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Furthermore, < 17% of the trial participants were taking guidelines-recommended aspirin, and 25% had systolic blood pressures > 145 mm Hg and would have merited treatment for hypertension. It is likely that many of the participants did not receive care consistent with current standards. Thus, the benefit of statin therapy would have been more difficult to demonstrate if standard therapeutic recommendations had been followed. In conclusion, these considerations cast doubt on the contention that statin therapy should be initiated in apparently healthy individuals on the basis of elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.

Supporting randomized evidence cited includes JUPITER, which enrolled men ≥ 50 years of age and women ≥ 60 years of age with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein values ≥ 2.0 mg/L; participants assigned to 20 mg/d of rosuvastatin achieved median reductions in LDL-C of 50% with highly significant ASCVD risk reduction at 1.9 years, and a median follow-up of 1.9 years showed greater LDL-C lowering and ASCVD outcome reductions with high-intensity rosuvastatin.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^6f9ab8df]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Results

JUPITER enrolled 17 802 men and women (6515 in Europe), and randomized 8901 each to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily and placebo. At baseline, 9% of the cohort was considered to be at 'high risk' for a first cardiovascular event on the basis of having a 10-year Framingham risk of MI/coronary death above 20%; 52% were considered to be at 'high risk' on the basis of having a 10-year SCORE risk of cardiovascular death of 5% or higher using the extrapolated model, and 35% were considered to be at 'high risk' using the capped SCORE model. Baseline characteristics of these high-risk patients are shown by treatment allocation (Table 1). As anticipated, when compared with the entire JUPITER cohort, the higher-risk patients were older, more often male and more likely to smoke, have hypertension and low levels of HDL-C. Differences between the high-risk Framingham and SCORE groups reflect the patient characteristics included in the risk algorithms and their weighted contribution to individuals' estimated global cardiovascular risk. In particular, metabolic syndrome was more prevalent among high-risk Framingham patients.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics according to the estimated 10-year risk defined by the Framingham risk score or the systematic coronary risk evaluation risk algorithm

For the entire JUPITER cohort, rosuvastatin lowered LDL-C by 50%, triglycerides by 17% and hs C-reactive protein by 37%, whereas it increased HDL-C by 4% compared with placebo (P < 0.001 for all from baseline to year 1). In the high-risk groups, effects of rosuvastatin on lipoproteins and hs C-reactive protein were similar to those seen for the entire cohort (Table 2), with significant reductions in LDL-C, triglycerides, and hs C-reactive protein (P < 0.0001 vs. placebo for all) and a significant increase in HDL-C (P < 0.0001).

Causal Relationships Between Inflammation and Cardiovascular Events: Insights From Randomized Clinical Trials

The advance in understanding of the cellular mechanisms of the chronic inflammatory process underlying atherosclerosis is increasingly being translated into actionable clinical discoveries. Phase 3, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trials have now shown that targeting specific inflammatory pathways can improve clinical outcomes and reduce cardiovascular events in select populations. Importantly, different anti-inflammatory strategies may have varying agent-related effectiveness due to diversity in underlying mechanisms, specifically whether they prevent early disease progression, lessen plaque formation, or reduce late-stage plaque rupture to prevent acute cardiac events. This scenario highlights a major challenge in clinical trials for anti-inflammatory agents: what is the population of relevance for the specific agent, and what is the relevant outcome that the agent may modify?

The first trial to test a clinical treatment strategy based on inflammatory markers was JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statin in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin). In 17,802 patients selected per LDL-C level < 130 mg/dL and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level ≥ 2 mg/L, rosuvastatin 20 mg was associated with a reduction in the rate of primary endpoint (MI, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, and cardiovascular death) compared with placebo (rosuvastatin vs placebo 1.31 vs 0.77). However, it was unclear whether it was an on-target effect due to LDL-C reduction or a pleiotropic effect of reducing inflammation, generating the need for investigation and development of targeted anti-inflammatory treatments.

### Recent clinical studies of the effects of lipid-modifying therapies [^ce8368e4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Results from multiple clinical trials, primarily with the class of lipid-lowering agents known as statins, have shown that reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are associated with reduced risk of coronary artery disease. Although LDL cholesterol is the primary target of cholesterol management strategies, increasing attention has focused on the role of inflammation, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. We review major trials with lipid-modifying therapies published since the 2004 update of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines. A pivotal trial was the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), which demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in healthy individuals without elevated LDL cholesterol but with high levels of the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Additional trials demonstrated the efficacy of intensive statin therapy in secondary prevention, whereas other agents, including fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, niacin, ezetimibe, and experimental cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, have been evaluated for their ability to reduce residual cardiovascular risk.

The design, rationale, and outcomes of the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention trial are described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, the trial evaluated the effect of rosuvastatin 20 mg daily compared with placebo on the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularisation, admission to hospital for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes among 17 802 apparently healthy men and women who had low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of less than 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) and high sensitivity C reactive protein levels of 2.0 mg/L or more. After a median follow-up of 1.9 years the hazard ratio for occurrence of the primary end point was 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.69), favouring rosuvastatin. Univariable subgroup analyses (for example, for age, sex, smoking status, ethnicity, and Framingham risk score) showed no significant deviations from this effect size.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein discordance with atherogenic lipid measures and incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in primary prevention: the ARIC study [^6871bdbd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Accumulating evidence from the past 2 decades suggests that inflammation plays a causal role, independent of lipoprotein levels, in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD; "inflammation hypothesis"). 1 Early observations 2, 3 led to the landmark JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial, which showed that rosuvastatin therapy reduced ASCVD events in a primary prevention population with low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) < 130 mg/dL but an elevated hsCRP (high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein) ≥ 2 mg/L, a marker of subclinical inflammation. 4 However, it remained unclear whether the observed benefits in JUPITER were directly related to reduction of hsCRP, LDL‐C, or both, or other atherogenic lipoproteins. Further, post hoc analyses from multiple lipid‐lowering trials have shown that individuals reaching dual low LDL‐C and hsCRP targets had superior outcomes compared with those who only reached an LDL‐C target. 5, 6 Validation for the role of inflammation in ASCVD was strengthened even more recently after the CANTOS (Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study) showed reduction in recurrent cardiovascular events with canakinumab treatment, 7 especially among those who achieved hsCRP < 2 mg/L at 3 months on therapy. 8

ASCVD events are known to occur more frequently among individuals with relatively low LDL‐C levels who have discordantly elevated levels of atherogenic lipid parameters such as non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL‐C), apolipoprotein B, 9 and the total cholesterol (TC) to HDL‐C ratio (TC/HDL‐C). 10, 11 Given that discordance between these various atherogenic lipid measures is common and clinically relevant, one way to isolate the independent contribution of heightened inflammation to atherosclerosis is to study whether hsCRP levels can provide additional information in situations when these atherogenic lipid and lipoprotein levels are all concordantly favorable or unfavorable. In a large, predominantly biracial population of US adults without known ASCVD, we aimed to evaluate whether hsCRP can provide additional long‐term prognostic information regarding risk of ASCVD independent of lipid and lipoprotein levels.

### A comparison of statin therapies in hypercholesterolemia in women: a subgroup analysis of the STELLAR study [^3c8541c9]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Our 6-week treatment period was not long enough to assess the effect on clinical events; therefore, our data cannot suggest a preferential advantage of one statin versus another in preventing cardiovascular events. However, based on the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' meta-analysis of > 170,000 patients in 26 prospective, randomized statin trials, which showed that every 39 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C led to a 22% (95% CI: 0.76–0.80, p < 0.0001) reduction in major vascular events and a 10% (95% CI: 0.87–0.93, p < 0.0001) reduction in all-cause mortality, it would be predicted that greater LDL-C reductions would confer greater benefit in reducing cardiovascular events. Although women have been under-represented in clinical end-point trials of statins, analyses of subgroups of women from these trials indicate that LDL-C reduction decreased cardiovascular event rates to a similar degree in women compared with that documented in men.

A meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials of statins in primary prevention found that statin intervention was associated with a lower cardiovascular event rate versus control and was similar in women and men (odds ratio [OR] 0.81, 95% CI: 0.75–0.89; p < 0.0001 vs. OR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71–0.83; p < 0.0001, respectively). In addition, a sex-specific analysis of data from the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study assessed the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin in apparently healthy individuals with raised high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Overall, the absolute CVD rates in women for rosuvastatin and placebo (0.57 and 1.04, respectively) were lower than those in men (0.88 and 1.54, respectively), although the relative risk reduction associated with rosuvastatin was similar in women and men (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% CI: 0.37–0.80; p = 0.002 vs. HR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.45–0.73; p < 0.001).

### Rosuvstatin [^2b23c1f7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary end point was a composite end point consisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major CV events: CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or an arterial revascularization procedure.

Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of major CV events (252 events in the placebo group vs. 142 events in the rosuvastatin group) with a statistically significant (p < 0.001) relative risk reduction of 44% and absolute risk reduction of 1.2% (see Figure 1). The risk reduction for the primary end point was consistent across the following predefined subgroups: age, sex, race, smoking status, family history of premature CHD, body mass index, LDL-C, HDL-C, and hsCRP levels.

Figure 1. Time to First Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Events in JUPITER

The individual components of the primary end point are presented in Figure 3. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and arterial revascularization procedures. There were no significant treatment differences between the rosuvastatin and placebo groups for death due to CV causes or hospitalizations for unstable angina.

Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (6 fatal events and 62 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 9 fatal events and 22 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin-treated subjects) and the risk of stroke (6 fatal events and 58 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 3 fatal events and 30 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin -treated subjects).

Figure 2. Major CV Events by Treatment Group in JUPITER

At one year, rosuvastatin increased HDL-C and reduced LDL-C, hsCRP, total cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels (p < 0.001 for all versus placebo).

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

Rosuvastatin reduces Total-C, LDL-C, ApoB, non-HDL-C, and TG, and increases HDL-C, in adult patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia.

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with hyperlipidemia, rosuvastatin given as a single daily dose (5 to 40 mg) for 6 weeks significantly reduced Total-C, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and ApoB, across the dose range (Table 10).

Cumulative incidence of fatal/non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke in high-risk patients. The cumulative incidence of fatal/non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal/non-fatal stroke are shown by the treatment group among patients with a 10-year systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% using the extrapolated (upper panel) and capped models (lower panel).

In the higher-risk patients, there was no evidence of heterogeneity for the endpoint of MI/stroke/cardiovascular death in subgroups by gender, age, race/ethnicity, hypertension, smoking, family history of premature coronary heart disease, baseline HDL-C, or C-reactive protein (Figure 3). Patients with body mass index > 30 kg/m 2 at baseline appeared to benefit less from rosuvastatin treatment compared with non-obese patients, but this interaction between treatment assignment and body mass index was not observed for the JUPITER cohort as a whole and thus is likely to be more apparent than real.

### Rosuvastatin calcium [^fd061aa5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary end point was a composite end point consisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major CV events: CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or an arterial revascularization procedure.

Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of major CV events (252 events in the placebo group vs. 142 events in the rosuvastatin group) with a statistically significant (p < 0.001) relative risk reduction of 44% and absolute risk reduction of 1.2% (see Figure 1). The risk reduction for the primary end point was consistent across the following predefined subgroups: age, sex, race, smoking status, family history of premature CHD, body mass index, LDL‑C, HDL‑C, and hsCRP levels.

Figure 1. Time to First Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Events in JUPITER

The individual components of the primary end point are presented in Figure 3. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and arterial revascularization procedures. There were no significant treatment differences between the rosuvastatin and placebo groups for death due to cardiovascular causes or hospitalizations for unstable angina.

Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (6 fatal events and 62 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 9 fatal events and 22 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin-treated subjects) and the risk of stroke (6 fatal events and 58 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 3 fatal events and 30 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin-treated subjects).

Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease

In the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study, the effect of rosuvastatin on the occurrence of major cardiovascular (CV) disease events was assessed in 17,802 men (≥ 50 years) and women (≥ 60 years) who had no clinically evident cardiovascular disease, LDL-C levels < 130 mg/dL and hsCRP levels ≥ 2 mg/L. The study population had an estimated baseline coronary heart disease risk of 11.6% over 10 years based on the Framingham risk criteria and included a high percentage of patients with additional risk factors such as hypertension (58%), low HDL-C levels (23%), cigarette smoking (16%), or a family history of premature CHD (12%). Patients had a median baseline LDL-C of 108 mg/dL and hsCRP of 4.3 mg/L. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 8901) or rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily (n = 8901) and were followed for a mean duration of 2 years. The JUPITER study was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to meeting predefined stopping rules for efficacy in rosuvastatin-treated subjects.

### Efficacy of rosuvastatin among men and women with moderate chronic kidney disease and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein: a secondary analysis from the JUPITER (justification for the use of statins in prevention-an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin) trial [^ff8e5425]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated the efficacy of statin therapy in primary prevention among individuals with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Background

Whether patents with moderate CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) benefit from statin therapy is uncertain, particularly among those without hyperlipidemia or known cardiovascular disease.

Methods

Within the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention-an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) primary prevention trial of rosuvastatin 20 mg compared with placebo among men and women free of cardiovascular disease who had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 130 mg/dl and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) ≥ 2 mg/l, we performed a secondary analysis comparing cardiovascular and mortality outcomes among those with moderate CKD at study entry (n = 3,267) with those with baseline eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (n = 14,528). Median follow-up was 1.9 years (maximum 5 years).

Results

Compared with those with eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), JUPITER participants with moderate CKD had higher vascular event rates (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23 to 1.92, p = 0.0002). Among those with moderate CKD, rosuvastatin was associated with a 45% reduction in risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hospital stay for unstable angina, arterial revascularization, or confirmed cardiovascular death (HR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.82, p = 0.002) and a 44% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.85, p = 0.005). Median LDL-C and hsCRP reductions as well as side effect profiles associated with rosuvastatin were similar among those with and without CKD. Median eGFR at 12 months was marginally improved among those allocated to rosuvastatin as compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Rosuvastatin reduces first cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality among men and women with LDL-C < 130 mg/dl, elevated hsCRP, and concomitant evidence of moderate CKD. (JUPITER-Crestor 20 mg Versus Placebo in Prevention of Cardiovascular [CV] Events; NCT00239681).

### The cost-effectiveness of C-reactive protein testing and rosuvastatin treatment for patients with normal cholesterol levels [^47c50639]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of applying the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial results into clinical practice.

Background

The JUPITER trial found that rosuvastatin reduces vascular events in apparently healthy subjects with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) but normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. The implications of expanding treatment recommendations based on these results have not been evaluated.

Methods

We constructed a cost-effectiveness model of men ≥ 50 years and women ≥ 60 years with LDL cholesterol levels of < 130 mg/dl and no known cardiovascular disease. We compared: 1) hs-CRP testing followed by rosuvastatin treatment for patients with hs-CRP levels ≥ 2.0 mg/l; and 2) usual care (i.e., no testing and no treatment). Estimates of treatment effectiveness were based on the JUPITER trial and were varied in sensitivity analyses.

Results

Among patients with LDL < 130 mg/dl and hs-CRP levels ≥ 2.0 mg/l, rosuvastatin had an incremental cost-effectiveness of $25,198 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to usual care. If the effectiveness of rosuvastatin were 50% of that observed in JUPITER, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would increase to $50,871 per QALY. Implementing this strategy only in patients with a Framingham risk score ≥ 10% yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness of $14,205 per QALY. Among such intermediate-risk patients, a JUPITER-based strategy becomes cost-saving at a rosuvastatin price of < $0.86 per day.

Conclusions

Rosuvastatin treatment for JUPITER-eligible patients appears to be cost-effective, particularly among those with a Framingham risk score ≥ 10%.

### Evaluation of C-reactive protein prior to and on-treatment as a predictor of benefit from atorvastatin: observations from the anglo-scandinavian cardiac outcomes trial [^ad9a89ad]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Certain inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, have been shown to be associated with risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease independent of classical risk markers, including LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c). In several trials, statin therapy has been shown to lower circulating C-reactive protein. In the recent JUPITER (Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial, the extent to which C-reactive protein is lowered by statins was reported to predict CV outcomes independently of LDL-c lowering. Indeed, authors have argued that the JUPITER trial provides confirmation of the value of C-reactive protein in determining CV risk. This finding is at variance with data from existing meta-analyses, which suggest that the 'anti-inflammatory' effect of statins may be a secondary effect of LDL-c reduction and that LDL-c reduction accounts for most of the benefit of statins. To further investigate this controversial issue, we have conducted a nested case–control study on participants recruited into ASCOT. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (i) baseline C-reactive protein (i.e. prior to randomization) is associated with and improves CV disease risk prediction, (ii) that baseline C-reactive protein modifies the efficacy of statins in reducing CV events, and (iii) that C-reactive protein levels during statin use predict statin efficacy independently of LDL-c reduction.

### Prevalence of low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein in the U.S.: implications of the JUPITER (justification for the use of statins in primary prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin) study [^0eebb7d1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

We assessed the prevalence of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) < 130 mg/dl with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in the National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), weighted to be representative of the general U.S. population.

Background

Rosuvastatin therapy in the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) study reduced cardiovascular events among older adults with LDL-C < 130 mg/dl and hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/l.

Methods

Using 1999 to 2004 NHANES data, we categorized men age ≥ 50 years and women age ≥ 60 years by fasting LDL-C and hsCRP levels, excluding individuals with prevalent coronary heart disease, coronary heart disease equivalent (including diabetes), and other JUPITER exclusions.

Results

A total of 3.9 million men age ≥ 50 years and 2.6 million women age ≥ 60 years meeting JUPITER eligibility criteria had fasting LDL-C < 130 mg/dl and hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/l. In addition, 6.7 million older adults with elevated hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/l have LDL-C levels that exceed their National Cholesterol Education Program goals.

Conclusions

Extrapolating JUPITER eligibility to NHANES, an estimated 6.5 million additional adults could be potential candidates to initiate statin therapy.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^e8632280]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

JUPITER subgroup outcomes in AAs — among subjects without hyperlipidemia but with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs‑CRP) assigned to placebo or 20 mg rosuvastatin daily, blacks had smaller biomarker reductions than whites: hs‑CRP −22.2% vs −36.4%, LDL‑C −43.0% vs −51.4%, and apo B −30.6% vs −38.7% (P < .001 for all). Rosuvastatin reduced the primary end point by 45% in whites (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.43–0.69) and 35% in blacks (0.65; 0.35–1.22), and reduced stroke by 55% in whites (0.45; 0.27–0.77) and 46% in blacks (0.54; 0.19–1.60). Although differences in benefits were not statistically significant, the somewhat smaller LDL‑C and apo B responses may have contributed to the trend toward smaller benefits in blacks compared with whites; black participants have been shown to have higher hs‑CRP levels, particularly black women compared with women of other races.

Inflammatory biomarkers and atherosclerosis

The contribution of various biomarkers to predicting the risk of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) events has been studied not only in patients with CV disease, but also in apparently healthy individuals. The concept of "personalized medicine" or "targeted therapy" has been proposed, in which lipid-lowering and/or anti-inflammatory treatment plans are tailored based on basal levels of these inflammatory markers.

Among the diverse group of circulating biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) stands out as a leading biomarker for risk prediction. CRP measured by high-sensitivity assay (hsCRP) can independently predict CV events. A primary prevention trial, the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial, showed that rosuvastatin reduced the rate of first major cardiovascular events (MACE) by 47% in patients with LDL-C levels of < 130 mg/dL and hsCRP of > 2 mg/L. However, Mendelian randomization and animal studies disproved a causal relationship between CRP and atherosclerotic events. This all indicates that CRP is a valuable biomarker for atherosclerotic risk/inflammation estimation, but that it is not a causal factor.

In contrast to CRP, there are consistent reports from multiple studies indicating a causal effect of IL-6 signaling in atherosclerosis. This has been related to plaque destabilization, microvascular dysfunction, and acute CV events (Fig. 1). As of yet, IL-1β, the primary circulating form of IL-1 (the most powerful inducer of innate immunity), cannot reliably be measured in plasma. Accordingly, there are no comparable epidemiologic studies relating IL-1β to CV risk.

### From here to JUPITER: identifying new patients for statin therapy using data from the 1999–2004 national health and nutrition examination survey [^252a2e61]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for statin use currently focus on patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein levels. Recent findings from the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), however, indicate that statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk is also effective among older persons with at-goal low-density lipoprotein but elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. We estimate the size of and describe this new population for whom statin therapy may now be indicated based on JUPITER's findings.

Methods and Results

Using data from the 1999 to 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we estimate that 57.9% of older adults (men ≥ 50 years and women ≥ 60 years), or 33,547 000 (95% CI, 32,217,000 to 34,877,000) Americans, are currently taking a statin (24.4%) or indicated for statin therapy (33.5%). In addition, we estimate that 19.2%, or 11 144 000 (95% CI, 10 053 000 to 12 235 000), may become newly eligible for statin therapy. This includes 8 071 000 (13.9%; 95% CI, 7 173 000 to 8 969 000) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/L and low-density lipoprotein < 130 mg/dL (ie, those meeting "strict" JUPITER criteria) and an additional 3,073,000 (5.3%; 95% CI, 2,404,000 to 3,743,000) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/L and low-density lipoprotein of 130 to 160 mg/dL for whom JUPITER's findings might reasonably be extended. Thus, approximately 80% of older persons may now have an indication for statin therapy. Compared with those who would continue to have no indication for statin therapy, the JUPITER group was more likely to be female, to be older, and to have obesity, hypertension, and the metabolic syndrome.

Conclusions

JUPITER's findings have the potential to impact treatment recommendations for approximately 20% of middle-aged to elderly adults, thus increasing the proportion of this segment of the population with an indication for statin therapy to nearly 80%.

### Pathophysiology and management of cardiovascular disease in patients with HIV [^35db15e0]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Statins are well known for their ability to lower cholesterol levels, especially low density lipoprotein (LDL), and for their efficacy in primary and secondary prevention of CVD in the general population. Statins also possess anti-inflammatory properties that may contribute to their cardioprotective benefits. In 2008, the JUPITER trial reported results of a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of rosuvastatin in non-HIV-infected patients with LDL levels of less than 3·37 mmol/L but with hs-CRP levels of greater than 2 mg/L, indicating heightened inflammation. They found that statin therapy reduced cardiovascular events with a hazard ratio of 0·56 (95% CI 0·46–0·69) alongside reductions in hs-CRP and LDL. In comparison, a meta-analysis that primarily reviewed statin trials using LDL cholesterol criteria for enrollment reported about a 20% reduction in vascular events for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL, an effect that would have predicted a 25% lowering of events in the JUPITER trial. The observed effect, however, was almost doubled the predicted effect. Since the trial primarily enrolled patients based on elevated hs-CRP rather than elevated LDL, these data suggest a potential anti-inflammatory action of statins added to cardioprotection in a cohort with heightened inflammation. Nonetheless, the degree to which statins may decrease CVD through traditional and anti-inflammatory actions remains unknown and an important focus of current research.

### Statins for the "SMuRFLess but inflamed": silent vascular inflammation and the challenge of translational science [^4ef893d6]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

The initial clinical response to the JUPITER trial was complex. On the one hand, the preventive cardiology and vascular biology communities hailed the JUPITER trial for its novel direction, several guideline committees endorsed the use of statin therapy among those with hsCRP > 2 mg/L, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded rosuvastatin labeling to specifically include use among those with elevated hsCRP. On the other hand, the JUPITER trial was assailed by others who largely objected to what in hindsight was perceived as the medicalization of primary prevention.

From a U.S. guideline perspective, the JUPITER trial had impact, but not in a manner the investigators might have predicted. Rather than introducing broad hsCRP screening into U.S. clinical practice, guideline writers interpreted the JUPITER trial as showing that LDL-C thresholds for statin initiation should be markedly lowered. This interpretation of the JUPITER trial was consistent with a cholesterol focused view of atherosclerosis and has been effective from a public health perspective, increasing global statin prescription and providing early hard evidence that "lower is better for LDL-C". Yet, this interpretation failed to recognize that SMuRFLess patients in the JUPITER trial whose only risk factor was an elevated hsCRP also benefitted markedly from statin therapy.

A total of 8,278 participants enrolled in the JUPITER trial had no standard modifiable risk factor and thus can be categorized as SMuRFLess. All of them, by trial design, had hsCRP levels > 2 mg/L. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, "SMuRFLess but Inflamed" JUPITER participants experienced a 48% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events when allocated to rosuvastatin as compared with placebo (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.45–0.85; P = 0.003) with consistent benefits on myocardial infarction (HR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.15–0.66), stroke (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.25–1.09), and arterial revascularization (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40–0.93). The data in Table 1 have been adjusted for both body mass index and kidney function estimated glomerular filtration rate to be consistent with current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommendations.

### Clinical implications of JUPITER (justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin) in a U.S. population insights from the ARIC (atherosclerosis risk in communities) study [^397aa272]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study is to describe the proportion of "JUPITER-eligible" (Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) individuals and clinical outcomes of individuals based on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) strata in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study.

Background

Questions remain after the JUPITER study, including whether the observed cardiovascular disease (CVD) event rates would persist with time and how these event rates would compare with other populations (lower hs-CRP and/or higher LDL-C levels).

Methods

After stratification into 4 groups based on LDL-C and hs-CRP levels, with cutoffs at 130 mg/dl and 2.0 mg/l, respectively, incident CVD events were examined (mean follow-up, 6.9 years) and compared.

Results

Of 8,907 age-eligible participants, 18.2% (n = 1,621) were JUPITER-eligible (hs-CRP ≥ 2.0 mg/l, LDL-C < 130 mg/dl) and had an absolute CVD risk of approximately 10.9% over a mean follow-up of 6.9 years (1.57% per year). If JUPITER hazard ratios were applied to this group, the number needed to treat to prevent 1 CVD event would be estimated at 38 over 5 years and 26 over 6.9 years.

Conclusions

ARIC participants with elevated hs-CRP and low LDL-C had a CVD event rate of 1.57% per year over 6.9 years, similar to the CVD event rate noted in the JUPITER study placebo group (1.36% per year over 1.9 years). The association of hs-CRP ≥ 2.0 mg/l with increased CVD risk and mortality regardless of LDL-C provides us a simple method of using age and hs-CRP level for identifying higher risk individuals.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^d989f36d]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The SCORE model is limited to ages 45–64 years. To account for the large proportion of subjects enrolled in JUPITER older than 65 years (n = 10 237), a modification of the SCORE model was used in which the risk conferred by age was extrapolated for patients aged 65 or older (extrapolated model). Extrapolation was based on the contribution of age to the risk of cardiovascular death as assessed in the algorithm for patients up to 65 years of age. The extrapolated model is the model cited in the European CRESTOR Summary of the Product Characteristics. An analysis was also performed using the SCORE algorithm capped at 65 years (capped model), in which all subjects 65 years or older were assigned the risk of a 64-year old. This more conservative approach resulted in fewer patients being classified as high risk; 52% of the JUPITER participants had SCORE risk ≥ 5% using the extrapolated model compared with 35% using the capped model. Analyses for patients with SCORE risk < 5% are included as.

Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from the Cox proportional hazard models. Changes in lipoproteins and hs C-reactive protein levels were compared by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Baseline hs C-reactive protein is the mean of each participant's values at the screening and randomization visits. Analyses were performed using SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC, USA).

### Estimating treatment effects for individual patients based on the results of randomised clinical trials [^828a2eec]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To predict treatment effects for individual patients based on data from randomised trials, taking rosuvastatin treatment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease as an example, and to evaluate the net benefit of making treatment decisions for individual patients based on a predicted absolute treatment effect.

Setting As an example, data were used from the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention (JUPITER) trial, a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of rosuvastatin 20 mg daily versus placebo on the occurrence of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularisation, admission to hospital for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes).

Population 17 802 healthy men and women who had low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of less than 3.4 mmol/L and high sensitivity C reactive protein levels of 2.0 mg/L or more.

Methods Data from the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention trial were used to predict rosuvastatin treatment effect for individual patients based on existing risk scores (Framingham and Reynolds) and on a newly developed prediction model. We compared the net benefit of prediction based rosuvastatin treatment (selective treatment of patients whose predicted treatment effect exceeds a decision threshold) with the net benefit of treating either everyone or no one.

Results The median predicted 10 year absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events was 4.4% (interquartile range 2.6–7.0%) based on the Framingham risk score, 4.2% (2.5–7.1%) based on the Reynolds score, and 3.9% (2.5–6.1%) based on the newly developed model (optimal fit model). Prediction based treatment was associated with more net benefit than treating everyone or no one, provided that the decision threshold was between 2% and 7%, and thus that the number willing to treat (NWT) to prevent one cardiovascular event over 10 years was between 15 and 50.

Conclusions Data from randomised trials can be used to predict treatment effect in terms of absolute risk reduction for individual patients, based on a newly developed model or, if available, existing risk scores. The value of such prediction of treatment effect for medical decision making is conditional on the NWT to prevent one outcome event.

### On-treatment non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, and lipid ratios in relation to residual vascular risk after treatment with potent statin therapy: JUPITER (justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin) [^22f502ac]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to determine whether residual risk after high-dose statin therapy for primary prevention individuals with reduced levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is related to on-treatment apolipoprotein B, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), trigylcerides, or lipid ratios, and how they compare with on-treatment LDL-C.

Background

Guidelines focus on LDL-C as the primary target of therapy, yet residual risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) among statin-treated individuals remains high and not fully explained.

Methods

Participants in the randomized placebo-controlled JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial were adults without diabetes or CVD, with baseline LDL-C levels < 130 mg/dl, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels ≥ 2 mg/l, and triglyceride concentrations < 500 mg/dl. Individuals allocated to receive rosuvastatin 20 mg daily with baseline and on-treatment lipids and lipoproteins were examined in relation to the primary endpoint of incident CVD (nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, arterial revascularization, or cardiovascular death).

Results

Using separate multivariate Cox models, statistically significant associations of a similar magnitude with residual risk of CVD were found for on-treatment LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B/A-I. The respective adjusted standardized hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for each of these measures were 1.31 (1.09 to 1.56), 1.25 (1.04 to 1.50), 1.27 (1.06 to 1.53), 1.22 (1.03 to 1.44), 1.29 (1.09 to 1.52), and 1.27 (1.09 to 1.49). The overall residual risk and the risk associated with these measures decreased among participants achieving on-treatment LDL-C ≤ 70 mg/dl, on-treatment non-HDL-C ≤ 100 mg/dl, or on-treatment apolipoprotein B ≤ 80 mg/dl. In contrast, on-treatment triglycerides showed no association with CVD.

Conclusions

In this primary prevention trial of nondiabetic individuals with low LDL-C and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, on-treatment LDL-C was as valuable as non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein B, or ratios in predicting residual risk.

### Statins for the "SMuRFLess but inflamed": silent vascular inflammation and the challenge of translational science [^7051818c]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

In the realm of primary prevention, clinical guidelines in 2000 suggested that statins be initiated to reduce the risk of first cardiovascular events among those with LDL-C levels above 160 mg/dL and that therapy should be titrated to an LDL-C treatment target of 130 mg/dL. Yet, the clinical community long understood that the majority of first cardiovascular events occurred among individuals whose native LDL-C levels were below these screening and target thresholds.

To address this problem, working with Tony Gotto and the AFCAPS/TexCAPS (Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study) investigators, we observed in 2001 that primary prevention patients with elevated hsCRP had fewer heart attacks and strokes when treated with lovastatin as compared with placebo even when native LDL-C levels were low. This post hoc hypothesis generating observation would become the basis for the large-scale JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) primary prevention trial.

The JUPITER trial was designed in 2002 to include individuals who would not receive statin therapy under existing guidelines, as they had LDL-C levels well below existing statin treatment targets, yet who were at increased cardiovascular risk due to levels of hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L. Despite the low LDL-C levels among trial participants and a focus in primary prevention, we nonetheless elected to use rosuvastatin 20 mg believing that there was no reason not to give a high-intensity regimen.

As reported in 2008, rosuvastatin allocation as compared with placebo lowered LDL-C by 50% and hsCRP by 37% among the 17,802 primary prevention participants enrolled. After a median follow-up of 2 years (maximum 5 years), the trial Data and Safety Monitoring Board stopped the JUPITER trial due to a 44% reduction in the trial primary endpoint (P < 0.000001), a 54% reduction in myocardial infarction (P = 0.0002), a 48% reduction in stroke (P = 0.002), a 47% reduction in hospitalization for unstable angina or need for urgent revascularization (P < 0.00001), a 43% reduction in venous thromboembolism (P = 0.002), and a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality (P = 0.02).

### Impact of statin therapy in heart Failure Patients: results of a large real-world experience [^b3de0606]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large, single health care system experience, which system offers advanced HF services, statin treatment in patients with HFrEF was common (64% of subjects), and outcomes were favorable. Although statin use was associated with a greater burden of baseline ASCVD risk factors, it also was associated with a lower risk of MACE during follow-up, including after adjustment for the differing baseline characteristics. Risk was lower not only for 2 definitions of MACE but for each of its components (death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and HF hospitalization). Benefit was observed both for the primary and for the secondary risk cohort and for prior/ongoing as well as new/post-entry statin prescription. Furthermore, the longer the patient was on a statin, the greater the reduction in risk of a cardiovascular event. These multiple observations are mutually supportive of a beneficial impact of statin therapy in HFrEF patients clinically selected for treatment. Furthermore, no adverse safety signals associated with treatment were reported.

Literature insights and comparisons

Statins (HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors) received intensive investigative attention during the 1990s and the first decade of the current millennium, and randomized clinical trials firmly established the role of statins in ASCVD prevention. A 2005 meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials in 90,056 patients demonstrated that statin therapy could reduce the 5-year incidence of major coronary events, revascularization, and stroke by about one-fifth per mmol/L reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and this benefit was largely independent of the initial lipid profile. A 2010 update, which included 26 trials comprising 170,000 patients, confirmed this benefit and demonstrated that further reductions in LDL-C achieved by more intensive therapy safely produced additional reductions in cardiovascular events. The JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) (2008) provided a strong impetus for the treatment of high-risk primary prevention subjects (ie, with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), demonstrating a 44% reduction in the primary ischemic event endpoint with rosuvastatin 20 mg daily.

### Optimal target of LDL cholesterol level for statin treatment: challenges to monotonic relationship with cardiovascular events [^3c9098a8]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The primary mechanism of statins for the prevention of cardiovascular events depends on lowering LDL-C. On the other hand, it has been proposed that statins also exert cardiovascular protective effects that are independent of LDL-C called pleiotropic effects. Among various pleiotropic effects, the anti-inflammatory properties of statins have been the focus of a number of clinical trials. The Myocardial Ischemia Reduction With Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) trial was an acute coronary syndrome trial comparing atorvastatin 80 mg/day with placebo. Atorvastatin lowered the primary endpoint in patients with both high and normal LDL-C and also lowered the level of hsCRP by 83%. JUPITER was a primary prevention trial of rosuvastatin in patients with LDL-C levels < 130 mg/dl and CRP ≥ 0.2 mg/dl. The main analysis of JUPITER found that rosuvastatin reduced LDL-C by 50%, hsCRP level by 37%, and the primary endpoint by 44%. Plotting the expected benefit from JUPITER based on LDL-C lowering on the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) collaboration regression line suggests that the achieved benefit may be greater than the expected benefit based on LDL-C reduction alone. These observations suggest rationales for statin therapy targeting inflammation. The Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS), which was a non-statin intervention trial for CAD, demonstrated that anti-inflammatory therapy targeting the interleukin-1β innate immunity pathway with canakinumab at a dose of 150 mg every 3 months led to a significantly lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events than placebo, independent of LDL-C lowering. Therefore, anti-inflammatory interventions as well as LDL-C lowering might be beneficial in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with CAD. In the present subanalysis, we demonstrated that a threshold value of LDL-C was present and that it was 70 mg/dl for the primary composite outcome. From our results, we can envision that therapy targeting residual risk factors beyond LDL-C, including inflammation, would be promising, for secondary prevention in CAD patients with LDL-C < 70 mg/dl. Also, in the REAL-CAD study, another subanalysis focused on hsCRP levels is currently in progress.

### Rosuvastatin slows progression of carotid intima-media thickness: the METEOR-China randomized controlled study [^2672bc42]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

The METEOR-China results are further supported by the results from the primary prevention JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin). JUPITER, which was conducted outside of China, showed a significant reduction in a combined end point comprising myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes with rosuvastatin 20 mg/d versus placebo in 17 802 seemingly healthy participants without elevated LDL-C levels but with elevated C-reactive protein levels. The global HOPE-3 trial (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-3), which included 12 705 participants of whom 3691 were Chinese, compared treatment with rosuvastatin 10 mg/d with placebo and showed superiority to placebo in diminishing cardiovascular events, with no racial differences regarding efficacy and safety.METEOR-China adds to the evidence base of CIMT randomized controlled studies that showed results congruent with studies that had morbidity and mortality as outcomes.

Strengths of METEOR-China are that in its design and analysis it included various features to proactively reduce measurement error and residual confounding: it involved a placebo group; included a clinically relevant Chinese population; had objective, blinded CIMT measurements analyzed by batch reading; used core laboratories for CIMT and blood samples; and provided extensive training and quality control of sonographers and readers. No attempt was made for imputing missing data since it has been shown that this does not aid in obtaining valid estimates in CIMT trials. However, the results may have limited generalizability, considering the intentionally limited ethnic and racial diversity of study participants.

Material and Methods

Study Design and Population

The primary study population is derived from a primary‐prevention randomized controlled clinical trial of rosuvastatin 20 mg versus placebo (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin, JUPITER; NCT00239681). 10 The JUPITER trial randomized individuals (women ≥ 60 years, men ≥ 50 years) without prior history of CVD or diabetes mellitus, all of whom had LDL‐c < 130 mg/dL, high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hsCRP ≥ 2.0 mg/L), and triglycerides ≤ 500 mg/dL. The relative risk reduction for the primary incident CVD end point was 44%. 10

We performed 1 H NMR lipoprotein measurements on fasting blood samples from 11 984 participants (of whom 9222 also had 1‐year samples) who consented to and provided additional blood collection with sufficient plasma available. In the placebo‐allocated arm, baseline lipoprotein measurements were used to identify lipoproteins associated with risk of incident CVD in untreated individuals. In the statin‐allocated arm, (1) change in lipoprotein measurements from baseline to 12 months after randomization was used to understand the effects of statin therapy on lipoprotein subfractions, and (2) on‐statin (12 month) lipoprotein measurements were used to identify lipoproteins associated with residual on‐statin risk of incident CVD.

### The JUPITER study: biomarkers plus statin vs. lifestyle… [^244b41b0]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

The JUPITER study shows that if healthy older adults with normal cholesterol and high C-reactive protein levels take rosuvastatin daily for two years, they are likely to experience some benefit. First, let us take a look at some of the details of the JUPITER study. It was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial conducted at 1, 315 sites in 26 countries; each site contributed an average of about 13 patients. It is difficult to ensure high-level quality control over 1, 315 sites with small patient numbers. The study also may have commercial bias. In addition to the study being sponsored by the manufacturer of rosuvastatin, the principal investigator has numerous ties to pharmaceutical companies and holds patents on the use of high-sensitivity CRP levels in evaluating cardiovascular risk.

All potentially eligible patients underwent a four-week run-in phase during which they received placebo. This means that 2, 000 adults in the relevant age group would have to be screened to identify 250 patients with a combination of low levels of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and high levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. 3 ARIC, 4 Health Professionals Follow-up Study, 5 and Nurses' Health Study 6) are even better. The JUPITER study shows a 44 percent reduction in cardiovascular deaths, whereas the healthy lifestyle studies show a 50 to 60 percent reduction. Lifestyle interventions are also far cheaper to implement. Not surprisingly, rosuvastatin appeared to offer some clinically significant benefit. However, the benefit falls far short of other approaches, particularly lifestyle interventions. This is a point that family physician, John Abramson, MD, has extensively documented in his book.

The biggest problem with the JUPITER study is that it suggests that physicians continue to test and treat. First, though, we need to take time to think. One of the things to ponder is this: Couldn't we do something better for patients than measuring everyone's CRP levels and treating those with elevated values. Instead, we should wait for a study comparing CRP measurement to routine coronary risk factor assessment, including studies on cost-benefit analysis. We already know that lifestyle changes are effective and, therefore, we should focus on innovative ways to assist patients in making these changes.

Methods

Study Population

JUPITER (No.: NCT00239681) was a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial that evaluated rosuvastatin 20 mg daily versus placebo in the primary prevention of first major CVD events among 17 802 apparently healthy men ≥ 50 years and women ≥ 60 years with low low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C; < 130 mg/dL), but who were at increased risk of cardiovascular events on the basis of elevated hsCRP (≥ 2 mg/L). 9 Key exclusion criteria for JUPITER included previous or current use of lipid‐lowering therapy, current use of postmenopausal hormonal therapy, diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory conditions, such as severe arthritis, lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, or treatment with immunosuppressant medications. The trial protocol required study participants to provide a baseline blood sample before randomization and after 1 year on study treatment. Study participants were also requested, but not required, to provide samples for additional phenotyping. For this study, we analyzed a total of 12 527 participants who provided a sufficient blood sample at baseline for NMR GlycA measurements; and of these, 10 039 participants had a sufficient blood sample at both baseline and at 1 year. The JUPITER trial protocol was approved by the local institutional review board at each participating center, and all study participants provided written informed consent.

### Statin therapy and risk of fracture: results from the JUPITER randomized clinical trial [^f1d4a585]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease may share common biological pathways, with inflammation playing a role in the development of both. Although observational studies have suggested that statin use is associated with a lower risk of fractures, randomized trial data addressing this issue are scant.

Objective

To determine whether statin therapy reduces the risk of fracture and, in a secondary analysis, whether baseline levels of the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are associated with the risk of fracture.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial was an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling 17,802 men older than 50 years and women older than 60 years with hs-CRP level of at least 2 mg/L. Participants were screened from 2003 to 2006 and observed prospectively for up to 5 years (median follow-up, 1.9 years).

Intervention

Rosuvastatin calcium, 20 mg daily, or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident fracture was a prespecified secondary end point of JUPITER. Fractures were confirmed by radiographs, computed tomography, bone scan, or other methods. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals for the risk of fracture according to randomized treatment assignment, as well as increasing tertiles of hs-CRP, controlling for potential confounders.

Results

During the study, 431 incident fractures were reported and confirmed. Among participants allocated to rosuvastatin, 221 fractures were confirmed, compared with 210 among those allocated to placebo, such that the incidence of fracture in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups was 1.20 and 1.14 per 100 person-years, respectively (adjusted HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.88–1.28]; P = 0.53). Overall, increasing baseline hs-CRP level was not associated with an increased risk of fractures (adjusted HR for each unit increase in hs-CRP tertile, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.94–1.20]; P for trend, .34).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among men and women with elevated hs-CRP level enrolled in a large trial of rosuvastatin therapy for cardiovascular disease, statin therapy did not reduce the risk of fracture. Higher baseline hs-CRP level was not associated with an increased risk of incident fracture.

### Rosuvastatin (Ezallor sprinkle) [^1549e961]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary end point was a composite end point consisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major CV events: CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or an arterial revascularization procedure.

Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of major CV events (252 events in the placebo group vs. 142 events in the rosuvastatin group) with a statistically significant (p < 0.001) relative risk reduction of 44% and absolute risk reduction of 1.2% (see Figure 1). The risk reduction for the primary end point was consistent across the following predefined subgroups: age, sex, race, smoking status, family history of premature CHD, body mass index, LDL-C, HDL-C, and hsCRP levels.

Figure 1. Time to First Occurrence of Major CV Events in JUPITER

The individual components of the primary end point are presented in Figure 3. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and arterial revascularization procedures. There were no significant treatment differences between the rosuvastatin and placebo groups for death due to CV causes or hospitalizations for unstable angina.

Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (6 fatal events and 62 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 9 fatal events and 22 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin-treated subjects) and the risk of stroke (6 fatal events and 58 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 3 fatal events and 30 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin-treated subjects).

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^a5c4f67e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in HIV — evidence and recommendation: Although hs-CRP is valuable to discriminate individuals at higher risk of CVD events in the HIV seronegative population, the data are not as clear in those with HIV infection. In a single center database, Triant and colleagues studied 70,357 patients with hs-CRP measured and found an increased risk of acute MI with elevated hs-CRP in HIV-infected individuals (OR 2.51), but bias in who was tested (n = 487 vs n = 729) and the lack of an absolute cut-off limit generalizability. Elevated CRP prior to initiation of ART was associated with a higher risk of progression to AIDS, CRP levels did not decline after 96 weeks with efavirenz, and in a randomized trial of pravastatin and fenofibrate there was no change in hs-CRP despite declines in LDL-C and TG, whereas in JUPITER the 44% risk reduction with rosuvastatin was associated with a decline in hs-CRP. However, until such time, the use of hs-CRP to adjudicate CVD risk in persons with HIV is not recommended.

Efficacy of Rosuvastatin According to Baseline GlycA

In an analysis that examined participants based on 8 categories that took both treatment assignment and GlycA levels according to quartiles into account, those who were on placebo and had GlycA levels ≤ 364 μmol/L (first quartile) were considered as the referent. For both placebo and rosuvaststin, there was a suggested trend of increasing risk with increasing baseline GlycA levels; however, at each level, the rosuvastatin group had lower risk (Figure 4 A). Consequently, rosuvastatin therapy had similar efficacy regardless of GlycA levels (Figure 4 B), with estimates centered around that reported in the original JUPITER trial (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46–0.69).

### Longitudinal assessment of estimated glomerular filtration rate in apparently healthy adults: a post hoc analysis from the JUPITER study (justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin) [^4eb901f9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Serum creatinine-based estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are frequently used to identify patients with chronic kidney disease and assess cardiovascular risk both in clinical trials and in clinical practice. Although change in eGFR may be useful to assess change in renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease, the utility of serum creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain, particularly among individuals with normal or only mildly impaired renal function.

Objective

The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between baseline serum creatinine and eGFR, as well as changes in these parameters, in apparently healthy adults in a post hoc analysis of data obtained in participants in the JUPITER study (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin).

Methods

JUPITER was a randomized study of rosuvastatin 20 mg versus placebo in apparently healthy adults with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels ≥ 2.0 mg/L, LDL-C < 130 mg/dL, and serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL. Changes from baseline in serum creatinine and eGFR, based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, were assessed in the entire population and in subsets classified according to baseline eGFR status.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the 16,279 JUPITER study participants (mean age, 66 years; 62% men; 72% white; and 58% with a history of hypertension) who had both a baseline and ≥ 1 postbaseline serum creatinine measurement were similar to the entire population of 17,802 patients who entered the trial. The mean age of the study population was 66 years, 62% were men, 72% were white, and 58% had a history of hypertension. Mean (SD) serum creatinine increased from baseline by 0.08 (0.16) mg/dL and 0.09 (0.14) mg/dL in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.001) at year 1 and by 0.09 (0.18) and 0.10 (0.16) mg/dL (P = 0.0045) at the final visit. Reductions in MDRD and CKD-EPI eGFR were ∼ 0.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2) greater with placebo than with rosuvastatin (P < 0.004) at year 1 and the final visit. The magnitude of eGFR change was closely related to baseline eGFR, with greater reductions among subjects with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in both the rosuvastatin and placebo groups. Among those with an eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2), mean changes at year 1 and final visit ranged from -16 to -23 mL/min/1.73 m(2) with MDRD and CKD-EPI, respectively; in contrast, mean changes were < 1 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in subjects with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).

Conclusions

In JUPITER, reductions in MDRD or CKD-EPI eGFR levels were greater in study participants with higher baseline eGFR levels but less in the rosuvastatin than in the placebo group. Future studies are required to assess the reliability of serum creatinine-based estimates of GFR to assess change in renal function, particularly among individuals with normal serum creatinine levels.

The risk reduction for the primary end point was consistent across the following predefined subgroups: age, sex, race, smoking status, family history of premature CHD, body mass index, LDL‑C, HDL‑C, and hsCRP levels.

Figure 1. Time to First Occurrence of Major CV Events in JUPITER

The individual components of the primary end point are presented in Figure 3. CRESTOR significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and arterial revascularization procedures. There were no significant treatment differences between the CRESTOR and placebo groups for death due to CV causes or hospitalizations for unstable angina.

CRESTOR significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (6 fatal events and 62 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 9 fatal events and 22 nonfatal events in CRESTOR-treated subjects) and the risk of stroke (6 fatal events and 58 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 3 fatal events and 30 nonfatal events in CRESTOR-treated subjects).

### Race, ethnicity, and the efficacy of rosuvastatin in primary prevention: the justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial [^183dec62]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of statin treatment in primary prevention of cardiovascular events in different race/ethnic groups.

Background

Clinical trial evidence about the efficacy of statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events among nonwhites is uncertain.

Methods

JUPITER trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of rosuvastatin 20 mg in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, and cardiovascular death included 12,683 whites and 5,117 nonwhites with low-density lipoprotein levels < 130 mg/dL and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels ≥ 2.0 mg/L.

Results

Random allocation to rosuvastatin resulted in a 45% reduction in the primary end point among whites (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95% CI 0.43–0.69) and a 37% reduction among nonwhites (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41–0.99). Blacks (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.35–1.22) and Hispanics (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.25–1.39) had similar risk reductions. Among nonwhites in the placebo group, the stroke rate exceeded the MI rate (0.44 vs 0.20 per 100 person-years); an opposite pattern was observed among whites (0.31 vs 0.42 per 100 person-years). Nonwhites had higher death rates than whites (2.25 vs 0.93 per 100 person-years); however, all-cause mortality was similar at 20% with rosuvastatin treatment in both participant groups.

Conclusions

When used in primary prevention among individuals with low-density lipoprotein < 130 mg/dL and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/L, rosuvastatin significantly reduced first MI, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, and cardiovascular death among whites and nonwhites.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes in the EXAMINE (examination of cardiovascular outcomes with alogliptin versus standard of care) trial [^7ec3faa4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Another key finding of our analysis is that the hsCRP value was independent of, and additive to, the achieved LDL‐C level in predicting future CV events. There has been controversy regarding whether statins have non‐lipid‐lowering pleiotropic benefits. A meta‐regression analysis showed a strong correlation between LDL‐C reduction and hsCRP reduction (r = 0.80, P < .001), and at least 90% of the hsCRP reduction with lipid‐lowering drugs may be explained by the reduction in LDL‐C. 20 This would lead to the conclusion that the potential non‐lipid‐lowering effects of statins on inflammation might be modest in magnitude. In contrast, results from a secondary analysis from the JUPITER trial demonstrated that the correlation between the reduction in hsCRP and the reduction in LDL‐C was relatively weak (r = 0.15) and relative risk for vascular events with rosuvastatin, 20 mg daily, was 0.45 in those who achieved an LDL‐C level < 70 mg/dL, 0.38 in those who achieved an hsCRP level < 2.0 mg/L, and 0.35 in those who achieved both LDL‐C and hsCRP targets together. Thus, the authors concluded that, not only LDL‐C reduction, but also hsCRP reduction, could be induced by statin therapy. 21 Finally, the PROVE IT‐TIMI 22 trial demonstrated that hsCRP reduction is beneficial in preventing vascular events, whether or not LDL‐C levels were reduced to the target value of < 70 mg/dL with statin treatment. 22

### Risk classification in primary prevention of CVD according to QRISK2 and JBS3' heart age', and prevalence of elevated high-sensitivity C reactive protein in the UK cohort of the EURIKA study [^547b3c42]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Results from our analysis demonstrate that a large proportion of patients have clinically relevant elevation in hsCRP levels. This applies across all 10-year risk categories as assessed by QRISK2. Previous work using data from the entire European EURIKA cohort identified similar proportions of patients with elevated hsCRP across risk categories when applying Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) and Framingham Risk (FRS) Scores for CVD risk assessment. For clinical decision-making, this has previously been most relevant in patients classified as intermediate risk by conventional methods. Although not routinely used in the UK, the recent lowering of the threshold for considering initiation of statin treatment by NICE has further weakened the argument for the measurement of hsCRP in intermediate-risk UK patients. Nonetheless, identification of elevated hsCRP still identifies a population for whom a greater absolute benefit of statin therapy might be realised than would otherwise be expected based on their traditional risk factor profile.

The JUPITER trial demonstrated a 44% reduction in cardiovascular events in patients receiving rosuvastatin 20 mg, all of whom had elevated hsCRP levels but a lipid profile that would not warrant statin therapy according to contemporary US clinical guidelines (LDL-cholesterol < 3.4 mmol/L). Indeed, rosuvastatin almost halved major CVD events in those with a 10-year CVD risk of 5%–10% by Framingham Risk Score. A prospective study, conducted in a more general UK population, identified approximately one-fifth of study participants as qualifying for medical therapy under JUPITER criteria who would not be candidates according to established scoring systems, and these subjects had a significantly increased event rate (HR 1.70). Our results reveal a considerable proportion of low-risk patients in the UK (≥ 50 years with one conventional risk factor) with elevated hsCRP levels who may therefore be at higher CVD risk than would be predicted based on conventional assessment methods and who may derive greater absolute clinical benefit from statin therapy with greater cost-effectiveness. However, these numbers would be smaller than those newly eligible through lowering of the conventional CVD risk score threshold from ≥ 20% to ≥ 10%.

Figure 3
Effects of rosuvastatin on myocardial infarction/stroke/cardiovascular death in high-risk patients, according to baseline characteristics. The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for rosuvastatin when compared with placebo are shown for patients with Framingham risk score > 20% and systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% (extrapolated and capped models). Size of the point estimate rectangle is proportional to the number of clinical events. The dashed vertical line indicates the relative risk reduction for the entire trial cohort. Also shown are P- values for the test of an interaction between the composite endpoint and categories within each subgroup.

In the high-risk patients, serious adverse events were reported with similar frequency in rosuvastatin and placebo-allocated patients (Table 4). A small excess of myalgia was reported with rosuvastatin in patients with Framingham risk score > 20% (rosuvastatin 5.9% and placebo 5.3%) or SCORE risk ≥ 5% (rosuvastatin 7.9%, placebo 6.5% for the extrapolated model; 7.4 vs. 5.8% for the capped model). Myopathy, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis were reported with similar frequency in the two treatment groups. In the entire JUPITER cohort, investigator-reported diabetes, a non-adjudicated outcome, was more frequent with rosuvastatin (rosuvastatin 3.0% and placebo 2.4%; P = 0.01). Investigator-reported diabetes was not consistently more frequent with rosuvastatin in the higher-risk patients (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.41–1.19, P = 0.19 for Framingham risk score > 20%; HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.86–1.43, P = 0.43 for extrapolated SCORE risk ≥ 5%; HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.72–1.36, P = 0.95 for capped SCORE risk). At 2 years following randomization, a 0.1% greater increase in glycosylated haemoglobin was observed with rosuvastatin compared with placebo (P < 0.001 vs. placebo for the high-risk groups). However, on-treatment fasting glucose levels were similar in the two treatment groups (P = 0.95 vs. placebo for Framingham risk score > 20%; P = 0.19 for extrapolated SCORE risk ≥ 5%; P = 0.52 for the capped SCORE model).

### Cardiovascular effect of discontinuing statins for primary prevention at the age of 75 years: a nationwide population-based cohort study in France [^342cb78f]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular events after discontinuation of statin therapy

Some studies have tried to specifically address the value of statins in the elderly population. The PROSPER (Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) trialevaluated the effect of pravastatin 40 mg on the risk of cardiovascular events in people aged 70–82 years (mean age 75 years). In the primary prevention subgroup of 3239 patients, statin therapy did not significantly reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke vs. placebo.

Based on data from the JUPITER (Justification for Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial, comparing Rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. placebo in patients with no history of cardiovascular disease and high C-reactive protein and low low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, subgroup analysis in the 5695 participants aged 70 years or older (median age 74 years) showed a significant reduction of cardiovascular events (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46–0.82), but not all-cause mortality (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–1.04).

The meta-analysis of primary prevention by Savarese et al.based on eight trials including 24 674 people over the age of 65 years with a mean age of 73 years concluded that statins vs. placebo significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction by 39.4% (95% CI 15.3–56.6%) and the risk of stroke by 23.8% (95% CI 7.4–37.4%), but statins did not provide any significant benefit on the risk of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.

The recent meta-analysis by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration, based on 28 trials, included a subgroup of 6449 primary prevention patients older than 75 years. Within this subgroup, cardiovascular incidence rates of 2.7 and 2.8 per 100 patient-years were found for the patient groups 'statin or more intensive treatment' and 'controls or less intensive treatment', respectively, corresponding to a rate ratio per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol of 0.92 (95% CI 0.73–1.16).

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein discordance with atherogenic lipid measures and incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in primary prevention: the ARIC study [^49bfc30c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications for JUPITER‐Like Population

The JUPITER trial increased the eligibility of adults for statin therapy in the United States and is the primary evidence behind the most recent guideline recommendations to use a hsCRP level of > 2 mg/L as a risk enhancer in intermediate risk patients. 32 However, Mora et al 33 showed that residual risk associated with elevated hsCRP in the JUPITER trial could be explained by a higher number of atherogenic particles other than LDL‐C. Given the well‐described discordance between LDL‐C and other, more robust atherogenic lipid measures (ie, non–HDL‐C or apolipoprotein B), 9 we further refined the JUPITER population by sequentially adding atherogenic lipid cut points of percentile equivalence to LDL‐C 130 mg/dL in order to fully assess the lipid‐independent risk attributed to hsCRP. We found that after ≈18 years of follow‐up (about 10‐fold longer than median JUPITER follow‐up), baseline hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L was associated with a 32% to 37% increased risk of ASCVD as compared with hsCRP < 2 mg/L among individuals with LDL‐C < 130 mg/dL and simultaneously more favorable levels of non–HDL‐C (< 160 mg/dL), apolipoprotein B (< 102 mg/dL), TC/HDL‐C ratio (< 4.4), and HDL‐C (≥ 50 mg/dL) combined. This increased independent risk was also independent of their global ASCVD risk assessed by the PCE score. We subsequently advanced these concepts by examining whether hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L was associated with an increased risk of ASCVD when atherogenic lipid levels were as low as LDL‐C < 100 mg/dL, as recommended by some guidelines for high‐risk patients, and percentile equivalent values of non–HDL‐C, apolipoprotein B, and TC/HDL‐C. The results were all consistent, suggesting that we ought to reemphasize the importance of using high‐intensity statin therapy, as recommended by JUPITER, in individuals with hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L regardless of their lipid levels or PCE risk score.

But is heightened inflammation, in primary prevention, also associated with other clinical outcomes over a long period of follow‐up? We were able to show that hsCRP is consistently associated with the risk of incident HF and all‐cause death, which suggests the possibility that inflammation reduction might have a broad favorable impact on several clinical outcomes, as proposed by other studies. 25, 34

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^64bcc377]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy among US Hispanic/Latino adults — trial evidence and safety — shows that in the Study Assessing Rosuvastatin in Hispanic Population, 696 Hispanic individuals ≥ 18 years (mean age 57.9 years) with LDL-C 130–300 mg/dL, TG < 400 mg/dL, and 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk ≥ 10% had reductions in total-C, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and apo B with rosuvastatin or atorvastatin, with adverse events mild/moderate and no clinically relevant increases in serum creatine kinase, myopathy, or rhabdomyolysis. In JUPITER among persons with LDL-C < 130 mg/dL and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) ≥ 2.0 mg/L, Hispanic participants (n = 2261) on rosuvastatin had a 42% lower risk of the primary endpoint, with HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.25–1.39], similar to NHWs with HR 0.55 [95% CI 0.43–0.69]; new-onset diabetes did not differ for Hispanics (P = 0.41). In ALLHAT-LLT (10,355 individuals ≥ 55 years; 23% Hispanic, 38% black) who had LDL-C levels of 120–189 mg/dL (100–129 mg/dL among those with history of CHD), TG < 350 mg/dL, and hypertension plus at least 1 other CVD risk factor, pravastatin lowered lipids at 4 years of follow-up but did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality (RR 0.99 [95% CI 0.89–1.11]) or fatal/non-fatal CHD events (RR 0.91 [95% CI 0.79–1.04]) versus usual care, and Hispanic-specific outcomes were not reported separately. Overall, the page notes there are "no clear differences in responsiveness among Hispanics/ Latinos with regard to the lipid effects of statins or the risk reduction associated with statin therapy".

JUPITER primary prevention in women — trial outcomes and synthesis: The JUPITER randomized trial included 6801 women and 11,001 men receiving rosuvastatin 20 mg vs placebo, and rosuvastatin produced similar, statistically significant reductions in the composite primary endpoint in women (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37–0.80; P = 0.002) and men (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.45–0.73; P < .001). In a meta-analysis restricted to exclusively primary prevention trials in women (AFCAPS/TexCAPS, MEGA, and JUPITER), statins reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (summary RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.49–0.82; P < .001; P for heterogeneity = 0.56), whereas adding predominantly primary prevention trials (ASCOT-LLA and ALLHAT-LLT) yielded a higher, non–statistically significant summary RR (0.79; 95% CI 0.59–1.05; P = 0.11; P for heterogeneity = 0.053); for total mortality in the 2 exclusively primary prevention trials (n = 13,154 women, 216 deaths), the summary RR was 0.78 (95% CI 0.53–1.15; P = 0.21).

### Effects of statin therapy according to plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration in the controlled rosuvastatin multinational trial in heart failure (CORONA): a retrospective analysis [^754d794b]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We examined whether the antiinflammatory action of statins may be of benefit in heart failure, a state characterized by inflammation in which low cholesterol is associated with worse outcomes.

Methods and Results

We compared 10 mg rosuvastatin daily with placebo in patients with ischemic systolic heart failure according to baseline high sensitivity-C reactive protein (hs-CRP) < 2.0 mg/L (placebo, n = 779; rosuvastatin, n = 777) or ≥ 2.0 mg/L (placebo, n = 1694; rosuvastatin, n = 1711). The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Baseline low-density lipoprotein was the same, and rosuvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein by 47% in both hs-CRP groups. Median hs-CRP was 1.10 mg/L in the lower and 5.60 mg/L in the higher hs-CRP group, with higher hs-CRP associated with worse outcomes. The change in hs-CRP with rosuvastatin from baseline to 3 months was -6% in the low hs-CRP group (27% with placebo) and -33.3% in the high hs-CRP group (-11.1% with placebo). In the high hs-CRP group, 548 placebo-treated (14.0 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 498 rosuvastatin-treated (12.2 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) patients had a primary end point (hazard ratio of placebo to rosuvastatin, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.98; P = 0.024). In the low hs-CRP group, 175 placebo-treated (8.9 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 188 rosuvastatin-treated (9.8 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) patients experienced this outcome (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.34; P > 0.2; P for interaction = 0.062). The numbers of deaths were as follows: 581 placebo-treated (14.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 532 rosuvastatin-treated (12.6 per 100 patient-years) patients in the high hs-CRP group (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.00; P = 0.050) and 170 placebo-treated (8.3 per 100 patient-years) and 192 rosuvastatin-treated (9.7 per 100 patient-years) patients in the low hs-CRP group (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.43; P = 0.14; P for interaction = 0.026).

Conclusions

In this retrospective hypothesis-generating study, we found a significant interaction between hs-CRP and the effect of rosuvastatin for most end points whereby rosuvastatin treatment was associated with better outcomes in patients with hs-CRP ≥ 2.0 mg/L.

### Circulating N-linked glycoprotein side-chain biomarker, rosuvastatin therapy, and incident cardiovascular disease: an analysis from the JUPITER trial [^e8b538ac]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

GlycA, a novel protein glycan biomarker of N ‐acetyl side chains of acute‐phase proteins, was recently associated with incident cardiovascular disease in healthy women. Whether GlycA predictsevents in the setting of statin therapy in men and women withoutbut with evidence of chronic inflammation is unknown.

Methods and Results

In the Justfication for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin trial (00239681), participants with low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol < 130 mg/dL and high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs) ≥ 2 mg/L were randomized to rosuvastatin 20 mg/day or placebo. GlycA was quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 12 527 before randomization and 10 039 participants at 1 year. A total of 310 first primaryevents occurred during maximum follow‐up of 5.0 years (median, 1.9). GlycA changed minimally after 1 year on study treatment: 6.8% and 4.7% decrease in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups, respectively. Overall, baseline GlycA levels were associated with increased risk of: multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratio perincrement, 1.20 (95%, 1.08–1.34; P = 0.0006). After additionally adjusting for hs, this was slightly attenuated (HR, 1.18; 95%, 1.04–1.35; P = 0.01). On‐treatment GlycA levels were also associated with; corresponding multivariable‐adjusteds perbefore and after additionally adjusting for hs: 1.27 (95%, 1.13–1.42; P < 0.0001) and 1.24 (95%, 1.07–1.44; P = 0.004), respectively. Tests for heterogeneity by treatment arm were not significant (P for interaction, > 0.20).

Conclusion

In thetrial, increased levels of GlycA were associated with an increased risk ofevents independent of traditional risk factors and hs.

Association of Baseline and On‐Treatment GlycA With CVD

Among 12 527 JUPITER participants with baseline GlycA levels, the study primary outcome was confirmed in 310 participants over a maximum follow‐up of 5.0 years (median, 1.9). Of these, 201 (1.6%) primary events occurred in the placebo group and 109 (0.87%) in the rosuvastatin group, the proportion of these were similar to those observed in the overall JUPITER trial. 9 The cumulative primary event rates diverged increasingly according to quartiles of GlycA with the lowest and highest events rates found in quartiles 1 and 4, respectively (log‐rank, P < 0.0001; Figure 2 and Table 4). In a multivariable model that included age, race, sex, randomized treatment assignment, smoking, blood pressure, body mass index, fasting glucose, LDL‐C, HDL‐C, triglycerides, and family history of premature coronary disease, HRs for the primary endpoint for quartiles 1 to 4 of baseline GlycA were 1.00, 1.05 (95% CI, 0.74–1.49), 1.23 (95% CI, 0.88–1.72), and 1.57 (95% CI, 1.12–2.18; P linear trend = 0.004). This association was slightly attenuated, but remained statistically significant, after adjustment for hsCRP: HR for quartile 4 versus 1 was 1.45 (95% CI, 1.01–2.10; P linear trend = 0.03). Risk estimates per SD increase in baseline GlycA levels were 1.20 (95% CI, 1.08–1.34; P = 0.0006) and 1.18 (95% CI, 1.04–1.35; P = 0.01) in the corresponding multivariable adjusted models (Table 4). Results were similar when baseline GlycA was examined in relation to the expanded primary endpoint that included all‐cause death (528 events); the HR in the fully adjusted model for quartile 4 versus 1 was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.38–2.42; P linear trend < 0.0001), with a corresponding HR per SD increase in baseline GlycA of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.15–1.37; P < 0.0001; Table 4).

### Effects of statin therapy on diagnoses of new-onset diabetes and worsening glycaemia in large-scale randomised blinded statin trials: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^13f0d839]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

A comparison of the cardiovascular benefits and risks of diabetes from statin therapy based on the results of the JUPITER trialpreviously concluded that the cardiovascular benefits of rosuvastatin greatly outweighed the risks of new-onset diabetes, despite this trial being conducted in a primary prevention setting among apparently healthy people (without hyperlipidaemia but with increased concentration of CRP on a high-sensitivity CRP test). Notably, vascular benefits of statin therapy represent the net effect of the aggregate effects of statins on blood lipids and glycaemia, such that any theoretical adverse effects of statins on cardiovascular risk that might arise from small increases in glycaemia (or, indeed, from any other mechanism) are already accounted for in the overall reduction in cardiovascular risk that is seen with statin therapy in these trials. Furthermore, the risk of future new major vascular events is significantly greater following major vascular events than following a diagnosis of diabetes. It was not possible to assess clinically significant microvascular complications of diabetes in our analyses both because of the absence of longer-term adverse event data (since development of such complications typically requires many years of exposure to poor glycaemic control) and the absence of any consistent detailed diagnostic information (eg, retinal photographs and measures of microalbuminuria or proteinuria). However, in a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing less intensive with more intensive glucose control, there was a 20% relative increase in risk of clinically significant renal complications (absolute excess risk 0·4% per year) and a 13% relative increase in risk of clinically significant retinal complications (absolute excess risk 0·2% per year) due to exposure to 0·9% higher HbA 1c over 5 years in major diabetes trials, so the changes induced by a statin are likely to be too small to result in a material change in the risk of microvascular disease in people with diabetes.

Methods

The data supporting the findings of this study are available to researchers on request from the JUPITER Data Usage Review Committee. Institutional review board approval for this study was obtained from Partners HealthCare (Boston, MA), and all participants provided written informed consent. The first and last authors had full access to all data in the study and take responsibility for their integrity and data analysis.

Study Population

This case‐control study was nested in the JUPITER trial (No.: NCT00239681), 21 as previously described. 16 In brief, JUPITER was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of rosuvastatin 20 mg daily versus placebo in the primary prevention of CVD in 17 802 asymptomatic men ≥ 50 years and women ≥ 60 years with low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) < 130 mg/dL and hsCRP (high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein) ≥ 2.0 mg/L who were monitored for a median follow‐up period of 1.9 years (maximum 5 years). Exclusion criteria for JUPITER included previous or current use of lipid‐lowering therapy, triglycerides > 500 mg/dL, diabetes mellitus, use of postmenopausal hormonal therapy, and specific inflammatory conditions such as severe arthritis, lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, or treatment with immunosuppressant medications. The trial protocol required measuring standard lipids and hsCRP at baseline and after 12 months of study treatment. Additional phenotyping was also done on samples that were voluntarily provided by 11 953 (67%) of the participants.

This nested case‐control cohort sample of 1034 individuals with available baseline blood samples is comprised of 517 incident cases of myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, arterial revascularization, CVD death, and all‐cause mortality matched in a 1:1 ratio based on age (± 2 years) and sex to controls who were selected using risk set sampling. 15, 22, 23 Secondary analysis excluded 209 cases with non‐CVD death resulting in 308 pairs. In exploratory analyses, we also examined non‐CVD and all‐cause mortality.

Discordance Using Median Cutpoints

Over a median follow‐up of 18.4 years (interquartile range, 12.8–19.5), there were 1574 incident ASCVD events (713 had definite/probable myocardial infarction, 304 had coronary death, 557 had definite/probable stroke). Figures 1 and 2 show Kaplan–Meier curves for hsCRP greater than or equal to cut points versus hsCRP less than cut points across various lipid groups. Table 2 shows the prospective analysis for hazard of incident ASCVD by hsCRP level (less than/greater than or equal to median) across triple and quadruple lipid measures stratified by less than/greater than or equal to median cut points. We observed a significant independent ≈30% to 60% increase in ASCVD risk in individuals with hsCRP greater than or equal to median versus less than median regardless of levels of triple or quadruple lipid measures even after adjusting for multiple factors known to be associated with ASCVD and log‐triglyceride levels (Table 2). Of note, this increased risk of ASCVD was similar in our supplementary analysis across all lipid groups starting from discordance with LDL‐C only to the gradual addition of other lipid measures (Table S1).

Statins — across guidelines, statins remain first-line therapy for mitigating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–driven atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; although statins do not lower Lp(a) and may slightly increase it, they reduce major adverse cardiovascular events by "approximately 22% for each 1-mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C". Median Lp(a) was not affected by rosuvastatin in JUPITER, and on-treatment Lp(a) increases with statins are minimal on average ("approximate 1.1-mg/dL increase or 0.1% relative increase"). Concerns about Lp(a) elevation "should not be a reason to discourage or discontinue statins".

Discussion

The current meta-analysis totalled 70 388 participants without established cardiovascular disease but with cardiovascular risk factors who were randomised to statin therapy or control. Statin therapy was associated with a significant risk reduction in all cause mortality of 12%, in major coronary events of 30%, and in major cerebrovascular events of 19%. Moreover, statin use was not associated with an increased risk of cancer. These results are in line with those previously published on the effects of statins in secondary prevention.

Our meta-analysis differs from earlier analyses in several ways. We were able to include several recently published studies targeted at primary prevention that enrolled a large number of women and people with diabetes. w1-w3 For example, the Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the Primary Prevention Group of Adult Japanese trial (MEGA) w2 comprised a large number of women (68%, 5356/7832), and we were able to obtain subgroup data. Additionally, the Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus study (ASPEN) w3 was carried out in a large group of people with type 2 diabetes (n = 1905) who did not have established cardiovascular disease. We also included data from the recently published JUPITER trial, w1 totalling 17 802 participants with no apparent vascular disease, low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels less than 3.4 mmol/l, and increased levels of high sensitivity C reactive protein (> 2.0 mg/l). w1 As our study is based on such large numbers, this meta-analysis, including the subgroups, has significant statistical power. Previously, only the JUPITER trial showed improved survival associated with statin use in high risk participants, but it is clear from the current analysis that a mortality benefit is a shared characteristic of long term statin use in people without previous cardiovascular disease. The currently observed benefit, a 12% risk reduction in mortality, may even be an underestimation of the true effect because subsequent death after a morbid cardiovascular event was not always considered in individual trials.

VA/DoD dyslipidemia — primary prevention dosing (Recommendation 8) advises that for primary prevention in patients on moderate-dose statins, "we suggest against maximizing the statin dose due to the lack of evidence proving added cardiovascular benefits and the risks of higher dose statins" and rates this as "(Weak against | Reviewed, New-replaced)". Supporting evidence states the review "found no evidence that high-dose statins offer additional benefit over moderate-dose statins in the prevention of CV events or mortality for primary prevention", notes "There are no studies that directly compare high-dose to moderate-dose statins in a primary prevention population", and specifies that the only major high-dose primary prevention trial, JUPITER, "compared rosuvastatin 20 mg daily to placebo".

JUPITER trial exploratory analysis — older subgroup outcomes and monitoring details: An exploratory analysis compared outcomes in 5695 participants age 70–97 years to those age 50–69 years old. Within this older subgroup, rosuvastatin reduced major ASCVD events by 39% with favorable point estimates for cardiovascular death and total mortality and greater absolute reductions in major ASCVD events compared to the younger group. Assessment for adverse effects, and measurements of lipid levels, liver function tests, and hemoglobin A1C occurred every six months.
