## Question

Can you treat pneumonia with oral steroids?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether oral steroids should be used to treat pneumonia, and if so, in whom, how, and why or why not. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "pneumonia" means clinically and how severity is defined. Then, I should verify what the highest-quality randomized trials show for severe versus non-severe disease. Next, I will review contemporary guideline positions and reconcile any apparent contradictions. After that, I need to check dosing, duration, and route, including whether oral therapy is acceptable. Finally, I should weigh benefits versus harms, consider special populations, and synthesize a practical recommendation with monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: when we say "pneumonia", we are generally referring to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized adults, and severity is typically stratified by ICU admission, high CURB-65 or PSI, or hypoxemia, which distinguishes severe CAP from non-severe CAP. This matters because benefits and harms of steroids appear to vary by severity and inflammatory phenotype, so I need to ensure I'm anchoring recommendations to these strata [^111GQZsG].

> Now, I should review the randomized evidence for severe CAP. The CAPE COD trial in ICU patients with severe CAP showed that low-dose hydrocortisone reduced 30-day mortality compared with placebo, and this signal has been echoed by meta-analyses focused on severe disease, with hydrocortisone appearing to drive the mortality benefit more consistently than other agents, although I should acknowledge heterogeneity and the need for more head-to-head trials [^116Hmoeb] [^116ULE3m] [^111GQZsG].

> Wait, let me verify the non-severe CAP data. In contrast to severe disease, large pragmatic trials and meta-analyses in non-severe CAP generally show no mortality benefit and sometimes signal harm, with the Swiss multicenter RCT showing faster clinical stability but more hyperglycemia and no mortality difference, and an individual patient data meta-analysis showing shorter time to stability and length of stay but increased hyperglycemia and more CAP-related rehospitalizations, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize benefits to non-severe patients [^116K73ZA] [^116wTgqM] [^114RQ84x].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure alignment. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline recommended against routine corticosteroids in both non-severe and severe CAP, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this was based on earlier, mixed evidence, and more recent focused updates from SCCM/ESICM and ATS 2025 now recommend systemic corticosteroids for severe bacterial CAP while advising against routine use in non-severe CAP, reflecting the newer RCT signal and subgroup effects, so the apparent contradiction is resolved by the timing and weight of evidence [^117QXQ9A] [^116LeFzN] [^116arY2y] [^111B5t6z].

> I need to check dosing and duration. Typical regimens used in trials and endorsed by guidelines are low-to-moderate doses for 5–7 days, with examples including prednisone 40–50 mg daily, methylprednisolone 32–40 mg daily, dexamethasone 6–8 mg daily, or hydrocortisone 200–300 mg/day in divided doses, and importantly, oral administration is acceptable given bioequivalence for most agents, which supports feasibility outside the ICU when clinically appropriate [^112nc1MD] [^11123BCv].

> Hold on, I should verify the harm profile. Across trials, the most consistent adverse effect is hyperglycemia requiring treatment, with signals for increased CAP-related rehospitalization in some analyses, whereas serious infections and GI bleeding have not consistently increased in short courses, though vigilance is warranted, particularly in diabetes, older adults, and immunocompromised hosts [^116wTgqM] [^115pdQPm].

> Let me consider special populations. In immunocompromised patients, prolonged or higher-dose steroids increase infection risk and should be used only with compelling indications and close monitoring, in COPD exacerbations short courses improve outcomes but longer courses increase pneumonia risk, and in COVID-19 pneumonia, dexamethasone reduces mortality in those requiring oxygen or mechanical ventilation, reinforcing that steroid benefit is context- and severity-dependent rather than universal [^1129oQWf] [^1111cf8t] [^1153b4ZV].

> But wait, what if the pneumonia is viral influenza? I should confirm that guidelines still advise against routine steroids in severe influenza pneumonia due to potential harm and lack of benefit, so steroids are not indicated for influenza-associated CAP outside research settings or exceptional circumstances [^111mMKdw].

> I will now examine practical implementation. For adults hospitalized with severe bacterial CAP, I would consider a short course of systemic corticosteroids, preferably hydrocortisone given the strongest and most consistent signal, or an oral equivalent such as prednisone 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days if enteral absorption is reliable, while ensuring appropriate antibiotics, close glucose monitoring, and reassessment for clinical response and adverse effects. For non-severe CAP, I would avoid routine steroids and prioritize antibiotics and supportive care, documenting rationale if steroids are considered for atypical presentations or refractory inflammatory physiology [^116LeFzN] [^112nc1MD] [^116arY2y] [^116ULE3m].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom line matches the evidence: oral steroids are not appropriate for routine treatment of pneumonia, but a short course of systemic corticosteroids — often feasible as oral therapy — can be considered for adults hospitalized with severe bacterial CAP, where benefits likely outweigh harms, whereas routine use in non-severe CAP is not supported and may be harmful. This severity-stratified approach aligns with the most recent high-quality trials and contemporary critical care and pulmonology guidelines [^111GQZsG] [^116LeFzN] [^116arY2y].

Oral steroids are **not routinely recommended** for pneumonia [^115mMXga] because benefits are limited to severe cases [^111Tb4BV] and outweighed by risks in non-severe disease [^notfound]. In severe CAP, short-course, low-dose oral steroids (e.g. prednisone 40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days) may reduce mortality [^111GQZsG], ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation [^1136GLTA], but increase hyperglycemia [^111Tb4BV] and infection risk [^112fn24Z]. Routine use in non-severe CAP is not supported [^116j8LXZ] due to lack of mortality benefit and higher adverse events [^116wTgqM]. Use cautiously in severe CAP with close monitoring, and avoid in non-severe disease, influenza pneumonia [^111mMKdw], or immunocompromised patients [^notfound].

## Clinical evidence supporting oral steroid use in pneumonia

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)

- **Mortality benefit**: Meta-analyses show reduced short-term mortality in severe CAP (RR 0.62–0.82) [^111Tb4BV] [^1136GLTA] [^111QpFWJ].
- **Reduced mechanical ventilation**: Lower need for invasive ventilation (RR 0.51–0.63) [^114RQ84x] [^111QpFWJ].
- **Shorter hospital stay**: Reduced length of stay by ~1–2 days [^111Tb4BV] [^116wTgqM] [^111QpFWJ].

---

### Non-severe CAP

In non-severe CAP, there is **no mortality benefit** — mortality does not improve with steroids [^111Tb4BV] [^111GQZsG] [^116K73ZA]. Clinical stability may improve modestly, but the effect is limited and not clinically decisive [^116K73ZA] [^116wTgqM].

---

## Recommended dosage and duration

- **Dosage**: Prednisone 40–50 mg/day (or equivalent) [^116K73ZA] [^112nc1MD].
- **Duration**: 5–7 days; longer courses increase adverse effects without added benefit [^112nc1MD] [^116K73ZA].
- **Route**: Oral administration is acceptable and commonly used in trials [^112bWQua].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Hyperglycemia**: Increased risk, often requiring insulin (RR ~1.7–2.0) [^111Tb4BV] [^116K73ZA] [^1136GLTA].
- **Secondary infections**: Higher risk of bacterial and fungal infections, especially with prolonged use [^1129oQWf] [^117HDGBN].
- **Other effects**: Fluid retention, hypertension, mood changes, and adrenal suppression with repeated or prolonged use [^117HDGBN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ATS/IDSA 2019 | - Do not use corticosteroids routinely in non-severe CAP [^116j8LXZ] <br/> - Conditional against routine use in severe CAP [^115mMXga] |
| SCCM 2024 | Recommend corticosteroids for severe bacterial CAP; no recommendation for less severe CAP [^116LeFzN] [^114y8xbu] |
| WHO 2021 | Do not routinely use corticosteroids in non-severe CAP |

---

## Patient populations benefiting from oral steroids

Patients with **severe CAP** — particularly those requiring ICU care or with high inflammatory markers — may benefit from corticosteroids [^111Tb4BV] [^11625v4U]. In contrast, **non-severe CAP** patients do not benefit and should not receive routine corticosteroids [^116j8LXZ] [^111B5t6z].

---

## Situations where oral steroids should be avoided

- **Non-severe CAP**: No mortality benefit; avoid routine use [^116j8LXZ] [^1136GLTA].
- **Influenza pneumonia**: Increased risk of complications; avoid [^111mMKdw].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher infection risk; use cautiously or avoid [^1129oQWf].

---

## Comparison with other corticosteroid formulations

Oral steroids are **non-inferior to IV** for bioavailability and clinical outcomes in CAP [^notfound]. IV steroids are preferred when oral intake is unreliable or absorption is compromised. Inhaled corticosteroids are not used for CAP management.

---

## Long-term outcomes and recurrence rates

Recurrence may be higher due to increased secondary infections and **hyperglycemia** [^116wTgqM] [^112fn24Z]. Long-term mortality is uncertain; some data suggest no clear long-term mortality benefit [^111QpFWJ].

---

Oral steroids are **not routine for pneumonia**; consider only in severe CAP with careful monitoring for hyperglycemia and infection. Avoid in non-severe CAP, influenza, or immunocompromised patients.

### Corticosteroids in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: systematic review and individual patient data metaanalysis [^116wTgqM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Our aim was to evaluate the benefits and harms of adjunctive corticosteroids in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using individual patient data from randomized, placebo-controlled trials and to explore subgroup differences.

Methods

We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central, and trial registers (all through July 2017). Data from 1506 individual patients in 6 trials were analyzed using uniform outcome definitions. We investigated prespecified effect modifiers using multivariable hierarchical regression, adjusting for pneumonia severity, age, and clustering effects.

Results

Within 30 days of randomization, 37 of 748 patients (5.0%) assigned to corticosteroids and 45 of 758 patients (5.9%) assigned to placebo died (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI].46 to 1.21; P &#x003D; .24). Time to clinical stability and length of hospital stay were reduced by approximately 1 day with corticosteroids (-1.03 days; 95% CI, -1.62 to -.43; P &#x003D; .001 and -1.15 days; 95% CI, -1.75 to -.55; P < .001, respectively). More patients with corticosteroids had hyperglycemia (160 [22.1%] vs 88 [12.0%]; aOR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.60 to 2.90; P < .001) and CAP-related rehospitalization (33 [5.0%] vs 18 [2.7%]; aOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.32; P &#x003D; .04). We did not find significant effect modification by CAP severity or degree of inflammation.

Conclusions

Adjunct corticosteroids for patients hospitalized with CAP reduce time to clinical stability and length of hospital stay by approximately 1 day without a significant effect on overall mortality but with an increased risk for CAP-related rehospitalization and hyperglycemia.

### A comparative study between methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone as an initial anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate COVID-19 pneumonia: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^112ibDf7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Some studies showed that high-dose methylprednisolone (MP) three to 5 days had provided better clinical improvement, decreased inflammatory markers, and had a lower proportion of patients who progressed to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) when compared with DXM. In a cohort study, Pinzón et al. compared high-dose MP for three days and oral prednisolone for 14 days against another regimen. The findings suggest that high-dose MP of 250 to 500 mg daily for three days effectively manages severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. Corticosteroids can influence the inflammatory process at the genomic level or through faster-acting non-genomic pathways. The latter requires high doses of corticosteroids, and the response is dose-dependent. In vitro studies indicate that MP elicits a more robust response than DXM. Mechanistically, MP exhibits a greater lung tissue-to-plasma ratio and is more efficient at penetrating tissue than other forms in experimental animals than dexamethasone, demonstrating higher potency in lung injury. Furthermore, high-dose MP therapy did not increase adverse events in severe and critical cases, especially those concerning bacterial infection.

In moderate COVID-19 pneumonia as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), no RCT has been conducted to compare high-dose MP therapy with high-dose DXM. We hypothesized that the initial treatment with MP 250 mg daily compared with high-dose DXM based on the previous study of the CoDEX randomized clinical trial for moderate COVID-19 pneumonia would improve clinical outcomes in moderate COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of a high-dose MP versus a high-dose DXM in hospitalized moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, regarding the WHO clinical progression scales, mortality, and the length of hospitalization.

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroid therapy for community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized, controlled trials [^116vAKos]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In the present study, we aimed to assess the effect of corticosteroids on all-cause mortality in patients hospitalized with CAP.

Methods

For this meta-analysis and meta-regression, we conducted a systematic search of trials that evaluated the effect of corticosteroid therapy in patients hospitalized with CAP through March 2023. We included randomized, controlled trials, comparing adjunctive corticosteroid therapy with the standard of care alone for treatment of patients hospitalized with CAP and reporting all-cause mortality. We excluded retrospective analyses, observational data, and trial protocols. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days after hospital admission. The safety analysis included the frequency of adverse events and steroid-associated adverse events.

Results

The literature search identified 35 713 citations, of which 15 studies and 3367 patients were eligible for the final analysis. The all-cause mortality at 30 days was significantly lower in the corticosteroid group (104 of 1690, 6.15%) than in the control group (152 of 1677, 9.06%; risk ratio [RR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI].53 to .85; p = 0.001; I2 = 0%). In 9 studies (2549 patients) that reported the occurrence of adverse events, corticosteroid therapy was not associated with an increased risk of developing any adverse event compared with standard care (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, .65 to 1.24; p = 0.5; I2 = 88%).

Conclusions

Adjunctive systemic corticosteroid therapy in patients hospitalized with CAP was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality by day 30. The benefits were more pronounced in patients with severe pneumonia.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^111GQZsG]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (adult inpatients) — Evidence summary indicates Eighteen RCTs compared corticosteroids to no corticosteroids in adult hospitalized patients with suspected or probable bacterial CAP, including severe and less severe disease. Severe CAP was classified as severe if 50% or more of participants had severe pneumonia or if most patients were admitted to the ICU at the time of randomization or required IV continuous vasopressor therapy; overall, 10 trials were classified as severe disease and 8 trials as less-severe disease. In severe CAP, corticosteroids probably reduce hospital mortality (RR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45–0.85; moderate certainty), an effect not seen in less severe CAP (RR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.83–1.42; low certainty) (subgroup interaction based on severity: p = 0.01), and there was also a subgroup effect on mortality by corticosteroid molecule (p < 0.001).

### Inhaled corticosteroids and pneumonia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113vbzxH]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids are widely used in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and, in combination with long-acting β2 agonists, reduce exacerbations and improve lung function and quality of life. However, inhaled corticosteroids have been linked with an increased risk of pneumonia in individuals with COPD, but the magnitude of this risk, the effects of different preparations and doses, and the mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. Therefore, making informed clinical decisions — balancing the beneficial and adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids in individuals with COPD — is difficult. Understanding of the mechanisms of increased pneumonia risk with inhaled corticosteroids is urgently needed to clarify their role in the management of COPD and to aid the development of new, safer therapies.

### Corticosteroid therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis [^115pVbRX]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The debate about the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still a longstanding dilemma. We performed a meta-analysis including 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids on the treatment of severe CAP in adults.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished clinical trials. Databases, including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane (from their establishment to July 2013), were searched for relevant articles. Only RCTs of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in adult patients with severe CAP were selected.

Results

Four trials enrolling 264 patients with severe CAP were included. Use of corticosteroids significantly reduced hospital mortality compared with conventional therapy and placebo (Peto odds ratio = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17–0.90). The quality of the evidence underlying the pooled estimate of effect on hospital mortality was low, downgraded for inconsistency and imprecision.

Conclusions

On the basis of the current limited evidence, we suggest that, although corticosteroid therapy may reduce mortality and improve the prognosis of adult patients with severe CAP, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the instability of pooled estimates. Reliable treatment recommendations will be raised only when large sufficiently powered multi-center RCTs are conducted.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111q5Y1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

### COPD exacerbations: the impact of long versus short courses of oral corticosteroids on mortality and pneumonia: nationwide data on 67 000 patients with COPD followed for 12 months [^114mMbZL]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Key messages

This nationwide cohort study reports a strong association between the long course (10 days) of oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment and the sustained increase in risk of admission with pneumonia and all-cause mortality — up to 1 year after exposure — in outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as compared with a short course (5 days) of OCS.
There was a time-dependent change in the magnitude of risk: those with current exposure had a higher vulnerability to pneumonia and all-cause mortality.
Understanding how risk depends on patterns of OCS will contribute to improved benefits and harm assessment.

### Balancing benefits and risks: Do inhaled corticosteroids modify the lung microbiome? [^116YUKKk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are common and powerful antiinflammatory medications. Because of their myriad effects on the immune system, they are capable of both facilitating infections and ameliorating their outcomes. In pulmonary medicine, chronic oral glucocorticoid therapy is a well-recognized risk factor for infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia. However, glucocorticoids also serve as adjunctive treatment for severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. The appropriate use of inhaled glucocorticoids in chronic inflammatory lung diseases is similarly complex. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the first line of therapy for asthma, for which they improve outcomes, but their use in COPD is much more complicated. Current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines recommend restricting ICS use to patients with a significant history of COPD exacerbations or peripheral eosinophilia because of the increased risk of pneumonia seen with these drugs in COPD. Thus, in COPD, we recognize that although glucocorticoids prevent and treat COPD exacerbations, they also increase the risk of pulmonary infection.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

Studies evaluating the effect of corticosteroids in CAP

The main studies on corticosteroids in pneumonia are summarized in Table 1. Several studies have evaluated the effects of corticosteroids in CAP. The first studies and meta-analyses included a heterogeneous population evaluating different outcomes, resulting in controversial data.

Table 1
Studies on corticosteroids in CAP

ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, CAP community acquired pneumonia, CI confidence interval, OR odds ratio, RCT randomized controlled trial, RR relative risk

A Cochrane meta-analysis selected six randomized controlled trails (RCTs) of corticosteroids in pneumonia including a total of 437 participants. The use of corticosteroids accelerated the resolution of symptoms and time to clinical stability (defined as improvement in chest X-ray and normalization of temperature, respiratory rate, and inflammatory markers). Corticosteroids provided no benefit in terms of mortality and the authors concluded that it was not possible to make any definitive recommendations because the studies analyzed in the meta-analysis did not provide strong evidence. Another meta-analysis including nine RCTs with a total of 1001 patients showed that the use of corticosteroids was not associated with significantly lower mortality considering all the patients (odds ratio (OR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37–1.04; p = 0.07). However, a survival benefit was detected in the subgroup of patients with severe CAP (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11–0.64; p = 0.003) and among patients receiving more prolonged corticosteroid treatment (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26–0.97; p = 0.04). Prolonged corticosteroid treatment was defined as more than 5 days of corticosteroid treatment and a maximum of 9 days. In terms of adverse effects, corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.68–4.15; p < 0.001) but did not increase the risk of superinfection (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.65–2.84; p = 0.41) or gastroduodenal bleeding (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.41–6.80; p = 0.47).

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114N7xbL]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) is a leading cause of hospitalization and can result in significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations such as elderly, immunocompromised individuals, and those with chronic medical conditions. Despite developments in antimicrobial therapy and life-support measures for patients with sCAP, clinical outcomes have not improved significantly owing to an aging population, increased prevalence of comorbidities, and the emergence of multi-drug-resistant organisms. Therefore, the prevention and effective management of sCAP continue to be critical public health concerns.

In addition to early diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, the use of corticosteroids for the management of sCAP has been discussed in considerable detail. As numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the role of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of sCAP and yielded inconsistent findings, current guidelines provide different recommendations regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with sCAP. Furthermore, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have explored the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with CAP; however, not all studies included in these meta-analyses focused on sCAP, and no consistent findings have been reported. In 2023, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported that among patients with sCAP treated in the intensive care unit (ICU), treatment with hydrocortisone could result in a lower risk of 28-day mortality than those treated by a placebo. To address this controversy, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in patients with sCAP.

### COVID-19 treatments: then and now [^115DhzUS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has evolved over the past 3+ years, and strategies to prevent illness and treat infection have changed over time. As COVID-19 transitions from a pandemic to an endemic infection, widespread nonpharmaceutical interventions such as mask mandates and governmental policies requiring social distancing have given way to more selective strategies for risk mitigation. Monoclonal antibody therapies used for disease prevention and treatment lost utility owing to the emergence of resistant viral variants. Oral antiviral medications have become the mainstay of treatment in nonhospitalized individuals, whereas systemic corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of therapy in those requiring supplemental oxygen. Emerging literature also supports the use of additional immune-modulating therapies in select admitted patients. Importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted both unprecedented research and development of medical interventions while also drawing attention to significant pitfalls in the global response. This review provides a comprehensive update in prevention and management of COVID-19.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111xe6An]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP).

Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted using the Medline, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Scopus databases for articles published until April 24, 2023. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids for treating sCAP were included. The primary outcome was the 30-day all-cause mortality.

Results

A total of severe RCTs involving 1689 patients were included in this study. Overall, the study group had a lower mortality rate at day 30 than the control group (risk ratio [RR], 0.61; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.85; p < 0.01) with low heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%, p = 0.42). Compared to the control group, the study group had a lower risk of the requirement of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.73; p < 0.001), shorter length of intensive care unit (MD - 0.8; 95% CI - 1.4 to - 0.1; p = 0.02), and hospital stay (MD - 1.1; 95% CI - 2.0 to - 0.1; p = 0.04). Finally, no significant difference was observed between the study and the control groups in terms of gastrointestinal tract bleeding (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.18; p = 0.93), healthcare-associated infection (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.32; p = 0.56), and acute kidney injury (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.21 to 2.26; p = 0.53).

Conclusions

In patients with sCAP, adjunctive corticosteroids can provide survival benefits and improve clinical outcomes without increasing adverse events. However, because the pooled evidence remains inconclusive, further studies are required.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^111PsGUe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this network meta-analysis of 11 RCTs involving 2042 patients with severe CAP, we aimed to determine the optimal corticosteroid regimen. Hydrocortisone was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo (RR, 0.35; 95% CrI, 0.14–0.64). While this finding is statistically significant, its clinical relevance requires further consideration. Traditionally, overreliance on p-values and SUCRA rankings may lead to overlooking the practical implications of therapeutic interventions in clinical settings. SUCRA values reflect relative rankings rather than absolute clinical benefit and should be interpreted with caution. To address these, Horita et al. recently proposed a framework for the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), which is applicable to effect sizes such as RR. According to this framework, an RR of 0.35 is not only statistically significant but also clinically meaningful, demonstrating a substantial mortality benefit. Further comparative analysis suggested that hydrocortisone may outperform methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and prednisolone in reducing mortality. Additionally, our results indicate that patients may benefit more from corticosteroids administered in low-to-moderate doses and over short courses.

Previous direct meta-analyses have investigated the effect of corticosteroids on severe CAP, but the results remain inconclusive. Our network meta-analysis revealed that unlike other corticosteroids, hydrocortisone not only significantly reduced mortality, but also reduced the need for MV. These findings underscore the distinct advantages of hydrocortisone in improving patient prognosis. Importantly, owing to the absence of direct comparative RCTs between different corticosteroids, our analysis provides critical insights suggesting that hydrocortisone may be more effective in reducing mortality and MV. Evidence credibility was rated as very low to low for outcomes including all-cause mortality, MV, and SAEs, primarily due to concerns regarding incoherence, heterogeneity, and imprecision. These limitations warrant cautious interpretation of hydrocortisone's potential benefits and highlight the need for well-designed, adequately powered head-to-head RCTs to validate these findings.

### Effect of corticosteroids on the clinical course of community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^117SaqsZ]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite advances in diagnostic methods and antibiotic treatment, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains an important cause of mortality. In the industrialized countries, CAP is the sixth highest cause of mortality and the first among infectious diseases. Although mortality in patients with CAP fell dramatically with the introduction of antibiotics in the 1950s, since then it has remained relatively stable. Current series report an overall mortality rate of 8 to 15%.

A recent study of the factors associated with early death in patients with CAP reinforces the classical concept that some deaths were not due to failure to eradicate the microorganism causing CAP, but are closely related to inadequate host response. Excessive cytokine response in patients with severe CAP has been linked in many previous studies with deleterious effects and poor prognosis.

In this context, the use of immunomodulation appears to be an appealing option for improving prognosis in CAP. Theoretically, an anti-inflammatory treatment given prior to antibiotic therapy could prevent an excessive inflammatory response, improving the prognosis of more severe episodes of CAP. Therefore, the use of corticosteroids as an adjunct therapy for pneumonia has been a matter of debate. Corticosteroids are known to reduce the production of the main inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-6), and the subsequent recruitment of inflammatory cells into the alveolar space leading to a more equilibrated response.

Here we conducted a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to analyse whether a corticosteroid therapy, administered in the form of a methyl-prednisolone bolus given prior to antibiotic treatment followed by sustained infusion for nine days, was able to modulate the inflammatory response and clinical outcome of selected hospital-admitted CAP patients presenting respiratory failure and extensive radiological consolidations.

### A pragmatic trial of glucocorticoids for community-acquired pneumonia [^1115LHU3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Adjunctive glucocorticoids may reduce mortality among patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in well-resourced settings. Whether these drugs are beneficial in low-resource settings with limited diagnostic and treatment facilities is unclear.

Methods

In this pragmatic, open-label, randomized, controlled trial conducted in 18 public hospitals in Kenya, we assigned adult patients who had received a diagnosis of CAP and who did not have a clear indication for glucocorticoids to receive either standard care for CAP or oral low-dose glucocorticoids for 10 days in addition to standard care. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 30 days after enrollment.

Results

A total of 2180 patients underwent randomization (1089 assigned to the glucocorticoid group and 1091 to the standard-care group). The median age of the patients was 53 years (interquartile range, 38 to 72); 46% were women. At day 30, deaths were reported in 530 patients (24.3%): 246 patients (22.6%) in the glucocorticoid group and 284 patients (26.0%) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.97; P = 0.02). The frequencies of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two trial groups. Serious adverse events that were considered to be related to glucocorticoid administration occurred in 5 patients (0.5%).

Conclusions

In patients with CAP in a low-resource setting, adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy was associated with a lower risk of death than standard care. (Funded by Wellcome Trust and others; SONIA PACTR number, PACTR202111481740832; ISRCTN number, ISRCTN36138594.).

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nZHGq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This meta-analysis evaluated the impact of corticosteroid therapy on short-term mortality outcomes in over 10,000 critically ill patients. A thorough literature search was conducted, and the study protocols were pre-registered. The review included a meticulous assessment of various subgroups of interest, employed the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, and utilized GRADE methodology to evaluate the robustness of the evidence. Both a priori and post-hoc subgroup analyses were performed to explore potential sources of statistical heterogeneity, with findings from these analyses largely aligning with the initial results. However, this review is not without limitations. Firstly, it spanned nearly five decades of clinical trials, during which continuous advancements were made in therapeutic and diagnostic approaches, leading to significant clinical heterogeneity across studies. This heterogeneity is further compounded by variations in patient populations (including ARDS, sCAP, and sepsis), types of corticosteroids used, dosages, durations of treatment, and treatment protocols, all of which are influenced by evolving clinical guidelines. Despite conducting subgroup analyses, the potential for type I errors due to multiple comparisons remains a concern. Secondly, the findings pertain specifically to a defined patient population; although corticosteroids may be linked to reduced short-term mortality in critically ill patients, these results cannot be generalized to all ICU populations due to variations in underlying disease phenotypes, clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and regional practices. Third, identifying the right patient for a steroid treatment is no easy task. Clinical studies have reported different results not only for different diseases (sepsis vs. community acquired pneumonia) but also for subsets in these groups (sepsis vs. septic shock with continued vasopressor treatment; bacterial CAP vs. influenza vs. COVID). The optimal choice of corticosteroid and the potential benefit of supplementing a mineralocorticoid complicates things even more. Fourth, we also worried that a large reason for the varying effects of steroids on mortality is differing efficacy in different patient subgroups. In such a circumstance aggregating the results of many trials together only serves to obscure the important question of how to identify which patients are likely to benefit from steroids and which patients are not. Lastly, our analysis focused solely on short-term mortality outcomes, overlooking long-term follow-up data, quality of life assessments, and survival rates for critically ill patients. Future real-world studies may provide more tailored insights for the management of critically ill individuals. Subgroup analyses were restricted to the primary outcome (short-term mortality) due to the exploratory nature of secondary outcomes and potential risks of multiple testing. Future studies should consider predefined subgroup analyses for all outcomes to enhance interpretability.

### Corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: the path we choose depends on where we want to get [^1123CUW6]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of admission to intensive care units and its mortality rates remain exceedingly high. In the search for adjunctive therapies, clinicians who were encouraged by available, though limited, evidence prescribed steroids in most patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, including those with community-acquired pneumonia. Current evidence demonstrates that, whereas corticosteroids should not be routinely employed as adjuvant therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia, there is sufficient equipoise to continue studying the use of corticosteroids.

### Steroids beneficial as adjunctive treatment for community… [^1166r9US]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Should steroids be used as adjunctive therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Bottom Line Moderate-quality to high-quality evidence suggests that steroids, when added to antibiotics and usual care, can improve outcomes in the treatment of CAP. Benefits include reduced hospital length of stay, decreased time to clinical stability, and lower rates of mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Steroids may also play a role in preventing deaths, especially in patients with severe CAP; however, the certainty of this evidence is not as clear. Given varying treatment regimens used in the individual studies, the appropriate steroid formulation, dosage, and duration of steroids cannot be elucidated from the current set of data.

Synopsis These authors searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Register to find randomized controlled trials that compared the use of steroids with placebo in adults with CAP. Two reviewers independently evaluated studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the included studies for risk of bias. Five of the 13 included studies, whose population made up 70% of the total sample population, had low risk of bias. The treatment groups in the individual studies received different steroid preparations, routes of administration, dosages, and duration of treatment. All groups otherwise received antibiotics and usual care for CAP. Moderate-quality evidence showed that the use of steroids decreased the need for mechanical ventilation and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Finally, data from the 12 trials that assessed all-cause mortality revealed a trend toward decreased risk of death in the steroid group. The difference between the two groups for this end point became statistically significant when only the trials that met the criteria for severe pneumonia were included. Although steroid use, not surprisingly, increased the risk of significant hyperglycemia, there were no differences detected in the rates of gastrointestinal bleeds, severe neuropsychiatric complications, or rehospitalizations.

### Efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids therapy of severe community-acquired pneumonia in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116QHgLw]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The results of this meta-analysis suggest that corticosteroid use is associated with a lower mortality rate; however, its safety remains uncertain. Therefore, in clinical practice, a comprehensive assessment of individualized benefits and risks is essential. Special caution should be exercised in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes, osteoporosis, immunodeficiency, fungal infections, or gastrointestinal bleeding. This study provides evidence-based support for the use of corticosteroids in older patients with sCAP and may serve as a reference for clinical decision-making. Given the uncertainty regarding safety outcomes and the necessity of individualized corticosteroid therapy, future guidelines may consider a conditional recommendation for corticosteroid use in older adult patients with sCAP without high-risk comorbidities, while ensuring close monitoring of potential adverse effects to maintain clinical safety.

This meta-analysis has some limitations. First, in the absence of RCTs that focused specifically on corticosteroid treatment in older adult patients with sCAP, studies with a mean age ≥ 60 years were included. Second, for studies reporting mortality across different time intervals, data closest to 30 days were used. Third, variations in the definition of sCAP across studies introduced heterogeneity that could not be entirely resolved. Fourth, older patients often present with multiple underlying comorbidities, and the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy may be influenced by these baseline conditions. Due to the lack of relevant data, this study did not explore this aspect. Finally, the secondary outcome means were estimated from the median values.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^116Hmoeb]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Evidence to recommendation for CAP — there was general agreement among the panel for a credible subgroup effect demonstrating a large desirable treatment effect of corticosteroid use for patients with severe CAP with less magnitude of benefit in less severe CAP, and given this subgroup effect the panel decided to make separate recommendations for severe and nonsevere CAP. Overall, the panel felt that the balance of beneficial and undesirable effects favors giving corticosteroids to patients with more severe CAP but was uncertain in patients with less severe CAP; this judgment was driven in part by the CAPE COD randomized controlled trial (RCT), which represented approximately 35% of the severe CAP subgroup patients and showed a strong mortality benefit with the use of corticosteroids. Evidence informing cost-effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in CAP is lacking, though one study suggests cost savings with a more pronounced benefit in those with severe CAP; definitions for severe CAP and use of risk stratification scores are variable across RCTs. Although the panel considered a conditional recommendation against corticosteroids in less severe diseases, consensus was not achieved and further RCTs evaluating corticosteroids in less severe CAP are urgently needed. Of note, 2 of the 18 RCTs included in the analysis were done in low- to middle-income countries.

### COPD exacerbations: the impact of long versus short courses of oral corticosteroids on mortality and pneumonia: nationwide data on 67 000 patients with COPD followed for 12 months [^112V6Tgt]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Future studies should focus on testing our results and investigating the possible causes of the increased all-cause mortality that is associated with long courses of OCS. Additionally, randomised trials should test strategies for safely administering OCS at the lowest possible accumulated dosage to achieve the documented positive short-term effects of OCS in COPD exacerbations without increasing the risk of serious long-term consequences. This could include blood eosinophils at presentation. So far, no data are available with regards to the minimal necessary OCS dose in an outpatient treatment setting. The development of several biological inhibitors of inﬂammatory mediators in COPD for targeting the cytokine/chemokine-mediated inﬂammation in COPD have provided little or no evidence of therapeutic effectiveness with regards to clinical outcomes in COPD.

Materials and methods

Search strategy and data sources

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science comprehensively, encompassing all publications with a search deadline of March 31, 2024, with no language restrictions, using a combination of keywords and MeSH terms related to community-acquired pneumonia and corticosteroids (including hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone). The search strategy was developed by an experienced researcher and is detailed in Table S1. In addition, we conducted a manual search of the references cited in the included studies to identify any other potentially relevant research. This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024544342) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Study selection

The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) Population: Severe CAP; (2) Intervention: Corticosteroids, including hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone, were administered at dosages designed to distinguish between low-to-moderate and high doses. Low-to-moderate doses were defined as < 1 mg/kg per day of methylprednisolone or < 80 mg per day of methylprednisolone or its equivalent, whereas doses equal to or exceeding either threshold were classified as high doses; (3) Comparison: Placebo; (4) Outcomes: The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality, the secondary efficacy outcome was MV, and the safety outcome was the incidence of SAEs; and (5) study design: RCTs. Severe CAP was defined as CAP that required admission to the ICU or met the criteria established by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America (ATS/IDSA), or PaO2/FiO2 < 300, or pneumonia severity index score ≥ IV. Only data from the subgroup with severe CAP were included if the studies enrolled patients with different severity levels of CAP. In additionally, we excluded non-RCTs, duplicate publications, conference reports, and studies with incomplete data.

Two authors screened the study titles and abstracts to establish eligibility and conducted rigorous preliminary selection. Subsequently, the full text was reviewed based on the inclusion criteria, leading to further exclusion. Discrepancies were resolved by consulting with a third independent researcher.

Data extraction

Two authors extracted pertinent demographic data and study outcomes, including all-cause mortality, need for MV, and SAEs. Additionally, we categorized the included trials based on the treatment dosage and duration.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^114Gnwzn]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — Recommendation: 2A) We "suggest" administering corticosteroids to adult critically ill patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty). Remark: We make no recommendation for corticosteroid use in pediatric patients with ARDS. Evidence summary: Eighteen RCTs compared corticosteroids to placebo or standard care in adult hospitalized patients with ARDS; Twelve (67%) used American-European Consensus Conference or Berlin criteria and 6 (33%) included patients with COVID-19; corticosteroid use probably reduces 28-day mortality (RR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95, moderate certainty) in critically ill patients with ARDS.

### Corticosteroids for pleural infection: should we STOPPE studying? [^114Fyopv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Without a trend toward benefit from steroids in parapneumonic effusions, does this shut the door on any future trials in this area? We would argue that it should not. As a first-of-its-kind pilot study, its authors should be commended. Interventional pleural studies are inherently difficult, as evidenced by the attrition from screening to randomization owing to patient factors alone. As a pilot study should, it has generated many questions that need addressing before future trials are performed.

A key issue is that of the optimal target population. In an era of large platform trials, overly restrictive inclusion criteria should be avoided. However, the spectrum of parapneumonic effusions is so wide that the fundamental aim of steroid therapy is affected. Are we trying to prevent the development of pleural infection? In that case, we should target only simple parapneumonic effusions at the earliest possible time point, especially given that corticosteroids seem to benefit adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia with or without an effusion. This is a valid approach, but only a minority of simple parapneumonic effusions progress to pleural infection, so the trial size needed to demonstrate a difference would be large, and the potential benefit-to-risk ratio of steroids could be marginal. Alternatively, one could argue for an approach of targeting established cases of pleural infection to augment the inflammation that is driving fluid production and loculation. Such a trial might include patients in whom initial medical management had already been performed, and the potential role of steroids would be to reduce ongoing symptoms, or hospital length of stay, or persistent pleural thickening, all endpoints that were deemed feasible to collect within the STOPPE trial.

Beyond trial design, the choice of steroid, dosing, and route is an important area. The investigators very reasonably chose dexamethasone for its strong antiinflammatory effects with minimal mineralocorticoid effect and long duration of action. However, 8 mg daily in divided doses is a relatively small dose compared with other inflammatory conditions related to infection, such as bacterial meningitis, for which 40 mg daily is administered. The RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial demonstrated that just 6 mg daily reduced mortality in severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) but is currently testing doses of 20 mg daily after promising results from other trials. In addition, the intravenous route might not be necessary, given the bioavailability of oral dexamethasone, which would reduce adverse effects (e.g. phlebitis), costs, and complexity of intravenous administration.

### Real-world corticosteroid use in severe pneumonia: a propensity-score-matched study [^117HweE8]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide despite correct antibiotic use. Severe disease not only manifests frequently and requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission, but also presents with the highest mortality. Death in severe CAP occurs due to an overwhelming pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response that causes abnormal gas exchange (i.e. respiratory failure), sepsis, and multiple-organ dysfunction. Although antimicrobials are highly effective at reducing the bacterial burden of pulmonary infection, they do not directly modulate the inflammatory response.

Poor clinical outcomes in severe CAP necessitate treatment strategies other than antibiotics. Corticosteroids are a biologically plausible option that inhibit the expression and action of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response associated with pneumonia. However, their use in CAP has yielded heterogeneous survival results in randomized clinical trials, in part because they included patients with and without severe CAP, precluding their routine inclusion in therapeutic strategies. Appropriate selection of patients with severe CAP only, in whom the beneficial effects of corticosteroids outweigh the potential adverse effects, is therefore of major relevance. Indeed, subgroup analyses of patients treated for CAP with corticosteroids have shown survival benefits mainly in those with severe disease. This is plausible because the low mortality in patients without severe CAP makes it less likely that we will observe reduced mortality. Given that the rationale for corticosteroid use is to attenuate the inflammatory response, those with the highest inflammatory status should obtain the most benefit. In a randomized clinical trial of patients with severe CAP and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, corticosteroid use led to less late radiographic progression of pulmonary opacities. However, this study was underpowered for assessing differences in mortality and other clinical outcomes.

We hypothesize that corticosteroids might improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe CAP and high inflammatory responses by reducing pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Accordingly, we aimed to analyze the impact of corticosteroids on mortality and other outcomes in patients with severe CAP and a high inflammatory response.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^111QYbg7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have primarily relied on direct meta-analyses, which can provide limited insight into the comparative effectiveness of different treatments. To overcome this limitation, this study employed network meta-analysis to enhance the precision of the results and enable a more comprehensive comparison of the efficacy of different corticosteroids. Despite these advances, our study had several limitations. First, the included RCTs varied in the diagnostic criteria for severe CAP and the definition and reporting of SAEs, which may have caused heterogeneity between the studies. Additionally, although corticosteroids may improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe CAP, their immunosuppressive effects could theoretically increase the risk of secondary infections and antibiotic resistance. However, none of the included studies in our meta-analysis provided specific data on the incidence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens or secondary bacterial or fungal infections. This lack of data represents an important limitation, as the potential for increased susceptibility to nosocomial or opportunistic infections could offset the benefits of corticosteroid therapy. Future trials should incorporate comprehensive microbiological surveillance to assess this risk more precisely and guide safer clinical decision-making. Moreover, due to the limited number of qualifying RCTs, it was not feasible to conduct sensitivity analyses without compromising the integrity of the network structure, which, in turn, limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding the optimal dosages and treatment durations for various corticosteroids. Finally, the generalizability of our findings may be limited by heterogeneity across study populations, including variability in comorbidities, ICU admission status. Whether hydrocortisone provides comparable benefit across these diverse clinical subgroups remains uncertain and should be explored in future stratified analyses or individual patient data meta-analyses.

In summary, our study indicates that hydrocortisone significantly reduced mortality, whereas methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and prednisolone did not exhibit the same effect. Furthermore, we confirmed the benefits of low-to-moderate doses and short-course corticosteroid therapy. While these findings may help guide clinical decision-making, they are not yet robust enough to warrant immediate changes to current treatment guidelines. To establish the optimal corticosteroid regimen, especially regarding the choice of agent, dose, and duration, further large-scale, high-quality randomized controlled trials are essential. Future research should particularly focus on direct head-to-head comparisons between hydrocortisone and other corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, to clarify their relative efficacy and safety profiles, and support the development of more precise, evidence-based treatment strategies.

### The role of corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^117UaBXQ]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Selection of participants, data collection, and definitions

We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, and CINAHL (for the period of 1966 to November 2007) to identify full-text English language publications that evaluated the use of corticosteroids in CAP. Inclusion criteria were established a priori. Major MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) search terms included 'community-acquired infections', 'pneumonia', 'steroids', 'corticosteroids', 'glucocorticoids', and 'cortisol'. We also reviewed the references of available studies for other potentially eligible studies, and additional published reports were identified through a manual search of citations from retrieved articles. Only original peer-reviewed clinical trials and cohort studies evaluating the use of corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP were selected and analyzed. The abstracts of all articles were used to confirm our target population (patients with CAP), and the corresponding full-text articles were reviewed for the presence of data evaluating the outcomes of adult non-immunocompromised patients with severe CAP treated with systemic corticosteroids. Only studies of at least 20 adult patients were included. We excluded case reports, articles in which children were the subject of study, articles on CAP in HIV-infected patients, nosocomial pneumonia, or CAP managed in an outpatient setting. Two investigators (JIFS and PP) independently identified the eligible literature. Predefined variables were collected, including year of publication, study design (prospective/retrospective), number of patients included, and hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS), oxygenation, markers of systemic inflammation, and data on pneumonia severity. Additional unpublished data were obtained by electronic mail from Garcia-Vidal and Mikami. Any inconsistencies between the two investigators (JIFS and PP) in interpretation of data were resolved by consensus. The data were extracted to a standardized form and included the number of patients, hospital mortality and LOS, oxygenation, markers of systemic inflammation, and data on pneumonia severity. In addition, we explored possible reasons that may explain the results and assigned quality levels as defined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) GRADE system to formulate the level of recommendation.

### Effect of hydrocortisone on mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia: the REMAP-CAP corticosteroid domain randomized clinical trial [^112UgD5d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and oversight

The design of REMAP-CAP was reported previously. Patients eligible for the platform are assessed for eligibility to be randomized to interventions within one or more domains. We report here on patients randomized in the non-pandemic corticosteroid domain to fixed-duration hydrocortisone or control.

The trial is managed by a blinded International Trial Steering Committee (ITSC) and an unblinded independent DSMB. The trial had multiple international funders and sponsors. The funders had no role in study design, analysis, or reporting. The trial protocol was approved by relevant research ethics committees in each jurisdiction. Informed consent was obtained before randomization from all patients or their surrogates, or in a deferred fashion, in accordance with local legislation. The trial was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All authors vouch for these data and analyses, as well as for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol and statistical analysis plan. There are no confidentiality agreements that preclude the investigators publishing the findings.

### Effect of hydrocortisone on mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia: the REMAP-CAP corticosteroid domain randomized clinical trial [^113ydXL9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Corticosteroids may reduce mortality in patients hospitalized with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Possible benefits include amelioration of organ damage secondary to excessive host inflammatory responses via their anti-inflammatory properties, or mitigation of septic shock via their effects on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis. Corticosteroids lowered mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, in a recent study of severe CAP, and in a post hoc analysis of CAP patients in a larger trial of steroids for septic shock. A recent guideline statement now recommends corticosteroid administration for severe CAP. However, other studies yielded inconsistent results, corticosteroids carry known side effects, and uncertainty persists regarding the type and dose of corticosteroids and whether treatment should be given broadly or to particular subgroups of patients.

REMAP-CAP is an ongoing international platform trial (NCT02735707) designed to evaluate treatments for patients with severe CAP in pandemic and non-pandemic settings. The REMAP-CAP investigators previously reported that hydrocortisone appeared to be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19, administered either as a fixed-dose 1-week course or titrated depending on the presence and duration of shock. REMAP-CAP also contains a corticosteroid domain for non-COVID-19 pneumonia, where patients were randomized to one of several corticosteroid strategies or control. On December 6th, 2023, the platform ceased randomization to one of the corticosteroid strategies, fixed-duration hydrocortisone, on the recommendation of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) after that arm triggered a pre-specified stopping rule for futility compared to control (no corticosteroid). Data were locked after the last patient completed follow-up for the primary end point and the results are presented here.

### Corticosteroids for community-acquired pneumonia: time to act! [^116y2USV]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The use of corticosteroids for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia has been reported for almost 50 years. A recent systematic analysis of the relevant literature suggested that corticosteroids reduce the critical illness associated with community-acquired pneumonia. There is little doubt that a prolonged administration of a moderate dose of corticosteroids may alleviate the systemic inflammatory response and subsequent organ dysfunction in severe infection. Whether these favorable effects on morbidity may translate into better survival and quality of life needs to be addressed in additional adequately powered randomized controlled trials.

### Repurposed pharmacological agents for the potential treatment of COVID-19: a literature review [^114KkYdC]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids

Another immunomodulatory option for the potential treatment of severe COVID-19 is the administration of corticosteroids. Although the use of corticosteroids in viral infection is questionable, their anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic actions could have beneficial effects on pneumonia, ARDS, and septic shock. Previous studies evaluating corticosteroids in ARDS and septic shock patients concluded that corticosteroids could reduce mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation. These insights give hope in the treatment of severe and mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with corticosteroids to wean the patients off from respiratory support and to reduce mortality.

In a report of the results of a controlled, open-label trial that is part of the RECOVERY trial in the United Kingdom, 6425 eligible patients were randomised to receive either usual care or usual care with additional dexamethasone. 2104 patients were allocated to receive dexamethasone, 6 mg once per day for 10 days or until hospital discharge administered orally or intravenously. 4321 patients were grouped to receive usual care. Patients that were eligible for this trial were those with clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and had no contraindications for the use of corticosteroids. After a primary outcome assessment of 28-day mortality, the group receiving mechanical ventilation or just supplemental oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation at the time of randomisation in the dexamethasone group had a lower mortality rate than those in the usual care group. For patients that did not need respiratory support at the time of randomisation, the use of dexamethasone was not significantly beneficial in comparison to usual care. Furthermore, the reduction of mortality was experienced more in individuals that had symptoms for more than 7 days but not in those with recent symptom onset which possibly correlates to the prevalence of inflammatory lung damage. In this study, the use of dexamethasone was associated with lower risk of patients receiving oxygen to deteriorate to invasive mechanical ventilation and a greater likelihood of patients already on invasive mechanical ventilation to successful weaning (Table 5). The RECOVERY trial proved a benefit of low-dose dexamethasone in mechanically ventilated and oxygen-needing, not mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients.

### Corticosteroid treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia [^116mTsWk]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the evidence for adjunctive corticosteroids for severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-February 2007) and EMBASE (1980-February 2007) were searched to identify English- and French-language publications that evaluated the use of corticosteroids for CAP in adults. Major search terms included community-acquired pneumonia, intensive care unit, steroids, glucocorticoids, and adrenal cortex hormones.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical studies that evaluated the use of corticosteroids for CAP in adults were included. Clinical and surrogate markers of pneumonia were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Severe CAP is associated with an increase in pulmonary and circulatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha that may be associated with higher mortality. Corticosteroids suppress inflammatory reactions and prevent migration of inflammatory cells from the circulation to tissues by suppressing the synthesis of chemokines and cytokines. One observational comparative study and 2 randomized, controlled studies examined the effects of corticosteroid therapy at various doses on endpoints of pulmonary and systemic inflammation and clinical outcomes. One small observational pilot study revealed that methylprednisolone blunted some of the pulmonary and systemic markers of inflammation. One small, randomized, placebo-controlled study revealed that hydrocortisone had no significant effects on markers of pulmonary and systemic inflammation or clinical outcomes. Another small, randomized, placebo-controlled preliminary study with methodological limitations revealed improvements in oxygenation, organ dysfunction score, and markers of inflammation favoring hydrocortisone over placebo.

Conclusions

Given the lack of proven benefit on clinically meaningful endpoints and adverse events, corticosteroids cannot be recommended for adjunctive treatment of severe CAP.

### Efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids therapy of severe community-acquired pneumonia in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115dV5xB]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a primary contributor to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) among hospitalized patients, especially in individuals aged 65 years and older. In 2019, the global mortality rate of LRTI was 6.46 per 100,000 individuals. Over the past 30 years (1990–2019), the mortality rate showed a decreasing trend among individuals aged ≥ 55 years; however, it increased by 85.84% in absolute terms, with the highest rates observed in patients aged ≥ 85 years. Additionally, patients with clinical failure (CF) after CAP treatment are generally older than those with clinical success, with a reported CF incidence of 13.1% in older adult patients with CAP. Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP), characterized by the requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or hemodynamic support, has a mortality rate of 16–36%. sCAP is prevalent among older adults who often have immunosuppression and age-related comorbidities, leading to poor clinical outcomes despite timely and adequate antibiotic therapy. Corticosteroid therapy, which attenuates local and systemic inflammatory responses, has been proposed as an adjunctive treatment to improve the outcomes of patients with sCAP. However, glucocorticoids are associated with numerous adverse effects, necessitating caution when prescribing them to older adults in distinct patient populations. Evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoid treatment in older adult patients with sCAP is essential. Currently, international guidelines lack specific treatment recommendations for older adult patients with sCAP, and conflicting guidelines on corticosteroid use in patients with severe CAP are available. Over the past decade, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a mean patient age > 60 years have examined the efficacy of glucocorticoids for sCAP. Some studies have indicated beneficial outcomes; however, the overall conclusions remain inconclusive. A 2023 meta-analysis incorporating recent studies reported that corticosteroid use in adult patients with sCAP was associated with reduced all-cause mortality, shorter hospital stays, and favorable safety profiles. However, it remains unclear whether these effects extend to older patients with sCAP. To investigate this, we performed a meta-analysis of both domestic and international RCTs involving patients with a mean age > 60 years to assess the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoid treatment in older individuals with sCAP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115mMXga]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Inpatient setting — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and corticosteroids: We recommend not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with nonsevere CAP (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). We suggest not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with severe CAP (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) and suggest not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with severe influenza pneumonia (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We endorse the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations on the use of corticosteroids in patients with CAP and refractory septic shock. Risk considerations note that the risk of corticosteroids in the dose range up to 240 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent per day for a maximum of 7 days is predominantly hyperglycemia, with concerns about greater complications in the following 30 to 90 days.

### Effect of hydrocortisone on mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia: the REMAP-CAP corticosteroid domain randomized clinical trial [^111ZYcaq]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Among patients with severe CAP, treatment with a 7-day fixed-duration course of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, appears unlikely to yield a large reduction in mortality. Smaller benefits and possible harm are not excluded.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1111cf8t]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

COPD exacerbations — systemic and inhaled glucocorticoids: Data indicate that systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations shorten recovery time and improve lung function, and also improve oxygenation, the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and the length of hospitalization. A dose of 40 mg prednisolone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended; therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective to intravenous administration, and nebulized budesonide alone may be a suitable alternative that provides similar benefits to intravenous methylprednisolone. Observational and safety data note that even short bursts are associated with subsequent increased risk of pneumonia, sepsis and death and use should be confined to patients with significant exacerbations, and longer courses are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and mortality. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less efficacious to treat acute COPD exacerbations in patients with lower levels of blood eosinophils. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (STARR2), prednisolone therapy guided by blood eosinophil count during acute COPD exacerbation was non-inferior to standard care including systematic prednisolone treatment (30 mg per day for 14 days) and allowed a 33% reduction in the proportion of patients receiving prednisolone; the authors concluded that blood eosinophil-directed prednisolone can be used to safely reduce systemic glucocorticoid use in clinical practice.

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19: equity-related analyses and update on evidence [^111A5D9M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. Nonetheless, size of effect, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

Objectives

To assess whether and at which doses systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, to explore equity-related aspects in subgroup analyses, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 6 January 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids and the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care, different types, doses and timings (early versus late) of corticosteroids. We excluded corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality up to 30 and 120 days, discharged alive (clinical improvement), new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death (clinical worsening), serious adverse events, adverse events, hospital-acquired infections, and invasive fungal infections.

Main Results

We included 16 RCTs in 9549 participants, of whom 8271 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total of 4532 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 3766). These studies included participants mostly older than 50 years and male. We also identified 42 ongoing and 23 completed studies lacking published results or relevant information on the study design. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 11 RCTs (8019 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analyses included outcome data from 10 studies. Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care compared to standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality (up to 30 days) slightly (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 0.97; 7898 participants; estimated absolute effect: 274 deaths per 1000 people not receiving systemic corticosteroids compared to 246 deaths per 1000 people receiving the intervention (95% CI 230 to 265 per 1000 people); moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on all-cause mortality (up to 120 days) (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.34; 485 participants). The chance of clinical improvement (discharged alive at day 28) may slightly increase (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11; 6786 participants; low-certainty evidence) while the risk of clinical worsening (new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death) may slightly decrease (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; 5586 participants; low-certainty evidence). For serious adverse events (two RCTs, 678 participants), adverse events (three RCTs, 447 participants), hospital-acquired infections (four RCTs, 598 participants), and invasive fungal infections (one study, 64 participants), we did not perform any analyses beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics due to very low-certainty evidence (high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one RCT (86 participants) comparing methylprednisolone to dexamethasone, thus the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of methylprednisolone on all-cause mortality (up to 30 days) (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.07; 86 participants). None of the other outcomes of interest were reported in this study. We included four RCTs (1383 participants) comparing high-dose dexamethasone (12 mg or higher) to low-dose dexamethasone (6 mg to 8 mg). High-dose dexamethasone compared to low-dose dexamethasone may reduce all-cause mortality (up to 30 days) (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.04; 1269 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of high-dose dexamethasone on all-cause mortality (up to 120 days) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.08; 1383 participants) and it may have little or no impact on clinical improvement (discharged alive at 28 days) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.09; 200 participants; low-certainty evidence). Studies did not report data on clinical worsening (new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death). For serious adverse events, adverse events, hospital-acquired infections, and invasive fungal infections, we did not perform analyses beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics due to very low-certainty evidence. We could not identify studies for comparisons of different timing and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. Equity-related subgroup analyses We conducted the following subgroup analyses to explore equity-related factors: sex, age (< 70 years; ≥ 70 years), ethnicity (Black, Asian or other versus White versus unknown) and place of residence (high-income versus low- and middle-income countries). Except for age and ethnicity, no evidence for differences could be identified. For all-cause mortality up to 30 days, participants younger than 70 years seemed to benefit from systemic corticosteroids in comparison to those aged 70 years and older. The few participants from a Black, Asian, or other minority ethnic group showed a larger estimated effect than the many White participants. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease There are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality up to 30 days in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19, while the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on all-cause mortality up to 120 days. For younger people (under 70 years of age) there was a potential advantage, as well as for Black, Asian, or people of a minority ethnic group; further subgroup analyses showed no relevant effects. Evidence related to the most effective type, dose, or timing of systemic corticosteroids remains immature. Currently, there is no evidence on asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). Due to the low to very low certainty of the current evidence, we cannot assess safety adequately to rule out harmful effects of the treatment, therefore there is an urgent need for good-quality safety data. Findings of equity-related subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution because of their explorative nature, low precision, and missing data. We identified 42 ongoing and 23 completed studies lacking published results or relevant information on the study design, suggesting there may be possible changes of the effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future.

### Impact of different corticosteroids on severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ULE3m]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Objectives

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated conflicting results regarding the effects of corticosteroids on the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of different corticosteroids on patients who were hospitalised for severe CAP.

Methods

We performed a systematic search through PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to May 2023. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Data analysis was performed using a random-effects model.

Results

A total of 10 RCTs comprising 1962 patients were included. Corticosteroids were associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR), 0.70 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.90); I² = 0.00%). When stratified into different corticosteroid types, hydrocortisone was associated with an approximately 50% lower mortality risk (RR, 0.48 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.72); I² = 0.00%). However, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone or prednisolone were not associated with an improvement in mortality. Furthermore, hydrocortisone was associated with a reduction in the rate of mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and duration of intensive care unit stay. These trends were not observed for dexamethasone, methylprednisolone or prednisolone. Corticosteroids were not associated with an increased risk of adverse events including gastrointestinal bleeding, secondary infection or hyperglycaemia.

Conclusions

The use of hydrocortisone, but not other types of corticosteroids, was associated with a reduction in mortality and improvement in pneumonia outcomes among patients hospitalised with severe CAP.

### Cytokines and cortisol-predictors of treatment response to corticosteroids in community-acquired pneumonia? [^11625v4U]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A previous study found community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients with imbalance of high inflammation and discordantly low cortisol levels to benefit most from adjunctive corticosteroid treatment. Our aim was to validate this hypothesis in a preplanned secondary analysis of the randomized controlled STEP trial.

Methods

Patients included in the STEP trial receiving 50 mg prednisone or placebo for 5 days were categorized based on pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-6/8/MCP-1), CRP and cortisol levels on admission into four groups (high/low inflammation and high/low cortisol). The primary combined end-point was mortality or ICU admission within 30 days.

Results

In total, 632 patients (315 prednisone, 317 placebo) were included in this analysis. Prednisone did not significantly reduce the risk for the primary end-point in patients with high cytokines/low cortisol and in any other subgroups. However, we noted some differences in the strength of corticosteroid effect in the different subgroups with stronger effects in patients with high cytokines [OR 0.44 (0.10,1.72)] compared to patients with low cytokines [OR 0.68 (0.30,1.5)] (P-interaction = 0.600). The effects did not differ according to cortisol levels.

Conclusion

The imbalance of high inflammation state and low cortisol levels did not predict treatment response to corticosteroids in patients with CAP. However, in line to previous research, inflammation as measured by cytokine levels irrespective of cortisol tended to predict treatment response to corticosteroids in CAP. Whether this concept may help to personalize corticosteroids to patients most likely benefitting from this treatment needs to be tested in future intervention trials.

Conclusion

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, corticosteroid use was associated with an increased risk for recurrent pneumonia, secondary infections, and new insulin dependence in the following 180 days. Currently, it is uncertain whether these long-term adverse effects outweigh the short-term effects of corticosteroids in moderate CAP.

### New aspects in the management of pneumonia [^112bWQua]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, these studies were not able to provide definitive results regarding the use of corticosteroids in CAP. The main limitations regarded the inclusion of a heterogeneous population in terms of severity (from mild to severe) and level of inflammatory response (e.g. defined by the level of C-reactive protein (CRP)) and the use, in some cases, of inadequate dosage of corticosteroids (low or excessively high).

Randomized controlled trials

Two recent multicenter RCTs have been published regarding the use of corticosteroids in CAP.

In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, a total of 785 patients with CAP were randomized to receive oral corticosteroids (50 mg of prednisone for 7 days) or placebo as adjunctive treatment. The corticosteroid group reported a shorter time to reach clinical stability in comparison with the placebo group (3 days versus 4.4 days). In the study, the time to clinical stability was defined as the days until reaching stable vital signs for 24 h or longer (including normalization of temperature, heart rate, spontaneous respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, mental status, ability for oral intake, and adequate oxygenation on room air). The complications related to pneumonia were not significantly different in the groups whereas the prednisone group more frequently presented hyperglycemia needing insulin treatment (19 versus 11%; OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.31–2.93; p = 0.001). However, other adverse events typically associated with corticosteroid use (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, nosocomial infections) were rare and similar in both groups. The mortality rate, considered as a secondary outcome in the study, was not different in the two groups (n = 16 (4%) in the prednisone group versus n = 13 (3%) in the placebo group; p = 0.57). This study presented some limitations, in particular the use of a weak outcome such as clinical stability, which included some items such as temperature that could be influenced by the use of corticosteroids. Moreover, the majority of patients had a mild disease presentation, thereby decreasing result validation for the most severe diseases.

### COPD exacerbations: the impact of long versus short courses of oral corticosteroids on mortality and pneumonia: nationwide data on 67 000 patients with COPD followed for 12 months [^1144WgQH]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, long course of OCS was associated with increased risk of pneumonia hospitalisation and all-cause mortality compared with the short course of OCS. Those with current exposure demonstrated a higher vulnerability to pneumonia and all-cause mortality. Understanding how risk depends on patterns of OCS will contribute to improved benefits and harm assessment. Importantly, causal inference cannot be drawn from these observational data.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114LaX6J]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the reporting guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO.

Search strategy and study selection

We performed a comprehensive systematic search of the Medline, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Scopus databases for articles published between the database inception and April 24, 2023, using appropriate prespecified search terms: "community-acquired pneumonia", "corticosteroid", and "steroid". Only RCTs that assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of adult patients with sCAP were included. To identify relevant reports, we manually searched the reference lists of systematic and narrative reviews and studies that fulfilled the eligibility criteria of the present study.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were included if the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcomes) criteria were met: (a) Population: adult patients (i.e. 18 years of age or older) with sCAP; (b) Intervention: systemic corticosteroids were used regardless of the type of corticosteroid, duration of treatment, dosage, or route of administration (i.e. intervention group); (c) Comparison: placebo or standard care (i.e. control group), (d) Outcomes: mortality, the use of mechanical ventilation (MV), length of intensive care unit ICU stay, length of hospital stay, and the adverse events (AEs). In this study, sCAP was defined as CAP accompanied by requiring ICU admission, or meeting either the criteria for severe pneumonia by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) or classified as risk class V of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Only peer-reviewed RCTs were included in the analysis without restrictions on language, sample size, age, sex, ethnicity, or publication date.

We excluded studies that (1) focused on patients with septic shock; (2) reported data from post-hoc analysis; (3) were published only as conference posters, case series, case reports, or single-arm studies; (4) did not report outcomes of interest; or (5) were pharmacokinetic investigations.

Study selection

Two independent investigators (JYW and YWT) screened the titles and abstracts of the studies to identify potentially eligible studies. Full-text copies of the potentially relevant articles were obtained and reviewed for eligibility. In case of disagreement, a third investigator (WHH) was consulted.

### Real-world corticosteroid use in severe pneumonia: a propensity-score-matched study [^111mS2su]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The mortality benefits of corticosteroid treatment for CAP, as previously reported in a meta-analysis, only appear to be observed in the most severely ill patients who have a high inflammatory response in real-world settings. In the absence of patients with severe CAP having an IMV requirement or developing septic shock, corticosteroids are not associated with lower mortality.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1129oQWf]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids and biologics — pneumonia risk is dose dependent in steroid-treated patients, with increased risk generally occurring when exposed to at least 20 mg equivalent of prednisone daily for more than 2–4 weeks; lower doses (i.e., 10 mg/d) taken for prolonged periods can also confer an increased risk, and the infectious spectrum includes Pneumocystis pneumonia, invasive aspergillosis, and typical causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Blockade of TNFα increases susceptibility to tuberculosis, IL-6 inhibitors and JAK kinase inhibitors have been associated with higher TB risk, other cytokine blockers (anti–IL-12/IL-23, anti–IL-23, anti–IL-17) carry TB warnings but an elevated TB risk has not been demonstrated to date, and additional risk accrues with diabetes, cigarette smoking, advanced age, and concomitant immunosuppressants.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^112yQ37o]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Special considerations in CAP — the panel was unable to make any statements on the use of corticosteroids in CAP in children based on the lack of randomized controlled trials, and the recommendation for bacterial CAP does not require microbiologic confirmation but refers to patients with high clinical suspicion for bacterial pneumonia treated with empiric antibiotics. Further, globally CAP has variable microbiology, thus it is uncertain if corticosteroid effects are generalizable to other etiologies of CAP.

### Addition of steroids improves outcomes in children and… [^113KmRAJ]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question In adults and children with community-acquired pneumonia, does the addition of corticosteroid treatment to usual care improve outcomes. Bottom Line Adding corticosteroid treatment to the management of CAP is beneficial for children and adults. Treatment decreases clinical failures, time in the hospital, and the risk of death in adults with severe pneumonia. Synopsis To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, the authors searched four databases without language restriction, including Cochrane CENTRAL, and identified 17 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2, 264 cases of radiographically confirmed pneumonia in children and adults treated with corticosteroid vs. placebo or no treatment in addition to usual care. Two investigators independently selected the trials for inclusion and abstracted the data.

The corticosteroid varied in type, dosage, and route, with the average dosage in adults being 40 to 50 mg of prednisone equivalents daily for an average of seven days. Corticosteroids decreased mortality in adults with severe CAP but not nonsevere CAP. Treatment resulted in a reduced time to clinical cure, fewer clinical failures, shorter overall hospital stays, fewer intensive care unit stays, and reduced rates of pneumonia complications. In children, corticosteroid treatment reduced the likelihood of clinical failure and decreased the time to clinical cure. Children's mortality rates, studied in only two trials, were not different. Hyperglycemia occurred more often with corticosteroid treatment. The researchers did not evaluate the risk of publication bias. Study results were homogeneous across studies for most outcomes.

### Effect of corticosteroids on mortality and clinical cure in community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of randomized control trials [^114RQ84x]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Corticosteroids may be a beneficial adjunct in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia.

Research Question

Is there any benefit of corticosteroid therapy in the management of bacterial CAP among patients requiring hospitalization?

Study Design and Methods

PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched to identify randomized controlled trials assessing the use of systemic corticosteroids compared with standard care in the management of CAP. A systematic review, meta-analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) were performed. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, treatment failure, readmission, and adverse events. Data are presented as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI, P value, heterogeneity (I 2), and TSA-adjusted CIs.

Results

Sixteen trials met the eligibility criteria. All-cause mortality (16 studies [3,842 patients]; RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.67–1.07]; p = 0.17; I² = 14%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.61–1.09), ICU admission (six studies [2,619 patients]; RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45–0.97]; p = 0.04; I² = 0%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.37–1.12), treatment failure (six studies [2,093 patients]; RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.37–1.67]; p = 0.52; I² = 68%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.02–25.5), and the incidence of adverse events (six studies [2,487 patients]; RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.97–1.25]; p = 0.14; I² = 53%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.82–2.41) were similar between patients receiving corticosteroids and patients assigned to the control group. The need for mechanical ventilation (eight studies [1,457 patients]; RR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.33–0.77]; p = 0.001; I² = 0%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.20–0.85) was lower among patients receiving corticosteroids compared with those receiving standard care. However, corticosteroid use may be associated with higher rates of hospital readmission (five studies [2,853 patients]; RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.05–1.38]; p = 0.008; I² = 0%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.89–1.98).

Interpretation

Corticosteroid therapy is associated with a lower incidence of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation among patients hospitalized with CAP. No association was found between corticosteroid therapy and mortality, treatment failure, or adverse events.

### What is the role of steroids in pneumonia therapy? [^113mZio5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review evaluates the potential benefits as well as adverse effects from adjunctive therapy with systemic steroids in patients with pneumonia: either mild-to-moderate or severe, community-acquired or hospital-acquired, of bacterial or of viral origin (in particular H1N1 viral infection).

Recent Findings

Steroids potentially modulate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system in pneumonia. However, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies have repeatedly shown that steroids had no impact on survival, the clinical event of interest, but in severe pneumonia some studies pointed to potential harmful effect. In addition, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections, as well as increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the steroid-treated patients.

Summary

According to the current evidence, there are no data to support the well tolerated use of systemic steroids as a standard of care in pneumonia, neither in mild-to-moderate and severe, nor in bacterial and viral infection. Clinical and basic research should work together to improve trial designs to identify reliable surrogate markers of outcome, in particular of mortality. This may improve the patient selection and facilitate the identification of subgroups that can benefit from adjunctive steroid therapy.

### Inhaled steroids and risk of pneumonia for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117D3Qru]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are anti-inflammatory drugs that have proven benefits for people with worsening symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and repeated exacerbations. They are commonly used as combination inhalers with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) to reduce exacerbation rates and all-cause mortality, and to improve lung function and quality of life. The most common combinations of ICS and LABA used in combination inhalers are fluticasone and salmeterol, budesonide and formoterol and a new formulation of fluticasone in combination with vilanterol, which is now available. ICS have been associated with increased risk of pneumonia, but the magnitude of risk and how this compares with different ICS remain unclear. Recent reviews conducted to address their safety have not compared the relative safety of these two drugs when used alone or in combination with LABA.

Objectives

To assess the risk of pneumonia associated with the use of fluticasone and budesonide for COPD.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), clinicaltrials.gov, reference lists of existing systematic reviews and manufacturer websites. The most recent searches were conducted in September 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration. Studies were included if they compared the ICS budesonide or fluticasone versus placebo, or either ICS in combination with a LABA versus the same LABA as monotherapy for people with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, numerical data and risk of bias information for each included study. We looked at direct comparisons of ICS versus placebo separately from comparisons of ICS/LABA versus LABA for all outcomes, and we combined these with subgroups when no important heterogeneity was noted. After assessing for transitivity, we conducted an indirect comparison to compare budesonide versus fluticasone monotherapy, but we could not do the same for the combination therapies because of systematic differences between the budesonide and fluticasone combination data sets. When appropriate, we explored the effects of ICS dose, duration of ICS therapy and baseline severity on the primary outcome. Findings of all outcomes are presented in 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADEPro.

Main Results

We found 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria, and more evidence was provided for fluticasone (26 studies; n = 21,247) than for budesonide (17 studies; n = 10,150). Evidence from the budesonide studies was more inconsistent and less precise, and the studies were shorter. The populations within studies were more often male with a mean age of around 63, mean pack-years smoked over 40 and mean predicted forced expiratory volume of one second (FEV1) less than 50%. High or uneven dropout was considered a high risk of bias in almost 40% of the trials, but conclusions for the primary outcome did not change when the trials at high risk of bias were removed in a sensitivity analysis. Fluticasone increased non-fatal serious adverse pneumonia events (requiring hospital admission) (odds ratio (OR) 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50 to 2.12; 18 more per 1000 treated over 18 months; high quality), and no evidence suggested that this outcome was reduced by delivering it in combination with salmeterol or vilanterol (subgroup differences: I(2) = 0%, P value 0.51), or that different doses, trial duration or baseline severity significantly affected the estimate. Budesonide also increased non-fatal serious adverse pneumonia events compared with placebo, but the effect was less precise and was based on shorter trials (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.62; six more per 1000 treated over nine months; moderate quality). Some of the variation in the budesonide data could be explained by a significant difference between the two commonly used doses: 640 mcg was associated with a larger effect than 320 mcg relative to placebo (subgroup differences: I(2) = 74%, P value 0.05). An indirect comparison of budesonide versus fluticasone monotherapy revealed no significant differences with respect to serious adverse events (pneumonia-related or all-cause) or mortality. The risk of any pneumonia event (i.e. less serious cases treated in the community) was higher with fluticasone than with budesonide (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.34); this was the only significant difference reported between the two drugs. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of possible differences in the assignment of pneumonia diagnosis, and because no trials directly compared the two drugs. No significant difference in overall mortality rates was observed between either of the inhaled steroids and the control interventions (both high-quality evidence), and pneumonia-related deaths were too rare to permit conclusions to be drawn.

Authors' Conclusions

Budesonide and fluticasone, delivered alone or in combination with a LABA, are associated with increased risk of serious adverse pneumonia events, but neither significantly affected mortality compared with controls. The safety concerns highlighted in this review should be balanced with recent cohort data and established randomised evidence of efficacy regarding exacerbations and quality of life. Comparison of the two drugs revealed no statistically significant difference in serious pneumonias, mortality or serious adverse events. Fluticasone was associated with higher risk of any pneumonia when compared with budesonide (i.e. less serious cases dealt with in the community), but variation in the definitions used by the respective manufacturers is a potential confounding factor in their comparison. Primary research should accurately measure pneumonia outcomes and should clarify both the definition and the method of diagnosis used, especially for new formulations such as fluticasone furoate, for which little evidence of the associated pneumonia risk is currently available. Similarly, systematic reviews and cohorts should address the reliability of assigning 'pneumonia' as an adverse event or cause of death and should determine how this affects the applicability of findings.

### Adjunct prednisone therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^116K73ZA]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Clinical trials yielded conflicting data about the benefit of adding systemic corticosteroids for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. We assessed whether short-term corticosteroid treatment reduces time to clinical stability in patients admitted to hospital for community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

In this double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with community-acquired pneumonia from seven tertiary care hospitals in Switzerland within 24 h of presentation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either prednisone 50 mg daily for 7 days or placebo. The computer-generated randomisation was done with variable block sizes of four to six and stratified by study centre. The primary endpoint was time to clinical stability defined as time (days) until stable vital signs for at least 24 h, and analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00973154.

Findings

From Dec 1, 2009, to May 21, 2014, of 2911 patients assessed for eligibility, 785 patients were randomly assigned to either the prednisone group (n = 392) or the placebo group (n = 393). Median time to clinical stability was shorter in the prednisone group (3.0 days, IQR 2.5–3.4) than in the placebo group (4.4 days, 4.0–5.0; hazard ratio [HR] 1.33, 95% CI 1.15–1.50, p < 0.0001). Pneumonia-associated complications until day 30 did not differ between groups (11 [3%] in the prednisone group and 22 [6%] in the placebo group; odds ratio [OR] 0.49 [95% CI 0.23–1.02]; p = 0.056). The prednisone group had a higher incidence of in-hospital hyperglycaemia needing insulin treatment (76 [19%] vs 43 [11%]; OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.31–2.93, p = 0.0010). Other adverse events compatible with corticosteroid use were rare and similar in both groups.

Interpretation

Prednisone treatment for 7 days in patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to hospital shortens time to clinical stability without an increase in complications. This finding is relevant from a patient perspective and an important determinant of hospital costs and efficiency.

### Corticosteroid therapy for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pdQPm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is common and often severe.

Purpose

To examine the effect of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy on mortality, morbidity, and duration of hospitalization in patients with CAP.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through 24 May 2015.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of systemic corticosteroids in hospitalized adults with CAP.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed risk of bias. Quality of evidence was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system by consensus among the authors.

Data Synthesis

The median age was typically in the 60s, and approximately 60% of patients were male. Adjunctive corticosteroids were associated with possible reductions in all-cause mortality (12 trials; 1974 patients; risk ratio [RR], 0.67 [95% CI, 0.45 to 1.01]; risk difference [RD], 2.8%; moderate certainty), need for mechanical ventilation (5 trials; 1060 patients; RR, 0.45 [CI, 0.26 to 0.79]; RD, 5.0%; moderate certainty), and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (4 trials; 945 patients; RR, 0.24 [CI, 0.10 to 0.56]; RD, 6.2%; moderate certainty). They also decreased time to clinical stability (5 trials; 1180 patients; mean difference, -1.22 days [CI, -2.08 to -0.35 days]; high certainty) and duration of hospitalization (6 trials; 1499 patients; mean difference, -1.00 day [CI, -1.79 to -0.21 days]; high certainty). Adjunctive corticosteroids increased frequency of hyperglycemia requiring treatment (6 trials; 1534 patients; RR, 1.49 [CI, 1.01 to 2.19]; RD, 3.5%; high certainty) but did not increase frequency of gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Limitations

There were few events and trials for many outcomes. Trials often excluded patients at high risk for adverse events.

Conclusion

For hospitalized adults with CAP, systemic corticosteroid therapy may reduce mortality by approximately 3%, need for mechanical ventilation by approximately 5%, and hospital stay by approximately 1 day.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### COPD exacerbations: the impact of long versus short courses of oral corticosteroids on mortality and pneumonia: nationwide data on 67 000 patients with COPD followed for 12 months [^117HDGBN]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute to high morbidity and mortality. Patients with COPD are also at greater risk of developing pneumonia, mainly due to the impairment of lung defence mechanisms and use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). In addition, patients hospitalised for COPD and pneumonia exhibit substantially higher rates of intensive care admission, mortality and longer length of hospital stay compared with persons without COPD.

Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommendation for treatment duration of systemic corticosteroids (oral corticosteroids, OCS) for acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) has changed over the last decades, ranging from treatment durations of 10–14 days,7–10 daysand is currently 5–7 days. The last reduction was based on a robust randomised controlled trial.

OCS are recommended to patients with COPD during acute exacerbations, and most COPD exacerbations can safely be managed in the outpatient setting.OCS have been found to shorten the length of hospital stays, improve lung function, and reduce the risk of early relapse and treatment failure in patients with non-pneumonia exacerbation. No effect has been observed regarding longer-term lung function, length of stay at intensive care unit and 30-day mortality. Most clinical trials investigating OCS for exacerbations were performed on patients who require hospitalisation, and only a few have described the effect of OCS in the outpatient setting.

OCS use is associated with a number of adverse effects including hyperglycaemia, ﬂuid retention, weight gain, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, adrenal suppression, deep vein thrombosis, osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. Even short courses of OCS (median days = 6) have been associated with adverse effects, and they increase with increased number of OCS courses. In addition, OCS have been shown to cause severe infections due to their immunosuppressive activity, which impairs phagocyte function and suppresses cell-mediated immunity. This was confirmed in a meta-analysis of 71 pooled controlled trials that showed a relative risk of 1.6 for infectious events in the prednisolone group (n = 2111) compared with the controls (n = 2087). However, the risk of severe infections and death following the use of OCS is in general unknown and mainly short-term follow-up endpoints have been reported in patients with COPD. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide, observational cohort study to determine the association between duration of OCS treatment in outpatients with AECOPD and the risk of pneumonia hospitalisation and all-cause mortality during a 1-year study period and to explore how the timing of the exposure affects the risk estimates.

### Effect of corticosteroids on the clinical course of community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^116dR7cj]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- In this prospective, double-blinded, randomized study comparing methylprednisolone (MPDN) to a placebo combined with ceftriaxone plus levofloxacin in severe CAP, MPDN administration was associated with improved oxygenation, faster decrease of fever and radiological improvement.

- MPDN administration was also associated with a faster reduction in blood IL-6 and CRP levels in the first 24 hours of treatment.

### Six-week oral prednisolone therapy for immune-related pneumonitis: a single-arm phase II study [^11595zPJ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

There is controversy regarding a need for intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone therapy prior to oral corticosteroid treatment. Despite the recommendation of guidelines, not all patients with grade ≥ 3 irP receive intravenous methylprednisolone in clinical practice. In the current study, approximately half of the patients with grade ≥ 3 irP did not receive high-dose methylprednisolone prior to the study treatment, which was not significantly associated with the pneumonitis control rate at 6 and 12 weeks. These data suggest that several patients with grade ≥ 3 irP would achieve irP control with sufficient dosing and duration of oral corticosteroid, even without intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone. However, the administration of intravenous methylprednisolone therapy was dependent on the investigators' discretion in the current study, and therefore, there could be a selection bias whether to use it, based on clinical features other than severity of irP. Thus, whether or not to use this or for whom this is used should be further elucidated.

### Corticosteroids for adult patients hospitalised with non-viral community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111QpFWJ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

International clinical practice guidelines addressing corticosteroid treatment for patients hospitalised with non-viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are inconsistent.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of corticosteroids in hospitalised adult patients with suspected or probable CAP. We performed random effects pairwise, Bayesian, and dose-response meta-analyses using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) heterogeneity estimator. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology.

Results

We identified 30 eligible RCTs, including a total of 7519 patients. The prednisone-equivalent doses ranged between 29 mg/day and 100 mg/day. Corticosteroids probably reduced short-term (28–30 days) mortality (RR 0.82 [95% CI 0.74–0.91]; moderate certainty) while the reduction in longer term (60–90 day) mortality is less certain (RR 0.89 [95% CI 0.76–1.03]; low certainty). Corticosteroids reduced the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.48–0.82]; high certainty) and may reduce duration of ICU stay (MD 1.53 days fewer [95% CI 0.31–2.75 days fewer]; low certainty), and hospital stay (MD 2.30 days fewer [95% CI 0.81–3.81 days fewer]; low certainty). Corticosteroids probably increased hyperglycaemia requiring intervention (RR 1.32 [95% CI 1.12–1.56]; moderate certainty) but probably have no effect on secondary infections (RR 0.97 [95% CI 0.85–1.11]; moderate certainty).

Conclusion

Corticosteroids probably reduced short-term mortality and reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in hospitalised patients with CAP.

### Corticosteroids in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: a systematic review, pairwise and dose-response meta-analysis [^1136GLTA]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

International guidelines provide heterogenous guidance on use of corticosteroids for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials examining corticosteroids in hospitalized adult patients with suspected or probable CAP. We performed a pairwise and dose-response meta-analysis using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) heterogeneity estimator. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methodology and the credibility of subgroups using the ICEMAN tool.

Results

We identified 18 eligible studies that included 4661 patients. Corticosteroids probably reduce mortality in more severe CAP (RR 0.62 [95% CI 0.45 to 0.85]; moderate certainty) with possibly no effect in less severe CAP (RR 1.08 [95% CI 0.83 to 1.42]; low certainty). We found a non-linear dose-response relationship between corticosteroids and mortality, suggesting an optimal dose of approximately 6 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent) for a duration of therapy of 7 days (RR 0.44 [95% 0.30 to 0.66]). Corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.56 [95% CI 0.42 to 74] and probably reduce intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR 0.65 [95% CI 0.43 to 0.97]) (both moderate certainty). Corticosteroids may reduce the duration of hospitalization and ICU stay (both low certainty). Corticosteroids may increase the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.76 [95% CI 1.46 to 2.14]) (low certainty).

Conclusion

Moderate certainty evidence indicates that corticosteroids reduce mortality in patients with more severe CAP, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission.

### Efficacy of corticosteroids in community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized double-blinded clinical trial [^114R6dD6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

Some studies have shown a beneficial effect of corticosteroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), possibly by diminishing local and systemic antiinflammatory host response.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of adjunctive prednisolone treatment in patients hospitalized with CAP.

Methods

Hospitalized patients, clinically and radiologically diagnosed with CAP using standard clinical and radiological criteria, were randomized to receive 40 mg prednisolone for 7 days or placebo, along with antibiotics. Primary outcome was clinical cure at Day 7. Secondary outcomes were clinical cure at Day 30, length of stay, time to clinical stability, defervescence, and C-reactive protein. Disease severity was scored using CURB-65 (a severity index for community-acquired pneumonia evaluating Confusion, blood Urea nitrogen, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, and age 65 or older) and Pneumonia Severity Index.

Measurements and Main Results

We enrolled 213 patients. Fifty-four (25.4%) patients had a CURB-65 score greater than 2, and 93 (43.7%) patients were in Pneumonia Severity Index class IV-V. Clinical cure at Days 7 and 30 was 84/104 (80.8%) and 69/104 (66.3%) in the prednisolone group and 93/109 (85.3%) and 84/109 (77.1%) in the placebo group (P = 0.38 and P = 0.08). Patients on prednisolone had faster defervescence and faster decline in serum C-reactive protein levels compared with placebo. Subanalysis of patients with severe pneumonia did not show differences in clinical outcome. Late failure (> 72 h after admittance) was more common in the prednisolone group (20 patients, 19.2%) than in the placebo group (10 patients, 6.4%; P = 0.04). Adverse events were few and not different between the two groups.

Conclusions

Prednisolone (at 40 mg) once daily for a week does not improve outcome in hospitalized patients with CAP. A benefit in more severely ill patients cannot be excluded. Because of its association with increased late failure and lack of efficacy prednisolone should not be recommended as routine adjunctive treatment in CAP.

### COVID-19 and corticosteroids: unfamiliar but potentially fatal infections that can arise following short-course steroid treatment [^116yq7bn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone, have powerful inhibitory effects on the immune system. Patients with COVID-19 may develop severe inflammatory-mediated disease with acute lung injury and multisystem organ dysfunction. Corticosteroids may improve outcomes in seriously ill COVID-19 patients by attenuating this inappropriate host immune response. –

Lower 28-day mortality was demonstrated in the large prospective, open-label controlled RECOVERY trial involving 6,425 participants admitted with COVID-19 in those randomized to 6 mg dexamethasone intravenously or orally once daily for up to 10 days than usual care. In those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, mortality among those treated with dexamethasone was one-third that in those receiving usual care and in those receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation mortality was reduced by one-fifth. Benefit was also seen in those treated more than 7 days after symptom onset with inflammatory lung damage, but not for those without respiratory support requirement at randomization, suggesting the timing of this intervention within the course of illness may be important. On this basis, the use of corticosteroids, which are relatively inexpensive and readily available medications, has increased worldwide for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 disease, as recommended by several health authorities such as the WHO, the NIH, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Similarly, evolving observational data also suggest that corticosteroids may be helpful in the management of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome, an uncommon but very serious complication of COVID-19 in children.

Dear editor,

We read with great interest the article by Wu et al. in which they studied the efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia. The authors ought to be congratulated for such an updated review. However, we have concerns regarding the conclusion of analysis.

### Adjunct prednisone in community-acquired pneumonia: 180-day outcome of a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112kaHG2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The major limitation of this analysis is the question whether short-term corticosteroids are still causative for the effects found at day 180. The trial was not powered for these secondary endpoints; therefore, the results should be considered hypothesis generating.

In addition, despite standardized questions in the endpoints, there is a risk of information bias due to the assessment of data as patient interviews.

It must be acknowledged that COVID-19 pneumonitis and CAP are different diseases and thus comparison is limited, in spite of similarities in subsequent hyperinflammation and pulmonary affection.

The main strengths of the trial are the large number of patients and the randomized placebo-controlled design, preventing many confounders. Moreover, this is the first randomized controlled trial of corticosteroids in CAP investigating long-term outcomes until 180 days.

### Corticosteroids for pneumonia [^111Tb4BV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious illness. Corticosteroids have been suggested for the treatment of different types of infection, however their role in the treatment of pneumonia remains unclear. This is an update of a review published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the treatment of pneumonia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS on 3 March 2017, together with relevant conference proceedings and references of identified trials. We also searched three trials registers for ongoing and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed systemic corticosteroid therapy, given as adjunct to antibiotic treatment, versus placebo or no corticosteroids for adults and children with pneumonia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and pooled data using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model when possible.

Main Results

We included 17 RCTs comprising a total of 2264 participants; 13 RCTs included 1954 adult participants, and four RCTs included 310 children. This update included 12 new studies, excluded one previously included study, and excluded five new trials. One trial awaits classification. All trials limited inclusion to inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with or without healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). We assessed the risk of selection bias and attrition bias as low or unclear overall. We assessed performance bias risk as low for nine trials, unclear for one trial, and high for seven trials. We assessed reporting bias risk as low for three trials and high for the remaining 14 trials. Corticosteroids significantly reduced mortality in adults with severe pneumonia (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84; moderate-quality evidence), but not in adults with non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.00). Early clinical failure rates (defined as death from any cause, radiographic progression, or clinical instability at day 5 to 8) were significantly reduced with corticosteroids in people with severe and non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.7; and RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83, respectively; high-quality evidence). Corstocosteroids reduced time to clinical cure, length of hospital and intensive care unit stays, development of respiratory failure or shock not present at pneumonia onset, and rates of pneumonia complications. Among children with bacterial pneumonia, corticosteroids reduced early clinical failure rates (defined as for adults, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.70; high-quality evidence) based on two small, clinically heterogeneous trials, and reduced time to clinical cure. Hyperglycaemia was significantly more common in adults treated with corticosteroids (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.14). There were no significant differences between corticosteroid-treated people and controls for other adverse events or secondary infections (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.93).

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroid therapy reduced mortality and morbidity in adults with severe CAP; the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 18 patients (95% CI 12 to 49) to prevent one death. Corticosteroid therapy reduced morbidity, but not mortality, for adults and children with non-severe CAP. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with more adverse events, especially hyperglycaemia, but the harms did not seem to outweigh the benefits.

Table 1 — Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes questions — corticosteroid use in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is framed by five PICO questions: "Should corticosteroids be administered to hospitalized patients with sepsis?", "If patients with sepsis are administered corticosteroids, should high dose/short duration or low dose/long duration be used?", "Should corticosteroids compared with no corticosteroids be used in patients with ARDS?", "Should methylprednisolone be used over other corticosteroids in patients with ARDS?", and "Should corticosteroids be administered to hospitalized patients with CAP?". Populations are specified as "All adult and pediatric patients with sepsis", "All adult and pediatric patients with ARDS", and "All adult and pediatric patients with CAP", with interventions and comparators including "Corticosteroids", "Placebo or no corticosteroids", and for methylprednisolone the comparators "Dexamethasone, hydrocortisone", with outcomes referenced in supplemental material.

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids for community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pfPij]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are an option in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, the benefits and adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially in severe CAP, have not been well assessed.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases from inception to May 2015 were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that evaluated use of corticosteroids in adult patients with CAP were included. The quality of outcomes was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The Mantel-Haenszel method with random-effects modeling was used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs.

Results

Nine eligible RCTs (1,667 patients) and six cohort studies (4,095 patients) were identified. The mean corticosteroid dose and treatment duration were 30 mg/day methylprednisolone for 7 days. Corticosteroids did not have a statistically significant effect on mortality (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.43–1.21; evidence rank, low) in patients with CAP and patients with severe CAP (RCTs: RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.43–1.21; evidence rank, low; cohort studies: RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.86–1.17). Corticosteroids treatment was associated with a decreased risk of ARDS (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.08–0.59) and may reduce lengths of hospital and ICU stay, duration of IV antibiotic treatment, and time to clinical stability. Corticosteroids were not associated with increased rates of adverse events.

Conclusions

Short-term treatment with corticosteroids is safe and may reduce the risk of ARDS, shortening the length of the disease in patients with CAP.

### What is the best antimicrobial treatment for severe community-acquired pneumonia (including the role of steroids and statins and other immunomodulatory agents) [^113W3HqP]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death from infectious diseases in the United States. The mortality rate due to severe CAP has shown little improvement over the past few years, with a rate as high as 50% mainly in patients admitted to intensive care units. Death and adverse outcomes from CAP result from a complex interplay between the pathogen and the host. Several therapies have been tested in patients with severe CAP in recent years. This article reviews recent data regarding different treatments including antimicrobials and adjunctive therapies in patients with severe CAP.

### The role of corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^113WSa3S]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the impact of corticosteroids on the outcomes of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We performed a systematic MEDLINE, Cochrane database, and CINAHL search (1966 to November 2007) to identify full-text publications that evaluated the use of corticosteroids in CAP.

Results

An initial literature search yielded 109 articles, and 105 studies were excluded after the first analysis. We found four studies eligible for analysis. On the basis of their results, the use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in severe CAP should be categorized as a weak recommendation (two studies) and a strong recommendation (two studies) with either low- or moderate-quality evidence. However, no evidence of adverse outcomes or harm is present in the evaluated studies.

Conclusion

According to the GRADE system, available studies do not support the recommendation of corticosteroids as a standard of care for patients with severe CAP. Further randomized controlled trials with this aim should enroll a larger number of severely ill patients. However, in patients needing corticosteroids, it may be reasonable to conclude that corticosteroid administration is safe in patients with severe infections receiving antimicrobial therapy.

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 [^1153b4ZV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID-19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

Objectives

To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, ventilator-free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital-acquired infections.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies. All-cause mortality (at longest follow-up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality slightly in people with COVID-19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator-free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution. New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics. Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital-acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low-certainty evidence). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19. Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator-free days. Since we are unable to adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). There is an urgent need for good-quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable. We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline. With the living approach of this review, we will continue to update our search and include eligible trials and published data.

### Final approval for corticosteroids in severe CAP? For sure, in septic shock [^114gKmAU]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of corticosteroids in the care of critically ill patients has been the subject of continuous research efforts with discrepant results. In sepsis, several "swings of the pendulum" for administering such drugs have occurred in the last two decades. A continuous and growing interest is in determining their role in a common source of sepsis: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients. Some studies in the last decade aimed to determine if corticosteroids resulted in a clinical benefit to the patients with the most severe clinical presentation and highest mortality of CAP: Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP). Corticosteroids have already been shown to be beneficial in those with high systemic inflammatory response and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Corticosteroids may also be useful in patients with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, who may have a more severe inflammatory response to sCAP. However, other studies have not found any significant benefit of corticosteroid therapy in CAP in mortality or treatment failure and have raised concerns about potential harm, including increased risk of secondary infections and delayed resolution for pneumonia.

### Impact of different corticosteroids on severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116JqriT]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

We conducted a systematic review through PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science and Scopus, searching for studies published from inception to May 2023, without language restrictions, using an approach that incorporated keywords including pneumonia and corticosteroids (online supplemental table 1). Referenced citations of included studies as well as articles citing the included studies were manually searched to identify any other potentially relevant studies. Articles published in languages other than English were interpreted using Google Translate. This study was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The review protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023431360).

Study selection

Eligible studies were RCTs that investigated the effectiveness of intravenous or oral corticosteroid therapy in adults hospitalised for severe CAP. Corticosteroids included hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone. Studies were required to report on at least one of the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, need for mechanical ventilation or development of serious complications of CAP or adverse events commonly associated with corticosteroids. Studies that focused on specific pneumonia populations, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia as well as those limited to specific patient populations such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes mellitus, were excluded from the analysis. Severe CAP was defined according to commonly used criteria: a Pneumonia Severity Index score of IV or V, a CURB-65 (Confusion, blood Urea nitrogen, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, and age 65 or older) score greater than 2, fulfilment of one major or three minor criteria from the 2007 consensus guideline of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society, a score of 3 or greater using British Thoracic Society criteria, development of respiratory failure defined by a PaO2:FiO2 < 300 or admission to the ICU (online supplemental table 2). Studies that enrolled patients with different severity of CAP were included if they reported subgroup data on severe CAP. The primary authors were contacted when subgroup data were not available in the published article.

The eligibility of each study was determined through a rigorous screening process conducted by two reviewers (CHa Chiang and CHu Chiang), who independently screened titles and abstracts, and obtained full texts of articles that were considered potentially eligible. The final inclusion of studies was determined through discussion with a third reviewer (JL). The inclusion and exclusion of included studies are summarised in online supplemental table 3.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^116JaKRd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a potentially fatal pulmonary disease. Although studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids for severe CAP, the results remain inconsistent. Moreover, there is a lack of sufficient evidence to rank the effects of different types of corticosteroids. The aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of different corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science comprehensively, encompassing all publications with a search deadline of March 31, 2024. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving the treatment of severe CAP with corticosteroids were included. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality, secondary efficacy outcome was mechanical ventilation (MV), and safety outcome was the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs).

Results

A total of 11 studies, involving 2042 participants, compared four corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone). The included trials were all corticosteroid versus placebo comparisons, resulting in a star-shaped network. Among the four corticosteroids, only hydrocortisone was significantly more effective at reducing mortality than placebo (RR, 0.35; 95% CrI, 0.14–0.64). Additionally, hydrocortisone reduced the need for MV (RR, 0.73; 95% CrI, 0.51–0.93). Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated that low-to-moderate doses, short-course corticosteroids are associated with a reduction in both mortality and the need for MV.

Conclusion

In the evaluated corticosteroid regimen, hydrocortisone might be an effective measure to reduce all-cause mortality in patients with severe CAP.

Clinical Trial Number

The present study is a meta-analysis and literature review, therefore clinical trial number is not applicable.

### Corticosteroids for hospitalized patients with community-… [^115ytTdS]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are corticosteroids safe and effective at reducing rates of mortality and clinical failure in adults and children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. Evidence-Based Answer For adults hospitalized with severe CAP, the use of corticosteroids may reduce the likelihood of mortality. For adults and children hospitalized with CAP, the use of corticosteroids may reduce the likelihood of early clinical failure. The risk of hyperglycemia is transient and of limited clinical significance. 2, 3 The authors of a previous Cochrane review found that "in most patients with pneumonia, corticosteroids are generally beneficial for accelerating the time to resolution of symptoms, " 4 but the evidence was not deemed strong enough to make firm recommendations.

Subsequently, a 2015 systematic review found that corticosteroids for adults hospitalized with CAP might reduce mortality, use of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. 5 However, the most recent guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America do not recommend using corticosteroids for adults with nonsevere or severe CAP, and they endorse the use of corticosteroids only for patients with CAP and refractory septic shock.
6. 1 Although the authors searched broadly for studies examining all severities of pneumonia and all treatment settings, the only studies that met inclusion criteria were RCTs of corticosteroids used in the inpatient treatment of CAP. The included trials were conducted in Europe, the Middle East, China, Japan, South Africa, and Australia. Thirteen of the 17 studies began in 2000 or later.

For the main outcomes reported in the Cochrane review, the findings were generally consistent across the studies. 4 but subsequent meta-analyses have demonstrated improvements in morbidity 8–10 and mortality 5 when adjunctive corticosteroids are used in hospitalized patients with CAP. The recent ATS/IDSA guidelines 6 were published after this Cochrane review, focus only on adults, and cite the four previous meta-analyses 5, 8–10; however, they do not address the findings of this review. The ATS/IDSA guidelines do not support routine use of corticosteroids in adults with severe or nonsevere CAP, but they call for further research in this area. 6.

### Effect of corticosteroids on the clinical course of community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^117D6Hou]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The results provided by this double-blind, randomised trial of CAP patients admitted to a general hospital ward and presenting severe respiratory failure and extensive radiological consolidations support the hypothesis that an adjuvant steroid therapy decreases the inflammatory response, and seems to reduce the need for MV. This experience supports the need for larger studies in order to establish the usefulness of this therapeutic strategy in the different kinds of CAP.

### How would you treat this patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^111p1VTX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Combined corticosteroid and long-acting β-agonist in one inhaler versus inhaled steroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1126b3CM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting beta-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids have both been recommended in guidelines for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Their co-administration in a combined inhaler is intended to facilitate adherence to medication regimens, and to improve efficacy. Two preparations are currently available, fluticasone/salmeterol (FPS) and budesonide/formoterol (BDF).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of combined inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist preparations, compared to inhaled corticosteroids, in the treatment of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. The date of the most recent search is April 2007.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they were randomised and double-blind. Studies compared combined inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonist preparations with the inhaled corticosteroid component.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcome were exacerbations, mortality and pneumonia. Health-related quality of life (measured by validated scales), lung function and side-effects were secondary outcomes. Dichotomous data were analysed as fixed effect odds ratios (OR), and continuous data as mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Seven studies of good methodological quality met the inclusion criteria randomising 5708 participants with predominantly poorly reversible, severe COPD. Exacerbation rates were significantly reduced with combination therapies (Rate ratio 0.91; 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.97, P = 0.0008). Data from two FPS studies indicated that exacerbations requiring oral steroids were reduced with combination therapy. Data from one large study suggest that there is no significant difference in the rate of hospitalisations. Mortality was also lower with combined treatment (odds ratio 0.77; 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.94). Quality of life, lung function and withdrawals due to lack of efficacy favoured combination treatment. Adverse event profiles were similar between the two treatments. No significant differences were found between FPS and BDP in the primary outcomes, but the confidence intervals for the BDP results were wide as smaller numbers of patients have been studied.

Authors' Conclusions

Combination ICS and LABA significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in COPD when compared with mono component steroid. Adverse events were not significantly different between treatments, although evidence from other sources indicates that inhaled corticosteroids are associated with increased risk of pneumonia. Assessment of BDF in larger, long-term trials is required. Dose response data would provide valuable evidence on whether efficacy and safety outcomes are affected by different steroid loads.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^112nc1MD]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Dosing of corticosteroids for severe CAP — the 2017 SCCM/ESICM guideline recommended corticosteroids for 5–7 days at a daily dose < 400 mg IV hydrocortisone or equivalent, and the updated recommendation recognizes that multiple dosing strategies are acceptable for severe CAP and likely related to clinician discretion. Typical doses range from 40 to 80 mg/d IV methylprednisolone equivalent for a duration of 5–7 days, with one study including a prolonged taper over 20 days, and one guided by clinical criteria for 8 or 14 days; current evidence did not demonstrate a differential effect based on corticosteroid duration and showed a possible subgroup interaction on mortality based on corticosteroid molecule.

### Adjuvant steroid therapy in community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112bp7ao]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among adults. Although steroids appear to be beneficial in animal models of CAP, clinical trial data in humans are either equivocal or conflicting.

Purpose

Our purpose was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the impact of steroid therapy on clinical outcomes among adults admitted with CAP.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) through a systematic search of published literature up to July 2011.

Data Extraction

We estimated relative risks (RR) and weighted mean differences, pooled from each study using a random effects model.

Data Synthesis

Eight RCTs, comprising 1119 patients, met our selection criteria. Overall quality of the studies was moderate. Adjunctive steroid therapy had no effect on hospital mortality or length of stay in the intensive care unit, but reduced the overall length of hospital stay (RR: -1.21 days [95% confidence interval (CI): -2.12 to -0.29]). Less robust data also demonstrated reduced incidence of delayed shock (RR: 0.12 [95% CI: 0.03 to 0.41]) and reduced persistence of chest x-ray abnormalities (RR: 0.13 [95% CI: 0.06 to 0.27]). A priori subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not alter these findings.

Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that adjunctive steroid therapy for adults hospitalized with CAP reduced the length of hospital stay but did not alter mortality.
