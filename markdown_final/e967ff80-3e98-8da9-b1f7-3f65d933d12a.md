## Question

Is urate lowering therapy recommended concomitantly with anti inflammatory drugs during flare or after flare settles?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be started during a gout flare and whether anti-inflammatory prophylaxis should be given with ULT, including how long to continue it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the timing of ULT initiation relative to an acute flare. Then, I should verify the rationale and strength of recommendations from major guidelines. Next, I will examine the evidence base supporting initiation during a flare. After that, I need to check the requirement for concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis and its duration. Finally, I will consider special populations, practical implementation, and reconcile any conflicting guidance before concluding with a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and why timing matters. ULT lowers serum urate and dissolves monosodium urate crystals, but during early ULT, mobilization of crystals can transiently increase flare risk, which is why prophylaxis is standard and why some clinicians historically deferred ULT until after a flare resolved; however, more recent guidance has shifted toward earlier initiation with appropriate anti-inflammatory coverage, so I need to verify how strong those recommendations are and in whom they apply [^fcbd57e1] [^048ace40].

> I will now examine the highest-credibility guidance on timing. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline makes a conditional recommendation to start ULT during a gout flare rather than waiting for resolution, provided that anti-inflammatory therapy is given concurrently; this is a conditional recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence and patient preference considerations, and it explicitly notes that starting ULT during a flare does not appear to prolong the current episode when anti-inflammatories are used [^5b3e28b5] [^4f057803] [^f00b1b6c].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base supporting initiation during a flare. Small randomized trials and observational data show that starting ULT during an acute flare does not worsen or prolong the flare when anti-inflammatory therapy is co-administered; for example, an RCT of allopurinol initiated during a flare with colchicine prophylaxis found no difference in time to flare resolution versus placebo, and a randomized febuxostat study likewise showed no prolongation of the current flare with early initiation, supporting the ACR's conditional stance [^f013602e] [^07208b99].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the requirement for concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis. The ACR issues a strong recommendation for concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis when starting ULT, favoring colchicine, NSAIDs, or low-dose prednisone/prednisolone for at least 3–6 months, with extension if flares continue; this is a strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence showing reduced flare risk during ULT initiation and titration [^10bfe735] [^d59375bb] [^bea6ab4b].

> Let me consider duration carefully. I initially thought 3 months might suffice, but wait, I should double-check the comparative data. A post hoc analysis of phase III febuxostat trials showed that 6 months of prophylaxis yielded lower flare rates than 8 weeks, and multiple guidelines converge on 3–6 months, with some recommending at least 6 months in higher-risk patients; thus, 3–6 months is appropriate, and extending to 6 months is reasonable if flares persist or risk is high [^a2afff65] [^189ffde1] [^6239eda6].

> Next, I should review special populations and exceptions. For patients with CKD, I need to ensure safety: KDIGO advises that ULT can be considered after a first gout episode in CKD, especially with SU > 9 mg/dL, and recommends low-dose colchicine or glucocorticoids rather than NSAIDs for acute flares and prophylaxis due to nephrotoxicity risk; this aligns with ACR's caution about NSAIDs in CKD and supports using colchicine or steroids for prophylaxis when ULT is initiated in CKD [^5171daf1] [^ad5ebc0e] [^ec5628dd].

> I should confirm first-flare nuances. The ACR conditionally recommends against starting ULT after a first flare unless there are high-risk features such as CKD stage ≥ 3, SU > 9 mg/dL, or urolithiasis; in those high-risk scenarios, starting ULT during or after the flare with prophylaxis is reasonable, whereas in low-risk first flares, observation with education and shared decision-making is acceptable, though some guidelines like EULAR/BSR increasingly support earlier ULT discussion even after a first attack [^4e634aee] [^a8a4b616] [^7f996b19].

> Let me think about practical implementation and adherence. Real-world and implementation studies show that initiating ULT during hospitalization for a flare, alongside aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy and structured follow-up, increases ULT uptake and urate target attainment without increasing recurrent hospitalizations; this supports seizing the opportunity of a flare to start definitive therapy with prophylaxis and education, which can improve long-term outcomes [^ac160a39] [^9628c580] [^32ff3d45].

> But wait, what if guidelines conflict? BSR suggests initiating ULT ideally after inflammation has settled, whereas ACR conditionally supports starting during a flare with anti-inflammatories; reconciling this, the balance of contemporary evidence and modern rheumatology practice favors ACR's approach when anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is assured, while acknowledging that shared decision-making and patient preference are essential, particularly in first flares or when comorbidities complicate agent selection [^45d72ca7] [^5b3e28b5] [^2909c889].

> Final synthesis: I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, ULT can be initiated during a gout flare when indicated, and it should always be accompanied by concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months, with extension if flares persist; this strategy is conditionally recommended by ACR and supported by trials showing no prolongation of flares with early ULT when anti-inflammatories are used, while prophylaxis substantially reduces mobilization flares during ULT initiation and titration [^5b3e28b5] [^10bfe735] [^f013602e] [^07208b99].

Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be started **during a flare** when indicated, but only with **concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis** (colchicine, NSAIDs, or low-dose prednisone) to prevent flare exacerbation [^5b3e28b5] [^10bfe735]. If ULT is not started during the flare, begin it **immediately after the flare resolves**, and continue prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months [^d59375bb] [^6239eda6]. This approach balances the risk of early flares from crystal mobilization with the benefits of timely ULT initiation and sustained flare prevention [^048ace40] [^cc968c42].

---

## Timing of urate-lowering therapy initiation

### Initiating ULT during a flare

- **ACR 2020 guidelines**: Conditionally recommend starting ULT during a flare if anti-inflammatory therapy is given concurrently, as it does not prolong or worsen the flare [^5b3e28b5] [^4f057803].
- **Evidence**: Small RCTs show starting allopurinol or febuxostat during a flare with anti-inflammatory cover does not extend flare duration or increase severity [^f013602e] [^07208b99].
- **Rationale**: Patients are often more motivated to start ULT during a flare, which can improve adherence and outcomes [^458183a9].

---

### Initiating ULT after a flare

If ULT is not started during the flare, it should be initiated **immediately after resolution**, with continued anti-inflammatory prophylaxis to mitigate early flares from crystal mobilization [^d59375bb] [^6239eda6].

---

## Role of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis

### Rationale for prophylaxis

During ULT initiation, **early flares** can occur due to crystal dissolution and mobilization; prophylaxis reduces this risk and improves adherence [^048ace40] [^fcbd57e1].

---

### Recommended prophylactic agents and duration

| **Prophylactic agent** | **Recommended dose** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Colchicine | 0.5–0.6 mg once or twice daily | 3–6 months |
| NSAIDs (e.g. naproxen) | 250 mg twice daily | 3–6 months |
| Prednisone/prednisolone | 5–10 mg daily | 3–6 months |

---

ACR 2020 **strongly recommends** prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months, extending if flares persist, and tailoring the agent to comorbidities and tolerance [^10bfe735] [^d59375bb].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting concomitant therapy

- **Febuxostat trial**: Starting febuxostat during a flare with anti-inflammatory therapy did not prolong the current flare [^f013602e].
- **Allopurinol trials**: Early allopurinol with prophylaxis did not worsen flares and enabled faster urate lowering [^07208b99].
- **Meta-analysis**: ULT plus colchicine or rilonacept reduces flares versus ULT alone, supporting prophylaxis [^f96c1caf].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Guideline** | **Ult initiation during flare** | **Prophylaxis duration** |
|-|-|-|
| ACR 2020 | Conditionally recommended with anti-inflammatory therapy | 3–6 months |
| EULAR 2016 | Not specifically addressed | 6 months |
| BSR 2017 | Prefer after flare settles | 3–6 months |

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **During a flare**: Start ULT if indicated, with concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis (colchicine, NSAID, or low-dose prednisone) [^5b3e28b5] [^10bfe735].
- **After a flare**: Start ULT immediately after resolution, continuing prophylaxis for 3–6 months [^d59375bb] [^6239eda6].
- **Individualize**: Choose prophylaxis based on comorbidities, contraindications, and patient preference [^d59375bb] [^ec5628dd].

---

## Conclusion

ULT can be started **during a flare** when accompanied by anti-inflammatory prophylaxis, or **immediately after the flare** with continued prophylaxis for 3–6 months. This strategy minimizes early flares and supports timely urate lowering and long-term control [^5b3e28b5] [^10bfe735].

### Prophylaxis for acute gout flares after initiation of urate-lowering therapy [^60cff61c]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This review summarizes evidence relating to prophylaxis for gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published in English from 1963 to 2013 using MEsH terms covering all aspects of prophylaxis for flares. Dispersion of monosodium urate crystals during the initial phase of deposit dissolution with ULT exposes the patient to an increased rate of acute flares that could contribute to poor treatment adherence. Slow titration of ULT might decrease the risk of flares. According to the most recent international recommendation, the two first-line options for prophylaxis are low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice a day) or low-dose NSAIDs such as naproxen 250 mg orally twice a day. They can be given for up to 6 months. If these drugs are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) might be used. Recently, reports for four trials described the efficacy of canakinumab and rilonacept, two IL-1 inhibitors, for preventing flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Prophylaxis for flares induced by ULT is an important consideration in gout management. Low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs are the recommended first-line therapies. Although no IL-1 blockers are approved as prophylactic treatment, this class of drug could become an interesting option for patients with gout with intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids.

### When underlying biology threatens the randomization principle-initial gout flares of urate-lowering therapy [^048ace40]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Flare is the dominant feature of gout and occurs because of inflammatory response to monosodium urate crystals; prevention of gout flares should be the major goal of gout care. However, a paradoxical increase in the risk of flare following initiation of urate-lowering therapy presents considerable challenges for proving the expected long-term benefits of flare prevention in clinical trials. Nevertheless, excluding from enumeration flares that occur in the initial post-randomization period (which can last several months to 1 year) can threaten the core benefits of randomization: the characteristics of the remaining participants can differ from those who were randomized, introducing potential bias from confounding (both measured and unmeasured); participants who drop out or die are excluded from the analysis, introducing potential selection bias; and, finally, ignoring initial flares underestimates participants' experience during the trial. This Perspective discusses these issues and recommends measures that will allow for high-level evidence that preserves the randomization principle, to satisfy methodological scrutiny and generate robust evidence-based guidelines for gout care.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cbb6c3f8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^f013602e]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is a common arthritic condition that results from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Urate-lowering treatment (ULT) is important for patients with gout. Previous guidelines have provided conflicting recommendations on whether ULT could be initiated during an acute gout flare. Generally, ULT should be initiated after an acute flare has resolved to avoid prolongation of symptoms. The incidence of gout flares has been positively correlated with the reduction of serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the first few months after initiating ULT.

However, ULT could be initiated during an acute flare to reduce the number of outpatient treatment visits required, and hence increase patient compliance. The 2016 EULAR Gout Management Recommendations have not provided clear guidance on this. In addition, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the management of gout have conditionally recommended that pharmacological urate-lowering therapy could be initiated during an acute gout flare based on anti-inflammatory treatment. However, this recommendation was graded moderate based on two small randomized clinical trials and an observational study.

Two small randomized clinical trials observed that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. Febuxostat (40 mg/day) had a superior urate-lowering effect compared with limited allopurinol doses (maximum 200–300 mg/day). At present, no studies have been published regarding the initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flares. Our objective of this study was to determine whether the initiation of febuxostat during an acute gout flare prolongs the current episode.

### Effect of prophylaxis on gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy: analysis of data from three phase III trials [^a2afff65]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), such as febuxostat or allopurinol, is recommended for the long-term management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout to reduce the incidence of acute flares. Because of the paradoxical relationship between early use of ULT and the increased incidence of gout flares, prophylaxis with either low-dose colchicine or NSAIDs has been recommended, although there have been concerns about the long-term prophylactic use of these agents.

Objectives

The present analysis examined flare rates during the 3 Phase III trials of febuxostat based on mean postbaseline serum urate (sUA) concentrations and duration of prophylaxis. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by prophylaxis with colchicine or naproxen.

Methods

This investigator-initiated, post hoc reanalysis of data on gout flares from the 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III trials evaluated the proportion of patients requiring treatment for gout flares at 4-week intervals based on mean postbaseline sUA concentrations < 6.0 and ≥ 6.0 mg/dL. The 3 trials enrolled males or females aged 18–85 years who had a diagnosis of gout and a baseline sUA concentration ≥ 8.0 mg/dL. Patients received ULT (febuxostat or allopurinol) or placebo for 6 months or 1 year and flare prophylaxis with colchicine 0.6 mg/d or naproxen 250 mg BID for 8 weeks or 6 months. The prophylactic regimen was chosen at the discretion of the investigator, based on renal function and known intolerance to either drug. Patients with an estimated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min were not to receive naproxen. AEs were summarized based on prophylaxis with colchicine or naproxen.

Results

The 3 trials enrolled a total of 4101 patients with gout. The majority were white (80.1%), male (94.5%), and obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) (62.8%). The mean duration of gout ranged from 10.9–11.9 years, and the mean baseline sUA concentration ranged from 9.6–9.9 mg/dL. Flare rates increased sharply (up to 40%) at the end of 8 weeks of prophylaxis and then declined gradually, whereas flare rates were consistently low (range, 3%-5%) at the end of 6 months of prophylaxis. Mean postbaseline sUA concentrations were correlated with flare rates; by the end of each study, patients with a mean postbaseline sUA concentration < 6.0 mg/dL had fewer flares than did those with a mean postbaseline sUA concentration ≥ 6.0 mg/dL. There were differences in rates of AEs between prophylaxis groups, but the rates did not increase with increased duration of prophylaxis.

Conclusion

This analysis of gout flare data from the 3 Phase III trials of febuxostat found that flare prophylaxis for up to 6 months during the initiation of ULT appeared to provide greater benefit than flare prophylaxis for 8 weeks, with no increase in AEs.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^d109f4d6]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

To enhance usability of a DA in daily practice, it is essential to adhere to national and/or international recommendations (EULAR/ACR). The distinction in the current DA between the first-line (allopurinol) and second-line (febuxostat and benzbromaron) ULT options, advice on lifestyle changes, need for prophylaxis on ULT initiation and the role of a sUA target are all supported in national as well as international recommendations.

The development of the DA posed some challenges, especially regarding evidence-based information on the risk of flares with and without ULT. Flares, the most important indicator of effectiveness for patients, are not or inconsistently reported in RCTs and follow-up is often too short to provide meaningful data on risks and benefits for clinical care. Fortunately, observational studies on the relation between sUA and flares with and without ULT were helpful, the discussion on sUA as biomarker for gout is ongoing. An advantage of this approach was that we could 'personalise' the DA, by presenting different risk for future flares depending on the initial sUA level while keeping the relative effectiveness of ULT. Some studies suggest that febuxostat has exacerbation of acute gout flares at the start of treatment, which is less the case for allopurinol, but evidence is weak. In other words, while febuxostat is more effective in sUA target achievement compared with allopurinol at the recommended dose, this does not translate into better effectiveness on flare reduction. Yet, the relationship between sUA and gout flares is complex.

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^d6940733]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to management of acute flares, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to treat acute flares of gout as early as possible. Educate fully informed patients to self-medicate at the first warning symptoms. Decide on the drug choice based on the presence of contraindications, the patient's previous experience with treatments, time of initiation after flare onset and the number and type of joints involved.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: consensus statement of the gout, hyperuricemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) [^af19a095]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^32ff3d45]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Following implementation of this strategy, many aspects of hospital gout care improved: joint aspirations increased; serum urate levels were performed more frequently; use of guideline-recommended flare treatments increased (particularly combination therapy); and gout-specific follow-up was provided to more patients. Rheumatologist input also increased; specialist support for frontline clinicians was felt to be an important facilitator of optimal gout care during our stakeholder consultations, supported by previous analyses demonstrating that rheumatology input associates with improvements in care for hospitalized gout patients.

The biggest change observed following implementation of our strategy was increased initiation of ULT. By 6 months post-discharge, 94% of patients had been prescribed ULT. This is comparable to ULT initiation rates in the Nottingham primary care-based study, and substantially better than the 61% of patients who were receiving ULT within 12 months of hospitalization in a recent UK-wide analysis. In particular, there was a 3-fold increase in the proportion of patients initiating and/or up-titrating ULT prior to discharge. There has been extensive debate around the relative benefits and harms of early ULT initiation (vs deferred initiation of ULT after flare resolution), with international guidelines varying widely in this regard. We advocated for early ULT initiation for several reasons. First, hospitalizations provide unique opportunities for clinicians to optimize care for people with long-term conditions, such as gout. Second, accumulating evidence suggests that upfront initiation of ULT does not prolong or worsen intercurrent flares, provided it is initiated alongside flare treatment. Third, earlier initiation of ULT leads to more timely reductions in serum urate levels. Finally, this approach can help to mitigate a breakdown in communication between secondary care and primary care, whereby post-discharge recommendations to initiate ULT are not acted upon.

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^f5a935bc]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and intervention

We performed a prospective cohort study at a large teaching hospital in South London, UK, which serves a population of over 1 million people. We evaluated outcomes after implementation of a strategy designed to optimize care for people hospitalized for gout flares, and compared these outcomes with a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients from before implementation.

The intervention package consisted of two key components: (i) an in-hospital gout management pathway (Supplementary Data S1, available at Rheumatology online), based on British Society for Rheumatology (BSR), European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) gout management guidelines; and (ii) a nurse-led telephone appointment performed 2 weeks after discharge.

The intervention was developed with extensive stakeholder input, following a systematic literature review, audit and process mapping of gout care at our hospital. The management pathway was designed as a quick-reference guide on optimal gout care for use by frontline clinicians and rheumatologists. This included recommendations on: diagnostic tests (including serum urate levels and joint aspiration); rheumatologist input; flare treatments (NSAIDs, colchicine and/or corticosteroids, where appropriate); offering ULT (allopurinol first-line) to all patients unless contraindicated; initiating ULT during the acute flare; considering prophylaxis against flares during ULT initiation and titration; admission-avoidance strategies (e.g. ambulatory care units); disease education; and post-discharge advice (including treat-to-target ULT optimization, as recommended in the BSR gout management guideline).

### Comparative risk of gout flares when initiating or escalating various urate-lowering therapy: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^f96c1caf]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

We systematically examined comparative gout flare risk after initiation or escalation of different urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), comparative flare risk with and without concomitant flare prophylaxis, adverse event rates associated with flare prophylaxis, and optimal duration of flare prophylaxis.

Methods

We searched the Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases and clinical trial registries from inception to November 2021 for trials investigating adults with gout initiating or escalating ULT. We performed random effects network meta-analyses and calculated risk ratios (RRs) between treatments. Bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.

Results

We identified 3,775 records, of which 29 publications (27 trials) were included. When compared to placebo plus prophylaxis, the RR of flares ranged from 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87–1.33) for febuxostat 40 mg plus prophylaxis to RR 2.65 [95% CI 1.58–4.45] for febuxostat 80 mg plus lesinurad 400 mg plus prophylaxis. Compared to ULT alone, the RR of flares was lower for ULT plus rilonacept 160 mg (RR 0.35 [95% CI 0.25–0.50]), ULT plus rilonacept 80 mg (RR 0.43 [95% CI 0.31–0.60]) and ULT plus colchicine (RR 0.50 [95% CI 0.35–0.72]). There was limited evidence for other flare prophylaxis and on prophylaxis harms and optimal duration. Primarily because of missing outcome data and bias in the selection of reported results, 71.4% and 63.4% of studies were assessed as high risk of bias for flares and adverse events, respectively.

Conclusion

The RR of flares when introducing ULT varies depending on ULT drug and dosing strategies. There were limited data on ULT escalation. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine and rilonacept reduces flare incidence. More research is required on the harms and optimal duration of prophylaxis.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^9628c580]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the marked increase in ULT initiation during flares, we did not observe an increase in hospitalizations for recurrent flares after implementing this strategy. These real-world data support those obtained from trial settings. Although not statistically significant, proportionately fewer re-hospitalizations occurred after implementation, relative to before (37.6% relative reduction; 5.6% absolute reduction), suggesting a potential for benefit with this approach. One contributory factor might have been the post-discharge follow-up appointment, which gave patients an opportunity to have any ongoing symptoms reviewed. Advice on flare management was provided within this appointment, empowering patients to self-manage flares. With longer follow-up, there is the potential for more admissions to be prevented with this strategy: observational data show that ULT associates with a significantly reduced risk of recurrent hospitalizations from 12 months after initiation, particularly when urate targets are attained. Future work will help to determine whether primary care workload is also reduced following implementation of better hospital gout care.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Gout [^903698b8]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease of deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which form in the presence of increased urate concentrations. Although environmental factors contribute to hyperuricaemia, renal and gut excretion of urate is central to regulation of serum urate, and genetic factors are important. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of interleukin 1β have key roles in initiation of acute gout flares. A "treat to target serum urate" approach is essential for effective gout management; long-term lowering of serum urate to less than 360 μmol/L leads to crystal dissolution and ultimately to suppression of flares. An allopurinol dose-escalation strategy is frequently effective for achieving treatment targets, and several new urate-lowering drugs are also available. Worldwide, rates of initiation and continuation of urate-lowering therapy are very low, and, consequently, achievement of serum urate targets is infrequent. Strategies to improve quality of gout care are needed.

Literature search

Three SLRs were identified, synthetising efficacy of allopurinol, febuxostat and uricosurics. As the last search of each review was older than 12 months, updates were conducted using each SLR's original search strategy. Overall, six RCTs were selected comparing effect of ULT to placebo or other ULTs on flares as outcome (the preferred outcome for patients). After tabulating the study characteristics, data turned out to be too heterogeneous (eg, exclusion criteria, definition of flares, sUA level at inclusion) and follow-up time was too short to provide meaningful data on efficacy on flares (as flares provoked by ULT initiation distorts long-term efficacy). Therefore, an available review of five longitudinal studies reporting data on the association of flares according to sUA category was used. The study best fitting our target population, concerned patients with rheumatologists diagnosed gout and clinically confirmed flares. Of note, the majority of patients were (not yet) treated with ULT during follow-up. As the relation between sUA and flare was steep, it was decided to distinguish two sUA categories, differing in future flares risk. In patients with an sUA of > 0.36– < 0.55 mmol/L, future flares risk was 48/100 and in patients with a sUA ≥ 0.55 mmol/L future flare risk was 90/100 within a follow-up period of at least 1 year. Patients who would reach the sUA target (≤ 0.36 mmol/L) would have a future flares risk of 12/100. To understand the relative efficacy of the different ULTs, one head-to-head RCT comparing allopurinol, febuxostat and placebo concluded a stronger impact of febuxostat compared with allopurinol on sUA but not on flares.

### Critical appraisal of serum urate targets in the management of gout [^1b5a3ff1]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Gout management involves two broad aspects: treatment of gout flares to provide rapid symptomatic relief and long-term urate-lowering therapy to lower serum urate sufficiently to prevent gout flares from occurring. All of the major rheumatology societies recommend a target serum urate of < 5mg/dl (< 0.30mmol/l) or < 6mg/dl (< 0.36mmol/l), both of which are below the point of saturation for urate and therefore lead to monosodium urate crystal dissolution. In this Review, we describe the rationale for treat-to-target urate approach in the long-term management of gout and the current evidence and controversy around the appropriate serum urate targets.

### Gout [^fcbd57e1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease caused by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Gout typically presents as an acute, self-limiting inflammatory monoarthritis that affects the joints of the lower limb. Elevated serum urate level (hyperuricaemia) is the major risk factor for MSU crystal deposition and development of gout. Although traditionally considered a disorder of purine metabolism, altered urate transport, both in the gut and the kidneys, has a key role in the pathogenesis of hyperuricaemia. Anti-inflammatory agents, such corticosteroids, NSAIDs and colchicine, are widely used for the treatment of gout flare; recognition of the importance of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and bioactive IL-1β release in initiation of the gout flare has led to the development of anti-IL-1β biological therapy for gout flares. Sustained reduction in serum urate levels using urate-lowering therapy is vital in the long-term management of gout, which aims to dissolve MSU crystals, suppress gout flares and resolve tophi. Allopurinol is the first-line urate-lowering therapy and should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation. Low-dose anti-inflammatory therapies can reduce gout flares during initiation of urate-lowering therapy. Models of care, such as nurse-led strategies that focus on patient engagement and education, substantially improve clinical outcomes and now represent best practice for gout management.

### Gout: an update [^ffd5097a]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^2909c889]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is worldwide the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and is a well treatable disease. Serum uric acid (sUA) is the main risk factor for gout. Lifestyle modifications, especially weight loss in case of obesity, play a relevant but limited role in controlling gout. Therefore, most patients will require pharmacological urate-lowering therapy (ULT) to prevent recurrent gout flares and damage related to tophi, and possibly to reduce risk for comorbidities.

Several ULTs are available to reduce sUA. Allopurinol and febuxostat inhibit the activity of xanthine oxidase and, thus, reduce uric acid production. Benzbromaron and lesinurad are examples of uricosuric drugs and increase the renal excretion of sUA. Despite the availability of an increasing number and mode of actions of ULT, gout management is far from optimal. Suboptimal treatment is related to various key barriers among both physicians and patients. Importantly, a qualitative study revealed that a substantial proportion of patients receives contradictory information from different physician, contributing to poor treatment initiation and adherence.

Several initiatives have been proposed to improve outcomes of gout treatment in daily practice. Shared decision-making (SDM) is increasingly considered to constitute an essential part of quality of care and is grounded in the paradigm that care should be based on best evidence and should be respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values. Decision aids (DAs) are tools that support patients and physicians in the choices when decisions about screening, treatment or other interventions have to be made. Shared decisions involve at minimum a patient and physician, although other healthcare providers or friends and family members may be invited to participate. The process ensures that correct and complete information is readily available for patients and physicians. While effectiveness of DAs on disease outcomes is as yet contradictory, patients exposed to DAs feel more knowledgeable, better informed and more clear about their values.

The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends to initiate ULT after a first gout flare.EULAR recommendation specifically stated that: ' Patients with gout should receive full information and be fully involved in decision-making concerning the use of ULT to increase uptake and adherence of ULT'. To support the implementation of this recommendation and, thus, improve quality of care, this paper describes the development of a DA for patients with gout that have an indication to (re-)start ULT in a clinical setting.

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^8071efc0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^9cc46356]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hospitalizations for gout flares have increased markedly over the last 20 years, doubling in the USA, England and Canada. These increases have occurred despite widespread availability of urate-lowering therapies (ULT), such as allopurinol and febuxostat. When titrated to achieve serum urate targets ≤ 360 μmol/l, ULT prevents flares, improves quality of life and leads to long-term reductions in hospitalizations. International guidelines have been updated to encourage the uptake of treat-to-target ULT. However, population-level data continue to show that ULT is initiated in only a minority of patients, while few patients achieve the urate targets necessary to prevent flares and hospitalizations.

For avoidable gout admissions to be prevented, strategies are needed to optimize care and increase uptake of treat-to-target ULT in hospitalized patients. A recent systematic review found a paucity of high-quality studies in people hospitalized for gout. Specifically, no prospective studies to date had evaluated strategies designed to encourage ULT uptake and prevent re-admissions in hospitalized patients. We sought to address this knowledge gap.

In this study, we evaluated a strategy designed to optimize hospital gout care and increase uptake of ULT. Our strategy was modelled on a nurse-led intervention shown to be highly effective at optimizing gout management in primary care. We adapted this strategy for implementation during hospitalizations for flares, and assessed outcomes including ULT initiation, serum urate target attainment and rates of re-hospitalization.

### Treating to target: a strategy to cure gout [^84e0df15]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gout attacks and the long-term complications of gout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals in the joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of long-term treatment is to reduce the serum urate (sUA) level to 6 mg/dl (≤ 360 micromol/l), below the saturation point of MSU, so that new crystals cannot form and existing crystals are dissolved. Serial joint aspiration studies confirmed the disappearance of crystals with effective urate-lowering therapy. There is good evidence that achieving sUA < 6 mg/dl (360 micromol/l) results in freedom from acute gout attacks, and shrinkage and eventual disappearance of tophi. Gout patients must be informed about their diagnosis and educated about gout management including the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Patients starting urate-lowering therapy need to understand the importance of prophylactic therapy with colchicine or NSAIDs to reduce the risk of 'mobilization flares' in the first few months. In the long term, reduction in the sUA below the target level will result in gout being effectively cured.

### Gout in primary care: can we improve patient outcomes? [^be7bb763]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Problem

Gout remains a significant concern within general practice. The prevalence of gout in developed countries is predicted to remain stable or even increase in the near future. This is partially due to longevity, increased alcohol consumption, hypertension and obesity. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides guidelines for general practitioners on the diagnosis and management of gout. Patient education and lifestyle advice, urate lowering therapy (ULT), assessment of cardiovascular disease risk and optimal uric acid levels are central to the recommendations. Patients should be given information about weight optimisation and dietary advice. Urate lowering therapy should be commenced after ≥ 2 acute gout flares in the same year or following one flare in high risk individuals including those with ≥ 1 tophi, nephrolithiasis, renal impairment and those on longstanding diuretic therapy. Serum urate should be ≤ 0.30mmol/l. NICE recommends that uric acid levels should be checked quarterly in the first year and then annually in patients taking allopurinol. The frequency of liver function testing in febuxostat is determined by the individual clinician. However, despite the presence of these guidelines and the availability of effective urate lowering therapies, audits have repeatedly revealed the suboptimal management of gout within primary care.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^d95935e3]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the USA between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100 000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100 000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100 000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an ageing population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics and inpatient settings, and only a minority of patients achieve the SU levels required to prevent flares.

Hospital admissions provide a unique opportunity to engage patients in shared decision-making and begin the process of establishing optimal ULT. What is not known is how best to implement evidence-based treatments during hospitalizations for gout. Such strategies are essential if the rising number of gout admissions is to be countered. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in patients hospitalized with gout.

Uric acid–lowering therapy use was suggested to be initiated in people with CKD G3–G5, serum uric acid concentration > 9 mg/dl (> 535 μmol/l), or urolithiasis at the time of their first episode of gout. The ERT evidence review identified that uric acid–lowering therapy results in an increased risk of a gout flare during the first 3 months after initiation in people with CKD; this is an expected short-term risk of uric acid lowering that people should be counseled about when initiating such therapy. Two relatively small randomized trials have suggested that starting uric acid–lowering therapy during a gout flare does not appear to extend flare duration, and once initiated, the American College of Rheumatology suggests continuing uric acid–lowering therapy indefinitely.

### Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy and hospitalizations for gout: results from a nationwide cohort study in england [^2cc7964f]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our finding that ULT associates with an increased risk of flares requiring hospitalization in the first 6 months after initiation is in keeping with the results of studies in community settings. In a UK primary care-based RCT of people with gout (n = 517), treat-to-target ULT increased the frequency of gout flares within the first year when compared with usual care, but reduced flares at 2 years. In the NOR-Gout study of treat-to-target ULT, flares were more frequent during the first year after initiation (particularly at 3–6 months after initiation), but reduced greatly in the second year.

Changes in SU levels when initiating ULT may precipitate flares through dissolution and remodelling of intra-articular urate crystal deposits. Guidelines recommend considering prescription of prophylaxis against flares when initiating and titrating ULT, with low-dose colchicine (500 micrograms once or twice daily for ≥ 3 months) recommended as first-line prophylaxis. In our cohort, only 10% of people initiating ULT were prescribed the equivalent of colchicine 500 micrograms once daily for ≥ 3 months. In age and sex-adjusted models, we observed an association between increased hospitalizations and the prescription of colchicine prophylaxis; however, this association was not statistically significant following multivariable adjustment. Our finding contrasts RCTs that have reported fewer flares when initiating ULT with colchicine prophylaxis. The differences may represent confounding by indication in our cohort; for example, prescription of colchicine to people with more severe gout at greater risk of hospitalization. We explored the use of propensity models to account for differences in colchicine-receiving vs non-receiving groups; however, differences between these groups precluded this. Other potential contributing factors could include repeated acute prescriptions for colchicine for flares being misclassified as prophylaxis, and low adherence to prophylaxis during ULT titration.

### Update on gout: new therapeutic strategies and options [^94de9e78]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Gout, a disease recognized since antiquity, has increased in prevalence in recent years and the clinical profile of this disease has become increasingly complex, owing to large numbers of cases with iatrogenic factors, multiple comorbidities, advanced age, and hyperuricemia and arthritis refractory to treatment. In this Review, key advances in gout research made during the past decade are summarized. Revised strategies for safe and effective employment of dietary measures and pharmacologic treatments for active gouty arthritis, prevention of gout flares and urate lowering are also reviewed, with an emphasis on dosing of colchicine and allopurinol, and the evidence-based approach to systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment of acute gout. Also discussed are new and emerging treatments for gout and hyperuricemia, and the potential influence of dual energy CT imaging on treatment. In this context, the therapeutic role of febuxostat, and clinical development of pegylated uricase urate-lowering therapy and interleukin 1 antagonism for gouty inflammation are reviewed. Collectively, novel approaches will hopefully lead to improved management of hyperuricemia and gout, and also to improvements in patient-centered outcomes, even for those who have previously failed to respond to treatment.

### Management of gout: update from the American College of Rheumatology… [^458183a9]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- During a second gout flare-up in one year, low-dose allopurinol can be started with anti-inflammatory therapy without worsening the flare-up.
- Allopurinol is the preferred urate-lowering agent, but HLA testing should be offered to patients of Southeast Asian or African American descent before starting to identify patients at risk for an allergic reaction.
- Titrating urate-lowering therapy to reach a serum urate level of 6 mg per dL decreases flare-ups and increases treatment adherence.
- During acute flare-ups, low-dose colchicine, NSAIDs, and glucocorticoids delivered orally, intramuscularly, or intra-articularly are similarly effective. When to Consider Urate-Lowering Therapy Urate-lowering therapy is recommended for patients with two or more gout flare-ups per year, tophaceous gout, or damage attributable to gout visible on radiography. Consider starting therapy for patients with a second flare-up even if not within one year.

With a first gout flare-up, shared decision-making is appropriate in patients at high risk because of a serum urate level of 9 mg per dL or higher, urolithiasis, or stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease. Urate-lowering therapy has not been shown to be beneficial for patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. The ACR recommends starting urate-lowering therapy during an acute flare-up instead of waiting until it resolves. Therapy started during a flare-up does not increase or prolong symptoms as long as anti-inflammatory treatments are provided. The ACR notes that patients are most motivated for treatment during an exacerbation. Anti-inflammatory medications such as colchicine or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be continued for three to six months after starting urate-lowering therapy. Consider starting allopurinol at 100 mg or less daily and febuxostat at 40 mg or less daily.

Dosing should be increased every two to five weeks to reduce serum urate levels to 6 mg per dL or less. Titrating medication slowly increases adherence while reducing flare-ups and tophi. Urate-lowering therapy may have to be continued for life. In a study of patients with low serum urate levels, 87% had flare-ups within five years of stopping urate-lowering therapy.

### Relationship between gout flare States and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^d8603dd7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Gout flares are the most important clinical feature for people who have gout. Gout flares affect just about every aspect of life including physical, psychological, social and family life. Prevention of gout flares is therefore a key goal of management for both health care providers and people with gout. Despite this, the majority of studies of urate‐lowering therapies have used serum urate (SU) as a "surrogate" measure for gout flares. However, the burden of gout flares is multifaceted and includes the number of flares as well as the severity of each individual flare. Defining the overall flare burden for people with gout has been challenging because of variable reporting and lack of a validated flares severity definition.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Flare prevention and treatment are critical aspects of gout management.
As gout flare burden increases, so does the impact of gout on the patient.
Most people commencing allopurinol are able to achieve gout flare patient‐acceptable symptom state or low disease activity in the second six months of treatment.

### Gout and NLRP3 inflammasome biology [^a1a71167]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Once gout flare has been effectively treated in the acute setting, long‐term gout management is also required. For people with frequent gout flares (two or more over 12 months), tophaceous gout, or joint damage related to gout, long‐term urate‐lowering therapy is strongly recommended to maintain a serum urate level below 6 mg/dL and dissolve deposited MSU crystals, which ultimately treats the underlying cause of gout flare and prevents ongoing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In the first months of initiating urate‐lowering therapy, gout flares are common, and these flares can be prevented by low doses of oral colchicine or other anti‐inflammatory medications. Consistent with the central role of IL‐1β in the initiation of acute MSU crystal–induced inflammation, canakinumab significantly prevented recurrent gout flares over 24 weeks in a randomized controlled trial.

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^ac160a39]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate a strategy designed to optimize care and increase uptake of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) during hospitalizations for gout flares.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study to evaluate a strategy that combined optimal in-hospital gout management with a nurse-led, follow-up appointment, followed by handover to primary care. Outcomes, including ULT initiation, urate target attainment and re-hospitalization rates, were compared between patients hospitalized for flares in the 12months post-implementation and a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients from 12months pre-implementation.

Results

One hundred and nineteen and 108 patients, respectively, were hospitalized for gout flares in the 12months pre- and post-implementation. For patients with 6-month follow-up data available (n = 94 and n = 97, respectively), the proportion newly initiated on ULT increased from 49.2% pre-implementation to 92.3% post-implementation (age/sex-adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 11.5; 95% CI 4.36, 30.5; P < 0.001). After implementation, more patients achieved a serum urate ≤ 360μmol/l within 6months of discharge (10.6% pre-implementation vs 26.8% post-implementation; aOR 3.04; 95% CI 1.36, 6.78; P = 0.007). The proportion of patients re-hospitalized for flares was 14.9% pre-implementation vs 9.3% post-implementation (aOR 0.53; 95% CI 0.22, 1.32; P = 0.18).

Conclusion

Over 90% of patients were initiated on ULT after implementing a strategy to optimize hospital gout care. Despite increased initiation of ULT during flares, recurrent hospitalizations were not more frequent following implementation. Significant relative improvements in urate target attainment were observed post-implementation; however, for the majority of hospitalized gout patients to achieve urate targets, closer primary-secondary care integration is still needed.

### Casebook consults: improving outcomes in gout (multimedia activity) [^438cd63e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a chronic, potentially debilitating condition characterized by an inflammatory process in the joints or periarticular tissues that results from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment can lead to the development of tophi and chronic arthropathy. A presumptive diagnosis of gout can be made on the basis of the clinical presentation as well as risk factors such as metabolic syndrome. Key conditions to rule out in the differential diagnosis are septic arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (pseudogout), fracture, and rheumatoid arthritis. Acute flares of gout should be managed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or corticosteroids. With a diagnosis of gout, if urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is required, prophylaxis should be considered with low-dose colchicine or an NSAID, followed by the addition of ULT. The goal of ULT is to reach a serum uric acid (SUA) level ≤ 6.0 mg/dL. Measurements of SUA should be obtained after resolution of an acute attack, then periodically to facilitate titration of the ULT dose to achieve the target SUA level. Studies have confirmed significant reductions in gout attacks among patients who have attained SUA levels ≤ 6.0 mg/dL with ULT. Patient education concerning the disease and its treatment is essential to ensure close adherence with recommended therapies. Patients should also understand that ULT is intended as long-term, and for most patients, lifelong therapy to maximize the prospects for control of the disease. Clinicians should feel confident in making a presumptive diagnosis and choosing a therapeutic regimen for gout while effectively communicating with and educating patients about their disease.

### Gout flares after stopping anti-inflammatory prophylaxis: a rapid literature review and meta-analysis [^7d888034]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this research was to determine how common gout flares are after ceasing anti-inflammatory prophylaxis.

Methods

A rapid literature review and meta-analysis were undertaken. PubMed was searched from inception to February 2024. Eligibility criteria included any clinical trial of people with gout with at least one arm starting or intensifying urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with coprescription of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis and that had the percentage of participants experiencing one or more gout flares reported during and after the period of prophylaxis. Random effects meta-analyses were used to generate pooled estimates of the percentage of participants experiencing one or more flares in each period.

Results

Six trials were included, together with aggregated, unpublished data from the VA STOP Gout trial (2,972 participants). Pooled random effects estimates of the percentage of participants having one or more gout flares were 14.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.3–18.5%) during prophylaxis, 29.7% (95% CI 22.9–37.0%) in the three-month period after ceasing prophylaxis, and 12.2% (95% CI 6.8–19.0%) during the last study period. The mean difference in the percentage of participants having one or more gout flare while taking prophylaxis and immediately after ceasing prophylaxis was -14.8.0% (95% CI -21.2% to -8.5%; P < 0.0001). The mean difference from the period immediately following prophylaxis discontinuation compared to the last study period was 16.0% (P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses indicated no material effects of prophylaxis duration, trial duration, ULT class, or placebo arms.

Conclusion

Gout flares are common after stopping anti-inflammatory prophylaxis but return to levels seen during prophylaxis. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of gout flares and have a plan for effective gout flare management in the three months after stopping anti-inflammatory prophylaxis.

### Evolution of management of gout: a comparison of recent guidelines [^815e9aaa]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

Recent Findings

For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using low dose. Intra-articular, oral or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective. For management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favour with most guidelines favouring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to target of serum urate (sUA) less than 6mg/dl, and less than 5mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

Summary

Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for management of gout and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^2f075291]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In a retrospective study of patients hospitalized for gout flares while receiving allopurinol (n = 59), dose reductions (or discontinuations) of allopurinol during admissions were associated with higher rates of flares in the 3 months following discharge than admissions during which allopurinol doses were unchanged or increased (53% vs 22%; P = 0.03). The primary reason provided for the allopurinol dose reductions/discontinuations was acute kidney injury, which was present in a higher proportion of this group than that of the comparator group (60% vs 36%). Patients in the dose-reduced/discontinued cohort were less likely to have received flare prophylaxis at discharge than the dose-unchanged/increased cohort (60% vs 27%; P -value not specified), which may have contributed to the observed differences in post-discharge flares.

Whether to initiate ULT during a gout flare has been evaluated in three studies that included participants recruited from EDs and inpatient settings. In an RCT, 31 participants were recruited from EDs and rheumatology clinics within 72 h of initial therapy for a gout flare and randomized to receive allopurinol 100 mg daily (up-titrated to 200 mg daily after 14 days) or placebo. Treatment for the flare was determined by the treating physician, with corticosteroids utilized in over 80% of participants. Both study arms received prophylactic low-dose colchicine. The primary end point of time to resolution of the flares was not significantly different between the allopurinol and the placebo arms (15.4 days vs 13.4 days, respectively; P = 0.50). It is of note, however, that post-hoc power calculations suggested 116 subjects per arm were required in order to have demonstrated a significant difference in this end point. Pain and physician global assessment scores declined rapidly in both study arms. As might be expected, SU levels were significantly lower in the allopurinol arm than the placebo arm at study completion (6.4 mg/dl vs 8.3 mg/dl; P = 0.012).

### Association between serum urate and flares in people with gout and evidence for surrogate status: a secondary analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^cc968c42]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Use of serum urate as a treatment target and outcome measure has become controversial in view of the 2017 American College of Physicians guidelines, which advocated a treat-to-symptom rather than a treat-to-target serum urate approach to gout management. The relevance of serum urate as a treatment target measure implies that achievement of target serum urate is causally associated with improvement in patient-important outcomes such as reduction in the number of gout flares. The aim of this study was to assess the causal relationship between achieving target serum urate and the occurrence of gout flares.

Methods

We analysed individual patient-level data from two randomised trials on urate-lowering therapies in people with gout conducted in Nottingham, UK, and New Zealand. We included participants randomly assigned to immediate dose escalation in the New Zealand study and all participants in the Nottingham study (a nurse-led gout care group and a general practitioner-led usual care group). Individuals who on average achieved a serum urate concentration less than 6 mg/dL (0.36 mmol/L) based on data at 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline were defined as serum urate responders. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants having at least one gout flare, and the secondary outcome was the mean number of flares per participant per month, from 12 to 24 months after baseline, compared between serum urate responders and non-responders. In adjusted logistic regression models, serum urate at baseline, previous flare history (in the year preceding study entry), presence of tophi at baseline, and, for the Nottingham dataset, the original randomisation group, were included as covariates. The Nottingham study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01477346. The New Zealand study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12611000845932.

Findings

From the combined individual data from both trials, we identified 343 serum urate responders and 245 serum urate non-responders. Significantly fewer serum urate responders had a gout flare than did serum urate non-responders between 12 and 24 months (91 [27%] of 343 vs 156 [64%] of 245; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.29 [95% CI 0.17 to 0.51], p < 0.0001). The mean number of flares per participant per month between 12 and 24 months was significantly lower in serum urate responders than in serum urate non-responders (adjusted mean difference -1.41 [95% CI -1.77 to -1.04], p < 0.0001). This association was independent of the original randomised treatment allocation.

Interpretation

Achieving an average serum urate concentration less than 6 mg/dL is associated with an absence of gout flares and a reduction in the number of flares in the subsequent 12 months in people with gout. These results support a treat-to-target serum urate approach in the management of gout.

American College of Rheumatology gout flare management — For patients experiencing a gout flare, the guideline states "we strongly recommend using oral colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular, or intraarticular) as appropriate first-line therapy for gout flares over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH", and "when colchicine is the chosen agent, we strongly recommend low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine given its similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects". For patients who are unable to take oral medications, "we strongly recommend glucocorticoids (intramuscular, intravenous, or intraarticular) over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH". If other antiinflammatory therapies are poorly tolerated or contraindicated, "we conditionally recommend using IL-1 inhibition over no therapy (beyond supportive/analgesic treatment)". As adjunctive care for a flare, "we conditionally recommend using topical ice as an adjuvant treatment over no adjuvant treatment". For colchicine dosing during flares, the guideline notes "the FDA-approved dosing should be followed (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing antiinflammatory therapy until the flare resolves)".

Methods — ACR guideline development used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. The Core Team, Expert Panel, and Voting Panel generated 57 population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions covering indications for ULT (5 questions), approaches to initiating ULT (7 questions), ongoing management (18 questions), gout flares (10 questions), and lifestyle and other medication strategies in patients with gout (9 questions) and in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (8 questions), which were posted for public comment (October 30–November 30, 2018). An in-person Patient Panel of 8 male patients with gout reviewed the evidence report and discussed the desirable and undesirable outcomes for decision making; then prespecified outcomes were obtained for each PICO question from a systematic literature review, and both patient-identified outcomes and serum urate (SU) concentration (and tophus for PICO question 1) were specified as critical outcomes for all PICO questions specific to ULT.

Data sources

All data used in these analyses were routinely captured during clinical care. In-hospital data were extracted from electronic patient records. Post-discharge data were extracted from local care records, containing primary and secondary care data for patients with linked NHS identifiers who had not opted out of this service. All data were manually validated by a rheumatologist, and pseudonymized for the purposes of analysis. Outcomes were selected a priori with stakeholder input.

Baseline characteristics

Baseline data were collected as follows: age; sex; admission type (ED attendance-only vs hospital admission); day/time of presentation (defined as out-of-hours if occurring between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. or on a Saturday/Sunday); pre-existing gout diagnosis; pre-existing prescription for ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat, benzbromarone, sulfinpyrazone or probenecid); and baseline blood tests, if performed during the presentation (serum urate, CRP, white cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and serum creatinine).

Outcomes during hospitalization

Data were captured to ascertain whether the following outcomes occurred during the hospitalization episode: rheumatology input sought; serum urate level performed; joint aspiration performed; flare treatment(s) prescribed (NSAID, colchicine and/or oral, intramuscular, intravenous or intra-articular corticosteroids); disease education provided to patients; ULT initiated (if patient not already receiving ULT) or up-titrated (if patient already receiving ULT at a sub-optimal dose); prophylaxis prescribed (low-dose colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids); gout-specific recommendations and/or follow-up on discharge.

Outcomes after hospitalization

For patients with available follow-up data, we ascertained whether the following outcomes occurred within 6 months of discharge: ULT initiation and/or up-titration; prescription of prophylaxis against flares during ULT initiation/titration; number of serum urate levels performed; attainment of serum urate targets ≤ 360 μmol/l and/or ≤ 300 μmol/l; follow-up in the gout telephone clinic and/or rheumatology outpatient clinic; re-attendance at ED and/or re-admission with a subsequent gout flare (occurring > 7 days after discharge from the initial presentation).

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^189a75ce]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome in gout randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the drug approval of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) by the regulatory authorities. Since there is no way to achieve the sUA target without monitoring or reassessing sUA, rheumatologists monitor sUA and aim for an sUA target level of less than 6 mg/dL. Therapeutic doses of allopurinol (100–800 mg/day) or febuxostat (40–80 mg/day) or a combination with uricosurics is often needed to achieve target sUA. Allopurinol maximum dose need not be reduced, even in the presence of renal failure, since adverse events are related to initial, and not final, allopurinol dose; pegloticase is another option. Appropriately titrated ULT doses can help achieve a near cure for gout by resolving all urate crystals.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^ca944278]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

Shared decision-making improves patients' experiences with care, satisfaction with management decisions and possibly health outcomes. This study describes the development of a decision aid (DA) that supports patients with gout and their physicians in a face-to-face clinical setting to (a) decide whether or not to (re)start urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and (b) agree on the preferred ULT.

Methods

Recommendations of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards group guided the development. A steering group of experts in gout and health services research specified the scope. Nominal group technique meetings were organised in which patients ranked the importance of preidentified potential characteristics/attributes of ULT and discussed further needs regarding the DA. A literature search was conducted to collect evidence on gout outcomes with and without ULT. Subsequently, the DA prototype was designed and adjusted using feedback from the steering group and results of cognitive debriefing interviews among five gout patients.

Results

The final DA consists of six pages. First, the DA clarifies the decision at stake and describes gout including its risk factors, the role of lifestyle and treatment of flares. Next, risk of future flares with and without ULT in relation to serum uric acid levels is described and visualised. Relevant attributes of ULT are presented in an option grid distinguishing first-line and second-line ULT. Finally, patients' believes and preferences are explicitly addressed before making the shared decision.

Conclusion

This study provides initial support for usability of a DA for gout patients eligible for starting ULT.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^ec5628dd]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — acute gout management in chronic kidney disease (CKD): For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Administration early after symptom onset is encouraged. For colchicine, the US Food and Drug Administration–approved dosing is 1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy until the flare has resolved; dose adjustment should be considered for CKD G5. NSAIDs can cause toxicity in CKD and need to be used cautiously, and short courses of oral glucocorticoids such as 30 mg prednisone orally for 3–5 days could be used as an alternative.

### Comparison of gout flares with the initiation of Treat-to-target allopurinol and febuxostat: a post-hoc analysis of a randomized multicenter trial [^34e29286]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in gout can precipitate arthritis flares. There have been limited comparisons of flare risk during the initiation and escalation of allopurinol and febuxostat, administered as a treat-to-target strategy with optimal anti-inflammatory prophylaxis.

Methods

This was a post-hoc analysis of a 72-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial comparing the efficacy of allopurinol and febuxostat. For this analysis, the occurrence of flares was examined during weeks 0 to 24 when ULT was initiated and titrated to a serum urate (sUA) goal of less than 6 mg/dl (< 5 mg/dl if tophi). Flares were assessed at regular intervals through structured participant interviews. Predictors of flare, including treatment assignment, were examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results

Study participants (n = 940) were predominantly male (98.4%) and had a mean age of 62.1 years with approximately equal proportions receiving allopurinol or febuxostat. Mean baseline sUA was 8.5 mg/dl and all participants received anti-inflammatory prophylaxis (90% colchicine). In a multivariable model, there were no significant associations of ULT treatment (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17; febuxostat vs allopurinol), ULT-dose escalation (HR 1.18 vs no escalation), prophylaxis type, or individual comorbidity with flare and no evidence of ULT-dose escalation interaction. Factors independently associated with flare risk during ULT initiation/escalation included younger age, higher baseline sUA, and absence of tophi.

Conclusion

These results demonstrate that gout flare risk during the initiation and titration of allopurinol is similar to febuxostat when these agents are administered according to a treat-to-target strategy using gradual ULT-dose titration and best practice gout flare prophylaxis.

### Allopurinol [^757142af]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation

Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR).

2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Elevated serum CA72-4 predicts gout flares during urate lowering therapy initiation: a prospective cohort study [^5ef78366]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

A variety of risk factors for recurrent flares have been reported, including periods of alcohol consumption, high diet-purine consumption, high serum urate, rapid drop of serum urate, longer disease duration, obesity and hypertriglyceridemia, male sex, and cardiometabolic comorbidities. However, those risk factors, alone or in a composite manner, have not satisfactorily identified the patients with the highest frequency of flares over a prolonged period of time following ULT initiation. A prior study developed a prediction model for gout flares in hospitalized patients with comorbid gout using nine clinical variables (pre-admission urate > 0.36 mmol/l, tophus, no pre-admission ULT, no pre-admission gout prophylaxis, acute kidney injury, surgery, initiation or increase of gout prophylaxis, adjustment of ULT and diuretics prior to flare), and achieved adequate accuracy. Given the information to date, and the assumption that aetiology of gout flare is heterogeneous, reliable markers of gout flare susceptibility remain an unmet need. In this study, participants with high concentration of baseline serum CA72-4 experienced more gout flares in terms of monthly incidence, cumulative incidence or recurrent gout during ULT initiation. Among all parameters with clinical importance, CA72-4 was an independent risk factor for recurrent gout flares, verified by the multivariate logistic model. The AUC was 0.63 for CA72-4 > 6.9U/ml solely and up to 0.78 by combining CA72-4 > 6.9U/ml with other five associated clinical variables. The findings suggest that serum CA72-4 is a potential marker for identifying those with recurrent gout flares who might benefit from anti-inflammatory prophylaxis treatment. A prospective controlled interventional study using anti-inflammatory prophylaxis selectively in those with high baseline CA72-4 could test this hypothesis.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^07208b99]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In another single-centre RCT, 57 participants recruited from EDs, wards and outpatient clinics within 7 days of onset of gout flares were randomized to receive allopurinol 300 mg daily or placebo for 10 days. After day 10, all participants received open-label allopurinol 300 mg daily. All participants received indomethacin 50 mg three times daily for 10 days and colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for 90 days. The co-primary end point of participant-reported joint pain normalized rapidly in both study arms, with no significant differences between arms from days 1 to 10. Self-reported new or recurrent gout flares did not differ significantly between study arms by day 30 (7.7% in the early initiation group vs 12.0% in the delayed initiation group; P = 0.61), despite rapid decreases in SU levels in the early initiation group. Similarly, in a retrospective study involving patients recruited from hospital or outpatient settings, more rapid attainment of target SU levels was observed with immediate vs delayed initiation of ULT (2.5 vs 3.8 months, respectively; P = 0.004). Repeat flares occurred more frequently in the immediate commencement cohort than in the delayed commencement cohort in the 12 weeks after the initial flare, but were comparable beyond this point.

Gout — starting dose and titration of ULT — starting treatment with low-dose allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day and lower in patients with CKD [stage ≥ 3]) and febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is strongly recommended; starting treatment with low-dose probenecid (500 mg once to twice daily) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is conditionally recommended. A lower starting dose of any ULT reduces the risk of flare associated with initiation, and lower initial allopurinol doses (e.g., ≤ 50 mg/day) are noted as examples.

### Elevated serum CA72-4 predicts gout flares during urate lowering therapy initiation: a prospective cohort study [^a0e6b2fd]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here, we report the first prospective cohort study to examine the association between serum CA72-4 and gout flares following ULT initiation. These findings provide evidence that baseline elevated serum CA72-4 is associated with gout flare incidence independent of other risk factors, and can assist with prediction of gout flares in the first 6 months of ULT. The ROC curve analysis of recurrent gout flares showed that AUC was 0.63 for serum CA72-4 > 6.9 U/ml, and the AUC was 0.78 when combined with disease duration, intra-articular tophus size, glucose, HDL-C and ESR. These novel findings have identified patients who are most likely to flare during initiation of ULT, and suggest the potential to stratify patients who may benefit from gout flare prophylaxis drug treatments.

Background

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in the U.S. that affects 4% of the general U.S. population. The prevalence of gout is increasing in the U.S., related at least partially to a rising rates of obesity and hypertension. Based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007–2008, it is estimated that 6 million Caucasians and 1.2 million African-Americans in the U.S. have gout. Gout presents with an extremely painful intermittent inflammatory arthritis, which over time, progresses to a chronic, deforming arthritis similar to rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to causing musculoskeletal morbidity and urate kidney stones, gout is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

The treatment of gout includes two approaches, treatment of acute episodes with medications that are anti-inflammatory including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine or corticosteroids (oral, systemic or intra-articular) and the long-term treatment of hyperuricemia with medications that either reduce the production of uric acid (urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol or febuxostat) or increase the excretion of urate (uricosurics such as probenecid [available in U.S.]; benzbromarone and sulfinpyrazone [not available in U.S.]). Due to a higher efficacy regardless of urate overproducer versus underexcretor status, allopurinol or febuxostat is used far more commonly than uricosurics. Despite availability of efficacious treatments, less than 50% patients treated with allopurinol, the commonest ULT, achieve the target serum urate < 6 mg/dl that is associated with lower risk of gout flares, tophi and medical care costs.
