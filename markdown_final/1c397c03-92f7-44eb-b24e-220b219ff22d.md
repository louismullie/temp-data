## Question

Does masturbation in male decreased prostate cancer risks?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether masturbation in males decreases prostate cancer risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the exposure is defined in the literature, because most studies measure total ejaculation frequency rather than masturbation alone. Then, I should identify the most relevant prospective cohort evidence and quantify the association. Next, I need to examine potential biases, confounding, and reverse causation. After that, I should consider biological plausibility. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced clinical conclusion and translate this into practical guidance, including how this fits alongside screening recommendations and broader sexual health considerations.

> Let me first confirm how the exposure is framed in epidemiologic studies. Wait, let me verify that when people ask about masturbation, the data usually come from studies of ejaculation frequency that include masturbation, intercourse, and nocturnal emissions. Yes, the pivotal cohort questionnaires explicitly asked about average monthly ejaculations from all sources, so any inference about masturbation per se is actually about total ejaculation frequency, with masturbation being one contributor to that total [^113S9CaD].

> Next, I should review the key longitudinal evidence. I will now examine the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which prospectively collected ejaculation frequency at ages 20–29, 40–49, and in the year before baseline, and then followed men for incident prostate cancer. Hold on, I should verify that the updated analysis extended follow-up and addressed clinically relevant subgroups and screening patterns. Yes, the original JAMA 2004 analysis and the 2016 European Urology update on the same cohort provide the most direct estimates and minimize reverse causation by measuring exposure prior to diagnosis [^113S9CaD] [^1148UPUJ].

> Now, I need to quantify the association. Let me think about the risk estimates relative to a 4–7 ejaculations per month reference. In the original report, 13–20 per month was associated with lower total prostate cancer risk, and ≥ 21 per month showed roughly a 33% reduction; the extended follow-up confirmed a similar inverse association with ≥ 21 per month around a 28% reduction. Wait, I initially thought the strongest effect was only in the youngest exposure window, but the updated analysis emphasizes that frequency reported for mid-adulthood and recent year also tracks with lower incidence; I should correct that impression and note the consistency across time points within the cohort [^113S9CaD] [^1148UPUJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I need to check sources of bias. These are observational data with self-reported sexual history, so residual confounding is possible despite multivariable adjustment, and misclassification of exposure can attenuate or distort associations. I should also confirm that reverse causation was considered; underlying prostate disease could alter ejaculatory function before diagnosis, which might bias associations. Indeed, baseline ejaculatory problems are common and could signal evolving prostate pathology, reminding me to interpret any inverse link with caution [^111AGayV] [^1148UPUJ] [^113S9CaD].

> Next, I should review corroborating and conflicting evidence across studies. A dose–response meta-analysis reported no clear linear trend between ejaculation frequency and prostate cancer across heterogeneous studies, though it suggested a possible protective association at moderate frequencies; this heterogeneity tells me the broader literature is mixed and methodology matters. Hmm, wait a minute, that means I should weigh the large, prospective cohort data more heavily than small case–control studies prone to recall bias, while still acknowledging inconsistency in pooled analyses [^1148UPUJ].

> I will now examine biological plausibility. Let me consider whether frequent ejaculation could reduce inflammatory or carcinogenic milieu within the prostate. There is transcriptomic evidence of differential gene expression in histologically normal adjacent prostate tissue across ejaculation frequency strata, which offers a potential mechanistic signal, and imaging work shows dynamic reductions in seminal vesicle volume after ejaculation, consistent with glandular clearance, although this is physiological rather than causal oncologic evidence. I should also double-check the hormonal angle; data linking circulating sex steroids to this association are inconsistent, and no definitive hormonal pathway explains the inverse risk, so mechanistic hypotheses remain suggestive rather than proven [^111P6WBM] [^1129SWc9] [^113ygQnV].

> Let me synthesize this carefully. The most consistent, prospective evidence indicates that higher ejaculation frequency, which includes masturbation, is associated with a modest reduction in incident prostate cancer on the order of 20–30% for men reporting around 21 or more ejaculations per month compared with 4–7 per month. But wait, I need to ensure I state the limitations plainly: these studies cannot prove causality, rely on self-report, and may be influenced by unmeasured aspects of health or sexual well-being, and pooled evidence outside this cohort is heterogeneous, which tempers certainty about a true preventive effect [^113S9CaD] [^1148UPUJ] [^115XmJrq].

> Translating to practice, I should confirm that no guideline endorses prescribing frequent ejaculation as a primary prevention strategy for prostate cancer. Instead, men should pursue risk-adapted early detection discussions and established lifestyle measures, with ejaculation frequency viewed as a safe personal behavior that may carry modest benefit but should not replace evidence-based screening and risk assessment. Let me verify current guidance: European recommendations emphasize individualized, risk-adapted strategies for early detection, which is the appropriate clinical anchor here [^111tWCUc] [^115MyCzV].

> But wait, what if increased sexual activity involves higher numbers of partners or STI exposures. I need to ensure I separate ejaculation frequency from sexual risk behaviors. Studies in specific populations suggest multiple partners and STIs may be associated with increased prostate cancer risk, underscoring the importance of safe sexual practices if ejaculation frequency is achieved via partnered sex rather than masturbation. This distinction helps avoid conflating the potential benefit of ejaculation frequency with harms from high-risk sexual exposures [^115MJNxn].

> Final answer to the specific question: Does masturbation in males decrease prostate cancer risk. Based on large, long-term observational cohort evidence, higher ejaculation frequency, which includes masturbation, is associated with a modestly lower risk of developing prostate cancer, approximately a 20–30% relative reduction at about 21 or more ejaculations per month compared with 4–7 per month, but this does not establish that masturbation itself causally prevents prostate cancer, so it can be considered safe and potentially beneficial but should not be relied upon as a primary prevention strategy [^113S9CaD] [^1148UPUJ].

---

Yes, higher ejaculation frequency — including masturbation — is associated with a **modest reduction in prostate cancer risk**, especially for low- to intermediate-grade disease [^1148UPUJ]. The largest prospective cohort shows a **20% lower risk** in men ejaculating ≥ 21 times/month versus 4–7 times/month, with a 3% risk reduction per three additional monthly ejaculations [^1148UPUJ] [^113S9CaD]. No clear benefit is seen for high-grade or advanced cancer, and causality remains unproven given the observational design and self-report bias [^115XmJrq]. Masturbation is safe and may modestly lower risk, but **should not replace standard screening** or risk management [^111tWCUc].

## Epidemiological evidence

### Health professionals follow-up study (HPFS)

- **Design**: Prospective cohort of 31,925 men, 18 years' follow-up, 3,839 prostate cancers [^1148UPUJ].
- **Exposure**: Self-reported average monthly ejaculations at ages 20–29, 40–49, and the year before baseline.
- **Findings**: Higher ejaculation frequency was associated with lower overall prostate cancer risk [^113S9CaD].
- **Quantitative results**: Men with ≥ 21 ejaculations/month had a 20% lower risk than those with 4–7/month (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72–0.89) [^1148UPUJ].
- **Dose-response**: Each three additional monthly ejaculations was associated with a 3% risk reduction (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96–0.99) [^1148UPUJ].
- **Grade-specific findings**: Inverse association was strongest for low- to intermediate-grade disease; no significant association for high-grade or advanced cancer [^1148UPUJ].

---

### Meta-analysis of sexual activity and prostate cancer risk

- **Design**: Meta-analysis of 21 case-control and one cohort study (55,490 participants) [^115XmJrq].
- **Findings**: Moderate ejaculation frequency (13–20/month) was associated with a 10% risk reduction versus low frequency (≤ 4/month) (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84–0.97).
- **Limitations**: Predominantly case-control studies with potential recall and selection bias [^115XmJrq].

---

## Biological mechanisms

Several plausible biological mechanisms may explain the inverse association between ejaculation frequency and prostate cancer risk [^111P6WBM]:

- **Reduction of carcinogens**: Frequent ejaculation may reduce prostatic stasis and exposure to carcinogens in prostatic fluid [^1129SWc9].
- **Hormonal regulation**: Regular ejaculation may modulate androgen and prolactin levels, potentially influencing prostate cancer risk.
- **Inflammation reduction**: Frequent ejaculation may reduce prostatic inflammation, a known risk factor for prostate cancer [^112txkj3] [^115MJNxn].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Despite consistent findings, most studies are observational, limiting causal inference [^115XmJrq]. Ejaculation frequency is self-reported, introducing recall and social desirability bias [^113S9CaD]. Lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and smoking may confound the associations [^1146FRnu]. These constraints warrant cautious interpretation and **do not establish causality** [^1148UPUJ].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Masturbation is a normal, safe sexual activity and may modestly reduce prostate cancer risk [^1148UPUJ]. Clinicians can reassure patients that it does not increase risk, while noting the evidence is observational [^115XmJrq]. Importantly, ejaculation frequency **should not replace established screening** or prevention strategies [^115MyCzV] [^111tWCUc].

---

## Conclusion

Higher ejaculation frequency, including masturbation, is associated with a **modest reduction in prostate cancer risk**, particularly for low- to intermediate-grade disease [^1148UPUJ]. The largest prospective cohort shows a 20% lower risk in men ejaculating ≥ 21 times/month versus 4–7 times/month, with a 3% risk reduction per three additional monthly ejaculations [^1148UPUJ] [^113S9CaD]. No clear benefit is seen for high-grade or advanced cancer, and causality is unproven due to observational design and self-report bias [^115XmJrq]. Masturbation is safe and may modestly lower risk, but **should not replace standard screening** or risk management [^111tWCUc].

### Ejaculation frequency and subsequent risk of prostate cancer [^113S9CaD]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Sexual activity has been hypothesized to play a role in the development of prostate cancer. However, epidemiological data are primarily limited to case-control studies, which may be prone to bias. Recall among individuals with prostate cancer could be distorted due to the consequence of prostate malignancy or ongoing therapy.

- **Objective**: To examine the association between ejaculation frequency, which includes sexual intercourse, nocturnal emission, and masturbation, and the risk of prostate cancer.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a prospective study using follow-up data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, conducted from February 1, 1992, through January 31, 2000. It involved 29,342 US men aged 46 to 81 years who provided information on their history of ejaculation frequency via a self-administered questionnaire in 1992. Participants responded to follow-up questionnaires every two years until 2000. Ejaculation frequency was assessed by asking participants to report the average number of ejaculations they had per month during the ages of 20 to 29 years, 40 to 49 years, and during the past year (1991).

- **Main outcome measure**: Incidence of total prostate cancer.

- **Results**: During 222,426 person-years of follow-up, there were 1,449 new cases of total prostate cancer, 953 organ-confined cases, and 147 advanced cases of prostate cancer. Most categories of ejaculation frequency were unrelated to the risk of prostate cancer. However, a high ejaculation frequency was linked to a decreased risk of total prostate cancer.

### Guidelines for sexual health care for prostate cancer patients: Recommendations of an international panel [^112N4pNk]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with prostate cancer suffer significant sexual dysfunction after treatment, which negatively affects them and their partners psychologically, straining their relationships.

- **Aim**: We convened an international panel with the aim of developing guidelines that will inform clinicians, patients, and partners about the impact of prostate cancer therapies on patients' and partners' sexual health and their relationships. Additionally, the guidelines address biopsychosocial rehabilitation in prostate cancer survivorship.

- **Methods**: The guidelines panel included international expert researchers, clinicians, and a guideline methodologist. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, PsychINFO, LGBT Life, and Embase databases (1995–2022), according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Study selection was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Each statement was assigned an evidence strength (A-C) and a recommendation level (strong, moderate, conditional) based on benefit/risk assessment, according to the nomenclature of the American Urological Association. Data synthesis included meta-analyses of studies deemed of sufficient quality, using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR).

- **Outcomes**: Guidelines for sexual health care for patients with prostate cancer were developed based on available evidence and the expertise of the international panel.

- **Results**: The guidelines account for patients' cultural, ethnic, and racial diversity.

### Differential gene expression in prostate tissue according to ejaculation frequency [^111P6WBM]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

In a prospective study of 31,925 men with 18 years of follow-up, higher ejaculation frequency (EF) throughout adulthood was associated with lower rates of prostate cancer. To further explore this association, we evaluated whole transcriptome gene expression in the prostate tissue from study participants who developed prostate cancer between 1992 and 2004 (n = 157 tumor tissue, n = 85 adjacent normal). We tested for trends in gene expression according to the level of EF as self-reported in 1992 for ages 20–29 years, 40–49 years, and the year prior to the questionnaire, 1991. There were no associations between EF and gene expression in areas of the tumor after accounting for multiple testing. In contrast, in the adjacent normal tissue, 409 genes and six pathways were differentially expressed at a false discovery rate ≤ 0.2 across categories of EF in 1991. These results suggest that ejaculation affects the expression of genes in the normal prostate tissue. The identified genes and pathways provide potential biological links between EF and prostate tumorigenesis.

- **Patient summary**: To explore previous findings that men who ejaculate more frequently have a lower risk of prostate cancer, we evaluated molecular alterations in the prostate tissue according to each man's frequency of ejaculation prior to diagnosis. We identified biological processes that could link ejaculation frequency and prostate cancer.

### The longitudinal effect of ejaculation on seminal vesicle fluid volume and whole-prostate ADC as measured on prostate MRI [^1129SWc9]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The average seminal vesicle fluid volume on day 3, with a standardized preparation time, was 5.82 cm³ (median 5.25 cm³, range 2.1–14.52 cm³). There was no significant correlation between age and seminal vesicle fluid volume (Rho 0.171). A reduction in seminal vesicle fluid volume was observed in 13 of 15 subjects from baseline to day 1, with a general trend of increasing volumes on subsequent days. Two patients without seminal vesicle volume reduction showed increases of 1.05 cm³ (8.4%) and 0.02 cm³ (0.9%), respectively. There was no significant correlation between reported ejaculation time and subsequent change in seminal vesicle fluid volume at day 1 (Rho -0.147).

Seminal vesicle fluid volume significantly reduced from 6.45 cm³ at baseline to 4.80 cm³ at day 1 (25.6% reduction, p < 0.001) and to 5.28 cm³ at day 2 (18.1% reduction, p = 0.002). Subsequently, there was a significant increase in volume to 5.82 cm³ at day 3 post-ejaculation from 4.80 cm³ at day 1 (35.1% increase, p = 0.006) and from 5.28 cm³ at day 2 (10.2% increase, p = 0.022).

- **Examples of seminal vesicle volume change over time**: Axial T2-weighted MR imaging was performed at baseline (minimum 3 days post-ejaculation) and post-ejaculation on days 1, 2, and 3. In the top row, subject 5 (aged 27) shows a significant reduction in volume from a baseline of 9.7 cm³ to 3.6 cm³ on day 1 and subsequently to 4.7 cm³ and 6.9 cm³ on days 2 and 3, respectively. In the middle row, subject 11 (age 53) shows similar reductions from 7.0 cm³ at baseline to 3.3 cm³, 4.2 cm³, and 5.3 cm³ on the respective days.

### Perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes of general population about prostate cancer-associated risk factors: A systematic review of qualitative studies focusing on lifestyle [^114eqP1a]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the motivations to change lifestyle, patients often view their sense of responsibility for spending more time and taking care of their families as a key motivation. Moreover, family and friends support also play a critical role, both by encouraging changes and by fostering quality time during activities like exercise and food preparation. Physical and mental benefits, such as a sense of accomplishment and improved self-image, further facilitate these changes. Additionally, certain subgroups, such as younger men with families or those undergoing hormone therapy, may show higher motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles. As healthcare professionals (HPs) noted, younger patients often embrace changes to ensure they can support their families, and the benefits of diet and exercise in reducing cancer recurrence provide further encouragement. This aligns with participants' recognition of the physical and mental benefits of healthier lifestyles and highlights the importance of integrating personalized advice from HPs into cancer care.

However, some barriers have been identified in adopting a healthier lifestyle. Lack of time and energy due to high workloads (often in multiple jobs due to low socioeconomic status), as well as limitations imposed by age and prostate cancer (PCa) side effects such as urinary incontinence and physical discomfort, have been reported in other studies. A participant in the qualitative research conducted by Rana reported, "Well, my exercise plan, I do not have time like I used to have, I am busy. I have got a heavy schedule", corroborating our findings.

### Sex hormones and the risk of incident prostate cancer [^114V3Z4g]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

To assess whether sex hormone levels are associated with the subsequent development of prostate cancer, a case-cohort study was conducted within the ongoing Osteoporotic Fractures in Men cohort study. This included community-dwelling men aged 65 and older, recruited at six U.S. clinical sites. After a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, all men with incident-confirmed prostate cancer and a random sample of the full cohort (subcohort) were selected for analysis. After excluding men with a history of prostate cancer and those who reported androgen or antiandrogen therapy at baseline, the resulting analytic sample comprised 275 cases and 1,652 noncases with complete sex hormone measurements. Serum testosterone, estradiol, estrone, and sex hormone-binding globulin were assayed at baseline (prediagnosis) by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Associations between incident prostate cancer and each sex hormone were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age, race, study site, body mass index, and person-time.

In the subcohort, the mean age was 73 years. Higher serum estrone was strongly related to an increased risk of prostate cancer: compared with men in the lower quartile, the risk of prostate cancer among those in the highest three quartiles (> 24.9 pg/dL) was nearly four times higher (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.93, CI: 1.61–9.57). Other sex hormones were not associated with the risk of prostate cancer.

In conclusion, in this cohort of older men, higher estrone levels were strongly associated with an increased risk of incident prostate cancer.

### Sexual behavior, sexually transmitted diseases and prostatitis: the risk of prostate cancer in black men [^115MJNxn]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Black men are diagnosed with prostate cancer more often than white men, present with more advanced disease, and have worse stage-specific survival. Given the high risk of incidence and mortality in this population, determining potentially modifiable factors is important. Recent studies have suggested a link between chronic inflammation and the development of prostate cancer. In concurrence, population-based studies of white men have revealed an increased risk of prostate cancer with a history of sexually transmitted diseases and prostatitis.

To explore the chronic inflammation hypothesis of prostate cancer development among black men, we examined sexual activity, sexually transmitted diseases, and prostatitis in a population-based study of 129 patients and 703 controls aged 40 to 79 years.

After adjusting for age, income, cigarette smoking, and history of digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen tests in the last five years, we observed that a history of gonorrhea infection and prostatitis increased the odds of prostate cancer 1.78-fold (95% CI 1.13, 2.79) and 4.93-fold (95% CI 2.79, 8.74), respectively. Men reporting 25 or more sexual partners were 2.80 times (95% CI 1.29, 6.09) more likely to be diagnosed with cancer compared to men with five or fewer partners.

Our findings support the significance of prior sexual practices, exposure to sexually transmitted microbial agents, and history of prostatic infection in the natural history of prostate cancer in black men. Additional prospective research incorporating serological studies is warranted to further investigate these associations.

### Is there any association between prostate-specific antigen screening frequency and uptake of active surveillance in men with low or very low risk prostate cancer [^111Skgpt]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Our study is the first to explore whether the frequency of PSA testing, PSA results, or the experience of a negative prostate biopsy influence the uptake of active surveillance (AS) among men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). We found no association between the uptake of AS and the frequency of PSA testing, PSA velocity, or the highest total PSA concentration prior to diagnosis. Uptake of AS was also not associated with a history of previous negative biopsy. Our findings applied equally to men with low or very low risk disease and across time periods. Equivalent results from our sensitivity analysis investigating the influence of missing data indicate robust findings despite some missing treatment information.

The uptake of AS was higher among older men, those with very low risk disease, and those more recently diagnosed, while it was lower among those with a family history of PCa. These findings are encouraging as they indicate increased uptake over time and among those most likely to be over-treated. Increasing trends toward AS among men with low-risk PCa have been reported in a number of large cohorts, though considerable variation remains between countries, practices, and physicians. Estimates of AS uptake range from 74% in Sweden in 2014 (Swedish National Prostate Cancer Register), 40% in the United States in 2010–13 (Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor), 40% in Australia in 2012 (Victorian Prostate Cancer Registry), to 21% in Canada in 2010 (Ontario Cancer Registry). The rate of uptake in our study (47%) is within the range of contemporary cohorts worldwide.

### Association between schizophrenia and prostate cancer risk: Results from a pool of cohort studies and Mendelian randomization analysis [^115aCAo4]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Observational studies analyzing the risk of prostate cancer in schizophrenia patients have generated mixed results. We performed a meta-analysis and a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the relationship and causality between schizophrenia and the risk of prostate cancer.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive and systematic search of cohort studies was conducted. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to calculate the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for prostate cancer incidence among schizophrenia patients versus the general population. To investigate the correlation between genetically-predicted schizophrenia and prostate cancer risk, we used summary statistics from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium (61,106 controls and 79,148 cases) and 75 schizophrenia-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from European descent as the instrumental variable.

- **Results**: In the meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies with 218,076 men involved, a decreased risk of prostate cancer was observed among schizophrenia patients [SIR 0.610; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.500–0.740; p < 0.001] with significant heterogeneity (I² = 83.3%; p < 0.001). However, MR analysis did not sustain the link between genetically-predicted schizophrenia and prostate cancer [odds ratio (OR) 1.033; 95% CI 0.998–1.069; p = 0.065]. The result was robust against extensive sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions

Our study indicated a decreased risk of prostate cancer in schizophrenia patients through…

### Perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes of general population about prostate cancer-associated risk factors: A systematic review of qualitative studies focusing on lifestyle [^114LQ8Zq]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

This systematic review followed the PRISMA statement guidelines and was registered in the international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews, PROSPERO (registration number CRD42023400342).

For this systematic review, searches were conducted in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE scientific databases in February 2023. The search was performed by two independent researchers and was primarily designed to identify relevant studies on the perceptions of the general population about prostate cancer (PCa) risk factors, focusing on lifestyle factors. The following keywords and their equivalents were used in the scientific databases mentioned above: (perceptions OR knowledge OR attitudes) AND (risk factor OR lifestyle OR diet OR nutrition OR exercise OR physical activity OR smoking OR tobacco OR sex OR sexual* OR alcohol) AND (prostate cancer).

The selection criteria applied in this review were as follows: (1) language: documents had to be published in English; (2) studies published from January 2013 to February 2023; (3) participants/population: adults/humans; (4) types of studies included qualitative studies (interview and/or focus groups). Study protocols, reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were excluded. The included studies assessed the perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes of the general population regarding PCa-associated risk factors. All the studies that mentioned this impact were considered. Studies involving women were included.

### Ejaculatory disorders may affect screening for prostate cancer [^111AGayV]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Ejaculatory disorders will be experienced in most men who are treated for localized prostate cancer. Baseline rates of ejaculatory disorders are unknown in men at risk for prostate cancer; therefore, we explored the prevalence of these disorders and the associated bother in men without evidence of prostate cancer who participated in an annual prostate cancer screening event.

A cohort of 1,273 men without clinical evidence of prostate cancer completed the self-administered Danish Prostate Symptom Score for sexual dysfunction. This questionnaire quantifies the rate of reduced ejaculatory volume, ejaculatory pain, and the rate of coexistent erectile dysfunction.

Mean age was 57.6 years (range 40 to 89). Of all men, 46% (563) had reduced ejaculatory volume, and 66% (356) of affected men were bothered by this condition. Ejaculatory pain was reported in 11% (134), and 89% (118) of these men reported associated bother. Finally, 45% (554) reported erectile dysfunction, and 73% (403) reported associated bother. Reduced ejaculatory volume was associated with erectile dysfunction (p < 0.001) and advanced age (p < 0.001). Ejaculatory pain was not associated with these variables.

Virtually all men will be affected by ejaculatory disorders after definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer. Therefore, it is important to observe that half of these individuals already have underlying reduced ejaculatory volume before treatment. Moreover, 1 in 10 men will be affected by ejaculatory pain. Both disorders are a significant source of bother.

### Association between two unlinked loci at 8q24 and prostate cancer risk among European Americans [^1159ct1s]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2007). Low credibility.

Recent studies have provided evidence of associations between genetic markers at human chromosome 8q24 and an increased risk of prostate cancer. We examined whether multiple independent risk variants exist in this region and whether the strength of observed associations differs as a function of disease aggressiveness.

- **Methods**: We evaluated associations between 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 1-Mb interval at 8q24 and the risk of prostate cancer among 1,563 case patients (1,017 of whom had high-grade [Gleason score ≥ 7] and/or non-organ-confined disease) and 576 control subjects of European American ancestry. Differences in genotype frequencies between case and control subjects were compared using logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for age, and the Wald chi-square test. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: We identified multiple SNPs in a 50-kb region (referred to as locus 1) that are in linkage disequilibrium with a previously reported risk-associated SNP at 8q24, rs1447295, but were more strongly associated with prostate cancer risk in our study population. We also identified a novel susceptibility SNP, rs6983267, at a second locus (locus 2) that is approximately 70 kb centromeric of rs1447295 and in linkage equilibrium with, and independent of, locus 1. Risk alleles at locus 2 were common in our study population (minor allele frequency approximately 50%, 25% homozygous for risk-associated allele).

### Analysis of recently identified prostate cancer susceptibility loci in a population-based study: Associations with family history and clinical features [^116wa6JJ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

Two recent genome-wide association studies have highlighted several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) purported to be associated with prostate cancer risk. We investigated the significance of these SNPs in a population-based study of Caucasian men and tested the effects of each SNP in relation to family history of prostate cancer and the clinicopathologic features of the disease.

- **Experimental design**: We genotyped 13 SNPs in 1,308 prostate cancer patients and 1,267 unaffected controls frequency matched to cases by five-year age groups. The association of each SNP with disease risk stratified by family history of prostate cancer and clinicopathologic features of the disease was calculated with the use of logistic and polytomous regression.

- **Results**: These results confirm the importance of multiple previously reported SNPs in relation to prostate cancer susceptibility; 11 of the 13 SNPs were significantly associated with risk of developing prostate cancer. However, none of the SNP associations were of comparable magnitude with that associated with having a first-degree family history of the disease. Risk estimates associated with SNPs rs4242382 and rs2735839 varied by family history, whereas risk estimates for rs10993994 and rs5945619 varied by Gleason score.

- **Conclusions**: Our results confirm that several recently identified SNPs are associated with prostate cancer risk; however, the variant alleles only confer a low to moderate relative risk of disease and are generally not associated with more aggressive disease features.

### Male pattern baldness in relation to prostate cancer risks: an analysis in the VITamins and lifestyle (VITAL) cohort study [^112A8J1c]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

Male pattern baldness and prostate cancer may share common pathophysiological mechanisms in terms of advancing age, heritability, and endogenous hormones. Results from previous epidemiologic studies are inconsistent. Therefore, we investigated the association of prostate cancer risks with male pattern baldness at age 30 years, age 45 years, and baseline (median age = 60.5 years) in the VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) cohort study.

- **Methods**: We included 32,583 men who were aged 50–76 years and without prior cancer diagnosis (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) at the start of follow-up. First primary incident prostate cancers were ascertained via linkage to the Western Washington Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regressions with adjustment for potential confounders.

- **Results**: During follow-up (median = 9 years), 2,306 incident prostate cancers were diagnosed. Male pattern baldness at age 30 years, age 45 years, and baseline were not statistically significantly associated with overall or subtypes of prostate cancer.

- **Conclusion**: This study did not provide support for the hypothesis that male pattern baldness may be a marker for subsequent prostate cancer. Previous evidence indicates that a distinct class of frontal with vertex balding may be associated with an increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer, but all such balding classes were captured as a single exposure category by the VITAL cohort questionnaire.

### Vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer: Population based matched cohort study [^117HJZ1F]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Vasectomy is a minor outpatient procedure with few short-term complications. It is effective in most men and is one of the most reliable and cost-effective long-term methods of contraception. An estimated 33 million women worldwide rely on their partner's vasectomy for contraception.

Several studies have explored the possible association between vasectomy and prostate cancer, yielding conflicting results. Potential biological mechanisms supporting an association include increases in androgen levels, hypothesized to increase the risk of prostate cancer, and impaired secretory function of the prostate, which might prolong exposure to carcinogenic factors. Although some studies have shown an increase in serum dihydrotestosterone and testosterone after vasectomy, others have found no statistically significant change in androgen levels. Similarly, the findings on the association between frequency of ejaculation and risk of prostate cancer are conflicting. Thus, any possible biological relation between vasectomy and prostate cancer remains unclear.

Many studies that found an association between vasectomy and prostate cancer were limited by sample size and the potential for selection, recall, and detection biases. Given the frequency of vasectomy, even a small increased risk of prostate cancer would constitute a major public health problem. We examined the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer in a large population-based cohort, adjusting for health-seeking behaviors that might have biased results.

### The importance of sexuality, changes in erectile functioning and its association with self-esteem in men with localized prostate cancer: data from an observational study [^116tRiwa]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is typically a disease of older men, and it may be assumed that an impairment of erectile functioning is negligible for most patients. At diagnosis, men are, on average, about 70 years old. Concluding that sexuality plays a subordinate role in decision-making could unjustifiably conform to the stereotype of sex being "unseemly, even unnatural in the old". Indeed, sexual activity decreases with increasing age, yet most older men still experience sexual desire and report being sexually active.

Although the relationship between erectile dysfunction and self-esteem has been studied, no research, to the best of our knowledge, has examined this association in men with localized prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing different treatment options. Additionally, there is a lack of data on the importance of sexuality in this population. PCa diagnosis might represent a critical life event for some men, potentially shifting their priorities. PCa and its treatment may become the main focus, while other aspects of quality of life, such as sexuality, might diminish in relevance. Previous studies with colorectal cancer patients showed a decreased importance of sexuality due to the cancer experience. It remains unclear whether this applies to men with localized PCa. Our study seeks to determine how important sexuality is for men with localized PCa. In addition, PCa treatment and radical prostatectomy (RP) in particular…

### Aveed [^112ceVPy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Worsening of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and potential risk of prostate cancer**: Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk of worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (4)].

- **Polycythemia**: Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating testosterone treatment. It would be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting testosterone treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable level. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

- **Venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as AVEED. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth, and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with AVEED and initiate appropriate workup and management.

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Long-term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular risk.

Regarding the medical management for premature ejaculation, specifically with respect to first-line therapy, the ISSM 2014 guidelines recommend offering off-label daily dosing of SSRIs, including paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and fluoxetine. Additionally, they suggest the use of the serotonergic TCA clomipramine and off-label on-demand dosing of clomipramine, paroxetine, and sertraline for treating patients with lifelong and acquired PE.

### Vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer: Population based matched cohort study [^113mgpuD]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

We identified all men aged 20 to 65 who underwent a vasectomy between April 1, 1994, and December 31, 2012. Exclusions were made for those diagnosed with prostate cancer before vasectomy, those who underwent a vasovasostomy (vasectomy reversal) before the censoring date, and those undergoing other procedures on the same day inconsistent with vasectomy for contraception (e.g. vasectomy performed on the same day as a prostatectomy or vesiculectomy).

The vasectomy date served as the index date. For each participant who underwent vasectomy, a matched control was selected — matching on age (within two years), comorbidity score (using the Johns Hopkins adjusted clinical groups case mix system), geographical area (defined by the first three digits of the postal code), and index date. The Johns Hopkins system is designed to predict healthcare use, considering the duration, severity, and intensity of service use related to both inpatient and outpatient claims. Detailed explanations are provided elsewhere.

Scores were assigned using data from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan, the Canadian Institute for Health Information, and the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System. An index date was randomly assigned within one year of the vasectomy date of the corresponding matched participant to account for temporal changes in prostate cancer screening and diagnosis over time.

### Meta-analysis of association of rare mutations and common sequence variants in the MSR1 gene and prostate cancer risk [^1139bg1o]. The Prostate (2006). Low credibility.

MSR1 has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa).

- **Methods**: We performed a meta-analysis of all eight published studies to evaluate the pooled effect of three rare mutations (R293X, S41T, and D174Y) and five common sequence variants (PRO3, INDEL1, IVS5–59, P275A, and INDEL7), stratified by race and sporadic/hereditary cancer.

- **Results**: Several variants were significantly or marginally significantly associated with sporadic, not hereditary PCa risk, including R293X in white men (random effect OR = 1.34, P = 0.09) and D174Y in black men (random effect OR = 2.41, P = 0.04). The associations were not significant when the initial study was excluded. However, the frequency of the D174Y mutation was consistently higher among cases in all three studies that examined black men.

- **Conclusions**: Overall, this meta-analysis suggests the MSR1 gene does not independently confer a major risk to PCa but may confer a moderate risk to PCa, especially in black men.

### Genetic variation in the HSD17B1 gene and risk of prostate cancer [^1119xgrt]. PLOS Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Another potential limitation of this study is that results are reported for a single gene. Prostate cancer risk may be a complex function of genotypes across several genes involved in steroid hormone metabolism. For example, a mutation in one gene may only increase risk in the presence of a mutation in a different gene. Although a gene involved in such gene-gene interactions can be discovered using a marginal test (ignoring the other genes), incorporating information about other genes may improve the power to detect association. As the BPC3 will eventually measure variation in over 30 genes related to the steroid hormone pathway, it will have the opportunity to investigate the combined contribution of multiple genes to the risk of prostate cancer.

In the present study, the absence of an association between HSD17B1 haplotypes and prostate cancer suggests that we can rule out large or moderate associations between common HSD17B1 variants and the risk of prostate cancer among U.S. and European whites. If any variants affect the risk of prostate cancer, they are likely to have small effects or low frequency and are unlikely to contribute significantly to the overall incidence of prostate cancer in these populations. While this sheds some light on the clinical effects of one enzyme involved in the complex process of steroid synthesis and catabolism, it remains to be determined whether variants in other genes in steroidal hormone pathways play a more important role or if the combined effects of several genes within these pathways have a larger impact. The BPC3 plans to investigate these pathways in future studies.

### Risk of prostate cancer in men with HIV/AIDS: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143Pu11]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Although previous studies have shown a decreased incidence of prostate cancer in men with HIV/AIDS, consensus has not been reached. Our aim is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the risk of prostate cancer among people with HIV/AIDS.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library until March 2020. Cohort studies were included if they compared the prostate cancer risk between people with HIV/AIDS and uninfected controls or the general population. The summary standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: A total of 27 studies were included for analysis, with more than 2,780 males with HIV/AIDS developing prostate cancer. The results showed that HIV infection was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer incidence (SIR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64–0.91; P = 0.003), with significant heterogeneity (P < 0.001; I² = 91.6%). A range of sensitivity analyses did not significantly change the results.

- **Conclusions**: Our study shows that people with HIV/AIDS have a lower incidence of prostate cancer compared with the general population. However, significant heterogeneity exists among the included studies. Further prospective studies with better designs are needed to elucidate the association between HIV infection and prostate cancer.

### Physical activity in relation to risk of prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146FRnu]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers among men, yet little is known about its modifiable risk and protective factors. This study aims to quantitatively summarize observational studies relating physical activity (PA) to PCa incidence and mortality.

- **Materials and methods**: Published articles pertaining to PA and PCa incidence and mortality were retrieved in July 2017 using the Medline and EMBASE databases. The literature review yielded 48 cohort studies and 24 case-control studies with a total of 151,748 PCa cases. The mean age of the study participants at baseline was 61 years.

- **Results**: In random-effects models, comparing the highest versus the lowest level of overall PA showed a summary relative risk (RR) estimate for total PCa incidence close to the null [RR = 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94–1.04]. The corresponding RRs for advanced and non-advanced PCa were 0.92 (95% CI = 0.80–1.06) and 0.95 (95% CI = 0.85–1.07), respectively. We noted a statistically significant inverse association between long-term occupational activity and total PCa (RR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.71–0.98, n studies = 13), although that finding became statistically non-significant when individual studies were removed from the analysis. When evaluated by cancer subtype, an inverse association with long-term occupational activity was noted for non-advanced/non-aggressive PCa (RR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.37–0.71, n studies = 2) and regular recreational activity was inversely related to advanced/aggressive PCa (RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.60–0.95, n studies = 2), although these observations are based on a low number of studies.

### Characterizing genetic risk at known prostate cancer susceptibility loci in African Americans [^1112itAv]. PLoS Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

- **Ethics statement**: The Institutional Review Board at the University of Southern California approved the study protocol.

- **Study populations**: Nine studies were genotyped as part of the GWAS of prostate cancer in African American men. Below is a brief description of each study.

	- **The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC)**: This cohort includes 215,251 men and women aged 45–75 years at recruitment from Hawaii and California. Assembled in 1993–1996, the cohort was established by mailing a self-administered, 26-page questionnaire to individuals identified primarily through the driver's license files. Incident cancer cases are identified by regular linkage with the Hawaii Tumor Registry and the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, both NCI-funded Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. Information about cancer stage and grade is obtained from these registries. Collection of biospecimens from incident prostate cancer cases began in California in 1995 and in Hawaii in 1997; a biorepository was established between 2001 and 2006 from 67,000 MEC participants. The participation rates for providing a blood sample have been greater than 60%. Through January 1, 2008, the African American case-control study in the MEC included 1,094 cases and 1,096 controls.

	- **The Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS)**: This is a prospective cohort of African and non-African Americans which, during 2002–2009, enrolled approximately 86,000 residents aged 40–79 years across 12 southern states. Recruitment occurred mainly at community health centers, institutions providing basic health services primarily to the community.

### Diagnostic and outcome differences between heterosexual and nonheterosexual men treated for prostate cancer [^115KqocK]. Urology (2013). Low credibility.

To determine if heterosexual and nonheterosexual men treated for prostate cancer differ in diagnostic and treatment outcomes, as well as in various measures of physical health, sexual function, and well-being before and after treatment, a study was conducted.

Four hundred sixty self-identified heterosexual and ninety-six self-identified nonheterosexual men completed an anonymous online survey. The men in the two groups were then compared using logistic regressions that controlled for differences among countries.

There were no significant differences in age at diagnosis for men in the two groups. However, Gleason scores at diagnosis were significantly lower for the nonheterosexual men (P = 0.02). There were no significant differences among men in the two groups in the proportion who received different treatment modalities or in the incidence of urinary incontinence, the experience of bone pain (as a marker of disease progression), the use of antidepressants (as a proxy measure for mental health), or the experience of erectile dysfunction after treatment. However, nonheterosexual men rated the degree to which they were bothered by an inability to ejaculate significantly higher than heterosexual men (P = 0.04).

This is the first set of findings from a survey comparing heterosexual and nonheterosexual men treated for prostate cancer. Although the groups were generally similar, nonheterosexual men might experience more intensive screening for disease, as indicated by lower Gleason scores at diagnosis. Nonheterosexual men appear more distressed by the loss of ejaculation.

### Perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes of general population about prostate cancer-associated risk factors: A systematic review of qualitative studies focusing on lifestyle [^112pfo3H]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Data collection procedures**: Most of the studies were conducted only in person. One study was conducted in a mixed setting combining in-person and telephone/online, and two studies were conducted only by telephone. Among those conducted in person, five studies were conducted in participants' homes or a venue chosen by them, three in clinics or hospitals, two in community health centers or churches, one in a community center and conference facility, and one in a quiet room, with no further information provided.

	- Regarding data collection procedures, nine of the studies obtained data through interviews, while seven collected data through focus groups. One study used both focus groups and interviews, and one employed "listening sessions".

- **Themes and subthemes**: In this systematic review, five major themes emerged: general knowledge about prostate cancer; risk factors; lifestyle pattern alteration; motivation and barriers to change lifestyle; and lifestyle advice support.

	- **General knowledge about prostate cancer**: Regarding general knowledge of prostate cancer (PCa), three subthemes arose: PCa overview, perceived symptoms, and the impact of PCa on sexuality. They established a correlation between age and PCa. Additionally, the impact of PCa on sexual performance was a major concern for participants.

### The impact of serial prostate biopsies on sexual function in men on active surveillance for prostate cancer [^115pn475]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

NCCN Guidelines® recommend annual prostate biopsies for men with low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance. We determined whether erectile function decreases with the number of biopsies experienced.

During a median 3.2-year follow-up after prostate cancer diagnosis from 2003 to 2010 at our institution, 427 men on active surveillance underwent a total of 1,197 biopsies and provided 1,398 erectile function evaluations via the Sexual Health Inventory for Men questionnaire. For analysis, we decomposed the 25-point questionnaire responses into a 5-point erectile function score and a 3-level sexual activity status. We used separate models adjusted for patient characteristics to determine whether either outcome varied with biopsy exposure.

At diagnosis, the median age was 61 years, and the median prostate-specific antigen was 5.3 ng/ml. Of the cases, 70% were clinical stage cT1 and 93% were Gleason score less than 7. Of biopsies followed by evaluations, 40% were the first undergone by the patient and 9% were the fifth to ninth. At the first erectile function evaluation, 15% of men were inactive, 8% engaged in stimulation, and 77% engaged in intercourse. Sexual activity level changed in more than 20% of respondents between evaluations. Adjusted erectile function scores were not associated with biopsy exposure cross-sectionally or longitudinally, but they corresponded with the 50th, 63rd, and 80th percentiles of erectile function by increasing sexual activity level. Similarly, sexual activity was not associated with biopsy exposure.

### Avodart [^111F82sA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with Avodart.

- **Reproductive and breast disorders**: In the three pivotal placebo-controlled BPH trials with Avodart, each lasting four years, there was no evidence of increased sexual adverse reactions (impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder) or breast disorders with an increased duration of treatment. Among these three trials, there was one case of breast cancer in the dutasteride group and one case in the placebo group. No cases of breast cancer were reported in any treatment group in the four-year CombAT trial or the four-year REDUCE trial. The relationship between long-term use of dutasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown.

- **Combination with alpha-blocker therapy (CombAT)**: Over 4,800 male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive 0.5-mg Avodart, 0.4-mg tamsulosin, or combination therapy (0.5-mg Avodart plus 0.4-mg tamsulosin) administered once daily in a four-year double-blind trial. Overall, 1,623 subjects received monotherapy with Avodart; 1,611 subjects received monotherapy with tamsulosin; and 1,610 subjects received combination therapy. The population was aged 49 to 88 years (mean age: 66 years), and 88% were white. Table 2 summarizes adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of subjects in the combination group and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving monotherapy with Avodart or tamsulosin.

### The importance of sexuality, changes in erectile functioning and its association with self-esteem in men with localized prostate cancer: Data from an observational study [^1121oipg]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

The RP and AS patients were compared regarding relevant sociodemographic variables and cancer characteristics. Chi-square tests were run for categorical variables, and independent t-tests were conducted for continuous variables to compare (a) changes in erectile functioning, (b) impairment of self-esteem, (c) the importance of sexuality, and (d) satisfaction with sexual life between the two groups. Cohen's d was calculated as a measure of effect size for group comparisons.

Bivariate correlations between variables were calculated. A sequential multiple regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics, clinical variables, the importance of sexuality, and changes in erectile functioning with the criterion of self-esteem. Covariates were entered first, followed by the importance of sexuality, changes in erectile functioning, and finally the interaction term. Within all regression models, collinearity diagnostics indicated no multicollinearity among the independent variables.

For moderation analyses, predictor variables and the constituents of the respective interaction terms were centered around their grand means. In moderation models, covariates were entered first, followed by the importance of sexuality as a moderator and changes in erectile functioning as a predictor, and finally by the interaction term. To display and test the interaction effects, simple slopes were tested. Low and high values of the continuous moderators were generated by adding or subtracting one standard deviation from the centered mean.

### Urinary symptoms and prostate cancer-the misconception that may be preventing earlier presentation and better survival outcomes [^113PTW1x]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Male urinary symptoms and prostate cancer — causality, association, or no link at all?

For decades, the recommendation has been to use symptoms to identify possible cancer, particularly lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Yet, the origins and evidence for this linkage are challenging to uncover. The concept of 'urinary symptoms as a sign of prostate cancer' is frequently conveyed by the media and is included in information from national guidelines and charities to encourage men to get tested. While many informational and official sites mention that most prostate cancers may not cause symptoms, they still prominently list several urinary symptoms to monitor. This is based on the notion that prostate cancer may manifest with symptoms such as slow urinary flow, frequency, or nocturia, which should prompt a visit to the general practitioner (GP) for testing to exclude cancer.

Indeed, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) distinguishes between patients with and without symptoms in managing suspected prostate cancer, for example, by recently reviewing the evidence base for PSA thresholds, but only in the 'symptomatic' population. Much of the basis for this distinction has derived from studies in primary care-based referral practices of symptomatic men. The widely used QCancer® tool was developed using data from over 2 million men presenting to GPs. For prostate cancer, urinary retention, frequency, urgency, and impotence were considered predictors of a diagnosis. However, PSA is not part of the model, and there is no detail on the stage of cancers found.

### Antihypertensive drugs use and the risk of prostate cancer: A meta-analysis of 21 observational studies [^113eqLhp]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing, and it is the main cause of cancer death in males in Western countries. Studies on the association between antihypertensive drug usage and prostate cancer risk remain controversial. In vitro studies suggest that calcium channel blockers (CCB) enhanced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells and might have a protective effect on prostate cancer. Debes et al. found that CCBs significantly decreased the risk of prostate cancer, with results varying by family history of the condition. However, some case-control studies did not find this relationship. For instance, a study involving 1,165,781 patients did not support the association between the long-term use of CCBs and prostate cancer risk.

Some case-control studies showed a significantly increased risk between ACE inhibitor usage and prostate cancer, while a previous meta-analysis indicated that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers did not affect cancer occurrence. In a study by Perron et al, beta-blockers were associated with a reduction in prostate cancer risk, whereas another study by Kemppainen et al. suggested an increased risk of prostate cancer in patients treated with beta-blockers. One study reported the relationship between alpha-blockers or diuretic usage and prostate cancer risk; their results were also controversial.

Due to the long-term follow-up in the observational studies, we performed a systematic review of observational studies to confirm whether the use of antihypertensive drugs could influence prostate cancer in the human body.

### Circulating sex hormones play no role in the association between sexual activity and the risk of prostate cancer [^113ygQnV]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

High sexual activity (SA) has been reported to reduce the risk of prostate cancer (PC). The role of sex hormones (SHs) in this regard remains controversial.

- **Aims**: To determine the impact of SA and SHs on PC development.

- **Methods**: In a multicentric, hospital-based case-control study, 194 newly diagnosed PC patients along with 317 age-matched controls were studied. Sociodemographic and medical characteristics of participants were recorded. History of vasectomy, sexually transmitted infections (STI), marital status, age at first intercourse, premarital sex, and the frequency of sexual intercourses per month (SPM) were evaluated. Total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), estradiol (ES), sex hormone binding globulin, and albumin were also measured. A logistic regression model was used to identify independent risk factors for PC.

- **Main outcome measures**:
	- (i) The association between SA, SHs, and the risk of PC.
	- (ii) The correlation between SHs and SA.
	- (iii) The interaction between SHs and SA with established risk factors for PC and erectile dysfunction in determining the risk of PC.
	- (iv) The correlation between SHs and SA in determining the risk of PC in different decades of life.

- **Results**: Vasectomy, STI, and marital status did not differ significantly between two cohorts. Controls reported premarital sex more commonly than cases (P < 0.05), and age at the time of…

### The importance of sexuality, changes in erectile functioning and its association with self-esteem in men with localized prostate cancer: Data from an observational study [^111ELDCm]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Our results have some implications for future research. Firstly, questionnaires on male sexuality in prostate cancer (PCa) patients at the time of writing focus primarily on the function rather than psychological aspects of sexuality. An effort should be made to develop questionnaires that comply with a broader definition of sexuality as a holistic construct and meet the particularities of older men or PCa patients. Widely accepted and validated questionnaires would also facilitate a comparison of results.

Secondly, longitudinal studies in this field are desirable to gain a deeper insight into the interplay of age, sexuality, self-esteem, and other psychosocial variables in men with PCa over time. As erectile functioning is only one facet of the sexual response cycle that can be affected by invasive PCa treatment, more items assessing sexual functioning should be included. Similarly, self-esteem is only one example of the connection between sexual functioning and psychological well-being. Future research should take this into account.

### Prostate cancer and consistency of reporting sexual histories in men over age 50 [^112kGRaw]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

We conducted an in-person interview to examine the reliability of reported sexual histories among men over age 50 with and without prostate cancer. Marriage and cohabitation were used as memory cues to recall sexual activity. High correlations on test-retest for questions evaluating sexual histories suggest reliable answers for most factors, specifically for age at first sexual activity and lifetime number of sexual partners. Low correlations were seen for ill-defined and socially undesirable items. These data suggest that men consistently report most measures of sexual activity when using marriage and cohabitation as memory cues to recall sexual histories.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^112qCNhB]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

The EAU 2025 guidelines emphasize the importance of patient education in the context of erectile dysfunction, particularly through counseling before radical prostatectomy. It is recommended to discuss with patients undergoing active treatment for prostate cancer the potential risk of sexual changes beyond erectile dysfunction. These changes may include a reduction in sexual desire, alterations in orgasm, anejaculation, Peyronie's-like disease, and changes in penile size.

### The importance of sexuality, changes in erectile functioning and its association with self-esteem in men with localized prostate cancer: data from an observational study [^112g8ru6]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations**: The strengths of this study include its high external validity, achieved through a non-interventional, multicenter design, the length of the follow-up period, and the sample size, which represents one of the largest samples for comparing radical prostatectomy (RP) and active surveillance (AS). Additionally, our study focuses on the psychosocial aspects of sexuality. While most studies addressing sexuality in men with localized prostate cancer (PCa) focus more on physiological aspects, we aimed to investigate the psychological aspects of altered sexuality. We selected items to measure men's sexual life accordingly.

	- However, the study is subject to some limitations. First, the cross-sectional and observational design does not allow for causal interpretations. For example, it remains speculative whether a change in erectile functioning for the worse leads to an impairment of self-esteem, or whether there are additional confounding variables. To address possible selection biases due to non-randomization, we controlled for several sociodemographic and clinical variables, which did not explain a significant amount of variance. In contrast to a randomized study, strengths of our observational design are high external validity and an exceptional participant rate. Second, our data are based on participants' self-reports of erectile functioning, which we did not validate through objective measures (e.g. medical records). However, the focus of the study was on men's subjective experience, which, particularly regarding sexuality, seems more important than objective parameters.

### Are there specific health-related factors that can accentuate the risk of suicide among men with prostate cancer [^1143k6kR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Being consistent with the way they rated using the VAS scale, the majority of the participants indicated that they had little or no pain during miction.

Analytical statistics using a regression model indicated statistically significant relationships (P ≤ 0.05) between suicide ideation and several factors: lower self-rated quality of life (P < 0.001), experience of physical pain (P ≤ 0.04), pain during miction (P = 0.03), and low-rated mental and physical energy (P = 0.03). Low-rated sexual function had no statistically significant relationship with suicide ideation, although there was a nearly significant relationship (P = 0.06) between them.

- **Psychosocial and demographic factors**: These were also found to have statistically significant relationships with suicide ideation. The younger the age, the higher the degree of suicide ideation (P < 0.001). Being unmarried or not living in a partnership was also found to have a statistically significant relationship with suicide ideation.

### Racial differences in the relationship between clinical prostatitis, presence of inflammation in benign prostate and subsequent risk of prostate cancer [^112txkj3]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic studies, primarily conducted in white men, suggest that a history of clinically-diagnosed prostatitis increases prostate cancer risk, while histological prostate inflammation decreases risk. The relationship between a clinical history of prostatitis and histologic inflammation, along with how these two manifestations of prostatic inflammation jointly contribute to prostate cancer risk and whether racial differences exist in this relationship, remains uncertain.

- **Methods**: Using a nested design within a cohort of men with benign prostate tissue specimens, we analyzed the data on both clinically-diagnosed prostatitis (NIH categories I-III) and histological inflammation in 574 prostate cancer case-control pairs (345 white, 229 African American).

- **Results**: Clinical prostatitis was not associated with increased prostate cancer risk in the full sample, but showed a suggestive inverse association with prostate cancer in African Americans (odds ratio (OR) = 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.27–0.81). In whites, clinical prostatitis increased risk by 40%, but was only associated with a significant increased prostate cancer risk in the absence of evidence of histological inflammation (OR = 3.56; 95% CI = 1.15–10.99). Moreover, PSA velocity (P = 0.008) and frequency of PSA testing (P = 0.003) were significant modifiers of risk. Clinical prostatitis increased risk of prostate cancer almost three-fold (OR = 2.97; 95% CI = 1.40–6.30) in white men with low PSA velocity and about twofold in white men with more frequent PSA testing (OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.09–3.35).

- **Conclusions**: In our cohort, the association of clinical prostatitis with prostate cancer risk varies by race and the presence of histological inflammation.

### Perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes of general population about prostate cancer-associated risk factors: A systematic review of qualitative studies focusing on lifestyle [^114eXJFa]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The search strategy involved retrieving 6,749 citations from the PubMed–MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE databases, from which 1,040 duplicates were excluded. Eligible articles were carefully chosen based on the title and abstract, resulting in 146 studies being analyzed. Since three of them couldn't be retrieved, 143 studies were evaluated based on their full-text, of which 18 were deemed suitable for inclusion in the review.

- **Study selection and quality assessment**: Cohen's weighted kappa was assessed between the selection of studies based on title and abstract (Supplementary material, Figure S1) and full-text analysis (Supplementary material, Figure S2). For the selection based on the title and abstract, Cohen's weighted kappa was 0.548, indicating a moderate level of agreement between the two independent researchers. In the selection based on full-text analysis, Cohen's weighted kappa was 0.698, indicating a substantial level of agreement. The results of the quality assessment (Supplementary Table S1) revealed that, overall, these qualitative studies exhibited a low risk of bias, considering that no section demonstrated a significant concern for the results.

- **Study characteristics**: The study characteristics of the included papers are summarized in Table 1, which provides information on the country, setting, study population, sample size, participants' characteristics (age, gender, race), time frame, and data collection procedures.

### Is there any association between prostate-specific antigen screening frequency and uptake of active surveillance in men with low or very low risk prostate cancer [^113pzaTV]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Patient-related factors, such as concern about cancer, are believed to influence men's decisions to undergo prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and to receive definitive treatment if diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). The potential link between screening frequency and the choice of active surveillance (AS) for low-risk disease has not been studied previously. Our aim was to investigate whether there is any association between PCa screening frequency or previous negative prostate biopsy and the uptake of AS among men with low-risk PCa.

This register-based study included all men aged 75 years or younger from Stockholm who were diagnosed with low-risk PCa from 2008 to 2014 (n = 4336). Pre-diagnostic PSA testing and biopsy histories were obtained from the Stockholm PSA and Biopsy Register, a population-based register for the Stockholm County. The association between previous screening/biopsy history and AS uptake, based on primary treatment recorded in the National Prostate Cancer Register, was examined using multivariable logistic regression.

Forty-seven percent of men with low-risk PCa underwent AS. Uptake was associated with older age, very low-risk disease, more recent diagnosis, and absence of family history. None of the screening/biopsy measures (testing frequency, mean interval, PSA velocity, highest pre-diagnostic PSA, or prior negative biopsy) were associated with the uptake of AS among men with low-risk PCa. Generalizability to settings with different policies and practices may be limited.

We found no evidence that screening frequency and other screening/biopsy measures influence the uptake of AS among men with low-risk PCa.

### The importance of sexuality, changes in erectile functioning and its association with self-esteem in men with localized prostate cancer: data from an observational study [^116q2znP]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

The effect of erectile dysfunction on men's self-esteem is a neglected topic in prostate cancer (PCa) research that deserves attention in both clinical practice and research. Changes in erectile functioning may become particularly important if they occur due to a PCa treatment. Our results emphasize the importance of sexuality for men with PCa. Therefore, medical advice on PCa treatment should encompass the strong association of erectile dysfunction and self-esteem in men with PCa. This topic should be addressed as a possible consequence of invasive treatment.

### Germline mutations in the BRCA2 gene and susceptibility to hereditary prostate cancer [^116RixdC]. Clinical Cancer Research (2007). Low credibility.

Several epidemiologic studies have reported that carriers of germline mutations in the BRCA2 gene have an increased risk of prostate cancer, with the highest risk observed in men diagnosed at earlier ages. However, studies of the contribution of BRCA2 mutations to the etiology of hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) have been inconsistent.

- **Experimental design**: To further address this issue, 266 subjects from 194 HPC families participating in the Seattle-based Prostate Cancer Genetic Research Study were screened for BRCA2 mutations. This was done by sequencing the coding regions, intron-exon boundaries, and suspected regulatory elements of this gene. Of the selected HPC families, 32 had multiple breast or ovarian cancer cases, 16 were Jewish, 8 had a pancreatic cancer case, and 138 had at least one affected man diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (< 60 years).

- **Results**: No disease-associated protein truncating BRCA2 mutations were found in 266 subjects from HPC families. There were 61 DNA sequence variants, of which 31 (50.8%) changed the predicted amino acids. No associations were found between these missense changes and family characteristics. Among affected men with prostate cancer, there were no statistically significant differences between the genotype frequencies of DNA variants with a minor allele frequency of 1% or higher and between the strata defined by median age at diagnosis or by clinical features.

No evidence was found in this study for an association between BRCA2 mutations and susceptibility to HPC in men selected from high-risk families.

### Sexual activity and risk of prostate cancer: A dose-response meta-analysis [^115XmJrq]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The role of sexual activity (SA) in prostate cancer (PCa) risk remains controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the associations among the number of female sexual partners, age at first intercourse, ejaculation frequency (EF), and the risk of PCa.

Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted on MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to identify relevant studies published before April 2018. The summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to determine the association between SA and PCa risk. A two-stage dose-response meta-analysis was performed to explore the trend from correlated log OR estimates.

Main outcome measures: Outcome measures included characteristics of included studies and associations among the number of female sexual partners, age at first intercourse, and EF with PCa risk.

Results: A total of 21 case-control studies and one cohort study, comprising 55,490 participants (14,976 patients and 40,514 controls), were included in this meta-analysis. Linear and significant dose-response associations were found between the number of female sexual partners and age at first intercourse with PCa risk. An increment of 10 female sexual partners was associated with a 1.10-fold increase in PCa risk (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01–1.21), while the risk of PCa decreased by 4% for every 5-year delay in age at first intercourse (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92–0.99). Although no linear association was observed between EF and the risk of PCa, moderate EF was considered.

### Vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer: Population based matched cohort study [^111MHA7Z]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Some limitations of our study merit emphasis. Firstly, although administrative data provide the advantage of studying large populations, these databases are not designed for clinical research, and some degree of outcome misclassification is likely. The databases used in this study, however, have been independently validated for cancer-related outcomes. Secondly, we were unable to account for possible differences in testing for prostate-specific antigen between groups; our results, however, suggest that the use of surrogate cancer screening tests might have accounted for this, as shown by the strong associations between colorectal cancer screening tests and incident prostate cancer. Thirdly, data on prostate cancer grade and stage were incomplete. Fourthly, certain risk factors for prostate cancer, such as family history, ethnicity, dietary factors, use of 5-α reductase inhibitors, and ejaculatory frequency cannot be obtained through administrative data. However, there is no reason to anticipate that these would be differentially distributed across groups. Finally, longer follow-up would have permitted ascertainment of more cases of prostate cancer. This limitation applies to both the vasectomy group and the non-vasectomy group, and we attempted to mitigate this limitation by performing sensitivity analyses of those with follow-up at least to age 50 and 60, and found similar associations to those of our primary analysis. Despite these limitations, our study is the largest at the time of writing to evaluate the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer and found no statistically significant differences.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for prostate cancer, and more specifically with respect to risk assessment, the EANM/EAU/ESTRO/ESUR/ISUP/SIOG 2025 guidelines recommend the use of one of the following tools to decide on biopsy indication in asymptomatic males with a PSA level of 3–20 ng/mL and a normal DRE:

- **Risk-calculator**: Provided it is correctly calibrated to the population prevalence.
- **Prostate MRI**.
- **Additional serum or urine biomarker test**.

### Effects of exercise on sexual dysfunction in patients with prostate cancer - A systematic review [^113BKDyz]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Emerging evidence suggests that exercise interventions may improve sexual dysfunction, one of the most common and distressing long-term adverse effects of cancer treatment.

- **Aim**: The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the effects of exercise on sexual dysfunction in prostate cancer patients.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The systematic literature search was performed on July 13, 2021, using CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing sexual function in prostate cancer patients conducting an exercise intervention alone or in combination with other supportive interventions. The methodological quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Education Database Score and Jadad scale. Outcomes were reported as between-group differences. Intragroup differences were also reported if significant.

- **Outcomes**: Positive intervention effects on sexual function were primarily observed in patients following prostatectomy and undergoing anti-hormone treatment and for pelvic floor muscle exercises, as well as aerobic and resistance exercise.

- **Results**: 22 RCTs (n = 1,752 patients) met the eligibility criteria. They conducted either an exercise-only intervention (n = 10), a multimodal (exercise plus other supportive therapy) intervention (n = 4), or pelvic floor muscle exercises (n = 8). Six RCTs assessed sexual dysfunction as a primary endpoint.

### Meta-analysis of rates of erectile function after treatment of localized prostate carcinoma [^117CrSdk]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2002). Low credibility.

The results of a 1997 meta-analysis of the rates of erectile function after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and radical prostatectomy have been widely used in patient and professional education materials and as a reference against which new findings are compared. With a number of recent publications, it is now possible to update this analysis and compare brachytherapy with or without EBRT with EBRT alone, standard and nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, and cryotherapy.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature review and subsequent meta-analysis of the rates of erectile dysfunction associated with the treatments of localized prostate carcinoma was conducted. A simple logistic regression analysis was used to combine the data from the 54 articles that met the selection criteria.

- **Results**: The predicted probability of maintaining erectile function after brachytherapy was 0.76, after brachytherapy plus EBRT 0.60, after EBRT 0.55, after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy 0.34, after standard radical prostatectomy 0.25, and after cryotherapy 0.13. When only studies reporting ≥ 2 years follow-up were considered, the only significant change was a decline in the probability for nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. No brachytherapy studies had a follow-up of ≥ 2 years. When the probabilities were adjusted for age, the spread between the RT methods and surgical approaches was greater.

- **Conclusion**: The differences in the probability of maintaining erectile function after different treatments of localized prostate cancer are significant.

### Ejaculatory function after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112yhiw3]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Scant data exists on the impacts of prostate radiation on ejaculatory function. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess ejaculatory outcomes in men after prostate radiation.

- **Methods**: We queried PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify 17 articles assessing ejaculatory function post-radiation. The primary outcome was anejaculation rate, and secondary outcomes included ejaculatory volume (EV), ejaculatory discomfort, and mean decline in ejaculatory function scores (EFS). We assessed study quality with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. We calculated pooled proportions using inverse variance and random effects models.

- **Results**: We identified 17 observational studies with 2,156 patients reporting ejaculatory profiles post-radiation. Seven studies utilized external beam radiation therapy, seven brachytherapy, one stereotactic RT, and two utilized either external or brachytherapy. Ten studies reported an anejaculation rate. The pooled proportion of patients having anejaculation, decreased EV, and ejaculatory discomfort (EjD) were 18% (95% CI, 11–36%), 85% (95% CI, 81–89%), and 24% (95% CI, 16–35%), respectively. Five studies reported a decline in EFS post-radiation.

- **Conclusions**: Patients receiving radiation treatment may experience significant changes in their ejaculation, such as the absence of ejaculation, reduced EV, and EjD. It is important to counsel them about these potential side effects.

### Sexual outcomes in men who have sex with men who underwent radical prostatectomy [^112CHqUm]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Sexual difficulties are a recognized consequence of prostate cancer (PCa) treatments. An estimated one in three men who have sex with men (MSM) receive a PCa diagnosis during their lifetime. MSM may experience all types of sexual dysfunction as reported in men who have sex with women (MSW), along with a number of more specific bothersome problems. This systematic literature review aims to evaluate sexual outcomes in MSM who have undergone radical prostatectomy (RP).

- **Methods**: A systematic review was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The searches were made using relevant keywords in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, thus including the whole literature from January 2000 to November 2023. Studies that did not allow retrieval of data on sexual outcomes on MSM treated with RP for PCa were excluded. Data on sexual outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were retrieved, mostly including changes in libido, erectile function, ejaculatory disorders, orgasm, climacturia, changes in role-in-sex identity, changes in sexual partnerships, and the presence of painful receptive anal intercourses (AI).

- **Results**: Six articles met the inclusion criteria. In total, data of 260 patients were analyzed. Three main themes emerged: (a) MSM may experience specific sexual dysfunctions due to the different dynamics of their intimacy; (b) the lack of tools validated on gay and bisexual populations to assess sexual outcomes; and (c) the need for a tailored approach.

### Are there specific health-related factors that can accentuate the risk of suicide among men with prostate cancer [^113bxdkq]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The median age of the participants was 73 years, ranging from 41 to 95 years. Most of them (87%) lived in some form of partnership. The majority had completed elementary school and received their prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis during or after the year 2000. Most of them had localized PCa at diagnosis.

Out of the 6,389 distributed questionnaires, 3,512 were returned (55%). Of those, 3,165 members reported having a PCa diagnosis (49.5%), and these are included in the analysis. Descriptive analyses of collected data showed that most respondents rated their physical and mental energy levels as high and their quality of life and general health situation as good (8 and above on the VAS scale). They rated their experiences of cancer-related pain as lower but reported lower levels of sexual activity and non-medicated erectile function.

Participants generally reported lower frequencies of disease-induced physical symptoms. About 40% sometimes experienced problems with urinary incontinence, and about 23% experienced obstruction during urination.

### Sexual function in male cancer survivors is not correlated to sperm quality [^112WSZBf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

Initial sperm samples were obtained by masturbation-induced ejaculation before gonadotoxic treatment. The time of ejaculation abstinence was recorded with the recommendation of an interval of at least 2–3 days. However, for urgent cases, sperm storage was performed regardless of the abstinence period. Men with low total sperm counts were advised to provide one or more additional samples, again with an optimal abstinence time of 2–3 days, to obtain sufficient numbers of sperms for cryopreservation. At the time of follow-up, another sperm sample was obtained by masturbation. Normozoospermia was defined for all samples in accordance with the 2010 WHO criteria (sperm concentration ≥ 15 million/mL, progressive motility ≥ 32%, and ≥ 4% normal morphology). Sperm samples obtained before 2010 (2008–2010) were evaluated following the 1999 WHO criteria and adjusted to the criteria of 2010.

- **Statistics**: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for normally distributed raw data, which were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). For non-normal data distribution, the differences between the individual parameters of the groups were analyzed using the Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney test and presented as median (interquartile range (IQR)). To prevent alpha error accumulation, a Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. To compare means, the paired t-test was applied. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to identify correlations between different parameters. A significance level of α = 0.05 was assumed for all statistical evaluations.
