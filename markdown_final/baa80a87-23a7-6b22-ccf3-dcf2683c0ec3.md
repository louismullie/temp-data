## Question

Kim earned scores of 87,83, and 88 on her first three mathematics examinations. If Kim receives a score of 90 on the fourth exam, then her average will

(A) remain the same    (B) increase by 1    (C) increase by 2    (D) increase by 3    (E) increase by 4

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Kim's average will change if she scores 90 on her fourth mathematics exam, given her first three scores were 87, 83, and 88. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about calculating the current average of the first three exams. Then, I should compute the new average after adding the fourth score. Next, I will find the difference between the new and old averages. Finally, I will match that difference to the provided answer choices and double-check my arithmetic to avoid careless errors.

> Let me first confirm the current average. The sum of the first three scores is 87 + 83 + 88, which equals 258, and dividing by 3 gives an average of 86 exactly, so the current mean is 86.

> Now, I need to calculate the new average after adding the fourth score of 90. The new sum will be 258 + 90 = 348, and dividing by 4 gives 87, so the new average is 87.

> Wait, let me verify the change. The difference between the new average and the old average is 87 − 86 = 1, which means the average increases by 1 point.

> I should confirm the answer mapping. An increase of 1 corresponds to option B, so the correct choice is B.

---

The average of Kim's first three exams is (87 + 83 + 88) / 3 = 86. After the fourth exam, the new average is (87 + 83 + 88 + 90) / 4 = 87. The average increases by 1, so the answer is **B**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

- **Current average**: (87 + 83 + 88) / 3 = 258 / 3 = 86
- **New average**: (87 + 83 + 88 + 90) / 4 = 348 / 4 = 87
- **Change in average**: 87 − 86 = 1

---

The average increases by 1, so the correct answer is **B**.

Applicants' performance in each domain is graded on a scale from 50 to 150. The global score is scaled and graded on a range from 200 to 800. Importantly, the grading is performed relative to all psychometric examinees since the very first test was administered in 1983. This ensures that the test date does not affect the score, allowing comparison of examinees' performance across test sessions.

The Psychometric Entrance Test has demonstrated high test–retest reliability, with estimates around 0.9 when the retest occurs within 1 year of the initial assessment. The predictive validity of the test is also noteworthy, with a correlation coefficient of 0.43 with first‐year grade point average (GPA) and 0.41 with GPA at the end of undergraduate studies (Allalouf et al.). Additionally, approximately 90% of examinees complete a preparation course before taking the test (Allalouf et al.), suggesting that Psychometric Entrance Test scores may reflect learning outcomes in real‐life settings.

To evaluate potential associations between test performance and demographic factors in our sample, we conducted the following analyses: first, sex‐related differences in performance were assessed using independent‐samples t‐tests for each of the four psychometric scores, with p ‐values FDR‐corrected for four comparisons. In addition, we tested whether performance was correlated with participants' age at the time of the exam or with the time difference between the imaging session and the exam. Correlations' p ‐values were also FDR‐corrected for four comparisons.

Outliers in age and psychometric scores were defined as values more than three standard deviations above or below the mean. To ensure that prediction results were not driven by extreme values, we repeated the prediction of each psychometric score after excluding age outliers and outliers of the target score. For the global score, we additionally excluded participants who were outliers in any of the domain‐specific scores, given the dependence between global and domain‐specific performance. We tested whether outlier exclusion significantly affected prediction accuracy using a permutation test (see comparison of model performance). p ‐values were FDR‐corrected for 16 comparisons (four target scores × four prediction models).

To generate comparable measures from these different tests, we rescaled subject-specific test scores to a common reference test scale using linear regression, building on previous approaches. We used TIMSS mathematics and science tests and PIRLS reading tests as the reference scale because they are large, international tests that cover most geographical regions and all three major testing subjects, and are already standardised to each other. We implemented the rescale using all available data matched by country and approximate year for the reference tests and alternative tests.

To estimate test scores for all countries, years, and ages (5-year age groups from 5 to 19 years), we used spatiotemporal Gaussian process regressionusing per capita mean years of education as a predictor (β = 5·7, p = 0 for boys; β = 5·8, p = 0 for girls), and with maths, science and reading test scores given equal weight to generate a combined learning measure ranging from 0 to 1000. This method draws strength across space, time, and age, incorporates both data and model uncertainty, and produces a full-time series of estimates for all geographies with the use of covariate relationships and spatial and temporal patterns in residuals.

Finally, we rescaled this measure to a 0–1 scale, with 1 set to one SD above the mean score (a score of 600) on the original TIMSS exam, approximately the highest estimated average test score in any country.

Stratification by MPS

We examined the phenotypic values by quantile of the MPS distribution. Figures 2a–c plot the observed outcomes against the predictions by the MPS model in the test set. In general, the quantile results were roughly linear.

Figure 2a shows quantile results for mean exam grades. Individuals in the top 10% of the MPS distribution on average achieved an 'A' mean grade (across the three subjects Mathematics, English and Science), whereas individuals in the bottom 10% MPS distribution achieved a 'C' mean grade on average (top 10% mean = 9.74; bottom 10% mean = 8.33 (11 = A*,10 = A, 9 = B, 8 = C, 7 = D, 6 = E, 5 = F, 4 = G, 0 = failed). Cohen's d was 1.20 (95% confidence interval 0.99–1.41) suggesting that 88% of the top 10% MPS group had a mean grade above that of the bottom 10% group, and there is an 80% probability that a person picked at random from the top 10% MPS group will have a higher score than a person picked at random from the bottom 10% group.

For cognitive ability, Figure 2b illustrates that individuals in the top 10% of the MPS distribution on average had a standardized cognitive ability score over 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.40–0.89) s.d. higher than those in the bottom 10% MPS distribution. This means that 74% in the top 10% MPS group had mean ability score above that of the bottom 10% group, and that there is a 67% probability that a person picked at random from the top 10% MPS group will have a higher score than a person picked at random from the bottom 10% group.

For BMI, Figure 2c shows that children in the top 10% of the MPS distribution on average had a 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.57–1.03) s.d. higher than those in the bottom 10% MPS distribution. Expressed differently, 79% of children in the top 10% MPS group had a mean ability score above that of the bottom 10% group, and that there is a 71% probability that a person picked at random from the top 10% MPS group will have a higher score than a person picked at random from the bottom 10% group.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^21ae0208]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

The "Sufficiency" Requirement and the Issue of Redundancy

The actual difficulty of each item is only roughly estimated with TTT. Could we better know this difficulty level, we might predict, given the total score achieved by a subject, which is the score expected in each item (see the ideal Guttmann pattern on Table 1 A) and vice versa. This property is called "sufficiency". Suppose two or more items share the same difficulty level. In that case, they indicate the same overall ability level: if their scores are summed anyway, as in the case of TTT, then an illusion of a greater ability is by fault considered.

Take the following simplistic example of a 6-item math test. A score of 1 is given to each correct answer; 0 is assigned to wrong responses.

A) 3 + 2 = ?; B) 5–4 = ?; C) 4*5 = ?; D) 9/3 = ?; E) 6/2 = ?; F) 4/1 = ?

It is clear that once the respondent can answer correctly to item D, the first of the three divisions, he/she will likely answer correctly also to items E and F, the other two divisions (all with 1-digit factors and an integer quotient). The respondent will get three score points for the same ability level ("ability to solve this kind of division"). His/her score will artificially jump from 3 to 6. This "jackpot" passes easily undetected in many questionnaires but makes it hazardous to compare changes within and between subjects. Rasch analysis solves this problem elegantly.

### Assessing COVID-19 pandemic policies and behaviours and their economic and educational trade-offs across US States from jan 1, 2020, to July 31, 2022: an observational analysis [^9cd8595e]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic coincided with substantial declines in US educational performance, but our results do not indicate that those learning losses were systematically associated with state-level primary school closures. 20 years of progress in fourth-grade mathematics and reading scores were reversed between 2019 and 2022, according to the 2021 National Assessment of Educational Progress examination, a nationally comparable test that the US Education Department administers every 2 years to 9-year-old children. Yet, California, a state with long school closures during the pandemic, had test score declines similar to or smaller than those in Florida and Maine, states with low rates of school closures. It is likely, however, that our state-level estimates of school closures do not fully capture the diversity in school closure and reopening decisions that occurred within states at the district levels. Our results suggest that state declines in fourth-grade mathematics scores were associated with the intensity of mandates deployed and with mandates unrelated to school closures (mask mandates and vaccine mandates for state and school employees). Declines in fourth-grade mathematics scores were also associated with higher mask use, less mobility, and higher vaccine coverage, as well as showing a weak association with lower infection rates without reaching statistical significance at the 5% level. One possible explanation is that in states where the public and elected officials were more cautious about SARS-CoV-2 transmission generally, more parents might have elected to keep children in remote schooling, irrespective of state requirements. Another possibility is that mask and vaccine mandates for state and school employees affected school attendance and closures in ways that our study is not designed to measure. Several studies have found that remote schooling was associated with lower test scores, in mathematics especially. Other studies showed that Black and Hispanic students and those from low-income households were in fully remote schooling longer and, on average, had steeper declines in mathematics test scores, widening the already large and persistent racial and economic inequities in US education.

### The subject-dependent, cumulative, and recency association of aerobic fitness with academic performance in Taiwanese junior high school students [^1e48cee3]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0, with an alpha of 0.05 set as the threshold for statistical significance. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were first computed to see whether demographic variables (i.e. sex, BMI, level of urbanization) were correlated with fitness patterns and/or exam scores. All data were converted to dummy variables with the exceptions of scores on the five academic subjects. Next, one-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were separately performed with fitness pattern group as the between-subjects factor. The scores of individual subjects were as the dependent variables. Sex, BMI, and degree of urbanization were used as covariates if found to be correlated with either fitness patterns or exam scores. Bonferroni -corrected t -tests were utilized for post hoc analyses. For interpretative purposes, Cohen's d effect sizes and % differences in test scores were calculated when necessary. The following conventions were used to determine the magnitude of the d effect sizes: 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 to represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.

To more clearly address the subject-dependent nature of the fitness-achievement relationship, a comparison was made between the average exam scores of those who were judged to be highly fit at any time during the 3-year period (i.e. (3F + 2F + F3 + 1F)/4)) with the 0F group for each academic subject.

### Implementation of the clinically oriented reasoning evaluation: impact on the European diploma in radiology (EDiR) exam [^52a08c35]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Scoring methodology

MRQs

Arithmetic mean of the scores obtained in each MRQ. Each MRQ is scored from 0 to 100%.

SCs

Arithmetic mean of the scores obtained in each SC. Each SC is scored from 0 to 100%.

CORE

Arithmetic mean of the scores obtained in each CORE case. Each CORE case is graded from 0 to 10 points.

Oral (Previous format): Arithmetic mean of the score obtained in each oral case. Each oral case is graded from -2 to +2.

A standard minimum and maximum pass-marks have been established for each part of the exam, so even if in a given exam the pass-mark drops below this value, the established minimum is still respected, and the same applies to the maximum value.

In order to obtain the EDiR certificate, candidates must have a score equal or greater than the pass-mark in each section (WWS and CORE or oral in the previous format).

After the exam takes place, the following statistics are calculated for each question:

Difficulty: calculated based on the average of the scores obtained for each individual in the corresponding question. Depending on the result, there are three categories:
Too easy: if the average is above 90%
Normal: if the average lies between 10% and 90%
Too difficult: if the average is below 10%

Discrimination: calculated with Pearson's correlation coefficient, which determines if the question discriminates correctly between candidates with a good performance and those with a poor performance. Depending on the result, there are four categories:
Wrong discriminator: if the correlation is negative
Too low discriminator: if the correlation is positive but below 20%
Low discriminator: if the correlation is positive and between 20% and 30%
Good discriminator: if the correlation is above 30%

A question is reused when the following conditions are met: two years have passed since the last time it was used in an exam, its difficulty is normal and its discrimination is either low or good.

The EDiR committees have been improving the quality of the material over the years, and this is reflected in the percentage of reused material (Figs. 2, 3).

Fig. 2
MRQs that can be reused per year

Fig. 3
Short Cases that can be reused per year

For the CORE part, the examiners that mark the cases decide if the case can be used again depending on several factors such as its difficulty and discrimination, but also the candidates' answers.

### Resitting a high-stakes postgraduate medical examination on multiple occasions: nonlinear multilevel modelling of performance in the MRCP (UK) examinations [^9f84b62e]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Numbers of attempts at Part 1, Part 2 and PACES. Top row: The figures show, for Part 1, Part 2 and PACES, the highest number of attempts at the examination (grey bars), and if the examination was passed, the attempt at which it was passed (pale green bars). Bottom row: The same data as in the top row but the ordinate is on a logarithmic scale. The fitted lines are lowess curves, blue for highest attempt and green for attempt at which the examination was passed. PACES, Practical Assessment of Clinical Examination Skills.

As well as attempts at each individual part, the total number of attempts to pass all three parts of the examination was calculated (although this is not straightforward, as not all candidates passing Part 1 go on to take Part 2 and so on). Since the concern is mainly with those passing MRCP(UK) overall, the analysis is restricted to the 10,951 individuals in the database who had taken and passed all three parts of the examination. The minimum number of attempts to gain MRCP(UK) is, of course, three (one for each part), the mean number of attempts was 5.01 (SD 2.72), the median was 4, and 36.8% of candidates passed in three attempts, 21.7% took four, 13.9% took five, and 7.7% took six (an average of twice at each part). The 90 th percentile to pass all three parts was 8, the 99 th percentile was 15, and the maximum number of attempts to pass was 35. Although not shown here, the distribution was also exponential, being almost perfectly straight when plotted on a logarithmic ordinate.

Candidates passing after the sixth attempt

Considering only the 10,951 candidates who passed all three parts of the examination, 1.8% (196) passed Part 1 after the sixth attempt, 0.5% (54) passed Part 2 after the sixth attempt, and 0.3% (152) passed PACES after the sixth attempt. Overall, 2.8% (308) passed one or more parts after the sixth attempt (and hence would fall foul of a limitation of six attempts), but only 0.30% (33) passed after more than 18 attempts in total (that is, an average of more than six attempts at each part).

### Prevention: necessary but insufficient? A 2-year follow-up of an effective first-grade mathematics intervention [^309fc165]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

We present first-grade, second-grade, and third-grade impacts for a first-grade intervention targeting the conceptual and procedural bases that support arithmetic. At-risk students (average age at pretest = 6.5) were randomly assigned to three conditions: a control group (n = 224) and two variants of the intervention (same conceptual instruction but different forms of practice: speeded [n = 211] vs. nonspeeded [n = 204]). Impacts on all first-grade content outcomes were significant and positive, but no follow-up impacts were significant. Many intervention children achieved average mathematics achievement at the end of third grade, and prior math and reading assessment performance predicted which students will require sustained intervention. Finally, projecting impacts 2 years later based on nonexperimental estimates of effects of first-grade math skills overestimates long-term intervention effects.

### Predicting real-life cognitive scores from functional connectivity [^beaec74e]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

3.1 Psychometric Entrance Test Scores

All participants reported their global psychometric scores as well as their quantitative reasoning, verbal reasoning, and foreign language scores. The mean and standard deviation of each score are presented in Table 1 (see Figure S1 for the distribution of each score). For reference, we have included the mean and standard deviation of Israel's general population between the years 2014–2023, as reported by Israel's National Institute for Testing and Evaluation.

TABLE 1
Mean and Standard Deviation of Psychometric Scores.

We next tested whether psychometric performance was associated with covariates. We found that males scored significantly higher than females on the global psychometric score (P FDR = 0.0364), as well as in the quantitative reasoning (P FDR = 0.0003) and foreign language domains (P FDR = 0.0381). While females had higher scores in verbal reasoning, the difference was not statistically significant (P FDR > 0.05). The mean and standard deviation of each score are reported separately for each sex in Table S1. No significant correlations were found between the psychometric scores, whether global or domain‐specific, and participants' age at the time of the exam or the time difference between the imaging session and the exam (P FDR > 0.05). To further account for these covariates, we re‐ran the prediction pipeline after regressing out each of these covariates from the target scores (see examining covariates' impact on prediction accuracy).

We note that our sample consists of participants with substantially higher scores and lower variance compared to the general population. This may limit our ability to predict individual differences. Nevertheless, achieving accurate predictions despite this challenge suggests that functional connectivity is closely linked to real‐life cognitive abilities and may discriminate between individuals even at the higher end of the cognitive ability spectrum.

### MSK30: a validated tool to assess clinical musculoskeletal knowledge [^75957c7b]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Results

A total of 18 SMEs participated in the modified Delphi process. The average importance rating for the initial 45 questions was 4.18 (range 3.39–4.89, SD 0.34). The average importance of the final 30 questions used in the exam was 4.32 (range 3.82–4.89, SD 0.28).

The pilot test of 45 questions was completed by 18 fourth year medical students and the average score was 80.9% (SD 7.8%). A group of seven family medicine interns also completed the final 30 question exam with an average score of 75.1% (SD 8.9%).

The final 30-question examination underwent full-scale implementation with the USU class of 2019. These 167 students had just completed their core clerkship rotations and took the new MSK knowledge assessment under testing conditions. The average score was 74% (range 53%–90%, SD 7.8%), equivalent to 22.3 of 30 questions correct. The distribution of scores is shown in figure 1. No passing score was established but the results of the exam will be used to assess the curriculum. Any topics that presented problems for a large proportion of students will be supplemented and reinforced subsequently in the curriculum.

### MSK30: a validated tool to assess clinical musculoskeletal knowledge [^7a27c025]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Several medical schools and residencies have used FB's exam with very similar results. Harvard administered the exam to fourth year medical students and only 26% earned a passing score of 70%. Tufts School of Medicine used the same exam to evaluate their new MSK module and had a mean exam score of 40% and only one student (of 405) passed. At the University of Arizona, the exam was administered to primary care residents (family medicine, internal medicine, paediatrics and emergency medicine) in their third year of residency as well as a group of fourth year medical students and a control group of orthopaedic residents. They found that the medical students who took an orthopaedic rotation had a mean score of 60.3% compared with 45.1% for those who did not. The primary care residents had an average score of 56.3% and the subgroup of emergency medicine residents had a mean score of 77.5%, whereas the orthopaedic residents had a mean score of 90%.

The Uniformed Services University (USU) also implemented the FB examination to evaluate the MSK knowledge of its graduating students. USU graduates serve in the active duty military or Public Health Service and proficiency in managing MSK conditions is especially critical because, in the military health system, MSK complaints comprise 25% of all outpatient encounters.USU has a comprehensive MSK education curriculum which includes an pre-clerkship 8-week MSK module, 8 additional hours of MSK trauma care in the pre-clerkship period, minimum of 4 hours of MSK training during clerkship period and 11 hours of MSK didactics/training in the post-clerkship period plus any elective rotations. USU fourth year medical students took the FB exam and average score for all 172 students was 68.5% (SD 11.9%).

### Nonlinear Z-score modeling for improved detection of cognitive abnormality [^c8317802]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2019). Medium credibility.

Fourth, we have less data near the edges of our age and education ranges. Consequently, when considering individuals with age and/or education close to or beyond the limits of the data, it is important to be aware of the context of the model predictions. Indeed, when interpreting scores for individuals with covariates that are associated with few data points in the UDS, it would be important to report on the additional model uncertainty involved.

Fifth, our modeling approach treats the effects from each predictor as additive. Extension to nonadditive age and sex are available within the additive model framework; these extended models allow for arbitrary two-dimensional smooth functions of pairs of predictors (and can be extended to yet more dimensional predictors), allowing for complex interactions between these predictors. Although the extended modeling can provide improved fit in many cases (internal validity), such models are more difficult to interpret, and therefore there is a stronger need for external validation. This led to our decision to initially avoid such models for our Z-score correction process.

Sixth, a side effect of the nonlinear fitting approach with heterogeneous variance is that it is not always true that a Z-score will improve with age (i.e. become less extreme) for a constant value of a test score (which is what one might initially expect given that you expect decline with age). For example, if the SD is increasing with age at a faster rate than the mean score that is declining with age, then a nonchanging test score could become less extreme relative to the normative distribution as age increases. Whether this is viewed as a negative depends on your perspective, but when the objective is to determine whether or not a score is extreme given a specific age, it is the correct approach to consider the variance specific to that individual's age in the calculation. Note also that this effect of a constant score becoming less extreme with respect to the normative distribution with increasing age might be exacerbated for outcomes where the residuals are not normally distributed. In particular, scores which have a limiting value at certain ages (i.e. ceiling or floor effects) because the SD can change radically over a short age range. The fact that our approach accounts for this changing variance is positive relative to conventional approaches in that we are still able to detect which observations are extreme at a specific age. Further improvements might potentially be made on this front by explicitly modeling the non-normality in the data.

### Neural alignment predicts learning outcomes in students taking an introduction to computer science course [^a7c9a1a3]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Alignment during lectures

Multi-voxel BOLD patterns during lectures were obtained as follows. First, we used 30-s non-overlapping bins to extract multi-voxel activity (spatial alignment-to-class, Table 1). This yielded a single pattern for every bin in every participant. Then, to examine spatial similarities between participants during videos, we employed an inter-subject pattern correlation framework, which has been successfully used to uncover shared memory-related responses. For each pattern in each student, we obtained an alignment-to-class measure by directly comparing the student pattern and the mean class pattern (average across all other students), using Pearson correlation. Then, correlation values were averaged within video segments. Throughout the manuscript, correlation values were transformed by Fisher's z prior to averaging and then back-transformed in order to minimize bias. Finally, we averaged across segments to obtain a single alignment-to-class measure for every student during all lectures. Alignment was derived independently for each ROI and each searchlight. We then used alignment to predict student performance in the placement exam. To this end, we used a between-participants design, correlating alignment and overall exam scores (mean across questions). Statistical significance values were derived using a one-sided permutation test, with a null distribution created for each searchlight by shuffling score labels 1000 times.

Alternative spatial alignment-to-class measures (Supplementary Table 1) were calculated by changing the length of the time bin used. This was done to test the effects of our arbitrary choice of 30-s time bins for calculating alignment. We used 10-s non-overlapping bins (averaging over 5 TRs) and 2-s bins (calculating alignment in every TR). We also calculated a temporal alignment-to-class measure using inter-subject correlation (ISC). This was done by taking the mean of voxel time courses in each ROI in each student (mean across voxels, resulting in a single average time course) and correlating it with the mean class response (average across all other students, resulting in a single time course).

### United States medical licensing examination step 1 two-digit score: a correlation with the American board of pathology first-time test taker pass / fail rate at the university of Pittsburgh medical center [^e3df6a29]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Factors that correlate with success or failure on the American Board of Pathology (ABP) examination are not known. Other medical residency programs have shown that standardized test scores correlate with specialty board examination scores; however, data from pathology programs are lacking.

Objective

To investigate whether the 2-digit score on step 1 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) was correlated with ABP examination performance at a large university pathology program.

Design

Nine years of data (2001–2009) from pathology residents (n = 72) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) was collected from existing files and deidentified. Step 1 USMLE 2-digit scores and ABP failure rates for first-time test takers were compared. Results are reported as the percentage of residents who failed either the anatomic pathology or clinical pathology part of the ABP examination in cohorts by their USMLE 2-digit score (≤ 80, 81–85, 86–89, ≥ 90).

Results

The rolling 5-year (2005–2009) ABP average failure rate for first-time test takers of the anatomic pathology examination was 3.1% (UPMC) and 14.1% (nationally); in clinical pathology, it was 13.8% (UPMC) and 23.6% (nationally). At UPMC, no resident failed the anatomic pathology or clinical pathology parts of the ABP examination if his or her 2-digit USMLE step 1 score was 90 or more across 9 years of training (2001–2009).

Conclusions

In the UPMC pathology program, 2-digit scores on USMLE step 1 of 90 or more and 80 or less were strong measures of ABP first-time pass/failure rates, whereas scores of 81 to 89 were less-accurate measures. The USMLE step 1 score is one of many criteria that can be used for screening applicants for a pathology residency program.

### Common measures or common metrics? A plea to harmonize measurement results [^bb146002]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

T scores are interval‐scaled, assuming this is a reasonable assumption or given for the original scores. In contrast, percentile rank scores are not equidistant and should be considered as ordinal scores. For instance, a high percentile rank score (PR = 75) corresponds to a T score of 57, which expresses a modest distance from the mean of 50. In the high range the T scores 65, 70, 75 and 80 correspond to 93.3, 97.7, 99.4 and 99.9 (see Figure 1). Thus, percentile rank scores have markedly inequal units, especially at the extremes, which results in underestimation of differences between scores near the mean and overestimation of differences at the extremes.

Figure 3 shows, for a selection of raw BDI‐II scores, their relation with T scores and clinical percentile ranks (only the even raw scores are shown). Dutch data were used to obtain T scores and percentile ranks from a clinical sample (de Beurs et al.). The relation between normal distributed T scores and percentile ranks follows a sigmoid curve, which reflects the stretching of the percentile rank metric relative to the T score metric at the extremes (due to the bell shape of the normal distribution percentile rank intervals are closer together at the middle of the scale than they are at the extremes, see also Figure 1).

FIGURE 3
Selected raw scores on the BDI‐II with T scores (x axis) and percentile rank scores relative to the clinical population (y axis); horizontal and vertical grid lines are based on raw scores

When percentile rank scores are erroneously regarded as equidistant, conclusions about the test result are often wrong. The biased perception of percentile ranks was demonstrated in a study by Bowman with third‐year undergraduate students, who appeared inclined to overestimate percentile ranks above 80 or below 20 as quite extreme test result (whereas under the normal curve PR = 80 corresponds to T = 58.4, that is, less than 1 SD removed from the mean, see Figure 1). Furthermore, given the prevailing view around admissible transformations and their link with arithmetical and statistical operations with percentile ranks, simple operations are not permissible, such as calculating an average over a set of scores, or calculating a difference score between repeated assessments. For some discussion of the topic, see Meijer and Oosterloo. Interestingly, this drawback interferes with the advantage of percentile scores that they are generally more intuitive to interpret.

### Mathematical performance in childhood and early adult outcomes after very preterm birth: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^e64878f3]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the strength of the independent associations of mathematics performance in children born very preterm (< 32wks' gestation or < 1500g birthweight) with attending postsecondary education and their current employment status in young adulthood.

Method

We harmonized data from six very preterm birth cohorts from five different countries and carried out one-stage individual participant data meta-analyses (n = 954, 52% female) using mixed effects logistic regression models. Mathematics scores at 8 to 11years of age were z-standardized using contemporary cohort-specific controls. Outcomes included any postsecondary education, and employment/education status in young adulthood. All models were adjusted for year of birth, gestational age, sex, maternal education, and IQ in childhood.

Results

Higher mathematics performance in childhood was independently associated with having attended any postsecondary education (odds ratio [OR] per SD increase in mathematics z-score: 1.36 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.03, 1.79]) but not with current employment/education status (OR 1.14 per SD increase [95% CI: 0.87, 1.48]).

Interpretation

Among populations born very preterm, childhood mathematics performance is important for adult educational attainment, but not for employment status.

### Measuring human capital: a systematic analysis of 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016 [^0c8d46dd]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Overview

We did a systematic analysis of available data for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 to measure educational attainment, by sex and 5-year age groups (from 5 to 64 years) for the in-school and working-age population, and learning, as measured by performance on stand-ardised tests of mathematics, reading, and science by 5-year age groups (from 5 to 19 years) for school-aged children. We constructed a measure of functional health status using the prevalence, by 5-year age groups, of seven health conditions for which evidence suggests a link to economic productivity using estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016. We also used mortality rates specific to location, age, sex, and year from GBD 2016.

Using these four dimensions — educational attainment, learning, functional health, and survival — we constructed an indicator of expected human capital that is sensitive to recent investments in health and education. Expected human capital is defined as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning, and functional health, measured in units of health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. Expected human capital is calculated by exposing a hypothetical birth cohort to educational attainment, learning, functional health status, and mortality rates specific to time period, age, and sex. The measure is analogous to health-adjusted life expectancy. Expected human capital was calculated as follows:

where nL xt is the expected years lived in an age group x, for year t, in which age groups are defined as birth–6 days, 7–27 days, 28 days–1 year, 1–4 years, and 5-year age groups thereafter; FH xt is the functional health status in an age group x, in year t, transformed to a 0–1 scale; l0 is the starting birth cohort; Edu xt is the years of education attained during an age group x, for year t; and Learn xt is the average standardised test score in an age group x, for year t, transformed to a 0–1 scale.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^4b3293d4]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

A Higher Score May Not Imply a Higher Subject's "Ability"

Tables 1 A and B show a simplistic didactic example. We want to measure the quantity of each subject's "mobility" rather than, like in the oranges metaphor, weight. From left to right, items are aligned to assume increasing "difficulty". This intuitive item ordering will be proposed again in this article, but one should consider that TTT in itself does not provide any formal estimation of the items' difficulty. Based on their raw scores, subjects are aligned from top to bottom in a (supposed) order of decreasing "ability", based on their raw scores. The questionnaire in Table 1 A makes sense. As the overall score of the subjects rises (from bottom to top), progressively more difficult items are "passed". More able subjects only, pass more difficult items.

TABLE 1
Two hypothetical "scales" of mobility (A, B, and C, respectively)

It is important to note that this sensible pattern implies that the items do not share the same difficulty level, although they can only be scored 0 or 1. This point is neglected whenever the overall score is only considered, regardless of which items (difficult or easy?) were passed.

This ideal pattern is dubbed the "diagonal" pattern ("1" and "0" scores lie on opposite sides of a perfect bottom-left to top-right diagonal line) or "Guttman" pattern (after the name of Louis Guttmann, 1916–1987, a famous statistician). Unfortunately, this pattern is virtually impossible to be observed in actual questionnaires, where some "0" and some "1" always happen to take the wrong place. An extreme case is shown in Figure 1 B. Subjects A and B seem to share the same "mobility" level (both are scoring 2 of 4), but it is hard to believe that subject B cannot sit and stand while he/she can walk and jump. In subject B, items' difficulty and subject's ability do not match. Did the rater inadvertently reverse the scores? Are there any reasons unrelated to "mobility" for this weird behavior? Algebraic expedients may attenuate the problem, but TTT does not provide formal solutions, which would require a proper estimation of the item difficulty levels.

### Association between gestational age and academic achievement of children born at term [^7e866ca2]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Measures

The study compares children born at the gestational ages of 37, 38, 39, and 41 weeks each with those born at 40 weeks. Two measures of gestational age are evaluated in separate models. The primary measure is based on the clinical estimate (in years 1989–2002) and the obstetric estimate (in birth years 2003–2009) recorded in birth certificates, which is also used to select the analytical sample; we refer to this as the clinical or obstetric measure. Switching to the obstetric estimate in birth certificates came with more detailed instructions to the birth attendant, including not basing the estimate on neonatal examinations, although otherwise the measures are generally considered to be comparable. Evidence suggests that the obstetric estimate is a valid measure. A secondary measure is the calendar estimate, based on the delivery date minus the date of the last menstrual period before pregnancy. With that measure available in days, the following gestational age ranges are compared with 40 weeks and 0 to 6 days: 37 weeks and 0 to 6 days, 38 weeks and 0 to 6 days, 39 weeks and 0 to 6 days, and 41 weeks and 0 to 6 days. This measure is evaluated because it may be considered in clinical decision-making and because it provides gestational age in days. It is well known, however, that this measure does not correlate well with the clinical or obstetric estimate, especially at late term.

The school tests are based on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Iowa Tests of Educational Development, and Iowa Assessments. Both public and private schools routinely administer these tests, and scores on these tests have been previously associated with conceptually relevant health and policy factors, further supporting their validity. This study focuses on math and reading tests, the 2 most commonly tested subjects. The 2 outcome measures are standardized test scores on math and reading, shown in national percentile rankings (NPRs), so the differences in scores across gestational ages can be directly interpreted as differences in percentile rankings relative to a national sample.

### APA guidelines for psychological assessment and evaluation [^9cb5f2bd]. APA (2020). High credibility.

Psychometric and measurement knowledge — Guideline 5 states that psychologists who provide psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation demonstrate knowledge in and seek to appropriately apply psychometric principles and measurement science as well as the effects of external sources of variability such as context, setting, purpose, and population. The rationale emphasizes that descriptive statistics are the foundational components of test construction and interpretation, noting common measures of central tendency and measures of variation. It adds that critical evaluation of instruments requires working knowledge of the fundamental theories and techniques of test construction. The section explains that individual results of most tests are derived from item responses that are grouped to form scales and are reported as raw scores or transformed and presented as normative comparative or standardized scores. On reliability/precision and measurement error, it states that the reliability/precision of test scores depends on how much scores vary across replications and that psychologists are encouraged to become familiar with approaches to reliability/precision estimation and factors that influence the appropriate index(es). On validity, it defines validity as "the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores for proposed uses of tests", clarifies that validity is not an inherent property of a test but concerns support for use for a particular purpose, and notes that in evaluating tests, psychologists should become suitably aware of the five sources of validity.

### Current and future state of evaluation of large language models for medical summarization tasks [^81d67394]. Npj Health Systems (2025). Medium credibility.

Analysis of human evaluations

The method of analysis for evaluation rubrics can also vary based upon the setting and task. Evaluative scores can be calculated using binary/Likert categorizations, counts/proportions of pre-specified instances, edit distance, or penalty/reward schemes similar to those used for medical exams. Binary categorizations answer evaluative questions using True/False or Yes/No response schema. This set-up allows complex evaluations to be broken down into simpler and potentially more objective decisions. A binary categorization places more penalization on smaller errors by pushing responses to be either acceptable or unacceptable. Likert -scaled categorizations allow for a higher level of specificity in the score by providing an ordinal scale. These scales can consist of as many levels as necessary, and in many cases there are between 3 and 9 levels including a neutral option for unclear responses. Scales with a higher number of levels introduce more problems with meeting assumptions of a normal distribution into an analysis, along with complexity and disagreement amongst reviewers. Count/proportion -based evaluations require an evaluator to identify pre-specified instances of correct or incorrect key phrases related to a particular evaluative criteria. A precision, recall, f-score, or rate can then be computed from an evaluator's annotations to establish a numerical score for a generated text. Edit distance evaluations also require an evaluator to make annotations on the generated text that is being evaluated. In these cases, an evaluator makes edits to the generated text until it is satisfactory or no longer contains critical errors. These edits can be corrections on factual errors, inclusion of omissions, or removal of irrelevant items. The evaluative score is the distance from the original generated text and the edited version based upon the number of characters, words, etc. that required editing. The Levenshtein distanceis an example of an algorithm used to calculate the distance between the generated text and its edited version. This distance is calculated as the minimum number of substitutions, insertions, and deletions of individual characters required to change the original to the edited version. Finally, one of the more complex ways to compute evaluative scores is to use a Penalty/Reward schema. These schema award points for positive outcomes to evaluative questions and penalize negative outcomes. This schema is similar to those seen on national exams which account for positive and negative scores, using the importance and difficulty associated with different questions. For example, the schema used to evaluate LLMs on the Med-HALT dataset is an average of the correct and incorrect answers which are assigned +1 and −0.25 points respectively. This evaluation schema provides a high level of specificity for assigning weights representative of the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.

### Predictive validity of the UKCAT for medical school undergraduate performance: a national prospective cohort study [^edec6f59]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

For many years, access to medical school worldwide has been determined primarily on educational attainment, measured by secondary (high) school grades. This has been an accepted approach as it generally reliably predicts later academic performance in medical school and later postgraduate clinical education. In the UK, as elsewhere, there is a high competition ratio for places at medical school, with around 11 high achieving applicants for each place. Internationally, this competition has encouraged the development of aptitude tests as part of the selection of future doctors. Specifically, aptitude tests seek to quantify the cognitive (and increasingly personal) attributes that are considered desirable in a future doctor and important to successfully completing both undergraduate and postgraduate training as well as practising effectively.

In England, secondary school academic achievement and entry to university is usually focussed on General Certificate of Education Advanced-level grades ('A-levels'). There has been a fairly continual increase in the average grades awarded at A-level over the last two decades. This 'grade inflation' means that prior (or predicted) educational attainment measures are losing their discriminatory power to identify future ability to perform in medical school. Thus, candidates are restricted in the scores attainable from secondary school qualifications such that they cannot demonstrate capability beyond other applicants achieving the same grades. UK universities tend to accept only the first top three grades achieved at A-levels, reducing the variation in accepted entry qualifications further. These top grades are converted from alphabetic form (e.g. A–E) grades to a 'tariff' points score by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) for the UK. Each grade is worth a set amount of tariff points, irrespective of the subject. However, for standard entry (as opposed to graduate entry or extended courses with a 'pre-medicine' year of study) medical schools usually require at least two of the sciences to have been studied at advanced level and also a certain level of achievement at mathematics. Thus, at the time of the study, the maximum achievable UCAS tariff score for 'best of three' A-levels was 360 points (equivalent to three A grades, each worth 120 points). In Scotland and Ireland the situation differs slightly. In Scotland, school students wishing to apply for the more competitive university courses typically sit 'Scottish Higher' exams in five subjects in their fifth year, followed by an additional two or three at 'Advanced Higher' level in their sixth year (the latter being more comparable with A-levels). At the time of this study, most Scottish medical schools would have required mostly 'A' grades at Higher level. UK medical schools outside Scotland generally also required Scottish Certificate of Education candidates to study up to three subjects at Advanced Higher or Higher level, with either AAA or AAB grades, and with subject specification (generally Chemistry and Biology), but this varied amongst medical schools. In Ireland, students intending to study medicine would tend to take seven Irish Leaving Certificate Examinations (ILEs), with an emphasis on science subjects. Medical school entry requirements, at the time, for applicants with Irish advanced educational qualifications, would have been 'A' grades for the best of six of the subjects taken; for ILEs the A grade is split into two levels, A1 and A2, with A1 being the highest achievable grade worth 90 UCAS tariff points. Usually, this needed to include at least two science subjects. Most Irish medical schools also required a specified standard in English, mathematics, Irish, and a third language.

### Early-life low lead levels and academic achievement in childhood and adolescence [^6f488ea4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Study outcomes were the child's math and reading scores in grades 2 through 11 measured as the national percentile rank (NPR), which is the child's percentile score relative to a national sample. Blood lead levels were based on the geometric mean of all blood tests the child may have undergone (50.7% of children in the analytical sample had 1 lead test, with the remainder having more than 1 test).

The following regression model estimated the association of a 1-unit increase in lead levels with school test scores separately for children with lead levels below 3.5 μg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 0.0483) and those with lead levels of 3.5 μg/dL or higher: Test Score i = β 0 + β 1 Lead i + X i λ + e i. For child i with a school test score in a given grade, the Test Score is on either math or reading, and Lead is blood lead level (geometric mean if multiple tests). X is a vector of child, maternal, and school characteristics. The child's covariates included a 0 or 1 indicator for month and year of birth, sex, gestational age (0 or 1 indicator for each gestational age in weeks), birth weight (0 or 1 indicator for birth weight deciles), 0 or 1 indicator for congenital anomalies, and 0 or 1 indicator for first year of lead testing. By including the 0 or 1 indicators for birth year and first year of lead test, the model accounted for age at lead testing. Maternal covariates included the following self-reported sociodemographic factors: age based on delivery date and reported maternal date of birth (0 or 1 indicator for each age in years), marital status, educational level, and race and ethnicity (from birth certificate data), in addition to a 0 or 1 indicator for smoking during pregnancy. Race and ethnicity were provided in the data in categories of Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, Native American, White, or unknown. Maternal race was included in the model as a 2-category indicator of White vs non-White to have minimum sufficient frequencies for this variable. Additional maternal covariates from hospital records included the number of prior live births (at child's birth), number of prenatal visits, 0 or 1 indicator for cesarean delivery, 0 or 1 indicator for labor induction, and 0 or 1 indicator for perinatal complications. School covariates included 0 or 1 indicators for school districts and for year, grade (when pooling by grade), and semester at the time of school test. The regression was estimated by ordinary least squares, both pooled and separately by grade; standard errors were clustered at the child level when pooling by grade.

### The national emergency medicine fourth-year student (M4) examinations: updates and performance [^ebee97fc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Version 1 (V1) of the National Emergency Medicine Fourth-year Student (EM M4) Examination was released in 2011 and revised along with release of V2 in 2012. Each examination contains 50 multiple-choice questions designed to assess knowledge in the EM M4 clerkship curriculum. Development and initial performance data were described previously.

Objective

To provide updated V1 performance data, describe development and revision of V2, and to compare performance between academic years and examination forms, and within academic years.

Methods

Examinations are administered at www.saemtests.org with ongoing performance data provided. After 1 year of use, nine questions on V2 were revised, five because of low discriminatory ability and four because of excessive difficulty. Revision or replacement was done in accordance with the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Item Writing Guidelines. Mean scores were compared for V1 between academic years (i.e. July 2011-June 2012 vs. July 2012-June 2013), V2 compared with V1, and for each examination version for early and late test takers.

Results

V1 has been administered > 10,000 times since its release, and the current form mean is 81.5% (SD 3.7). Average discriminatory value (rpb) is 0.204. V2 has been administered > 1500 times, with a mean score of 78.4% (SD 4.4) and average rpb 0.253. V1 and V2 current means differ statistically. Scores from examinees completing V1 or V2 early vs. late in the academic year differ statistically.

Conclusions

Performance data for V1 remain stable after 2 years. Revisions of poorly performing questions improved question performance on V2. Questions with low rpb or low pdiff will continue to be revised annually. While examination forms differ statistically, the practical utility of the differences is not defined.

### The European certificate in medical genetics and genomics (ECMGG) [^86a084be]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Validation and analysis

The exam is designed to identify a 'minimum passing candidate' – someone who has just the level of knowledge for safe clinical practice in a senior role.

MCQs

All MCQs undergo a review process outlined in Fig. 2. Briefly, each question submitted by a question writer is reviewed and edited in a small group, followed by a second-line review by at least 3 experienced examiners before a draft paper of 120 questions is assembled and sent for standard setting.

Fig. 2
Over 200 questions are written by individual question writers.

These are reviewed and edited 'live' in question writing groups of 4–6 people. Around 160 questions are then reviewed by a review panel of at least 3 experienced geneticists, and the 120 question draft paper is assembled. This paper is sent to standard-setters, whose comments are reviewed with the questions, and a final 110 MCQ paper is constructed and checked against the blueprint. After the exam, psychometric analysis is performed and poorly performing questions are reviewed. Questions which have a clear reason for performing poorly are removed. The final marks and passes are calculated after removing these questions from the analysis. Each question that is used has been reviewed at 3 different stages, including more than 20 people.

Standard setting uses the Angoff method with assessment by at least 15 experienced clinical geneticists who have not written the questions. Comments may be submitted by standard setters, and at the final paper review 10 MCQs are removed, leaving a 110-question paper. The simple Angoff method takes the average of all the standard setters' estimates for each of the 110 original items, with a grand mean of all item averages then computed to calculate a passmark/cut score. No correction/modification is used.

After the exam, question performance is assessed using split-half reliability, Cronbach's alpha, item validity, and item difficulty.

Split-half reliability calculates how similar the candidates' performance is in the first, versus the second, half of the exam. A reliability score of 0.80 or above is widely accepted as desirable, suggesting that candidates are not becoming fatigued by too many questions.

### The UKCAT-12 study: educational attainment, aptitude test performance, demographic and socio-economic contextual factors as predictors of first year outcome in a cross-sectional collaborative study of 12 UK medical schools [^49820901]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Table 1
Summary of variables in the analysis

Variables are indicated by their SPSS variable names (in bold) to reduce ambiguity.

1. MEDICAL SCHOOL OUTCOME DATAMedical schools provided information on overall outcome on a four-point scale (passed all exams at first attempt; passed after re-sitting exams; repeating the first year; and leaving the course), which we called OutcomeFirstYear4pt. Average percentage marks on assessments were also available for most students (OverallMark), and for many students separate marks were also available for 'theory' and 'skills' assessments (TheoryMark and SkillsMark; see Table 1). The overall, theory and skills marks were all based on marks attained at the first attempt.

2. PRIOR EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, AND SO ONInformation on prior educational attainment was provided by UCAS, consisting of Scottish Higher and Advanced Higher results for students from Scotland (collectively SQA qualifications), and A-level, AS-level and GCSE results for other students (collectively GCE qualifications). Educational qualifications are always complex to analyze, because different candidates take different examinations with different structures and grading schemes, and candidates have chosen to study different subjects. Four medical schools were from Scotland and eight from the rest of the UK, entrants to the former mostly, but not entirely, taking Scottish Highers rather than A-levels. No easy solution is possible for the difficult problem of equating the two different sets of results, and we have followed the approach of Tiffin et al. in converting Scottish Highers and A-levels to z-scores, which can then be combined. The Technical Report describes an extensive set of preliminary analyses of the wide range of different measures of attainment (see Table 1). Briefly, each of the 42 derived scores for A-levels, AS-levels and GCSEs was correlated with OverallScore (TR Table 1 a, b). Multiple regressions suggested that only a subset of eight measures (TR Table 2) showed independent predictions of outcome. Missing values for these eight measures were replaced by expectation-minimization (EM) imputation, the resulting 8 x 8 correlation matrix factor analyzed, the first principle component extracted, (which has a mean of zero and SD of one), and scores on that were used as an optimal summary measure of attainment at A-level, AS-level and GCSE. A similar process was carried out for the 51 derived measures of Highers, 'Highers Plus' and Advanced Highers, each of which was correlated with OverallScore (TR Table 3). Ten independent predictors were found, missing values replaced by imputation, and the first principle component extracted (TR Table 4). Since the principle components for the two analyses were both on standardized scales, they could be combined to provide an optimal summary measure of Educational Attainment for the majority of students. Educational attainment measures differ between medical schools and between cohorts, but because the main interest in this study is prediction within medical schools, we have standardized Educational Attainment within cohorts and medical schools, resulting in the variable we call zEducational Attainment. It should be noted that educational qualifications were only available in most cases for non-mature students (age less than 21). Although statistically optimal, and hence good for assessing underlying processes using as much information as possible, we realize that zEducational Attainment does not reflect the current selection processes, and therefore we also report results for the more conventional measures of three best A-levels, four best AS-levels, nine best GCSEs, five best Scottish Highers, five best Scottish "Highers Plus" (which includes finer definition of bands within grades), and the best Scottish Advanced Higher.

### Adequacy of education in musculoskeletal medicine [^7eca30eb]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Basic musculoskeletal knowledge is essential to the practice of medicine. A validated musculoskeletal cognitive examination was given to medical students, residents, and staff physicians in multiple disciplines of medicine to assess the adequacy of their musculoskeletal medicine training.

Methods

The examination was given to 334 volunteers consisting of medical students, residents, and staff physicians. Analysis of the data collected and comparisons across disciplines were performed.

Results

The average cognitive examination score was 57%. Sixty-nine participants (21%) obtained a score of ≥ 73.1%, the recommended mean passing score. Of the sixty-nine with a passing score, forty (58%) were orthopaedic residents and staff physicians with an overall average score of 94%. Differences in the average scores for the orthopaedic residents compared with all other specialties were significant (p < 0.001). The average score was 69% for the 124 participants who stated that they had taken a required or an elective course in orthopaedics during their training compared with an average score of 50% for the 210 who had not taken an orthopaedic course (p < 0.001). When the scores of those in orthopaedics were excluded, the average score for the participants who had taken an orthopaedic course was 59%; this difference remained significant (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Seventy-nine percent of the participants failed the basic musculoskeletal cognitive examination. This suggests that training in musculoskeletal medicine is inadequate in both medical school and nonorthopaedic residency training programs. Among the nonorthopaedists, scores were significantly better if they had taken a medical school course or residency rotation in orthopaedics, suggesting that a rotation in orthopaedics would improve the general level of musculoskeletal knowledge.

### Motor symptom variability in Parkinson's disease: implications for personalized trial outcomes? [^dd7187a2]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

This report is not a reliability study but focuses on symptom variability within individual participants and how this variability relates to the MCID. Therefore, instead of using Cohen's kappa, we calculated all potential differences (deltas) between the 10 scores within each participant, to assess the entire spectrum of variability for all participants in this study. This resulted in 90 possible combinations of MDS‐UPDRS, Part III, scores (Δ‐UPDRS) per participant. This assumes that there is no order in the MDS‐UPDRS, Part III, assessments, such as introduced by learning effects or carryover effects. To verify this assumption, chronological changes in MDS‐UPDRS, Part III, scores over all 10 consecutive measurements were explored using a regression analysis. Furthermore, to assess whether intraindividual variability was associated with symptom severity, we explored the association between intraindividual variability (based on the Δ‐UPDRS) and mean MDS‐UPDRS, Part III, sum score using a regression plot. Finally, an exploratory regression analysis was performed to evaluate whether the levodopa‐equivalent dose (LED) was associated with symptom variability.

To account for intra‐rater variability, the Δ‐UPDRS was corrected with twice the standard error of the mean (SEM) of the sole outcome assessor to obtain a 95% confidence interval for each of the 90 calculated delta values. To obtain the SEM, the trained assessor performed the complete official MDS‐UPDRS, Part III, exam thrice, at least 1 month apart. This exam contains four cases, and the standard error per case was calculated and averaged over all four cases. Next, the percentages of MDS‐UPDRS score differences that were lower than the MCID for improvement (−3.25 points), or higher than the test's MCID for worsening (4.63 points), were calculated per participant. These percentages were averaged across all participants. The delta values show the fluctuation of symptoms in each participant individually. If the delta values exceed the MCID for improvement or worsening, these symptom fluctuations could be interpreted as clinically relevant. To evaluate whether the contextual factors were determinants of the MDS‐UPDRS, Part III, scores, linear mixed effect models were developed per contextual factor, with MDS‐UPDRS, Part III, as outcome, the contextual factor as covariate, and participants as random effects and random intercepts. Statistical analyses were designed with the help of two statisticians and were conducted using R.

### Numerical magnitude representations influence arithmetic learning [^8f04dd6c]. Child Development (2008). Low credibility.

This study examined whether the quality of first graders' (mean age = 7.2 years) numerical magnitude representations is correlated with, predictive of, and causally related to their arithmetic learning. The children's pretest numerical magnitude representations were found to be correlated with their pretest arithmetic knowledge and to be predictive of their learning of answers to unfamiliar arithmetic problems. The relation to learning of unfamiliar problems remained after controlling for prior arithmetic knowledge, short-term memory for numbers, and math achievement test scores. Moreover, presenting randomly chosen children with accurate visual representations of the magnitudes of addends and sums improved their learning of the answers to the problems. Thus, representations of numerical magnitude are both correlationally and causally related to arithmetic learning.

The sampling frame for this study consisted of 729 students entering the clinical course (year 3) at University College London Medical School (UCLMS) in autumn 2005 (n = 383) and 2006 (n = 346), of whom 621 (85.2%) had studied basic medical sciences (BMS) at UCLMS, and all but one of the remaining 108 students had studied BMS at Oxford or Cambridge.

Students had entered medical school between 2001 and 2004, different times since entry reflecting personal circumstances, exam failure or intercalated degrees. Finals were mostly taken in 2007 and 2008, with some students taking them later, again for various reasons. Examination results were available for students taking first and second year exams at UCL, and for all third, fourth and fifth year examinations. Performance was summarized by the medical school as a total overall score. Because students entered the medical school in different years, comparability was ensured by converting all scores to z-scores by year.

A-levels were taken by 669 students and scored as the best three grades attained, on the basis of A = 10, B = 8, C = 6, D = 4 and E = 2 (A* grades had not yet been introduced). A total of 62.5% of students achieved the maximum of 30 points, with 16.9%, 12.3%, 3.1%, 2.2% and 2.9% achieving 28, 26,24, 22 or 20 (or fewer) points. GCSE results were known for 599 students, students taking an average number of 10.04 GCSEs and achieving a mean of 53.6 points (SD 7.84; A✱ = 6, A = 5, B = 4, C = 3, D = 2, E = 1).

### Comparison of two methods for ranking applicants for residency [^ae61b799]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Ranking radiology residency applicants is a complex process. Multiple factors, such as the variability in evaluation of candidates and the sometimes excessive subjectivity experienced, may influence the final outcome. To address inconsistencies, Yale University's selection committee integrated a mathematical model of ranking. The goal is to compare the mathematically generated rank list with the traditional committee-derived list to identify applicants with discrepancies between the two rank orders as a safety net to ensure that the final rank order list reflects true committee consensus. For three consecutive years, beginning with the 2006–2007 interview season, three rank order lists were compiled. The subjective list was developed by committee consensus on appropriate rank for each applicant. The mathematical list was developed using an equation to assign a score from each of an applicant's three interviewers, which were then averaged and arranged in descending order. These two lists were compared to identify applicants who had differences of 10 rank order positions. Identified applicants were reassessed and reassigned if necessary, forming the National Resident Matching Program (final) list submitted for the match. Over three years, 224 applicants were ranked in total, with 109 being reevaluated (49%) and 24 ultimately reassigned (11%). Discrepancies in rank on the two lists were identified and discussed. In some but not all cases, the discrepancies were remedied. Reasons for discrepancies are discussed. The mathematical method used in parallel with the subjective method has proved useful in identifying misplaced applicants and provided assurance that the final rank list reflects the committee's evaluation of each applicant.

Qualitative assessment

Qualitative scoring for image quality and artefact presence/severity is summarised in Table 3 and Fig. 2, with examples of each score provided in Fig. 3.

Summary of qualitative image scoring. A Representation of qualitative scores for both image quality and artefact presence/severity across all examinations. Each row represents a single examination, with examinations grouped according to site. Each column represents a different scoring metric. A black rectangle indicates that a score was not possible for that examination, e.g. Dixon imaging could not be scored because it was not provided, or brain distortion could not be scored as the first imaging station was not acquired due to patient kyphosis. B, C Image quality scores separated by field strength and site respectively. The dashed braces in A indicate groups for which a statistically significant difference in means was found, using a Mann–Whitney U test

Fig. 3
Examples of each artefact/image quality issue that received each score for presence/severity. Artefacts/quality issues are identified by the letters given in Table 2 and scores are indicated by the numbers in brackets (according to the Likert scale: 1 = not present/no artefact, 2 = minimal effect, 3 = moderate effect, 4 = severe effect). When a score is not shown for a particular artefact, this indicates that no examinations were given this score. Images are windowed by a radiologist to optimise reading for each series

94.2% of examinations received a score of either good or excellent for overall image quality, with 93.4%, 95.8% and 99.2% receiving good or excellent scores for DWI, Dixon and spine imaging, respectively. This reflects that DWI generally remains marginally more challenging to implement than the rest of the protocol, although 66.1% of DWI exams were rated as excellent with only two (1.7%) rated as non-diagnostic.

### The effects of an educational intervention for "at-risk" residents to improve their scores on the in-training exam [^44a8175e]. Family Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The American Board of Family Practice (ABFP) In-training Exam (ITE) is one of the tools used to evaluate both a resident's progress through residency and the program itself. Investigators have examined the ITE's validity and reliability and predictors of resident performance, but no published studies have reported the effects of initiatives to improve residents' performance on the ITE. This study examines the impact of an educational intervention on low-scoring residents' ITE composite scores.

Methods

Second-year residents at a university-based program were divided into two groups. The intervention group, who took the educational intervention, all had PGY-1 scores < 400 on their composite score. The control group was comprised of residents scoring > 400 on their composite score as PGY-1s. The educational intervention involved intensive group and independent study.

Results

In the first year of the study, there was an increase in the average composite score of 75 points in the intervention group compared to the control group. In the second year, there was an increase of 72.5 points, but these differences were not significant.

Conclusions

These composite score changes are not significant, and although this educational intervention may have improved confidence among low-scoring residents, it did not clearly improve their scores on the ITE.

### Do scores of the USMLE step 1 and OITE correlate with the ABOS part I certifying examination? a multicenter study [^b643ba8f]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE) are commonly used to select medical students or residents, respectively. Knowing how well these examinations predict performance on the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I certifying examination is important to provide evaluations for medical students and residents. Previous studies comparing the OITE scores with the ABOS Part 1 scores have been limited to one program.

Questions/Purposes

Therefore, we compared the scores on the USMLE Step 1 and OITE examinations with those on the ABOS Part I certifying examination using data from four ACGME approved residency programs.

Methods

We reviewed 202 resident files from 1996 to 2008 from four programs in the same geographic region. Of those, 181 (90%) had complete records. De-identified data were used to compare USMLE Step 1 scores, OITE percentile rank scores, and ABOS Part I percentile rank scores. Pearson coefficients and receiver operator curves were calculated to assess the relationships between tests.

Results

We found a correlation of 0.53 between the USMLE Step 1 and ABOS Part I, and an average correlation of 0.50 for postgraduate years (PGY) 2 through 5 OITE scores and ABOS Part I. There was a stepwise increase in correlation from PGY 2 through PGY 5 between the OITE scores and ABOS scores. Those who averaged in the 27th percentile or lower on the OITE had a 57% chance of failing the ABOS Part I examination.

Conclusion

USMLE Step 1 scores correlated with ABOS Part I certifying examination scores, and we therefore believe it may be used as one factor in resident selection. Use of the OITE scores in guiding education and feedback appears to be justified.

### Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks for photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide [^3d426360]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Catalytic mechanism

It is well known that the routes of H 2 O 2 photosynthesis via O 2 reduction include a 2e − two-step process with · O 2 − as the intermediate species [Fig. 4, Eqs. (1)-(2)], and a 2e − one-step process [Fig. 4, Eq. (3)]. The routes of H 2 O 2 photosynthesis via H 2 O oxidation include a 2e − two-step process with · OH as the intermediate species [Fig. 4, Eqs. (4)-(5)], and a 2e − one-step process [Fig. 4, Eq. (6)]. To clarify the reaction pathways of O 2 reduction and H 2 O oxidation for H 2 O 2 photosynthesis over TTF-HOF and TTF-Bpy-HOF, the quenching tests of the active species were performed, in which p-benzoquinone (BQ) and tert-butanol (TBA) were employed as the scavengers for · O 2 − and · OH radicals, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3d, the photocatalytic H 2 O 2 production over TTF-HOF and TTF-Bpy-HOF did not decline when TBA was added to the reaction system, which indicates that for both TTF-HOF and TTF-Bpy-HOF, the H 2 O oxidation goes through a 2e − one-step process to synthesize H 2 O 2. On the other hand, the photocatalytic H 2 O 2 production over TTF-HOF was almost unaffected when BQ was added, whereas TTF-Bpy-HOF was significantly inhibited after BQ addition. These observations indicate that for TTF-HOF, the H 2 O 2 photocatalysis via O 2 reduction undergoes a 2e − one-step process, whereas for TTF-Bpy-HOF, it undergoes a 2e − two-step process, where · O 2 − is the detected important intermediate.

### Step-by-step state-selective tracking of fragmentation dynamics of water dications by momentum imaging [^9ec320e6]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The double photoionization of a molecule by one photon ejects two electrons and typically creates an unstable dication. Observing the subsequent fragmentation products in coincidence can reveal a surprisingly detailed picture of the dynamics. Determining the time evolution and quantum mechanical states involved leads to deeper understanding of molecular dynamics. Here in a combined experimental and theoretical study, we unambiguously separate the sequential breakup via D + +OD + intermediates, from other processes leading to the same D + +D + +O final products of double ionization of water by a single photon. Moreover, we experimentally identify, separate, and follow step by step, two pathways involving the b 1 Σ + and a 1 Δ electronic states of the intermediate OD + ion. Our classical trajectory calculations on the relevant potential energy surfaces reproduce well the measured data and, combined with the experiment, enable the determination of the internal energy and angular momentum distribution of the OD + intermediate.

### Phase 0 / microdosing approaches: time for mainstream application in drug development? [^98d5620b]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2020). High credibility.

Phase 0 approaches - which include microdosing - evaluate subtherapeutic exposures of new drugs in first-in-human studies known as exploratory clinical trials. Recent progress extends phase 0 benefits beyond assessment of pharmacokinetics to include understanding of mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics. Phase 0 approaches have the potential to improve preclinical candidate selection and enable safer, cheaper, quicker and more informed developmental decisions. Here, we discuss phase 0 methods and applications, highlight their advantages over traditional strategies and address concerns related to extrapolation and developmental timelines. Although challenges remain, we propose that phase 0 approaches be at least considered for application in most drug development scenarios.

### Impact of one versus two content-specific modules on American board of family medicine certification examination scores [^aef7a0e6]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We consider the question of whether requiring diplomates to select only 1 content-specific module, rather than 2, would increase, decrease, or produce no change in scores among the examinee population.

Methods

Examinees' scores were computed under 3 different conditions: the examination core plus (1) both modules, (2) the module on which they scored higher, and (3) the module on which they scored lower.

Results

Although the differences in scores across the 3 conditions were relatively small, asking examinees to select only a single module would likely benefit more examinees than it would harm by a 4:1 ratio, assuming that the diplomates selected the module on which they scored higher. Only 114 of the 29,088 examinees (0.4%) would have changed from a pass to a fail, whereas 467 (1.6%) would have changed from fail to pass.

Conclusion

These results suggest that having examinees select 1 module rather than 2 will likely produce a slight score increase for examinees. Simultaneously, it would improve the standardization of the examination across examinees.

### The second ESGAR consensus statement on CT colonography [^28485aa9]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Table 2
Statements elaborated by the panellists in the second Delphi round, and discussed in the third and fourth to reach the maximum consensus and Cronbach's internal reliability. Statements with score between 4 and 5 are highlighted to show the situations in which all panellists agreed on the statement but the level of support differed (i.e. "agree somewhat" versus "agree strongly")

In the third and fourth rounds, copies of the latest statements were sent by email to panellists, who then indicated independently their level of agreement with each individual statement using a 5-point scale, as follows: 1, strongly disagree with the statement; 2, disagree somewhat with the statement; 3, undecided; 4, agree somewhat with the statement; 5, strongly agree with the statement.

After the third round the facilitator collected panellists' ratings and determined the agreement score for each statement. If the mean score for an individual item was lower than four (maximum possible = five) the facilitator asked panelists to review the statement and attempt to reach a consensus in the fourth round.

Statistical analysis

To measure the internal consistency of panellist's ratings for each statement, a quality analysis was performed using Cronbach's α correlation coefficient and SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, Ill.). Cronbach's α was determined after each round.

Cronbach's α reliability coefficient normally ranges between 0 and 1. The closer the Cronbach's α coefficient is to 1.0, the greater the internal consistency of the item. An α coefficient > 0.9 was considered excellent, α > 0.8 good, α > 0.7 acceptable, α > 0.6 questionable, α > 0.5 poor and α < 0.5 unacceptable. For the iterations, an α of 0.8 was considered a reasonable goal for internal reliability. All panellist ratings for each statement were also analysed with descriptive statistics, estimating the mean, maximum and minimum score, and their standard deviation.

A mean score of 4 was considered to represent "good" agreement between panellists, a score of 5 "complete" agreement.

### Two-step structural changes in M3 muscarinic receptor activation rely on the coupled gprotein cycle [^38b54a93]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Considering the stable interaction between active hM3R and Gα q -GTP (Fig. 7a), the results suggested that hM3R, Gα q, and PLCβ 1 formed a stable heterotrimeric complex during receptor activation. To test this possibility, we examined the direct interaction between hM3R-CFP and YFP-PLCβ 1. As shown in Fig. 7k, Oxo-M strongly increased the FRETr signal in cells expressing the two probes, supporting the conclusion that a stable complex formed between M3R and PLCβ 1 upon receptor activation. The analysis of the FRETr signals revealed two-step responses during activation and deactivation (Fig. 7l, m, right). Interestingly, the kinetics of the fast steps 1 ON and 1 OFF was similar to that of receptor activation (Fig. 7l, m, left). The kinetics of step 2 OFF was close to that of the step 2 OFF of hM3R-YFP and Gα q -CFP (Fig. 7g, right), suggesting that PLCβ 1 might dissociate from hM3R when Gα q left the receptor. Together, the results demonstrate that PLCβ 1 is released from Gα q -GTP more slowly than the step 1 OFF reaction and that this release ends before the completion of the step 2 OFF reaction (Fig. 8). Finally, to check the function of YM, we conducted the same FRETr experiments with Gα q -CFP plus YFP-PLCβ 1 in the presence of YM (Supplementary Fig. 18b–f). There was no FRETr change by receptor activation, indicating that YM successfully inhibited G q activation by blocking the GDP release from Gα q. The results further confirmed that the inactive G q protein cannot interact with PLCβ 1.

### New designs for phase 2 clinical trials [^a90544dc]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Conventional phase 2 clinical trials are typically single-arm experiments, with outcome characterized by one binary "response" variable. Clinical investigators are poorly served by such conventional methodology. We contend that phase 2 trials are inherently comparative, with the results of the comparison determining whether to conduct a subsequent phase 3 trial. When different treatments are studied in separate single-arm trials, actual differences between response rates associated with the treatments, "treatment effects", are confounded with differences between the trials, "trial effects". Thus, it is impossible to estimate either effect separately. Consequently, when the results of separate single-arm trials of different treatments are compared, an apparent treatment difference may be due to a trial effect. Conversely, the apparent absence of a treatment effect may be due to an actual treatment effect being cancelled out by a trial effect. Because selection involves comparison, single-arm phase 2 trials thus fail to provide a reliable means for selecting which therapies to investigate in phase 3. Moreover, reducing complex clinical phenomena, including both adverse and desirable events, to a single outcome wastes important information. Consequently, conventional phase 2 designs are inefficient and unreliable. Given the limited number of patients available for phase 2 trials and the increasing number of new therapies that must be evaluated, it is critically important to conduct these trials efficiently. These concerns motivated the development of a general paradigm for randomized selection trials evaluating several therapies based on multiple outcomes. Three illustrative applications of trials using this approach are presented.

### Estimating premorbid general cognitive functioning for children and adolescents using the American wechsler intelligence scale for children-fourth edition: demographic and current performance approaches [^ef8ad12f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Neuropsychologic evaluation requires current test performance be contrasted against a comparison standard to determine if change has occurred. An estimate of premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ) is often used as a comparison standard. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) is a commonly used intelligence test. However, there is no method to estimate premorbid IQ for the WISC-IV, limiting the test's utility for neuropsychologic assessment. This study develops algorithms to estimate premorbid Full Scale IQ scores. Participants were the American WISC-IV standardization sample (N = 2172). The sample was randomly divided into 2 groups (development and validation). The development group was used to generate 12 algorithms. These algorithms were accurate predictors of WISC-IV Full Scale IQ scores in healthy children and adolescents. These algorithms hold promise as a method to predict premorbid IQ for patients with known or suspected neurologic dysfunction; however, clinical validation is required.

### Chapter 9: options for summarizing medical test performance in the absence of a "gold standard" [^4e0871e5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The classical paradigm for evaluating test performance compares the results of an index test with a reference test. When the reference test does not mirror the "truth" adequately well (e.g. is an "imperfect" reference standard), the typical ("naïve") estimates of sensitivity and specificity are biased. One has at least four options when performing a systematic review of test performance when the reference standard is "imperfect": (a) to forgo the classical paradigm and assess the index test's ability to predict patient relevant outcomes instead of test accuracy (i.e., treat the index test as a predictive instrument); (b) to assess whether the results of the two tests (index and reference) agree or disagree (i.e., treat them as two alternative measurement methods); (c) to calculate "naïve" estimates of the index test's sensitivity and specificity from each study included in the review and discuss in which direction they are biased; (d) mathematically adjust the "naïve" estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the index test to account for the imperfect reference standard. We discuss these options and illustrate some of them through examples.

### A comparison of phase II study strategies [^ebb760ae]. Clinical Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

The traditional oncology drug development paradigm of single arm phase II studies followed by a randomized phase III study has limitations for modern oncology drug development. Interpretation of single arm phase II study results is difficult when a new drug is used in combination with other agents or when progression-free survival is used as the endpoint rather than tumor shrinkage. Randomized phase II studies are more informative for these objectives but increase both the number of patients and time required to determine the value of a new experimental agent. In this article, we compare different phase II study strategies to determine the most efficient drug development path in terms of number of patients and length of time to conclusion of drug efficacy on overall survival.

### Enantioselective three-component aminomethylation of α-diazo ketones with alcohols and 1, 3, 5-triazines [^44b1413c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Mechanistic studies

To gain some insights into the pathway of this transformation, two control experiments were conducted. First, the O–H insertion product 7 derived from 1j and 2b was allowed to react with 3a under the optimal conditions, and the Mannich-type product 5j was not detected (Fig. 7a). This result indicated that a stepwise O–H insertion/Mannich reaction pathway is unlikely involved in current transformation. On the other hand, the [4 + 1] cycloaddition product 8 derived from 2b and 3a, which has been observed as the major product when Rh(II) alone was used as the catalyst, failed to react with 1j under the optimal reaction conditions (Fig. 7b), thus extruding the involvement of 8 as the intermediate for this transformation.

a Control reaction to exclude the formation of product 5j from insertion product 7. b Control reaction to exclude the formation of product 5j from cycloaddition product 8. c, d Control reactions to verify the involvement of enol intermediate with diazo ketone 2e and 2e'.

In previously reported O–H insertion and rearrangement transformations between α -diazo ketones and alcohols, an enol intermediate has been proposed and characterized as the key intermediate. Recent related DFT studies also supported the involvement of an enol intermediate in these processes –. To verify whether an enol intermediate was also involved for the current transformation, parallel experiments starting from 2-diazo-1-tetralone (2e) or 1-diazo-2-tetralone (2e') were conducted. For both reactions, the same three-component product 9 whose tertiary carbon was located at the 2-position were obtained as the major product (Fig. 7c, d), indicating that an enol intermediate, rather than an oxonium ylide, might be involved for this transformation.

### The clinical application of polygenic risk scores: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^e6fe44ea]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) interpretation — low scores and absolute risk is summarized as follows: A low PRS does not rule out significant risk for the disease or condition in question. PRS outputs usually reflect relative ranking rather than absolute lifetime risk, because PRS results are typically given in the unit of the effect size and can be converted to a score between the first to 99th percentiles; a low percentile score reflects lower predicted risk versus a reference population and does not typically report the absolute lifetime risk. Potential sources of unidentified risk and methodological limitations also constrain PRS, absolute risk from the original genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or reference population is not always available, and area under the curve may not be as high as lifestyle-based prediction models, although some studies have shown PRS may be at least comparable or stronger risk predictors than traditional tools.

3.2 Validation of the Applied Scoring Approach Using Fivefold Cross‐Validation

3.2.1 Versus

The average AUC for the five test models was 86.55% which was slightly smaller than the one in the subsample (89.56%). When examining the results of each test round, we found similar AUC scores to the one in the subsample in four test rounds, but a lower AUC score (76.79%) in one test round (Supporting Information F). Of the five test models together, the average sensitivity was 90% and the average specificity was 85% for the cut‐off scores calculated with the Youden index, compared to 76%–89% in the subsample respectively.

The small differences in reported values between cross‐validation and the subsample are likely explained by the small sample sizes of the five test models (= 10, = 14) in the cross‐validation which increases the risk of potential outliers.

3.2.2 Versus

The average AUC of the five test models was 91.34% (compared to 92.13% in the subsample) with an average sensitivity of 90% and an average specificity of 88% for the cut‐off scores calculated by the Youden index, compared to 90% and 83% in the subsample respectively (Supporting Information G).

Results of course evaluation

Scores are presented on a 10-point scale; 0 is the lowest, 10 is the highest score with their ranges (at course level)

P presentation; C content

The mean scores of the modified Berlin questionnaire increased from a pre-course value of 6.2 out of 10 (SD 1.7) to a post-score value of 7.1 out of 10 (standard deviation (SD) 1.3). This increase was statistically significant: mean difference 0.85 (95% CI 0.46–1.25), with an effect size (difference in means divided by the SD) of 0.57, which is moderate to large. Although we found a significantly higher (P = 0.017) mean increase in the 2013 cohort (difference = 2.3) than in the other cohorts (difference = 0.61), we did not observe a trend during the years the course was given or between the distinct courses, nor could we detect any statistically significant difference (P = 0.78) among the residents' specialties.

### Impact of the foundations of clinical medicine course on USMLE scores [^41e31ef2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The synthesis of basic and clinical science knowledge during the clerkship years has failed to meet educational expectations.

Objectives

We hypothesized that a small-group course emphasizing the basic science underpinnings of disease, Foundations of Clinical Medicine (FCM), could be integrated into third year clerkships and would not negatively impact the United States Medical Licensure Examination (USMLE) step 2 scores.

Design

In 2001–2002, all third year students met weekly in groups of 8–12 clustered within clerkships to discuss the clinical and basic science aspects of prescribed, discipline-specific cases.

Participants

Students completing USMLE step 2 between 1999 and 2004 (n = 743).

Measurements

Course evaluations were compared with the overall institutional average. Bivariate analyses compared the mean USMLE steps 1 and 2 scores across pre- and post-FCM student cohorts. We used multiple linear regression to assess the association between USMLE step 2 scores and FCM cohort controlling for potential confounders.

Results

Students' average course evaluation score rose from 66 to 77 (2001–2004) compared to an institutional average of 73. The unadjusted mean USMLE step 1 score was higher for the post-FCM cohort (212.9 vs 207.5, respectively, p < .001) and associated with step 2 scores (estimated coefficient = 0.70, p < .001). Post-FCM cohort (2002–2004; n = 361) mean step 2 scores topped pre-FCM (1999–2001; n = 382) scores (215.9 vs 207.7, respectively, p < .001). FCM cohort remained a significant predictor of higher step 2 scores after adjustment for USMLE step 1 and demographic characteristics (estimated coefficient = 4.3, p = .002).

Conclusions

A curriculum integrating clinical and basic sciences during third year clerkships is feasible and associated with improvement in standardized testing.

### Ribosome profiling reveals multiple roles of secA in cotranslational protein export [^d7883894]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Positional enrichment

For each gene, the enrichment at each codon was calculated as the ratio of the normalized reads over a window of 7 residues in the SecA interactome over that in the translatome. For the heatmaps in Figs. 2d and 4a, log2 enrichment was calculated at each codon. The localization score at each codon was calculated as the ratio over a window of 11 residues of reads in membrane fraction and that in soluble fraction to normalize for local variations in translation speed.

For metagene analyses of SecA enrichment, the first five and last five codons were excluded and only the genes that had an average reads per codon > 0.5 in both translatome and SecA interactome were used. Reads at each codon are first smoothed using a 5 residue rolling average and genes were normalized to their expression level by dividing the reads at each codon by the average reads per codon of the respective gene. ORFs from specific subsets (e.g. Sec substrates) are then aligned to the start codon or to the N-terminus of initial TMD/signal sequence as indicated and the mean of normalized reads and bootstrapped 95% CI were calculated at each position. For metagene analyses of ribosome membrane association, localization score at each codon is divided by the mean localization score of the respective gene. ORFs are aligned as indicated and the median of normalized localization scores and bootstrapped 95% CI were calculated at each position.

### Body weight in adolescent men in Sweden and risk of an early acute coronary event: a prospective population-based study [^217c9317]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The cognitive abilities were assessed at conscription using the Swedish Enlistment Battery. Two different versions of the Swedish Enlistment Battery were used during the study period: Swedish Enlistment Battery 67 and Swedish Enlistment Battery 80. They consisted of 4 subtests measuring verbal, logical, visuospatial, and technical abilities, which were summed to give a global IQ score. The tests were slightly modified in 1980. The logical test recorded the ability to understand written instructions and apply them to a problem‐solving task. Before 1980, the verbal test examined the ability of concept discrimination; after 1980, it examined the capability to select the correct synonym or antonym from a given set of words. Before 1980, the visuospatial test contained questions about puzzles in 2 dimensions; after 1980, the test evaluated the capacity to identify the correct 3‐dimensional image from a series of 2‐dimensional drawings (metal folding). Finally, the technical intelligence test contained problem‐solving tasks, requiring knowledge of basic mathematics and physics. The cognitive performance tests, including reliability and validity, have previously been described in detail. The test scores of the 4 cognitive domains were totaled and given equal weighting, thereby providing a global intelligence score as a measure of general cognitive performance. To determine the long‐term stability of the data sets, the test results were standardized against data from previous years to obtain scores from 1 (low) to 9 (high; henceforth referred to as IQ category). Before 1996, raw data were not electronically recorded, and only stanine scores could be accessed for statistical analysis. Therefore, we used only stanine scores in the present study.

### Daily step count and postprandial fat metabolism [^55681b71]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Two benefits of acute exercise are the next day's lowering of the postprandial plasma triglyceride response to a high-fat meal and increased fat oxidation. However, if activity levels (daily steps) are very low, these acute adaptations to exercise do not occur. This phenomenon has been termed "exercise resistance". This study sought to systematically reduce daily step number and identify the range of step counts that elicit "exercise resistance".

Methods

Ten participants completed three, 5-d trials in a randomized, crossover design with differing levels of step reduction. After 2 d of controlled activity, participants completed 2 d of LOW, LIMITED, or NORMAL steps (2675 ± 314, 4759 ± 276, and 8481 ± 581 steps per day, respectively). Participants completed a 1-h bout of running on the evening of the second day. High-fat tolerance tests were performed on the next morning, and postprandial responses were compared.

Results

After LOW and LIMITED, postprandial incremental area under the curve (AUC) of plasma triglyceride was elevated 22%-23% compared with NORMAL (P < 0.05). Whole body fat oxidation was also significantly lower (16%-19%, P < 0.05, respectively) in LOW and LIMITED compared with NORMAL. No significant differences were found between LOW and LIMITED.

Conclusion

Two days of step reduction to approximately 2500–5000 steps per day in young healthy individuals impairs the ability of an acute bout of exercise to increase fat oxidation and attenuate postprandial increases in plasma triglycerides. This suggests that "exercise resistance" occurs in individuals taking approximately 5000 or fewer steps per day, whereas 8500 steps per day protects against exercise resistance in fat metabolism. It seems that fat metabolism is influenced more by the inhibitory effects of inactivity than by the stimulating effects derived from 1 h of moderate-intensity running.

### An overview of phase 2 clinical trial designs [^bf52c5c8]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials are studies to test new treatments in humans. Typically, these treatments are evaluated over several phases to assess their safety and efficacy. Phase 1 trials are designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a new treatment, typically with a small number of patients (eg, 20–80), generally spread across several dose levels. Phase 2 trials are designed to determine whether the new treatment has sufficiently promising efficacy to warrant further investigation in a large-scale randomized phase 3 trial, as well as to further assess safety. These studies usually involve a few hundred patients. This article provides an overview of some of the most commonly used phase 2 designs for clinical trials and emphasizes their critical elements and considerations. Key references to some of the most commonly used phase 2 designs are given to allow the reader to explore in more detail the critical aspects when planning a phase 2 trial. A comparison of 3 potential designs in the context of the NRG-HN002 trial is presented to complement the discussion about phase 2 trials.

### Multi-stimulated far-UVC luminescence for solar-blind imaging [^af2d0475]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Design principles for far-UVC emission.

Step 1: Calculation of the band gap of the host crystal. Step 2: Assessment of the position and intensity of transitions from the 1 S 0 state of Pr 3+. Step 3: Determine the lowest energy 4f5d state for the longwave boundary of far-UVC emission. Step 4: Analysis of the situation in which the transitions from the 4f5d state of Pr 3+ dominate the emissions as well as the shortwave boundary of far-UVC emission.

Next, we pay attention to the 1 S 0 state of Pr 3+, which may generate far-UVC emissions through the 1 S 0 → 3 H 4 (≈215 nm) and 1 S 0 → 3 H 5 (≈225 nm) transitions (Fig. 1, step 2). It should be noted, however, that the emission intensities of these intra-configurational transitions are very weak due to their parity-forbidden nature. Another downside is that the total transition branching ratios of 1 S 0 → 3 H 4,5 are usually less than 1%. More than 60% ~ 80% of the excited 1 S 0 state terminates in the lower-lying 1 I 6 state, peaking at ≈400 nm. This explains why the 1 S 0 → 3 H 4 (≈215 nm) and 1 S 0 → 3 H 5 (≈225 nm) transitions are hardly observed in most reports. Even if they are observed under optimal conditions, the emission intensity is too weak.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^c221722f]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV-2 diagnostic testing algorithm — Using the currently recommended HIV testing algorithm, people with HIV-2 infection will have positive results on a standard HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody or HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody immunoassay, which will prompt testing with a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay; individuals with HIV-2 mono-infection will test negative for HIV-1 antibodies and positive for HIV-2 antibodies, whereas both tests will be positive for individuals with HIV-1/HIV-2 co-infection. In the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) algorithm, the first step is an HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination assay on serum or plasma (e.g. Abbott Architect HIV Ag/Ab combo assay, Bio-Rad GS Combo Ag/Ab EIA, Alere Determine), which does not distinguish between HIV-1 antibodies and HIV-2 antibodies; reactive specimens must be tested with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved antibody assay to distinguish HIV-1 antibodies from HIV-2 antibodies, and the FDA-approved HIV-2 antibody supplemental test Geenius (Bio-Rad Laboratories) is used as part of the CDC-recommended laboratory testing algorithm.

### Potential impact of a pass or fail United States medical licensing exam step 1 scoring system on radiology residency applications [^5d3105b5]. Academic Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To assess the anticipated impact of the change in United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scoring from numerical to pass or fail on the future selection of radiology residents.

Materials and Methods

An anonymous electronic 14-item survey was distributed to 308 members of the Association of Program Directors in Radiology and included questions regarding the anticipated importance of various application metrics when Step 1 becomes pass or fail. Secondary analyses compared responses based on the current use of a Step 1 scoring screen.

Results

Eighty eight respondents (28.6% [88/308]) completed the survey. Most (64% [56/88]) noted that the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) score will likely be one of the top three most important factors in assessing applicants, followed by class ranking or quartile (51% [45/88]) and the Medical Student Performance Evaluation/Dean's Letter (42% [37/88]). Over 90% (82/88) of respondents anticipate potentially or definitively requiring Step 2 CK scores before application review, and 50% (44/88) of respondents anticipate extending interview invites at a later date to receive Step 2 CK scores. These results did not significantly differ between programs who currently use a Step 1 scoring screen and those who do not.

Conclusion

As Step 1 transitions from a numerical score to pass or fail, radiology residency program directors will likely rely on Step 2 CK scores as an objective and standardized metric to screen applicants. Further investigation is needed to identify other objective metrics to evaluate applicants before Step 1 becomes pass or fail.

### Synergistic catalysis for cascade allylation and 2-aza-cope rearrangement of azomethine ylides [^58d46e3d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 6
Substrate Scope of aldimine esters. Reactions conditions: 1a (0.20 mmol), 2 (0.30 mmol), Cu(I)/DPEphos (0.01 mmol), Ir(I)/(S, S, S)- L2 (0.006 mmol), CH 2 Cl 2 (1 mL), N 2, 25 o C, 12–24 h. Isolated yields were shown. Ee values were determined by HPLC analysis

Since the preliminary study has revealed the stereospecific chirality transfer in 2-aza-Cope rearrangement of a range of the generated allylation intermediates bearing two adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereocenters, we wondered if the efficacy of the chirality transfer could be maintained when the tertiary allyl stereocenter controlled by chiral Ir-catalyst was eliminated in the corresponding allylation intermediates. To further investigate the generality and limitation of this cascade protocol, the reaction of methyl 2-methyl prop-2-en-1-yl carbonate 1 v and phenylglycine derived aldimine ester 2d was conducted with the combined [Cu(I)/(R, R p)- L1 + Ir(I)/ rac - L2] as the catalyst. Due to the reduced steric congestion, the reaction stopped at the first allylation step at room temperature without further rearrangement, and the corresponding intermediate (R)-Int 3 P ′ was obtained in 99% yield with 97% ee. We were pleased to find that the allylation intermediate (S)-Int 3 P ′ could rearrange smoothly upon heating at 100 o C in toluene for 12 h, and the desired 1,3-disubstituted homoallylic amine (R)- 3P was produced in good yield with 93% ee after work-up. The stereochemistry of this stereospecific chirality transfer could also be similarly rationalized through the quadrant conformational analysis shown in Fig. 4. Further control experiments demonstrated that a comparable level of stereospecific chirality transfer could be achieved with the combined [Cu(I)/(R, R p)- L1 + Ir(I)/(S, S, S)- L2] or [Cu(I)/(R, R p)- L1 + Ir(I)/(R, R, R)- L2] as the catalyst, which is consistent with that the absolute configuration of the N -quaternary stereogenic center in (S)-Int 3P′ is fully controlled by chiral Cu(I)/(R, R p)- L1 complex. More examples with respect to aldimine esters containing electron-neutral, electron-deficient aryl and heteroaryl substituents are further tested, affording the corresponding 1,3-disubstituted homoallylic amine 3Q-T in good yield with excellent enantioselectivity (Fig. 7). 2-Phenyl allyl carbonate was also compatible and the desired product 3U could be obtained in 85% yield with 84% ee. It worth mentioning that there is no report on the catalytic asymmetric construction of enantioenriched 1,3-disubstituted homoallylic amines except limited examples with the use of moisture-sensitive allylmetal reagents. Remarkably, with bulkier α-naphthalen-1-yl substituted aldimine ester 2 y as the reaction partner, 1-substituted homoallylic amine 3 V could be obtained in moderate yield with 80% ee. These results clearly demonstrated the high efficiency of the stereospecific chirality transfer of 2-aza-Cope rearrangement even when the allylation intermediate contains only one quaternary stereogenic center, which further showcase the flexibility of this cascade protocol for the synthesis of diversified homoallylic amines.

In step 20, before pooling 1 μl of Nuclease-free water was added to each well to minimize material loss. In step 21, ligation products were pooled by centrifugation into oil-coated VBLOK200 Reservoir (ClickBio) at 500 g for 2 min and (step 22) the liquid face was transferred into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and (step 23) was purified by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 1 min and transfer into a fresh tube twice. In step 24, DNA fragments were purified using Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter — prediluted 1 in 8 in bead binding buffer — 1 M NaCl, 20% PEG8000, 20 mM Tris, pH = 8, 1 mM EDTA) at a bead-to-sample ratio of 0.8. In step 25, after 15 min incubation at room temperature, beads were washed twice with 1 mL 80% ethanol resuspending the beads during the first wash and (step 26) resuspended in 8 μl nuclease-free water. After 2 min elution, the supernatant was (step 27) transferred into a fresh 0.5 mL tube. In step 28, the cleaned DNA is then linearly amplified by in vitro transcription adding 12 μl of MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AMB13345) for 12 h at 37 °C. In step 29, template DNA is removed by the addition of 2 μl TurboDNAse (IVT kit) and incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. In step 30, the produced RNA is further purified using RNA Clean XP beads (Beckman Coulter) at 0.8 beads to sample ratio and samples are resuspended in 22 μl of Nuclease-free water. In step 31, RNA is fragmented by mixing in 4,4 μl fragmentation buffer (200 mM Tris-acetate pH 8.1, 500 mM KOAc, 150 mM MgOAc) and incubation for 2 min at 94 °C. In step 32, fragmentation is stopped by transferring samples to ice, adding 2.64 μl 0.5 M EDTA and another bead cleanup and samples are resuspended in 12 μl nuclease-free water.

### The next step? Use of tissue fusion technology to perform the serial transverse enteroplasty – proof of principle [^e154f88a]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) is an established procedure for intestinal lengthening and tapering. A gastrointestinal linear stapler is used to taper the bowel sequentially. We report preliminary experience with tissue fusion technology to perform STEP in a porcine model.

Methods

Four weaned male pigs (mean age, 4 ± 0 weeks; mean weight, 6.8 ± 0.1 kg) first underwent a 60-cm reversed intestinal segment followed by a STEP 4 to 6 weeks later. The LigaSure Impact (Covidien, Valleylab, Tyco Healthcare Group LP, Boulder, CO) was used to perform the procedure. Animals were fed on postoperative day 2 and terminated 1 week later. Morphometric data were collected, and intestinal tissue was obtained for histology.

Results

Mean bowel caliber of 5.1 ± 0.5 cm was tapered to 1.8 ± 0.3 cm post-STEP with a mean increase in the length of the dilated segment of 82% ± 20%. All animals tolerated enteral feeding, and all survived to termination on day 7. Histologic evaluation revealed the zone of tissue fusion to be 7.1 ± 1.5 mm. Masson trichrome, hematoxylin and eosin, and polarized picrosirius red stains demonstrated that the fusion zone was well healed with overlying granulation tissue.

Conclusion

This is the first report of the successful application of radiofrequency energy to perform the STEP procedure in animals. Although further evaluation is required, tissue fusion devices may eventually provide an alternative to the linear stapler for the STEP procedure.

We detected EGFR mutations in 37.6% (44/117) and 40.2% (47/117) of samples in the 1- and 2-step centrifugation groups, respectively. The κ coefficient for the qualitative results of these 2 groups was 0.91. Additionally, the T790M mutation was detected in 10.3% (12/117) of samples in both groups. We observed an 89.7% (105/117) concordance between the 1- and 2-step centrifugation groups, with a 96.6% concordance for the T790M mutation Table 1. We detected additional mutations in 5 and 7 samples belonging to the 1- and 2-step centrifugation groups, respectively.

### Robotic hepaticojejunostomy training in novices using robotic simulation and dry-lab suturing (ROSIM): randomized controlled crossover trial [^35614676]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome

Due to expected significant interrater variety in OSATS score of the first exam (Kappa value = 0.20) and the second exam (Kappa value = 0.16) (see Supplementary Table 2), data analysis was performed with the combined OSATS score and the OSATS score per rater.

OSATS after the second training

In the second exam, the mean combined OSATS score was significantly higher in the robotic simulation-first group (3.3 ± 0.9 vs 2.5 ± 0.8, respectively; p = 0.049) (see Table 3). No individual OSATS elements were reported to be significantly different between groups by both raters. More detailed OSATS outcomes of the second exam are presented in Supplementary Table 3.

Table 3
Surgical performance in the second exam according to the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) score

R1 is rater 1, R2 is rater 2. Values are mean ± SD

Secondary outcomes

In the second exam after both trainings, no significant difference was found in average force, non-zero force, maximum force, and maximum impulse between groups (see Supplementary Table 4). One second exam in the suture-pad-first group only included force measurements of 3 min and 48 s, due to lost data. This incomplete exam was excluded from the sub-analysis. The sub-analysis included all repetitions to calculate the mean force per group.

Force after the second training

In the second exam, the robotic simulation-first group exceeded the 4 Newton threshold (i.e. threshold for potential tissue damage) more frequently (see Supplementary Fig. 1). However, the suture-pad-first group exerted the highest force with 151.9 Newton, compared to 20.1 Newton in the robotic simulation-first group (see Fig. 4). In both groups, the average force significantly increased (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001) (see Supplementary Fig. 1).

### Comparing cognitive tests and smartphone-based assessment in 2 US community-based cohorts [^b557b01b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In the BHS, like the FHS protocol, the neuropsychological test evaluation requires trained personnel and takes ≈45 minutes to complete. The BHS examinations are conducted every 4 to 5 years and evaluate executive control, attention/information processing speed, and verbal episodic memory domains. The specific neuropsychological tests analyzed for the current research included the most recent examination, including the Digit Span Forward and Digit Span Backward tests (WAIS‐IV), TMT‐A and TMT‐B, WAIS‐IV Logical Memory Immediate and Delayed Free Recall, Delayed Recognition (Wechsler Memory Scale‐IV), and WAIS‐IV Digit Symbol Coding tests.

A Global Cognitive Score (GCS) was computed using the same approach for FHS and BHS data to ensure the comparability of results. The TMT‐A and TMT‐B were reverse‐scored so that higher scores indicated better performance. Because neuropsychological performance is highly influenced by cultural constructs and may result in the overrepresentation of lower and higher scores, we demographically corrected neuropsychological scores to yield more comparable indicators of cognitive function. Neuropsychological test raw scores were standardized into Z scores corrected for age, sex, and race, then averaged to compute a GCS. For descriptive purposes, the GCS was divided into quartiles. The 2 middle quartiles were merged into 1 single group to allow for lower and upper tail descriptions resembling better and worse cognitive performance, given that all individuals were cognitively normal.

As a secondary analysis, domain‐specific Z scores were created separately in both cohorts to examine the association between DANA task digital outcome measures and executive function abilities (Digit Span Backward and TMT‐B), attention and processing speed (Digit Span Forward and TMT‐A), and verbal/visual episodic memory (Immediate and Delayed Free Recall).

Sociodemographic Characteristics

Sociodemographic data were collected in accordance with established FHS and BHS protocols, respectively. Variables included age (years) at neuropsychological exam, sex (women, men), and education (less than high school, high school, some college, and college graduate). Information on the educational level was obtained from self‐reported questionnaires. Given that race, income, geography, and other social determinants affect the quality of education and are not fully captured by education years alone, educational attainment was gauged using a proxy of premorbid cognitive abilities. Specifically, a word reading test (Wide Range Achievement Test‐3 for FHS participants and Wide Range Achievement‐4 for BHS participants) was used, and the index score was converted into a Z score.

### Duration of protection after first dose of acellular pertussis vaccine in infants [^3145fa26]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Data on the effectiveness of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine in the first 4 years of life are sparse. We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 1 and 2 doses of DTaP before 6 months of age and of 3 doses from 6 months of age in Australia, where, since 2003, a fourth dose is not given until 4 years.

Methods

We matched reported pertussis cases aged 2 to 47 months between January 2005 and December 2009 to controls from a population-based immunization register by date of birth and region of residence. VE by number of doses and age group was calculated as (1 - odds ratio) × 100%.

Results

VE against hospitalization increased from 55.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 42.7%-65.1%) for 1 dose before 4 months of age to 83.0% (95% CI, 70.2%-90.3%) for 2 doses before 6 months. The VE of 3 doses of DTaP against all reported pertussis was 83.5% (95% CI, 79.1%-87.8%) between 6 and 11 months, declining to 70.7% (95% CI, 64.5%-75.8%) between 2 and 3 years of age and 59.2% (95% CI, 51.0%-66.0%) between 3 and 4 years of age.

Conclusions

DTaP provided good protection against pertussis in the first year of life from the first dose. Without a booster dose, the effectiveness of 3 doses waned more rapidly from 2 to 4 years of age than previously documented for children > 6 years of age who had received 5 doses.

### Infants evaluate informativeness of evidence and predict causal events as revealed in theta oscillations and predictive looking [^711cb2f0]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Gaze behaviour (Experiment 2). Two main areas of interest (AOI) were defined for Unconfounded trials: Correct and Incorrect. Correct AOI corresponded to the box into which the block should be sorted (active box following an effect, inactive box following no effect). AOIs were same-sized and equidistant from the centre of the screen, surrounding the part of the scene where the sorting boxes (as well as the arms of the model when sorting objects) were positioned (see Fig. 1). First look: The first fixation within either of the AOIs (Correct or Incorrect) during Prediction period (15000–19000 ms) was extracted for each trial and assigned a score of 1 (Correct AOI), or -1 (Incorrect AOI). Trials with valid data but no fixations to either AOI were scored as 0. Prediction Scores (PS) were calculated by averaging the First look scores across the trials. Differential looking score (DLS): Cumulative duration of fixations within either of the box AOIs (Correct or Incorrect) during Prediction period were extracted. DLS was calculated [(looking time to Correct minus looking time to the Incorrect AOI) divided by (total looking time)] for each test trial and averaged across trials.

To control for low-level matching, First looks in Confounded trials were analysed analogously to Unconfounded trials, whereby a fixation within either of the AOIs during Prediction period was extracted for each trial and assigned a score of 1 (Matched AOI – active box), -1 (No-Match AOI – inactive box), or 0. Matching Score was calculated by averaging the First look scores across the Confounded trials.

### Differential contributions of cardiovascular health-related lifestyle factors to epigenetic ageing: implications for healthy longevity [^268ab2f3]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular health components

We assessed and defined cardiovascular health-related components using Life's Essential 8 from the AHA, which consists of four health behaviours (healthy diet, healthy sleep, avoidance of nicotine, and participation in physical activity), and four healthy clinical indicators (healthy weight (body mass index, BMI (kg/m 2)), healthy levels of blood lipids (mg/dL), blood glucose (mg/dL or %), and blood pressure (mmHg)). Participants' dietary pattern was assessed using the Healthy Lifestyle Score (HLS) based on the average consumption frequency and portion size for each food type. Due to the limited availability of diet data in the follow-up exams in Ansan and Ansung, we utilized data from the first wave for calculating the diet score of Ansan and Ansung participants (see Additional file 1: sMethod 2 for details).

Each metric was assigned a score ranging from 0 to 100 based on the AHA's guideline (Additional file 1: Table S1). The overall CVH score was calculated as the unweighted average of the scores for the CVH components, designed to range from 0 to 100. We categorized the levels of overall CVH score into three groups using the cutoff values recommended by the AHA: ideal (scores of 80 to 100), intermediate (50–79), and poor (0–49). In this study, CVH was examined in five dimensions: (i) the overall CVH score (continuous); (ii) the level of CVH score (ideal, intermediate, and poor); (iii) individual CVH components; (iv) a mixture of CVH components; (v) the relative contribution of CVH components in a mixture.

### Systematic detection of functional proteoform groups from bottom-up proteomic datasets [^22365564]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Proteoform scoring

The proteoform score is calculated as follows: first, the average peptide Person's correlation is calculated for each cluster. The lowest correlation value across all clusters is selected as within-cluster correlation. Second, the average Pearson's correlation is calculated across all peptides of the protein, referred to as across-cluster correlation. Third, the proteoform score is calculated by subtracting the across-cluster correlation from the within-cluster correlation.

A p -value for the proteoform score is derived by first transforming the within- and across-cluster correlations by the Fisher z -transformation:

Here, r corresponds to the respective Pearson's correlation. The standard error (SE) of the z -value is defined by:

Here, N is the number of samples for which the correlation was calculated. A test statistic, Z, can therefore be derived as follows:

The Z -value has an approximately Gaussian distribution under the null hypothesis, assuming that the population correlations are equal. A p -value can therefore be derived as follows:

The p -values across all proteins are finally corrected for multiple testing by the BH procedure. The data analyzed in this study was filtered for adj. p -values of 0.1 and a proteoform score of 0.1.

### Assessing first year radiology resident competence pre-call: development and implementation of a computer-based exam before and after the 12 month training requirement [^8cd18318]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Whether first-year radiology residents are ready to start call after 6 or 12 months has been a subject of much debate. The purpose of this study was to establish an assessment that would evaluate the call readiness of first-year radiology residents and identify any individual areas of weakness using a comprehensive computerized format. Secondarily, we evaluated for any significant differences in performance before and after the change in precall training requirement from 6 to 12 months.

Materials and Methods

A list of > 140 potential emergency radiology cases was given to first-year radiology residents at the beginning of the academic year. Over 4 years, three separate versions of a computerized examination were constructed using hyperlinked PowerPoint presentations and given to both first-year and second-year residents. No resident took the same version of the exam twice. Exam score and number of cases failed were assessed. Individual areas of weakness were identified and remediated with the residents. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate exam score and the number of cases failed, considering resident year and the three versions of the exam.

Results

Over 4 years, 17 of 19 (89%) first-year radiology residents passed the exam on first attempt. The two who failed were remediated and passed a different version of the exam 6 weeks later. Using the oral board scoring system, first-year radiology residents scored an average of 70.7 with 13 cases failed, compared to 71.1 with eight cases failed for second-year residents who scored statistically significantly higher. No significant difference was found in first-year radiology resident scoring before and after the 12-month training requirement prior to call.

Conclusions

An emergency radiology examination was established to aid in the assessment of first-year radiology residents' competency prior to starting call, which has become a permanent part of the first-year curriculum. Over 4 years, all first-year residents were ultimately judged ready to start call. Of the variables assessed, only resident year showed a significant difference in scoring parameters. In particular, length of training prior to taking call showed no significant difference. Areas of weakness were identified for further study.

### Predictive validity of the UKCAT for medical school undergraduate performance: a national prospective cohort study [^073b3dd0]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

From Table 6, we can see that, if the UKCAT score is used as a screening threshold, with z = 0 set at the cut-point for candidate rejection, 46% (4903/10,693; in effect the positive predictive value of the test) of those who screen positive are estimated to fail at least one of their year's at first attempt. In contrast, only 31% (4370/13,930) of those that are above the screening threshold are estimated to fail at least one of their year's at first attempt. Thus, the absolute risk reduction resulting from the screening process is 15%. This equates to a 'number needed to treat', or rather in this case, 'number needed to screen', of seven. This could be viewed as an overall index of the effectiveness of the UKCAT as a selection method. We can also calculate hypothesised values for the UKCAT at this selected 'screening' threshold for sensitivity (53%) and specificity (62%).

We can also see that, using a mid-range cut-point, in order to reject 4903 candidates who would be likely to fail at least one exam, we would need to reject 5790 candidates who would probably pass all their end of year assessments first time. This ratio (5790:4903) could be termed as the NNR; in this case 1.18 (approximately one, if rounded down). This could be conceptualised as the number of acceptable candidates we would need to reject in order to screen out one 'poor' candidate. This number rises to 1.5 if a higher threshold (z ≤ –1, i.e. one standard deviation above the mean) is used. In contrast, the NNR reduces to around 0.8 if a lower threshold is selected (z ≤ 1). However, as can be seen from Table 6, when this lower cut-point is selected, the absolute number of higher risk candidates rejected is fairly low at 1465. Moreover, at this threshold, the estimated specificity of the test is also very low at around 15% (Table 5).

### Radiation safety and medical education: development and integration of a dedicated educational module into a radiology clerkship, outcomes assessment, and survey of medical students' perceptions [^b8e3c68e]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

This study assesses the effect on medical student understanding of a new radiobiology and radiation safety module in a fourth-year radiology clerkship.

Materials and Methods

A dedicated radiobiology and radiation safety module was incorporated into the fourth-year medical school radiology clerkship at our institution. Student understanding of the material was assessed via pretest and posttest. Statistical analysis was performed to assess significance of changes in student performance. In addition, we surveyed student perceptions of the importance of this material in medical education and practice.

Results

Monthly pretest mean scores ranged from 47.8% to 55.6%, with an average monthly pretest score of 50.3%. Monthly posttest mean scores ranged from 77.3% to 91.2%, with an average monthly posttest score of 83.9%. The improvement in exam scores after the educational intervention was statistically significant (all P < .01).

Conclusion

The introduction of a new educational module can significantly improve medical student understanding of radiobiology and radiation safety.

### Plasma protein risk scores for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in the framingham heart study [^a24765e7]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Cognitive assessment

Surveillance of cognitive impairment and incident dementia in the Offspring cohort began in 1979, at the second health exam, when the group was relatively young on an average (mean[range]) 44 [17 to 77] years old, to develop a dementia‐free cohort. At the beginning of the fifth health exam (1991 to 1995), the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used to monitor changes in cognitive state. A decrease in MMSE performance of three or more points from the previous assessment, or five or more points overall, and a MoCA score below 23 would indicate a cognitive status change that required investigation by a dementia diagnostic panel composed of at least one neurologist and one neuropsychologist. Furthermore, from 1999 to 2005, all surviving Generation 2 individuals were invited to an in‐depth cognitive evaluation, which included screening for incident cognitive impairment. The panel determines whether a person had dementia, dementia subtype, and the date of onset, using data from previously performed sequential neurologic and neuropsychological examinations, telephone interviews with CloseKnit medical records, and neuroimaging studies. The diagnosis of dementia was established using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM‐IV) criteria, and AD was diagnosed based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS‐ADRDA) criteria.MCI without dementia was defined during dementia monitoring as a person who does not progress to dementia but may suffer decline but never go beyond MCI. Further, the MCI stage was characterized (e.g. amnestic, non‐amnestic, specific cognitive domains affected).

Cognitive factor scores for memory, language, and executive function domains were determined. Scores were co‐calibrated to ensure they were on the same scale regardless of the cognitive battery used. An expert panel of neuropsychologists and a behavioral neurologist classified each neuropsychological test item into one of three domains. Cognitive scores with standard error > 0.6 or derived solely from MMSE, which has a ceiling effect, were excluded. Cognitive factor scores close to exam 5 and MMSE score (exams 5 to 8) were used for association analysis with MCI and PPRSs.

### Stimulus-dependent representational drift in primary visual cortex [^e70ab08e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Event types were determined by z-scoring an event's responses on every trial against baseline activity and comparing the distributions of these z-score values between the first two sessions (60 trials) and the last two sessions (60 trials) (two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Event instability, or normalized delta z-score, was calculated as:

Whererepresents the average z-score of an event's trial-averaged activity on the first two sessions andrepresents the average z-score of an event's trial-averaged activity on the last two sessions. For boxplot comparisons in event analyses, the first quartile of data was compared against the last quartile (Wilcoxon rank-sum test).

To draw boundaries between cortical layers, layer 4 was identified by finding peak ROI density along a user-defined translaminar axis of the window. A 140 μm window centered at this point was defined as the L2/3/L4 boundary and the L4/L5 boundary, and 150 μm deeper than the L4/L5 boundary was defined as the L5/L6 boundary.

For comparing pupil size to visual responsiveness, a Δ F / F gain factor was calculated for every trial. For each trial, a linear least-squares fit was performed between each neuron's activity for the trial and its trial-averaged activity for the given session, and the alpha values produced by these fits were averaged across neurons to yield the trial's gain factor.

Pairwise signal correlations were calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between two neurons' trial-averaged activity on a given session. For pairwise noise correlations, a neuron's trial-average activity was first subtracted from its activity on every trial. All frames were then concatenated into a continuous signal, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was found between these full traces (for MOV, only the first 5760 frames were used to match the length of the PDG recording). Calculation of noise correlations using the average correlation of response vectors across stimulus presentations produced similar results.

### Pass / fail USMLE step 1 scoring – A radiology program director survey [^2ab32796]. Academic Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

In February 2020, administrators for the US medical licensing examination (USMLE) announced that Step 1 reporting would change to pass/fail in hopes of reducing the overemphasis of USMLE performance on the residency selection system and improving medical student well-being. Our objective was to determine the perspectives of diagnostic radiology (DR), interventional radiology (IR), and nuclear medicine (NM) program directors (PDs) regarding pass/fail USMLE Step 1 scoring.

Materials and Methods

A survey composed of thirteen questions on a three-point Likert scale, five demographic questions, and a free-text question was distributed to 179 DR, 84 IR, and 34 NM PDs from ACGME-accredited residency programs.

Results

In total, 140 unique responses were obtained (response rate = 47.1%). The PD respondents had a male predominance of 79.1%, average age of 46 ± 7.2 years, and average tenure of 5.9 ± 5.2 years. A majority of PDs (69.6%) disagreed that the change is a good idea, and a minority (21.6%) believe the change will improve medical student well-being. Further, 90.7% of PDs believe a pass/fail format will make it more difficult to objectively compare applicants and most will place more emphasis on USMLE Step 2 scores and medical school reputation (89.3% and 72.7%, respectively).

Conclusion

The lasting impact of pass/fail Step 1 scoring are uncertain and many radiology PDs do not support this change. While the central motivations to reduce the overemphasis on USMLE Step 1 performance and improve medical student well-being are admirable, it remains to be seen if pass/fail scoring will accomplish these goals.

Association With Other Variables' Validity Data

Forty percent of analyzed participants were affiliated with a USNWR top 25–ranked medical school (n = 496 affiliated vs 1242 nonaffiliated). Mean diagnostic percentile scores for DAPP were highest for attending physicians affiliated with a USNWR top 25 medical school compared with nonaffiliated attending physicians (80 [95% CI, 77–83] vs 72 [95% CI, 70–74], respectively; P < .001). Resident physicians affiliated with a USNWR top 25 medical school had higher mean DAPP scores compared with nonaffiliated peers (75 [95% CI, 73–77] vs 71 [95% CI, 69–72], respectively; P < .001). Interns affiliated with USNWR top 25 medical schools had higher mean DAPP scores compared with nonaffiliated peers (75 [95% CI 72–78] vs 69 [95% CI, 67–71], respectively; P < .001). Difference in mean DAPP scores for medical students affiliated with a USNWR top 25 medical school (69; 95% CI, 66–71) and those nonaffiliated (67; 95% CI, 64–70) did not reach statistical significance (P > .99). Thirty-two percent of analyzed participants were affiliated with a top 25 NIH-funded institution (n = 417 vs n = 1310. Attending physicians affiliated with a top 25 NIH-funded institution had higher mean DAPP scores compared with nonaffiliated attending physicians (81 [95% CI, 75–85] vs 72 [95% CI, 70–74], respectively; P < .001). Resident physicians affiliated with top 25 NIH-funded institutions had higher DAPP scores compared with nonaffiliated peers (75 [95% CI, 73–77] vs 71 [95% CI, 69–72], respectively; P < .001). Interns affiliated with top 25 NIH-funded institutions had higher mean DAPP scores compared with nonaffiliated peers (76 [95% CI, 73–79] vs 69 [95% CI, 67–71], respectively; P < .001). Difference in mean DAPP scores for medical students affiliated with a top 25 NIH-funded institution (70; 95% CI, 66–73) and those nonaffiliated (67; 95% CI, 64–69) was not statistically significant (P = 0.59).
