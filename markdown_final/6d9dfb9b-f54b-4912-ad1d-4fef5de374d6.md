## Question

ammonia level 73 next steps

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate next steps for interpreting and managing a plasma ammonia level of 73 µmol/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the laboratory result and excluding pre-analytical errors. Then, I should assess the clinical context to determine whether there is chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, a nonhepatic cause, or a neonatal scenario. Next, I will stratify actions by scenario, define monitoring and escalation triggers, and outline longer-term management. Finally, I will synthesize a practical takeaway tailored to an ammonia level of 73 µmol/L in different contexts.

> Let me first confirm the result itself before acting on it. Wait, let me verify pre-analytical handling: was the specimen a free-flowing venous or arterial sample collected in lithium heparin or EDTA, kept on ice, and analyzed within about 15 minutes, with hemolysis excluded, since delays, warming, or hemolysis can spuriously elevate ammonia and mislead clinical decisions [^115uNDFC] [^112Cxdh6]. I should double-check whether the patient was fasting or recently had a protein load, because postprandial rises of approximately 12–18% are expected and can shift borderline values upward in both cirrhosis and controls, and site-to-site variability further complicates interpretation, which is another reason to repeat a questionable value under strict handling if it will change management [^116dWwkj] [^1162NBSW] [^115qC1VQ].

> Next, I should review the clinical context, because the significance of 73 µmol/L depends on who the patient is and what is happening clinically. Hold on, I should verify the age-specific reference ranges: for term infants, children, and adults, typical upper limits are around 50–60 µmol/L, so 73 µmol/L is a mild elevation for most older infants through adults, whereas neonatal cutoffs are higher in the first 1–2 weeks of life; I need to ensure the correct reference interval is being used for the patient's age [^115mhcCm]. I will now examine the history and exam: chronic liver disease versus acute liver failure, medication exposures such as valproate, topiramate, 5-FU, or other implicated agents, risk for inborn errors of metabolism or UCDs, renal function, and whether there is altered mental status or seizures, because encephalopathy, not the number alone, dictates urgency [^115wwYSi] [^112ayMSR] [^11138EBV].

> Let me consider the cirrhosis scenario first, since that is common in adults. I need to ensure I do not over-interpret the number in chronic liver disease: the AASLD/EASL guidance is explicit that ammonia levels neither diagnose nor stage hepatic encephalopathy, and clinical assessment drives therapy; a normal ammonia may argue against HE, but an elevated value such as 73 µmol/L neither confirms HE nor guides dose titration of lactulose or rifaximin, so I should treat the patient and precipitating factors rather than the number [^116fpXmX] [^1159UJym]. Let me double-check real-world data: inpatient management of overt HE does not appear to be guided by measured ammonia levels, and correlation with HE grade is poor in routine practice, reinforcing that the lab value has limited utility for bedside decisions in cirrhosis [^114a9VtD] [^113SEYzx] [^116kCx7i] [^111KhZCV].

> Now, what if this is acute liver failure. Initially, I thought thresholds of 124–150 µmol/L uniformly defined high risk for cerebral edema and mandated immediate invasive steps, but wait, I should verify the nuance here. To be precise, an arterial ammonia around 124 µmol/L predicts mortality and complications in ALF cohorts, whereas guideline triggers for intracranial hypertension concern often begin when ammonia exceeds about 150–200 µmol/L or fails to decline, especially with grade 3–4 encephalopathy and other risk factors; thus, 73 µmol/L in ALF is abnormal but below classic high-risk thresholds, though trend and trajectory matter greatly [^115qTjSR] [^115z4TDw] [^112Txfat]. I need to ensure ICU-level monitoring, serial ammonia measurements, neuro checks, and early transplant contact in ALF when ammonia is rising, because persistent or increasing levels portend worse outcomes and higher risk of cerebral edema and seizures [^112Txfat] [^115z4TDw].

> If there is no known liver disease, hold on, I should verify nonhepatic etiologies, because 73 µmol/L outside liver disease can be the first clue to drug-induced hyperammonemia or an inborn error of metabolism. I will now examine medications and stop potential offenders immediately, particularly valproate and interacting agents like topiramate, given the risk of hyperammonemic encephalopathy even with normal LFTs, and consider L-carnitine if VPA is implicated while I obtain targeted labs for UCDs and organic acidemias, starting treatment if symptoms are present rather than waiting for confirmatory results [^11138EBV] [^112ayMSR] [^116UmMEz] [^116rVz9z]. But wait, what if I am missing an occult UCD presenting in adulthood, such as OTC deficiency; I should send plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, and orotic acid, recognizing that genetic testing can be supportive yet nondiagnostic in some cases, so biochemical patterns and clinical suspicion remain pivotal [^116UmMEz] [^112RDKAu] [^1158m1dt].

> In neonates and infants, I need to ensure I do not dismiss 73 µmol/L as benign without considering age and trajectory. Hmm, wait a minute, in the first week of life the upper limit can approach 90–110 µmol/L and then decreases after two weeks; beyond the early neonatal period a level of 73 µmol/L is abnormal and requires urgent assessment for UCDs, and importantly, neonatal UCDs often mimic sepsis, so I should treat and investigate in parallel rather than delay [^115mhcCm] [^1177mVzJ]. I should double-check emergency measures: stop protein temporarily, provide high-glucose fluids to suppress catabolism, consider N-carbamylglutamate if NAGS deficiency is suspected, and escalate rapidly to dialysis when thresholds are exceeded or neurologic deterioration occurs, with continuous modalities preferred in newborns; for PA/MMA-associated crises, Carbaglu can be used adjunctively per label while awaiting definitive control of ammonia [^113mdgZ6] [^111oX3HF] [^113VRP9u] [^111VoPrf].

> For initial monitoring, let me verify cadence and escalation triggers. I should repeat ammonia at roughly 3-hour intervals early on to assess trend while performing serial neurologic exams and checking glucose, electrolytes, and acid-base status, because trajectory informs risk more than an isolated value, and rising levels with worsening encephalopathy warrant prompt escalation including renal replacement therapy and neuroprotective measures such as head-of-bed elevation and, in selected ALF cases, consideration of ICP monitoring [^115uNDFC] [^112Txfat]. Hold on, I should verify dialysis indications across ages: in pediatrics, initiation is generally recommended at high thresholds or rapid rises, whereas in adults with ALF or severe nonhepatic hyperammonemia, initiation is often considered when ammonia exceeds about 150–200 µmol/L or is rising with neurologic decline; local expertise and the clinical picture should guide timing to preempt cerebral edema [^112Txfat] [^113VRP9u].

> Let me circle back to 73 µmol/L and make the interpretation explicit. I should confirm that in most older infants through adults, 73 µmol/L is a mild elevation above typical reference ranges and, on its own, is neither diagnostic nor an automatic trigger for aggressive ammonia-lowering therapy; rather, it should prompt verification of the value, careful clinical assessment for encephalopathy, and evaluation for underlying causes if unexplained by known cirrhosis or recent catabolic stressors [^115mhcCm] [^1162NBSW]. I need to ensure that in cirrhosis I do not titrate therapy to the number, because management of HE is clinical and directed at precipitating factors, while in ALF or suspected metabolic disease I should track trends closely and escalate if levels climb toward high-risk ranges, engaging transplant or metabolic specialists early as appropriate [^116fpXmX] [^1159UJym] [^112Txfat] [^116UmMEz].

> For longer-term prevention once the acute issue is stabilized, I will now examine durable strategies. I should confirm the definitive diagnosis with genetic and biochemical testing when a UCD is suspected, involve a metabolic dietitian to balance protein needs against metabolic stability, consider chronic nitrogen-scavenger therapy when indicated, and use practical targets such as keeping ammonia less than about 80 µmol/L and glutamine below 1,000 µmol/L in UCD follow-up, with transplant evaluation for severe or refractory disease and patient education including MedicAlert identification [^112QdZR5] [^112sqFeP] [^113y6T3v] [^113GNqQk]. Hold on, I should verify that some patients with suspected OTC deficiency may have nondiagnostic sequencing; in such cases, ongoing risk mitigation and surveillance are still reasonable given the potential for recurrence or decompensation despite incomplete genetic confirmation [^112RDKAu].

> Key takeaway, and let me reconsider to ensure no step is missing: an ammonia level of 73 µmol/L is a yellow flag that demands context, confirmation, and trend assessment, not a red flag that mandates ammonia-targeted therapy by itself; treat the patient, not the number, in cirrhosis, but in ALF or suspected metabolic disease, act early on trajectory and neurologic status, with low thresholds to escalate care and involve specialty teams, always starting by verifying the assay before making decisions that hinge on the accuracy of this notoriously labile test [^116fpXmX] [^1159UJym] [^1162NBSW] [^115uNDFC].

---

An ammonia level of 73 μmol/L is a **mild elevation** [^115mhcCm] and should be interpreted in clinical context. The next steps are: **confirm the result** with a properly handled repeat sample [^112Cxdh6], assess for symptoms of encephalopathy, and identify underlying causes such as liver disease, medications (e.g. valproate) [^11138EBV], or metabolic disorders [^115wwYSi]. If symptomatic, initiate lactulose and consider rifaximin [^1159UJym]; if asymptomatic, monitor and address triggers [^116fpXmX]. Escalate care if ammonia rises or symptoms develop, and consider metabolic or hepatology referral if the cause is unclear.

---

## Clinical significance of ammonia level 73 μmol/L

- **Normal reference range**: Typically 15–45 μmol/L; 73 μmol/L is a mild elevation.
- **Clinical correlation**: Ammonia levels do not reliably correlate with encephalopathy severity [^116fpXmX]; clinical assessment is essential [^111KhZCV].
- **Variability**: Levels are labile [^1162NBSW] and influenced by sample handling, diet, and comorbidities [^1153BJM7].

---

## Immediate next steps

### Confirmatory testing

Repeat **ammonia level** using a free-flowing venous or arterial sample [^112Cxdh6], transport it on ice, and process within 15 minutes [^115uNDFC]. Laboratory **evaluation** should include LFTs, renal function, electrolytes, glucose, and an ABG to assess metabolic status and identify triggers [^112RBbyZ].

---

### Clinical assessment

Neurological **evaluation** should assess for confusion, asterixis, altered mental status, or coma [^111m84EG]. Identify **underlying causes** by assessing for liver disease [^115wwYSi], medications (e.g. valproate) [^11138EBV], GI bleeding, infection, or metabolic disorders [^112u1ANp].

---

## Management strategies

### Asymptomatic patients

Asymptomatic patients require **close monitoring** with repeat ammonia measurements and regular clinical reassessment [^116fpXmX] while triggers are addressed. Management focuses on adjusting contributing medications [^112ayMSR], treating intercurrent infections, and correcting metabolic derangements. Dietary **management**, including protein restriction when indicated, should be guided by a dietitian [^1123h5ky].

---

### Symptomatic patients (encephalopathy present)

- **Initiate lactulose**: 20–30 mL orally or via NG tube every 1–2 hours until 2–3 soft stools/day, then titrate to maintain bowel movements [^1159UJym].
- **Add rifaximin**: 550 mg orally twice daily if encephalopathy persists despite lactulose [^1159UJym].
- **Supportive care**: Maintain hydration, correct electrolytes, and monitor neurological status closely [^115dHJXb].

---

## Indications for escalation of care

- **Rising ammonia levels**: Persistent elevation or rapid increase despite initial management [^115z4TDw].
- **Worsening neurological status**: Progression to severe encephalopathy or coma [^1177T9LH].
- **Refractory hyperammonemia**: Consider ICU admission and extracorporeal detoxification (hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy) if ammonia > 150–200 μmol/L or rapidly rising [^113VRP9u].

---

## Long-term considerations

Long-term care focuses on **identifying and managing underlying causes** such as chronic liver disease, metabolic disorders, or medication-induced hyperammonemia [^113HAQFC]. Ongoing **follow-up** should include serial ammonia levels, periodic neurological assessments, and targeted metabolic evaluations [^111D4zT2] [^116UmMEz]. Patient **education** is essential to help individuals recognize encephalopathy symptoms and know when to seek medical attention [^111m84EG].

---

An ammonia level of 73 μmol/L is a **mild elevation**; confirm the result, assess for encephalopathy, and identify causes. Manage with lactulose and rifaximin [^1159UJym] if symptomatic, monitor if asymptomatic, and escalate care if levels rise or symptoms worsen.

Increased blood ammonia can result from various causes, including liver cirrhosis, hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome, acute liver failure, organic aciduria, and complications of transurethral resection of the prostate. It can also arise from portosystemic shunt, citrullinemia, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, arginosuccinic aciduria, fatty acid oxidation defects, and complications of ureterosigmoidostomy. Additionally, it may be due to complications of bariatric surgery, urea cycle disorders, Reye's syndrome, gastrointestinal bleeding, total parenteral nutrition, dehydration, inborn errors of metabolism, and hemodialysis.

Medications can also elevate blood ammonia levels. These include valproic acid, ethacrynic acid, bumetanide, acetazolamide, furosemide, chlorthalidone, sunitinib, fluorouracil, regorafenib, and asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant). Other drugs such as haloperidol, topiramate XR, divalproex ER, ribavirin, topiramate, zonisamide, rabeprazole DR, oxaliplatin, divalproex DR, and cannabidiol have also been implicated.

### Valproate-associated hyperammonemic encephalopathy [^11138EBV]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Use of valproic acid (VPA) (also known as Depakote, Depakene, and others) frequently results in elevated plasma ammonia. In some people, hyperammonemia may be clinically significant, resulting in hyperammonemic encephalopathy, which may be severe. Valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy may occur in people with normal liver function, despite normal doses and serum levels of VPA. We describe two cases of valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy in patients with supratherapeutic VPA levels, although the condition has been described in people with normal VPA levels.

With the increasing indications and off-label uses of VPA, family physicians should be aware of this potential complication of VPA and check ammonia levels in patients taking VPA who present with alterations in mental status. Treatment with L-carnitine may be beneficial in reducing ammonia levels.

### Ammonia-lowering strategies for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy [^115dHJXb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia leads to neurotoxic levels of brain ammonia and is a major factor involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Ammonia-lowering treatments primarily involve two strategies: inhibiting ammonia production and/or increasing ammonia removal.

Targeting the gut has been the primary focus for many years, with the goal of inhibiting the generation of ammonia. However, in the context of liver failure, extrahepatic organs containing ammonia metabolic pathways have become new potential ammonia-lowering targets. Skeletal muscle has the capacity to remove ammonia by producing glutamine through the enzyme glutamine synthetase (amidation of glutamate) and, given its large mass, has the potential to be an important ammonia-removing organ. On the other hand, glutamine can be deaminated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase, thus releasing ammonia (ammonia rebound). Therefore, new treatment strategies are being focused on stimulating the removal of both ammonia and glutamine.

### Reversing hyperammonemia in neuroendocrine tumors [^111Zb6eo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Ammonia is a neurotoxin normally cleared by an intact liver; if not, hyperammonemia results in hepatic encephalopathy. Hyperammonemia may arise from primary or secondary causes. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent permanent brain damage.

Advanced malignancy involving the liver is associated with hyperammonemia due to abnormality in the portal venous system or massive hepatic tumor burden. Neuroendocrine tumors are a type of malignancy that frequently involves the liver. Despite this involvement, these tumors may have a relatively good prognosis and are often characterized by chronic manageable symptoms and slow progression. Hyperammonemia in neuroendocrine tumors represents a potentially reversible yet ongoing process linked to an indolent malignancy.

We present two case studies exemplifying this diagnosis and discuss the diagnostic and management challenges that may arise.

### Consensus guidelines for management of hyperammonaemia in paediatric patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy [^115uNDFC]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Prompt identification and treatment of hyperammonaemia are imperative to optimize the outcome of a hyperammonaemic crisis and to avoid irreversible brain damage.

- **Initial medical management guidelines**: In the initial medical management of acute hyperammonaemia, the patient should be immediately stabilized (circulation, airway, and breathing), vital signs should be addressed, and blood glucose levels monitored. Intravenous access should be established, and airways should be maintained by intubation and ventilation if necessary. Adequate rehydration should be started, typically using a dextrose-containing fluid at a high infusion rate. In patients in hyperammonaemic crisis, laboratory testing is required to establish the cause of hyperammonaemia. Accurate measurement of plasma levels of ammonia is crucial and should be performed on a free-flowing venous or arterial blood sample collected into a lithium heparin or EDTA tube and transported on ice to the laboratory. The sample must be processed within 15 minutes of draw and analyzed immediately.

Once hyperammonaemia is identified, protein intake must be temporarily stopped, and plasma ammonia levels monitored every 3 hours. In a patient with an ammonia level at the upper limit of normal for their age — that is, 110 μmol/l (154 μg/dl) at age 1–7 days, < 90 μmol/l (126 μg/dl) at age 8–14 days, and 16–53 µmol/l (22–74 μg/dl) at age 15 days to adult — stopping protein intake and initiating intravenous glucose and lipids to prevent catabolism is generally adequate.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^111m84EG]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a significant complication associated with chronic liver disease, requiring comprehensive management beyond that of liver specialists. This consensus statement outlines the roles and responsibilities of various healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis and management of this condition, as well as the critical precipitating factors contributing to its development.

- **Signs and symptoms**: Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including cognitive impairment and altered levels of consciousness, which are crucial for clinicians to recognize early.

- **Precipitating factors**: Factors such as infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and electrolyte imbalances are known to precipitate this condition in susceptible individuals.

Interdisciplinary care teams must collaborate to identify potential triggers and apply appropriate therapeutic interventions to mitigate the impact of this disorder. This approach ensures comprehensive care and improves patient outcomes in the management of hepatic encephalopathy.

### Amino acid metabolism and immune dysfunction in urea cycle disorders: T and B cell perspectives [^114HAtVe]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia also has significant immunological consequences. Elevated ammonia levels impair the phagocytic activity of neutrophils by inhibiting the respiratory burst necessary for pathogen clearance. Ammonia disrupts T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, primarily by altering NF-κB signaling pathways. Furthermore, hyperammonemia affects neurotransmission, indirectly compromising immune responses by impairing cognitive functions, which may reduce an individual's ability to recognize and respond to infections effectively.

The neurological implications of urea cycle disorders (UCDs) may also impact the central nervous system's regulation of immune responses, potentially leading to an increased susceptibility to infections. Finally, amino acid changes in UCDs can affect the immune system. Elevated levels of glutamine, glycine, and alanine in urea cycle disorders can potentially impact the function of T and B cells. Although previous studies have examined the in vitro effects of arginine and other elements from the urea cycle on the immune system, their impact on the immunological functions in patients remains largely unknown. The accumulation of intermediate metabolites and amino acids, or the deficiency in essential amino acid production, may disrupt T cell survival and differentiation, potentially playing a vital role in cell proliferation. Although the urea cycle takes place in the liver cells, recent research has indicated that certain urea cycle enzymes also have roles in other tissues and cell types, including T cells, often related to their metabolic and regulatory functions.

### Drug-induced hyperammonaemia [^112ayMSR]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

Hyperammonaemia (HA) arises from numerous primary or secondary causes and leads to clinical manifestations due to its toxic effects on the brain. The neurological consequences generally reflect the ammonia level, duration, and age, with pediatric patients being more susceptible. Drug-induced HA may occur due to either decreased ammonia elimination or increased production. This condition is most frequently associated with the use of valproate and presents a dilemma between ongoing therapeutic need, toxicity, and the possibility of an alternative cause.

As there is no specific test for drug-induced HA, prompt discussion with a metabolic physician is recommended since the neurotoxic effects are time-dependent. Specific guidelines for managing drug-induced HA have yet to be published. Hence, the treatment approach outlined in this review reflects that detailed in relevant urea cycle disorder guidelines.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as liver function tests (LFTs), yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason, this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs, as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation, convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin, and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline, an abnormal liver blood test is defined as a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is emerging literature suggesting that the reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms: unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation, whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises the unconjugated and conjugated fractions.

### Inborn errors of metabolism with hyperammonemia: Urea cycle defects and related disorders [^111NeonR]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The urea cycle disorders are a group of inherited biochemical diseases caused by a complete or partial deficiency of any one of the enzymes or transport proteins required to convert toxic ammonia into urea and to produce arginine and citrulline. The clinical manifestations of these disorders are mostly the result of acute or chronic hyperammonemia, which affects the central nervous system. Affected individuals can also develop hepatic dysfunction. These disorders can present at any age, from the immediate newborn stage to later in life. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to improving outcomes.

### Measurement of ammonia in blood [^112Cxdh6]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The measurement of ammonia, now known to be a normal constituent of all body fluids, is fraught with problems. An elevated ammonia level in blood (100 micromol/L or higher) is an indicator of an abnormality in nitrogen homeostasis. The collection, handling, storage, and analysis of blood samples, along with their limitations and potential sources of error, are discussed. New techniques that permit continuous or real-time estimates of systemic ammonia levels over a broad range are also discussed. The aim should always be to minimize the release of ammonia from the collected sample before analysis. Recommendations are made on the collection and processing of blood samples, for it is by standardization and rigid adherence to these techniques that the reliability of the test results will be improved.

### Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency: A diagnostic odyssey [^112RDKAu]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Low credibility.

The difficult diagnostic journey, with its serendipitous outcome described by Hertzog and collaborators, underscores how metabolic medicine often resembles detective work. This is particularly the case when confirmatory testing comes back negative, but clinical concerns remain. In the three cases presented by Hertzog et al, routine Sanger sequencing of the OTC gene did not identify a disease-causing variant, nor did next-generation sequencing/urea cycle disorder gene panel. Both publications send out a general warning in these sequencing-oriented times: a clinical or biochemical suspicion should not be ruled out based only on negative DNA sequencing results.

The difficulties that may arise are wide-ranging, including the risk of either a near-missed diagnosis or an incomplete diagnosis with no confirmation. If the familial pathogenic variant is unknown (and there may be many more as yet undiscovered pathogenic variants in gene regulatory regions) and biochemical testing comes back nondiagnostic, we may still not be able to rule out OTCD, for example, in relatives at risk. Where the diagnosis of OTCD cannot be established but poses an active concern, for example, in family members at risk, preventive measures and surveillance, together with appropriate counseling with active patient or parent involvement, may be reasonable approaches until the evidence becomes clearer.

In the study conducted by Han and Bjornsson and collaborators, published in the Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022), the diagnostic profile of the proband's brother was also included.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115wEbB4]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned the Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study, which reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but came at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. However, the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting, GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients.

The addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%. Notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### Biomarkers for drug development in propionic and methylmalonic acidemias [^1122ukqf]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Low credibility.

- **Ammonium**: Ammonium is a waste product of amino acid catabolism and is also a potent neurotoxin. Hyperammonemia, which often occurs with episodes of metabolic decompensation in PA or MMA, likely results from secondary disruption of substrate balance in other biochemical pathways, including the urea and TCA cycles. Accumulated metabolites (propionyl‐CoA and methylmalonyl‐CoA) likely compete with acetyl‐CoA to inhibit the activity of N‐acetylglutamate synthase, thereby diminishing the synthesis of carbamoylphosphate. This secondary impairment of the urea cycle can lead to elevated plasma ammonium levels with neurotoxic effects during metabolic decompensations. A chronic contributor to hyperammonemia in patients with PA or MMA is the release of ammonia from glutamine to generate glutamic acid in an attempt to replenish alpha‐ketoglutaric acid in the TCA cycle.

	- Hyperammonemia toxicity in the developing brain is due to multiple mechanisms, including disruption of amino acid and cerebral energy metabolism and increased oxidative stress. Repeated and frequent episodes of hyperammonemia (alongside metabolic decompensations) can result in impaired growth and intellectual disability, the severity of which increases with longer duration of hyperammonemia. This effect is likely exacerbated by concomitant acidosis.

	- Hyperammonemia can lead to the identification and diagnosis of PA/MMA, and it might be a useful biomarker to monitor the severity of metabolic crises. However, hyperammonemia is not specific for PA/MMA and it is not by itself diagnostic. It is also likely not as useful for monitoring the condition as once thought.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: Implications for trial design and clinical practice [^115qC1VQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: The multicenter experience demonstrates that wide variability and lability of serum ammonia levels can confound interpretation, highlighting the unreliability of ammonia as a clinical measure. These results are consistent with American Association for the Study of Liver Disease/European Association for the Study of Liver guidelines recommending against using ammonia levels alone for managing hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This is relevant when ammonia levels are used as the major determinant of trial entry or success/failure. Variation in ammonia levels between sites additionally confounds ammonia level interpretation, particularly because it biases uniformity of the upper limit of normal (ULN). Correlation with the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) likely reflects hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Interestingly, this variation was reduced but not eliminated even with a detailed protocol for blood draw and analysis, which is rarely followed in routine clinical practice. Moreover, norms generated using ULN from healthy controls were largely different from those followed locally. This further demonstrates the need to restandardize ammonia measurements, as has been encouraged for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and international normalized ratio for research.

We also found a major discordance between frozen-thawed and freshly drawn ammonia samples. This poses a challenge to multicenter trials using central laboratories to analyze flash-frozen samples. These results further suggest that if ammonia levels are to be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials, local analytic parameters must likely be standardized.

### Quo vadis ureagenesis disorders? A journey from 90 years ago into the future [^116YQLNj]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). High credibility.

The pathway of ammonia disposal in the mammalian organism was described in 1932 as a metabolic cycle present in the liver in different compartments. In 1958, the first human disorder affecting this pathway was identified as a genetic condition leading to cognitive impairment and constant abnormalities in amino acid metabolism. Since then, defects in all enzymes and transporters of the urea cycle have been described, referring to them as primary urea cycle disorders causing primary hyperammonemia.

In addition, there is a continually growing list of conditions that impact the function of the urea cycle through various mechanisms, leading to secondary hyperammonemia. Despite significant advances in understanding the molecular background and biochemical specificities of both primary and secondary hyperammonemias, many questions remain open. We do not fully understand the pathophysiology in many of the conditions, nor do we always grasp the highly variable clinical course of affected patients. Clearly, there is a need for novel and improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

This study reflects on the beginning of the urea cycle's history, briefly describes the journey through past decades, illustrates advancements and knowledge gaps, and provides examples of the extremely broad perspective inherent to some of the defects of ureagenesis and related conditions.

### Important unresolved questions in the management of hepatic encephalopathy: An ISHEN consensus [^114U3xqi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Management of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) remains challenging from both a medical and psychosocial perspective. Members of the International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism recognized five key unresolved questions in HE management:

- **Driving**: There is an ongoing debate regarding the impact of HE on patients' ability to drive safely.
- **Ammonia levels in clinical practice**: The role of ammonia levels in the diagnosis and management of HE continues to be questioned.
- **Testing strategies for covert or minimal HE**: The effectiveness and necessity of various testing strategies are yet to be fully ascertained.
- **Therapeutic options**: The document reviews treatment options and their efficacy, guiding future treatments.
- **Nutrition and patient-reported outcomes**: The link between nutritional management and patient outcomes remains a critical area for further exploration.

### Progress and challenges in development of new therapies for urea cycle disorders [^113GNqQk]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

Urea cycle disorders (UCD) are inborn errors of metabolism caused by a deficiency of enzymes required to transfer nitrogen from ammonia into urea. Paradigms of treatment focus on dietary manipulations, ammonia scavenger drugs, and orthotopic liver transplantation. In recent years, there has been intense preclinical research aiming at developing more effective treatments for UCD, and as a result, several novel approaches based on new knowledge of the disease pathogenesis, cell, and gene therapies are currently under clinical investigation. We provide an overview of the latest advances for the development of novel therapies for UCD.

### Persistent hyperammonemia is associated with complications and poor outcomes in patients with acute liver failure [^115z4TDw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients admitted to the hospital with acute liver failure (ALF) and high arterial levels of ammonia are more likely to have complications and poor outcomes than patients with lower levels of ammonia. ALF is a dynamic process, and ammonia levels can change over time. We investigated whether early changes (first 3 days after admission) in arterial levels of ammonia were associated with complications and outcomes and identified factors associated with persistent hyperammonemia.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective observational study that measured arterial ammonia levels each day for 5 days in 295 consecutive patients with ALF. We analyzed associations of changes in ammonia levels during the first 3 days with complications and outcomes.

- **Results**: Patients with persistent arterial hyperammonemia (≥ 122 μmol/L for 3 consecutive days), compared with those with decreasing levels, had lower rates of survival (23% vs 72%; P < .001) and higher percentages of cerebral edema (71% vs 37%; P < .001), infection (67% vs 28%; p = 0.003), and seizures (41% vs 7.7%; P < .001). Patients with persistent hyperammonemia had greater mortality, with an odds ratio (OR) of 10.7, compared with patients with baseline levels of ammonia ≥ 122 μmol/L (OR, 2.4). Patients with persistent hyperammonemia were more likely to progress to and maintain advanced hepatic encephalopathy than those with decreasing levels. Patients with persistent, mild hyperammonemia (≥ 85 μmol/L for 3 days) were also more likely to have complications or die (P < .001) than patients with serial ammonia levels < 85 μmol/L.

### Non-cirrhotic hyperammonaemia: Are we missing the diagnosis [^1157aNW6]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy secondary to hyperammonaemia is a known complication of chronic liver disease. In contrast, non-cirrhotic hyperammonaemia is a lesser-known entity that should be considered in a patient with acute encephalopathy as part of the diagnostic workup, as prompt identification can help avoid complications such as seizures and cerebral oedema. We present a case of a middle-aged woman who presented electively for a total pancreatectomy-duodenectomy with splenectomy, hepatico-jejunostomy, and gastro-jejunostomy and developed encephalopathy on postoperative day 10 due to non-cirrhotic hyperammonaemia.

### Ammonia-induced stress response in liver disease progression and hepatic encephalopathy [^113HAQFC]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Ammonia levels are orchestrated by a series of complex interrelated pathways in which the urea cycle has a central role. Liver dysfunction leads to an accumulation of ammonia, which is toxic and is strongly associated with disruption of potassium homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, hypoxaemia, and dysregulation of neurotransmission. Hyperammonaemia is a hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy and has been strongly associated with liver-related outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and liver failure.

In addition to the established role of ammonia as a neurotoxin in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, an increasing number of studies suggest that it can lead to hepatic fibrosis progression, sarcopenia, immune dysfunction, and cancer. However, elevated systemic ammonia levels are uncommon in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. A clear causal relationship between ammonia-induced immune dysfunction and risk of infection has not yet been definitively proven.

In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which ammonia produces its diverse deleterious effects and their clinical relevance in liver diseases, the importance of measuring ammonia levels for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and liver failure, and how our knowledge of inter-organ ammonia metabolism is leading to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

### Serum ammonia levels do not correlate with overt hepatic encephalopathy severity in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis [^111KhZCV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Although ammonia is involved in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), the use of ammonia levels in clinical practice is problematic. For example, in a study of 551 patients with overt HE (OHE) receiving lactulose who had ammonia levels tested, only 60% had an increased ammonia level (defined as > 72 μmol/L). Overall, there was no correlation observed between lactulose dose and whether ammonia levels were obtained (i.e. the presence/absence of increased ammonia level did not guide therapy), or between time to OHE resolution and ammonia levels. Additionally, there is substantial interlaboratory variability in sample handling and processing, which may affect ammonia measurements.

### Neurological implications of urea cycle disorders [^117D1D4n]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2007). Low credibility.

The urea cycle disorders constitute a group of rare congenital disorders caused by a deficiency of the enzymes or transport proteins required to remove ammonia from the body. Through a series of biochemical steps, nitrogen, the waste product of protein metabolism, is removed from the blood and converted into urea. A consequence of these disorders is hyperammonemia, resulting in central nervous system dysfunction, with mental status changes, brain edema, seizures, coma, and potentially death. Both acute and chronic hyperammonemia result in alterations of neurotransmitter systems.

- **Acute hyperammonemia**: Activation of the NMDA receptor leads to excitotoxic cell death, changes in energy metabolism, and alterations in protein expression of the astrocyte. These changes affect volume regulation and contribute to edema. Neuropathological evaluation demonstrates alterations in astrocyte morphology. Imaging studies, particularly (1)H MRS, can reveal markers of impaired metabolism, such as elevations in glutamine and reduction of myoinositol.

- **Chronic hyperammonemia**: This condition leads to adaptive responses in the NMDA receptor and impairments in the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway, resulting in alterations in cognition and learning.

Therapy for acute hyperammonemia has traditionally relied on ammonia-lowering agents. However, in recent years, there has been considerable interest in neuroprotective strategies. Recent studies have suggested the restoration of learning abilities by pharmacological manipulation of brain cGMP with phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Both strategies present intriguing areas for potential exploration.

### Hyperammonemia in the ICU [^111rBMsE]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Patients experiencing acute elevations of ammonia present to the ICU with encephalopathy, which may progress quickly to cerebral herniation. Patient survival requires immediate treatment of intracerebral hypertension and the reduction of ammonia levels. When hyperammonemia is not thought to be the result of liver failure, treatment for an occult disorder of metabolism must begin prior to the confirmation of an etiology. This article reviews ammonia metabolism, the effects of ammonia on the brain, the causes of hyperammonemia, and the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in adult patients.

### Predictive value of arterial ammonia for complications and outcome in acute liver failure [^115qTjSR]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

In acute liver failure (ALF), the brain is exposed to high levels of ammonia. Human studies defining the clinical significance of ammonia in ALF are lacking. This prospective study evaluated the relationship of arterial ammonia levels at admission to complications and survival among patients with ALF.

- **Methods**: Eighty consecutive ALF patients admitted from March 2001 to December 2003 were followed up until death or complete recovery. All had arterial ammonia estimation at admission using the enzymatic method. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of mortality.

- **Results**: Forty-two (52.5%) patients died. Non-survivors had significantly higher median ammonia levels than survivors (174.7 vs. 105.0 micromol/l; p ≥ 0.05). An arterial ammonia level of ≥ 124 micromol/l was found to predict mortality with 78.6% sensitivity and 76.3% specificity, and had 77.5% diagnostic accuracy. Patients with higher ammonia levels also developed more complications, including deeper encephalopathy (p = 0.055), cerebral edema (p = 0.020), and the need for ventilation (p ≥ 0.124 micromol/l). Oedema is scored as 0 (absent) or 1 (present).

### Inborn errors of metabolism with hyperammonemia: Urea cycle defects and related disorders [^112u1ANp]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on urea cycle disorders:

- **Definition**: UCDs are a group of rare inborn metabolic errors caused by deficiencies in enzymes or transporters of the urea cycle, leading to the accumulation of ammonia and other toxic metabolites in the body. These disorders include deficiencies of N-acetylglutamate synthase, carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1, ornithine transcarbamylase, arginosuccinate synthetase (citrullinemia type 1), argininosuccinate lyase (argininosuccinic aciduria), arginase, ornithine translocase (hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome), and citrin (citrullinemia type 2).

- **Pathophysiology**: The urea cycle is the primary pathway for converting excess nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, into urea for excretion. Deficiencies in specific enzymes or transporters disrupt this cycle, leading to the accumulation of ammonia (with a normal anion gap and normal blood glucose) and other metabolites (such as glutamine, alanine, and asparagine). Hyperammonemia disrupts potassium homeostasis and water transport in the brain, resulting in cytotoxic cerebral edema.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of UCDs in the US is estimated at 1 per 35,000 births.

- **Disease course**: Complete enzyme or transporter deficiencies typically present with severe hyperammonemia within the first week of life, causing symptoms such as vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, hypothermia, and coma. Partial deficiencies usually present later in life with milder symptoms, including protein aversion, food refusal, frequent vomiting, and poor appetite.

### A prospective, blinded assessment of ammonia testing demonstrates low utility among front-line clinicians [^113SEYzx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Although ammonia is essential to the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), its levels cannot diagnose HE, do not correlate with the grade of HE, and are plagued by technical challenges. Nevertheless, ammonia levels are routinely obtained in the evaluation of hospitalized patients. We have advocated for quality improvement to limit testing. However, data are lacking regarding the reasons for, context, and perceived value of ammonia testing among ordering clinicians. Additional data are needed to optimize a quality improvement intervention aiming to curb overuse.

### Buphenyl [^113y6T3v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A patient or carrier of these disorders should wear a Medic Alert tag stating the diagnosis. In the event that the patient experiences a sudden rapid accumulation of ammonia in the blood, which subsequently affects the brain and leads to unconsciousness, the doctor will be alerted to treat the disease properly.

Periodically, depending on the severity of a particular patient's urea cycle disorder, it will be necessary to perform blood tests. These tests include plasma ammonia and plasma amino acid levels, along with other routine blood tests to evaluate nutritional status.

Buphenyl is a drug that helps prevent the accumulation of ammonia in the blood. It aids the body in eliminating substances that produce ammonia. However, despite drug treatment, blood ammonia levels may elevate periodically, leading to episodes of altered brain function associated with these elevations. Patients with disease onset as newborns have a high incidence of mental retardation. Medical attention should be obtained as soon as signs appear.

In addition to taking Buphenyl, it is equally important to follow a prescribed diet. Given the variability in the severity of urea cycle disorders, each patient's diet should be custom-designed by a physician and a nutritionist. Since diet is crucial, it is recommended that the prescribed diet be discussed frequently to ensure compliance and effectiveness.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: Implications for trial design and clinical practice [^116dWwkj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Results**: We enrolled 64 CPs (age 59.8 ± 7.0 years, 58% male, MELD 8.43 ± 2.21) from three centers. All patients tolerated the protein load without any signs of HE or confusion during the postmeal period. The baseline fasted venous ammonia levels were 33.71 (SD 13.78; range 18–85) μmol/L, which increased to 37.71 (SD 13.86; range 17–80) and 39.82 (SD 15.20; range 17–96) μmol/L one and two hours postmeal, respectively. This represented a 12% and 18% increase relative to baseline (P < 0.001). Interindividual variability was 71% of the total variance (SD = 9.3 μmol/L), whereas intraindividual variability was 29% (SD = 5.9 μmol/L). These changes were independent of age and sex. The MELD score was correlated with ammonia levels at baseline and at all time points, with an 8% increase in ammonia levels for every point increase in the MELD score.

- **Figure 1**: In cirrhotic patients without previous overt hepatic encephalopathy, the changes in ammonia levels one and two hours following a 20 g standardized protein meal are presented. Individual data, median, and the 95% CI are shown, demonstrating significant increases over baseline at one- and two-hour time points.

### Low-value levels: Ammonia testing does not improve the outcomes of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^116kCx7i]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical diagnosis. However, many clinicians measure ammonia levels in hospitalized patients presenting with hepatic encephalopathy. In this editorial, we review the results of an important study by Haj and Rockey. The authors examined the management decisions affected by and outcomes associated with (i) ordering an ammonia level and (ii) knowing the ammonia level. They found that ammonia level determination did not impact clinical decision-making or patient outcomes. These persuasive data demonstrate the limited clinical utility of ammonia levels and highlight the need for testing stewardship to dissuade unnecessary use through educational efforts and decision supports.

### Emergency management of intoxication-type inherited metabolic disorders [^114cmn8S]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

If the ammonia level exceeds 250 μmol/L, transfer may be needed for extracorporeal blood purification. Pediatric consensus guidelines for this have recently been published. Peritoneal dialysis is much less effective and is only recommended if there are no alternatives. The method of extracorporeal blood purification will depend on what is available: continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration is preferred, but continuous veno-venous haemofiltration can also be used. Intermittent haemodialysis lowers ammonia concentrations faster, but it may cause haemodynamic problems in neonates, and there is often rebound hyperammonaemia necessitating multiple sessions. Over recent years, the equipment has improved, particularly for babies. The consensus guidelines recommend starting extracorporeal blood purification if the ammonia reaches 400 μmol/L, and at a lower level if it is rising fast or causing neurological impairment.

Two recent studies, however, found that practice does not improve the neurocognitive outcome in neonatal-onset urea cycle disorders and has little effect on mortality. Starting at a lower ammonia concentration has been suggested, maybe as low as 180 μmol/L. Adults develop cerebral oedema at lower ammonia levels, so extracorporeal blood purification is recommended at 200 μmol/L. Neuroprotection with therapeutic hypothermia has been undertaken during dialysis, but further randomized data are needed to establish whether the benefits outweigh the difficulties.

Sadly, outcomes are poor after severe hyperammonaemia, unless very brief, and it may be appropriate to…

### Laboratory evaluation of urea cycle disorders [^113isDid]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The urea cycle disorders (UCDs) represent a group of inherited metabolic diseases with hyperammonemia as the primary laboratory abnormality. Affected individuals may become comatose or die if not treated rapidly. Diagnosis of a UCD requires a high index of suspicion and judicious use of the laboratory. It is important to rule out other conditions causing hyperammonemia that may require different treatment. The astute clinician may suspect a specific UCD in the appropriate clinical setting, but only laboratory results can confirm a specific diagnosis. The importance of the laboratory in helping the clinician to differentiate among various causes of hyperammonemia, in confirming a specific UCD, in carrier testing, and in prenatal diagnostic testing is highlighted in this review.

### Datamining approaches for examining the low prevalence of N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency and understanding transcriptional regulation of urea cycle genes [^1133tido]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). High credibility.

Ammonia, which is toxic to the brain, is converted into non-toxic urea through a pathway of six enzymatically catalyzed steps known as the urea cycle. In this pathway, N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS, EC 2.3.1.1) catalyzes the formation of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) from glutamate and acetyl coenzyme A. NAGS deficiency (NAGSD) is the rarest of the urea cycle disorders, yet it is unique in that ureagenesis can be restored with the drug N-carbamylglutamate (NCG).

We investigated whether the rarity of NAGSD could be due to low sequence variation in the NAGS genomic region, high NAGS tolerance for amino acid replacements, and alternative sources of NAG and NCG in the body. We also evaluated whether the small genomic footprint of the NAGS catalytic domain might play a role. The small number of patients diagnosed with NAGSD could result from the absence of specific disease biomarkers and/or the short NAGS catalytic domain.

We screened for sequence variants in NAGS regulatory regions in patients suspected of having NAGSD and found a novel NAGS regulatory element in the first intron of the NAGS gene. We applied the same datamining approach to identify regulatory elements in the remaining urea cycle genes. In addition to the known promoters and enhancers of each gene, we identified several novel regulatory elements in their upstream regions and first introns. The identification of cis-regulatory elements of urea cycle genes and their associated transcription factors holds promise for uncovering shared mechanisms governing urea cycle gene expression and potentially leading to new insights.

### Unusual causes of hyperammonemia in the ED [^111U23Mi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Plasma ammonia measurement is a simple yet important screening in the ED for patients with unexplained stupor or delirium. Acute hyperammonemia is a medical emergency for which immediate steps must be taken to minimize permanent brain damage. Although the most common causes of hyperammonemia are severe abnormal liver function, the absence of liver disease in some cases has been observed. This brief report describes four hyperammonemia cases with normal liver function in the ED.

- **Causes**: On careful history and speculated examinations, ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC) deficiency, hematologic malignancy, and the side effects of valproic acid and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were considered.

- **Therapy**: Therapy was first aimed at correcting the hyperammonemia. Once a specific diagnosis was reached, protein restriction, essential amino acid supplementation, efficient chemotherapy, and valproic acid and 5-FU level discontinuance were instituted.

In this report, the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and diagnostic workup for various hyperammonemia causes are discussed. Every EP should understand that the clinical symptoms for hyperammonemia and prognosis are related to early diagnosis.

### Acute illness protocol for urea cycle disorders [^1163Fy4q]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are genetic disorders that disrupt enzyme activity, cellular transport, or energy production. They are individually rare but collectively have an incidence of 1:1000. Most patients with IEMs are followed by a physician with expertise in biochemical genetics (metabolism) but may present outside this setting. Since IEMs can present acutely with life-threatening crises requiring specific interventions, it is critical for the emergency physician, internist, and critical care physician, as well as the biochemical geneticist, to have information on the initial assessment and management of patients with these disorders. Appropriate early care can be lifesaving. This protocol is not designed to replace the expert consultation of a biochemical geneticist but rather to improve early care and increase the level of comfort of the acute care physician with the initial management of urea cycle disorders until specialty consultation is obtained.

### Adult onset urea cycle disorder in a patient with presumed hepatic encephalopathy [^111oDWpq]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Deficiency of any of the five enzymes in the urea cycle results in the accumulation of ammonia, leading to encephalopathy, which, if untreated, can be lethal and produce devastating neurologic sequelae in long-term survivors. We hereby present an interesting case that presented with hyperammonemia and encephalopathy; it was later found to have a urea cycle defect.

### Hyperammonemia syndrome in immunosuppressed individuals [^1139iQX1]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia syndrome is an increasingly recognized and often fatal condition that occurs in immunosuppressed individuals, most commonly lung transplant recipients. Growing evidence suggests hyperammonemia syndrome is associated with systemic infections caused by urease-producing organisms, namely Ureaplasma spp., an organism unable to grow with routine culturing techniques. This review will summarize the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of hyperammonemia syndrome, as well as diagnostic and management strategies once hyperammonemia syndrome is suspected.

- **Recent findings**: Hyperammonemia syndrome is being described with increasing frequency in the solid organ transplant population. Morbidity and mortality, even with treatment, is high once hyperammonemia syndrome occurs. Surveillance studies indicate the prevalence of lung donor colonization with Ureaplasma spp. is high, suggesting screening and treatment may be of benefit. Antibiotic resistance is common, and rapid diagnostics can facilitate appropriate antimicrobial therapy in the peri-transplant period.

- **Summary**: Hyperammonemia syndrome is most commonly seen in lung transplant recipients and has a high mortality rate once it occurs. Screening for Ureaplasma spp. should be considered in all lung transplant donors.

### Consensus guidelines for management of hyperammonaemia in paediatric patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy [^1154csmt]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

A high index of suspicion for hyperammonaemia is mandatory in paediatric patients of any age with suggestive clinical symptoms, given that almost all survivors have developmental disabilities that correlate with the number, severity, and duration of hyperammonaemic episodes. Prompt treatment with KRT and/or NKRT, the choice of which depends on the ammonia concentrations and presenting symptoms of the patient, is crucial.

The paediatric literature with regard to hyperammonaemia requiring KRT is limited. To our knowledge, a consensus recommendation including a literature review with expert guideline recommendations has not yet been published. More studies are needed to strengthen the recommendations presented in this article; these recommendations will be followed by an audit.

### Ammonia levels do not guide clinical management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy caused by cirrhosis [^114a9VtD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Ammonia appears to play a major role in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), but its role in guiding management is unclear. We aimed to understand the impact of ammonia levels on inpatient HE management, hypothesizing that patients with elevated ammonia levels would receive more aggressive lactulose therapy than patients with normal ammonia or no ammonia level drawn.

- **Methods**: We examined patients with cirrhosis older than 18 years admitted for management of HE from 2005 to 2015. We additionally used propensity matching to control for confounding by the severity of underlying disease. Patients with an ammonia level taken at the time of HE diagnosis were further separated into those with normal or elevated ammonia levels. The primary endpoint was the total lactulose (mL) amount (or dose) given in the first 48 hours of HE management.

- **Results**: One thousand two hundred two admissions with HE were identified. Ammonia levels were drawn in 551 (46%) patients; 328 patients (60%) had an abnormal ammonia level (> 72 μmol/L). There were no significant differences in the Child-Pugh score, MELD, or Charlson Comorbidity Index in those with and without ammonia levels drawn. The average total lactulose dose over 48 hours was 167 and 171 mL in the no ammonia vs. ammonia groups, respectively (P = 0.42). The average lactulose dose in patients with an elevated ammonia level was 161 mL, identical to the lactulose dose in patients with a normal ammonia level. There was no correlation between lactulose dose and ammonia level (R = 0.0026).

- **Discussion**: Inpatient management of hepatic encephalopathy does not appear to be guided by ammonia levels, as no significant differences were observed in lactulose dosing between different ammonia level groups.

### EASL clinical practical guidelines on the management of acute (fulminant) liver failure [^112Txfat]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute liver failure, and more specifically the management of hepatic encephalopathy, the EASL 2017 guidelines recommend considering invasive ICP monitoring in a highly selected subgroup of patients who have progressed to grade 3 or 4 coma. This should be considered for patients who are intubated and ventilated, and deemed at high risk of intracranial hypertension based on the presence of more than one of the following variables:

- **Young patients**: With hyperacute or acute presentations.

- **Ammonia level**: Greater than 150–200 µmol/L not dropping with initial treatment interventions such as RRT and fluids.

- **Renal impairment**: Presence of renal dysfunction.

- **Vasopressor support**: Requirement of vasopressor support exceeding 0.1 mcg/kg/min.

Regarding medical management for urea cycle disorders, specifically in relation to nitrogen scavengers, the NRN 2020 guidelines recommend administering nitrogen-scavenging agents, such as sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate, and urea cycle intermediates, such as L-arginine and L-citrulline, at the recommended doses:

- **IV sodium benzoate**: Maximum dose of 12 g daily; high-dose benzoate can be toxic and lethal within one hour.
	- **Body weight > 20 kg**: 5.5 g/m², given over 90 min as a bolus and then as maintenance over 24 hours.

- **IV sodium phenylacetate**:
	- **Body weight > 20 kg**: 5.5 g/m², given over 90 min as a bolus and then as maintenance over 24 hours.

- **IV sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate**:
	- **Body weight > 20 kg**: 5.5 g/m², given over 90–120 min as a bolus and then as maintenance over 24 hours.

- **IV L-arginine hydrochloride**:
	- **Weight > 20 kg**: 4 g/m² for ornithine transcarbamylase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiencies, and 12 g/m² for argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase deficiencies. Given over 90 min as a bolus and then as maintenance over 24 hours.

- **IV L-carnitine**: 50 mg/kg loading dose given over 90 min, then 100–300 mg/kg daily (not needed for urea cycle disorders but needed for organic aciduria).

### Consensus guidelines for management of hyperammonaemia in paediatric patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy [^115mhcCm]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Hyperammonaemia is defined as concentrations greater than 100 µmol/L (170 µg/dL) in neonates or 50 µmol/L (85 µg/dL) in term infants, children, and adolescents. Individual laboratory reference intervals vary, and some age dependency of ammonia levels is evident, with higher levels in premature neonates. Early onset hyperammonaemia presents in neonates within the first few days of life after they start to feed and can no longer rely on maternal (placental) transport to appropriately eliminate the accumulating ammonia. Symptoms in preterm neonates typically result from transient hyperammonaemia of the newborn, characterized by the absence of organic acidurias and normal activity of urea cycle enzymes. This subtype is usually associated with complete recovery, typically without needing treatment.

In hyperammonaemia, the acute rise in ammonia levels in the brain leads to increased levels of extracellular potassium and metabolism of ammonia to glutamine by astrocytes. These changes result in increased intracellular osmolality, cerebral oedema, and the release of inflammatory cytokines. High levels of extracellular potassium and glutamate released by astrocytes lead to neuronal damage. Elevated levels of glutamine, which is the end product of ammonia detoxification, are a key factor in both hepatic encephalopathy and ammonia-related neurotoxicity. Apart from hyperammonaemia, adverse effects on the nitric oxide pathway are also thought to lead to brain damage in patients with UCDs. The clinical abnormalities observed vary for each specific UCD, but most patients tend to have similar symptoms.

### Carbaglu [^111oX3HF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage for acute hyperammonemia due to PA or MMA**: Initiate Carbaglu for the treatment of acute hyperammonemia in patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of PA or MMA. The recommended dosage of Carbaglu for adult and pediatric patients with acute hyperammonemia due to PA or MMA is based on actual body weight: 150 mg/kg orally daily for patients less than or equal to 15 kg, and 3.3 g/m² orally daily for patients greater than 15 kg. Divide the daily dosage into two equal doses and round up to the nearest 50 mg (one-quarter of a Carbaglu tablet). Administer doses 12 hours apart. Continue Carbaglu treatment until the patient's ammonia level is less than 50 micromol/L and for a maximum duration of seven days. During acute hyperammonemic episodes, administer Carbaglu with other ammonia-lowering therapies, such as intravenous glucose, insulin, L-carnitine, protein restriction, and dialysis.

- **Dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment**: Adjust the recommended dosage in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. No dosage adjustment is warranted in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m²). The recommended dosage of Carbaglu in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment is outlined in the relevant section.

### Arterial ammonia and clinical risk factors for encephalopathy and intracranial hypertension in acute liver failure [^1177T9LH]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

High circulating ammonia concentrations are common in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) and are associated with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and intracranial hypertension (ICH). Other risk factors are poorly characterized. We evaluated the relation of the admission arterial ammonia concentration and other clinical variables with the development of HE and ICH. Arterial ammonia was measured on admission to the intensive care unit in 257 patients; 165 had ALF and severe HE, and there were three control groups: acute hepatic dysfunction without severe HE (n = 50), chronic liver disease (n = 33), and elective surgery (n = 9). Variables associated with ICH and HE were investigated with regression analysis. Ammonia was higher in ALF patients than controls. An independent risk factor for the development of severe HE and ICH, a level greater than 100 mumol/L predicted the onset of severe HE with 70% accuracy. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was also independently predictive of HE, and its combination with ammonia increased specificity and accuracy. ICH developed in 55% of ALF patients with a level greater than 200 mumol/L, although this threshold failed to identify most cases. After admission, ammonia levels remained high in those developing ICH and fell in those who did not. Youth, a requirement for vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy were additional independent risk factors.

Ammonia is an independent risk factor for the development of both HE and ICH. Additional MELD scoring improved the prediction of HE.

### Hyperammonemia in the pediatric emergency department [^116Mt2Ct]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia is a serious clinical condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the pediatric population, it is often caused by urea cycle disorders, acute liver failure, or other less common underlying etiologies. Children and teens with hyperammonemia can exhibit a broad range of clinical findings, including vomiting, respiratory distress, and changes in mental status. As ammonia levels worsen, this presentation can progress to respiratory failure, encephalopathy, cerebral edema, seizures, and death. Given the risk of neurologic damage, timely identification and management of hyperammonemia is critical and includes initial resuscitation, early consultation with subspecialists, and initiation of appropriate therapies. It is important for pediatric emergency medicine providers to understand the clinical findings, causes, diagnosis, and management of hyperammonemia because they play a key role in providing effective, multidisciplinary care to these patients.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for urea cycle disorders, particularly in dietary management, TEWG-UCD 2019 guidelines emphasize the recognition that deficiencies in energy and/or essential amino acids and other nutrients can lead to metabolic instability and morbidity. It is crucial to involve a specialist metabolic dietitian to balance nutritional requirements with metabolic stability, adhering to the FAO/WHO/UNU guidelines for protein and energy requirements.

### Brain MRS glutamine as a biomarker to guide therapy of hyperammonemic coma [^116fyZfP]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Acute idiopathic hyperammonemia in an adult patient is a life-threatening condition often resulting in a rapid progression to irreversible cerebral edema and death. While ammonia-scavenging therapies lower blood ammonia levels, clearance of waste nitrogen from the brain may be delayed. Therefore, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor cerebral glutamine levels, the major reservoir of ammonia, in a gastric bypass patient with hyperammonemic coma undergoing therapy with N-carbamoyl glutamate and the ammonia-scavenging agents, sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate. Improvement in mental status mirrored brain glutamine levels, as coma persisted for 48h after plasma ammonia normalized. We hypothesize that the slower clearance for brain glutamine levels accounts for the delay in improvement following initiation of treatment in cases of chronic hyperammonemia. We propose MRS to monitor brain glutamine as a noninvasive approach to be utilized for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring purposes in adult patients presenting with idiopathic hyperammonemia.

### Clinical impact of arterial ammonia levels in ICU patients with different liver diseases [^1148yWx5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Increased arterial ammonia levels are associated with high mortality in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). Data on the prognostic impact of arterial ammonia is lacking in hypoxic hepatitis (HH) and scarce in critically ill patients with cirrhosis.

- **Purpose**: In this study, arterial ammonia concentrations were measured daily in 72 patients with HH, 43 patients with ALF, 100 patients with liver cirrhosis, and 45 patients without evidence of liver disease. The results were compared among these four patient groups and between 28-day survivors and non-survivors overall and within each group.

- **Methods**: Overall 28-day mortality rates in patients with HH, ALF, and cirrhosis, and in the control group were 54%, 30%, 49%, and 27%, respectively. Peak arterial ammonia levels differed significantly between transplant-free 28-day survivors and non-survivors in the HH and ALF groups (p < 0.01 for both).

- **Results**: Multivariate regression analysis identified peak arterial ammonia concentrations as an independent predictor of 28-day mortality or liver transplantation in patients with HH and ALF, respectively (p < 0.01). No association was found between mortality and arterial ammonia in patients with liver cirrhosis or in the control group. Admission arterial ammonia levels were independently linked to hepatic encephalopathy grades 3/4 in patients with HH (p < 0.01), ALF (p < 0.05), and cirrhosis (p < 0.05), respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Elevated arterial ammonia levels indicate a poor prognosis in acute liver injury and are associated with advanced hepatic encephalopathy in HH, ALF, and cirrhosis.

### Clearance and production of ammonia quantified in humans by constant ammonia infusion - the effects of cirrhosis and ammonia-targeting treatments [^113Z19Hh]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Hyperammonaemia is a key pathological feature of liver disease and the primary driver of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, the relative roles of increased ammonia production and reduced clearance are poorly understood, as is the action of ammonia-targeting drugs for HE. We aimed to quantify whole-body ammonia metabolism in healthy persons and patients with cirrhosis and to validate our method by examining the effects of glycerol phenylbutyrate and lactulose + rifaximin treatment.

- **Methods**: Ten healthy men and ten male patients with cirrhosis were investigated by 90-minute constant ammonia infusion to achieve steady-state plasma ammonia. Whole-body ammonia clearance was calculated as infusion rate divided by steady-state concentration increase, and ammonia production was calculated as clearance multiplied by baseline ammonia concentration. Participants were re-investigated after the ammonia-targeting interventions.

- **Results**: In healthy persons, ammonia clearance was 3.5 (3.1–3.9) L/min and ammonia production was 49 (35–63) μmol/min. Phenylbutyrate increased clearance by 11% (4–19%, p = 0.009). In patients with cirrhosis, ammonia clearance was 20% lower at 2.7 (2.1–3.3) L/min (p = 0.02) and production was nearly threefold higher at 131 (102–159) μmol/min (p < 0.0001). Lactulose + rifaximin reduced production by 20% (2–37%, p = 0.03). The infusion was generally well-tolerated apart from in one hyperammonaemic patient, with cirrhosis and possible bleeding unrelated to the infusion, who developed clinical HE that reverted when infusion was discontinued.

### The Ongoing Debate of Serum Ammonia Levels in Cirrhosis: the Good, the bad, and the Ugly [^113inYyR]. The American journal of gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Serum ammonia testing in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has been long debated in the field of hepatology. Although central to the pathophysiology of HE, serum ammonia testing is fraught with complexities that can lead to challenges in laboratory collection and interpretation. Although there is some disagreement across guideline organizations regarding routine testing of ammonia in HE, all acknowledge that normal values, although possible in HE, may warrant reconsideration of the diagnosis. In this study, we propose a nuanced approach to ammonia testing in HE. Serum ammonia testing provides little additional benefit in clinical scenarios with a high or low pretest probability for HE. However, if the pretest probability for HE is uncertain, a low ammonia level may reduce the posttest probability of HE. In this scenario, other etiologies of altered mental status should be explored. Future research should focus on developing a standardized approach to serum ammonia collection, processing, and interpretation.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: Implications for trial design and clinical practice [^1162NBSW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Ammonia levels are used to assess hepatic encephalopathy, but their levels are highly variable in clinical practice.

- **Methods**: We studied factors associated with variation in ammonia values in cirrhotic patients without previous hepatic encephalopathy and healthy volunteers (HVs).

- **Results**: Ammonia increased by 12% and 18% at 1 and 2 hours, respectively, following a protein meal in 64 cirrhotic patients (P < 0.001). In 237 HVs, ammonia levels varied significantly between sites (P < 0.0001). New site-specific ammonia upper limits, based on HV levels using a strict analysis protocol, differed from routinely used values. Correlation between paired fresh samples was high (r = 0.83), but modest between fresh and frozen samples (r = 0.62).

- **Discussion**: Sample handling, processing, and protein intake impact ammonia levels across sites.
