## Question

How do you manage staph epi catheter related sepsis? Can I keep the catheter in place?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a catheter infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis can be kept in place and how to manage catheter-related sepsis, including when to remove the catheter and how to treat the infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathogen and its biofilm biology. Then, I should verify the clinical context and severity, including hemodynamics and local signs. Next, I will review guideline-based indications for catheter removal versus salvage. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach to confirm true infection and exclude contamination. Then, I will outline empiric and targeted antimicrobial therapy, including antibiotic lock. Finally, I should define monitoring, response criteria, and follow-up, and close with a concise decision algorithm and caveats for special populations like hemodialysis or oncology patients.

> Let me first confirm the pathogen profile. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus and a prototypical biofilm former on intravascular devices; its virulence is low compared with Staphylococcus aureus, but eradication is hindered by biofilm, which is why management differs from more virulent organisms and why catheter salvage is often feasible if carefully selected and monitored [^114jCA7r] [^112s7vrU] [^112poThM].

> I need to check the clinical context next. Uncomplicated S. epidermidis CRBSI in a hemodynamically stable patient without septic shock, tunnel infection, or evidence of metastatic complications is the scenario in which catheter salvage is most reasonable; conversely, instability, persistent bacteremia, tunnel involvement, or endovascular complications push toward removal rather than retention [^114juEik] [^114rXWhc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about keeping the line; I should confirm guideline direction. The IDSA allows attempting catheter salvage with systemic antibiotics plus antimicrobial lock therapy for uncomplicated CRBSI due to less virulent organisms in long-term catheters when removal is undesirable, while recommending removal for severe sepsis, suppurative thrombophlebitis, endocarditis, persistent bacteremia beyond 72 hours, or infections due to S. aureus, Pseudomonas, fungi, or mycobacteria; S. epidermidis is not in the mandatory-removal list, so salvage is acceptable if criteria are met [^112zf4ii] [^114juEik]. KDOQI similarly supports attempting salvage for coagulase-negative staphylococci with guidewire exchange considered in some cases, while mandating removal for S. aureus, Pseudomonas, fungi, or tunnel infection, which aligns with a retention strategy for S. epidermidis when uncomplicated [^11551unb] [^112vT8nq]. Oncology guidance likewise supports attempting salvage of tunneled devices in CoNS infections without complications, reinforcing the same principle [^117WRVEv].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic steps before committing to salvage. I should obtain paired blood cultures from the catheter and a peripheral vein before starting antibiotics when feasible, and if the catheter is removed, send the tip for culture; if the catheter remains, consider differential time to positivity or paired quantitative cultures to support a catheter source, while recognizing that clinical correlation is essential to distinguish contamination from true infection [^115hSWHH] [^116uVkH6] [^1179H637]. I should double-check that at least two sets are positive for the same CoNS organism with clinical features of infection before labeling this a true CRBSI, given the frequency of skin contaminants [^114krLJQ].

> Next, I should review empiric therapy and then de-escalation. Initially, I thought vancomycin alone would suffice empirically, but wait, I need to ensure I am not missing methicillin resistance patterns; many CoNS are methicillin-resistant, so vancomycin is a reasonable empiric choice while cultures are pending, with de-escalation to a beta-lactam such as cefazolin if the isolate is methicillin-susceptible and local susceptibility supports it, typically for a total of 10–14 days for uncomplicated cases when the catheter is retained [^113ggbjb] [^117WRVEv]. If the patient is critically ill or there is concern for other pathogens, broader empiric coverage may be warranted initially, but I should narrow promptly once CoNS is confirmed and no complications are present [^113L5Ma6].

> I will now examine the role of antimicrobial lock therapy. For catheter salvage in CoNS CRBSI, adding an antibiotic lock to systemic therapy improves eradication of intraluminal biofilm; typical agents include vancomycin, daptomycin, or taurolidine-based locks, with dwell times tailored to institutional protocols, and the combination of systemic plus lock therapy yields higher salvage rates than systemic therapy alone in observational syntheses and aligns with IDSA's salvage recommendation for long-term catheters infected with less virulent organisms [^111D8jyE] [^113qcQS1] [^116rw3Q2] [^113vFv44]. Let me reconsider duration; most protocols use 10–14 days of lock therapy alongside systemic antibiotics, with some contemporary series using shorter daptomycin lock courses combined with taurolidine with reported high success, though data are limited and should be interpreted cautiously [^1173VR4w] [^113vFv44].

> But wait, what if the patient deteriorates or the bacteremia persists; I need to ensure clear stop criteria. If there is hemodynamic instability, persistent bacteremia beyond 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy, development of a tunnel infection, suppurative thrombophlebitis, or clinical concern for endocarditis or metastatic infection, the catheter should be removed promptly rather than continuing salvage attempts, consistent with IDSA and KDOQI guidance [^114juEik] [^112vT8nq]. I should confirm that follow-up blood cultures are obtained to document clearance before completing therapy and that any signs of local infection along the tunnel prompt removal irrespective of pathogen [^112vT8nq].

> Let me think about special populations where access preservation is critical. In hemodialysis patients, KDOQI supports attempting salvage for CoNS with systemic therapy and lock, and allows guidewire exchange in selected cases; however, I should verify that there is no tunnel infection and that the patient is clinically stable before choosing retention or exchange strategies [^11551unb] [^112vT8nq]. In oncology or home parenteral nutrition patients, device salvage is commonly attempted for CoNS given limited venous access, with systemic therapy plus lock showing favorable salvage rates in systematic reviews, again contingent on absence of complications [^117WRVEv] [^113qcQS1].

> I should double-check recurrence risk and outcomes. Recurrence after CoNS CRBSI managed with catheter removal is uncommon, and when catheters are retained with appropriate therapy, success rates are generally high, though vigilance for relapse is necessary and should trigger reassessment of the device and source control if positive cultures recur [^111DDQ8n] [^113qcQS1]. If relapse occurs with the same strain, that strengthens the case for device removal or exchange rather than repeated salvage attempts [^115w3PJi].

> Next, I should review a practical decision pathway. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, has no tunnel infection, and the diagnosis of S. epidermidis CRBSI is supported by paired cultures, I would retain the catheter, start systemic antibiotics with MRSA coverage and then de-escalate to a beta-lactam if susceptible, and add antimicrobial lock therapy for 10–14 days, obtaining repeat blood cultures at 48–72 hours to ensure clearance. If the patient is unstable, has a tunnel infection, or bacteremia persists beyond 72 hours, I would remove or exchange the catheter and extend therapy based on complications and clinical response [^112zf4ii] [^114juEik] [^117WRVEv].

> In summary, yes — catheter retention is acceptable for Staphylococcus epidermidis CRBSI when the infection is uncomplicated, the patient is stable, and there is no tunnel infection, provided you use appropriate systemic therapy plus antimicrobial lock, monitor closely for clearance and complications, and have a low threshold to remove the device if response is suboptimal or complications arise [^112zf4ii] [^114juEik] [^117WRVEv].

In general, **catheter removal is not mandatory** for Staphylococcus epidermidis catheter-related sepsis; catheter salvage is acceptable in stable patients with uncomplicated infection [^112zf4ii]. Retain the catheter only if the patient is hemodynamically stable, there is no tunnel or pocket infection, and bacteremia clears within 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy [^112vT8nq]. Use **systemic antibiotics plus antibiotic lock therapy** for 10–14 days [^111D8jyE] [^117WRVEv], and remove the catheter if there is clinical deterioration, persistent bacteremia, or complications [^114rXWhc]. Catheter removal is indicated for S. aureus, Pseudomonas, fungi, mycobacteria, or when the patient is unstable or has a tunnel infection [^114juEik] [^112vT8nq].

---

## Indications for catheter removal

According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, **catheter removal is indicated** in the following scenarios:

- **Severe sepsis or septic shock**: Hemodynamic instability or organ dysfunction [^114juEik] [^114rXWhc].

- **Persistent bacteremia**: Positive blood cultures after 48–72 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy [^112vT8nq].

- **Complicated infections**: Suppurative thrombophlebitis, endocarditis, or metastatic infections [^114juEik].

- **High-virulence pathogens**: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fungi, or mycobacteria [^114juEik] [^112vT8nq].

- **Tunnel or pocket infection**: Localized infection at the catheter site [^112vT8nq].

In the absence of these factors, **catheter salvage may be attempted** in clinically stable patients with uncomplicated S. epidermidis infections [^112zf4ii].

---

## Catheter salvage strategies

When catheter salvage is attempted, the following strategies are recommended:

- **Systemic antibiotic therapy**: Administer appropriate antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity results [^114usXLr].

- **Antibiotic lock therapy (ALT)**: Instill high-concentration antibiotic solutions into the catheter lumen to eradicate biofilm-associated bacteria [^111D8jyE] [^116rw3Q2].

- **Close monitoring**: Regularly assess clinical status, repeat blood cultures, and monitor for signs of persistent infection or complications [^114jCA7r].

---

## Clinical outcomes of catheter salvage

Several studies have evaluated the **clinical outcomes** of catheter salvage in S. epidermidis infections:

- **Success rates**: Catheter salvage is successful in approximately 56–75% of cases, depending on patient factors and infection severity [^114zCRRq] [^114jCA7r].

- **Recurrence**: Recurrent infections are common, occurring in approximately 20–30% of cases, often due to persistent biofilm formation [^116rw3Q2].

- **Complications**: Persistent bacteremia, metastatic infections, and device malfunction are potential complications of catheter salvage [^1173VR4w].

---

## Risks and benefits of catheter retention

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Avoids surgical removal and reinsertion procedures | Persistent or recurrent infection |
| Maintains vascular access for ongoing therapy | Potential for metastatic complications |
| Reduces patient discomfort and healthcare costs | Device malfunction or thrombosis |

---

## Recommended antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should include **vancomycin** or **linezolid** to cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), with de-escalation based on culture and sensitivity results. Treatment duration is typically **10–14 days** for uncomplicated infections, with longer courses (4–6 weeks) if complications such as endocarditis or osteomyelitis are present [^1173VR4w] [^116CgUVU] [^113r1wAa].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

IDSA guidelines recommend attempting catheter salvage in clinically stable patients with uncomplicated S. epidermidis infections, using systemic antibiotics and antibiotic lock therapy [^112zf4ii]. KDOQI guidelines similarly support catheter salvage in stable hemodialysis patients with S. epidermidis infections, emphasizing close monitoring and prompt removal if complications arise [^11551unb].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Catheter removal is **not mandatory** for Staphylococcus epidermidis catheter-related sepsis. Catheter salvage is acceptable in clinically stable patients with uncomplicated infections, using systemic antibiotics and antibiotic lock therapy. Catheter removal is indicated for persistent bacteremia, hemodynamic instability, tunnel or pocket infection, or infection with high-virulence pathogens. Close monitoring and adherence to clinical guidelines are essential for successful management.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for catheter-related bloodstream infection, more specifically with respect to catheter removal, IDSA 2009 guidelines recommend to attempt treatment without catheter removal by administering both systemic and antimicrobial lock therapy in patients with uncomplicated CRBI involving long-term catheters due to pathogens other than S. aureus, Pseudomona aeruginosa, Bacillus species, Micrococcus species, Propionibacteria, fungi, or mycobacteria, because of the limited access sites in many patients requiring long-term intravascular access for survival (such as patients undergoing hemodialysis or with short-gut syndrome).

### Selection of empiric therapy in patients with catheter-related infections [^113ggbjb]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Catheter-related infections (CRI) are frequent and manifest in a wide range of clinical situations. A rational approach is necessary for the adequate management of these infections. Whenever a CRI is suspected, two main questions have to be addressed: whether to remove the catheter and whether to initiate empiric antimicrobial treatment. As the clinical diagnosis of CRI has a low specificity, the catheter should be removed only in circumstances such as severe or ongoing sepsis, persistent bacteremia, pulmonary or peripheral embolization, endocarditis, signs of tunnel infection, when the catheters or when the CRI is caused by fungi, Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa are easy to replace among others. Exchanging the catheter through a guidewire is a frequent practice but is not recommended by some authors. Empiric antimicrobial treatment should be administered in any of the following situations: when the catheter is not removed, in the case of central venous or surgically implanted catheters and prosthetic implants, in the presence of severe sepsis, neutropenia or other immunodepressed status, suppurative phlebitis, embolization and acute endocarditis. Empriic antimicrobial treatment should include a glycopeptide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) as staphylococci are the most frequent cause of CRI. Adding an antipseudomonal agent, such as amikacin, aztreonam, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, or a carbapenem (depending on the local antimicrobial susceptibility data or antibiotic policy) is necessary in cases of neutropenia, burn patients, severe sepsis, or suspicion of contaminated infusate. Empiric treatment against Candida is not initially necessary in most cases. Empiric treatment should be replaced by specific therapy whenever possible.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^112s7vrU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy for catheter-related infection is often initiated empirically. The initial choice of antibiotics will depend on the severity of the patient's clinical disease, the risk factors for infection, and the likely pathogens associated with the specific intravascular device. Resistance to antibiotic therapy due to biofilm formation also has an important role in the management of bacteremia. In fact, the nature of the biofilm structure makes microorganisms difficult to eradicate and confer an inherent resistance to antibiotics.

CRBSIs can be reduced by a range of interventions including closed infusion systems, aseptic technique during insertion and management of the central venous line, early removal of central venous lines, and appropriate site selection. Different measures have been implemented to reduce the risk for CRBSI, including the use of maximal barrier, precautions during catheter insertion, effective cutaneous anti-sepsis, and preventive strategies based on inhibiting microorganisms originating from the skin or catheter hub from adhering to the catheter. The simultaneous application of multiple recommended best practices to manage CVCs has been associated with significant declines in the rates of CRBSI. Bundles can be defined as the systematic implementation of a set of evidence-based practices, usually three to five, that when performed properly and collectively can improve patient outcomes. Research on CRBSI prevention demonstrated the effectiveness of bundles, which reduce the incidence of CRBSI by up to 80%, reaching a rate of 0 in some cases. Education and training of healthcare workers and adherence to standardized protocols for insertion and maintenance of intravascular catheters significantly reduced the incidence of catheter-related infections and represent the most important preventive measures.

### The spectrum of infections in catheter-dependent hemodialysis patients [^115q79fx]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Catheter-dependent hemodialysis patients may develop access-related and nonaccess-related infections that may be managed in the outpatient arena or in the hospital. The goal of this study was to quantify infections in such patients, to characterize their clinical presentations, and to evaluate factors determining need for hospitalization.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We collected prospective data on the clinical management of catheter-dependent hemodialysis patients with suspected infection at a large dialysis center. We documented the presenting symptoms, type of infection, pathogen, and whether hospitalization occurred.

Results

An infection was suspected in 305 separate cases and confirmed in 88%. The 268 diagnosed infections included catheter-related bacteremia (69%), another access-related infection (19%), and nonaccess-related infection (12%). The overall frequency of infection was 4.62 per 1000 catheter-days. Hospitalization occurred in 37% of all infections, but it varied greatly (72% for nonaccess-related infection, 34% for catheter-related bacteremia, and 4% for exit-site infection). Among patients with catheter-related bacteremia, the likelihood of hospitalization varied by pathogen, being 53% for Staphylococcus aureus, 30% for Enterococcus, 23% for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 17% for gram-negative rods (P < 0.001). The likelihood of hospitalization was not associated with age, gender, or diabetes. Fever was a presenting symptom in only 47% of cases of catheter-related bacteremia.

Conclusions

Catheter-dependent patients have a high burden of infection. It is important to evaluate patients with suspected infection for various access-related and nonaccess-related infections. A low threshold is indicated for suspecting catheter-related bacteremia because the patients frequently present without fever.

### From prevention to treatment: comprehensive strategies for the management of Staphylococcus aureus induced catheter-related bloodstream infections [^116Tq7cj]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a prominent pathogen that frequently causes catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in hemodialysis patients with tunneled central lines. The guidelines' key recommendation for managing SA-induced CRBSIs is to remove the infected catheter. In real life, however, this may be hindered by logistical or clinical problems (e.g. unavailability of surgical rooms, incarcerated catheters, catheter-associated thrombosis). Furthermore, an interventional approach may expose patients to complications, such as those related to the procedure itself or the development of central vein stenoses. Prospective observational studies seem to support the possibility of preserving the infected line in case of early pathogen identification and CRBSI management with empirical large-spectrum antibiotics, followed by targeted treatment once the antibiogram is available. Further options for the treatment and prevention of SA-induced infections are becoming available, leading to a rapidly evolving therapeutic scenario. This review aims to perform a multidisciplinary revision of the available evidence and current unsolved problems, focusing on future perspectives for the management and prevention of SA-induced CRBSIs in hemodialysis patients.

### Intravascular catheter-related infections: advances in diagnosis, prevention, and management [^1179H637]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Indwelling vascular catheters are a leading source of bloodstream infections in critically ill patients and cancer patients. Because clinical diagnostic criteria are either insensitive or non-specific, such infections are often overdiagnosed, resulting in unnecessary and wasteful removal of the catheter. Catheter-sparing diagnostic methods, such as differential quantitative blood cultures and time to positivity have emerged as reliable diagnostic techniques. Novel preventive strategies include cutaneous antisepsis, maximum sterile barrier, use of antimicrobial catheters, and antimicrobial catheter lock solution. Management of catheter-related bloodstream infections involves deciding on catheter removal, antimicrobial catheter lock solution, and the type and duration of systemic antimicrobial therapy. Such decisions depend on the identity of the organism causing the bloodstream infection, the clinical and radiographical manifestations suggesting a complicated course, the underlying condition of the host (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), and the availability of other vascular access sites.

### Hub qualitative blood culture is useful for diagnosis of catheter-related infections in critically ill patients [^113d1SxR]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess clinical safety and accuracy of qualitative blood culture drawn through the hub for ruling out catheter-related infection (CRI).

Design and Setting

Prospective observational study in a surgical intensive care unit.

Patients

All patients with sepsis of unknown origin and possibly due to a CRI.

Interventions

Blood culture drawn through a central venous catheter (CVC) just before the catheter was cultured.

Measurements and Results

In 126 patients we investigated 135 cases of sepsis of unknown origin. Using a clinical and bacteriological approach as the reference, the performance of the CVC blood culture was evaluated by the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. When CVC blood culture was positive, the time to positivity was considered. Using standard definitions, seven CRIs were diagnosed. CVC blood culture identified five CRIs including the three episodes of catheter-related bacteremia. The method missed two coagulase-negative staphylococcus CRIs without bacteremia. Thirteen false-positive results occurred, including seven bacteremias from a distant source. The CVC blood culture had a sensitivity of 71% (CI 30–95%), specificity of 90% (CI 83–94%), negative predictive value of 98% (CI 93–100%), and positive predictive value of 28% (CI 11–54%). In cases of catheter-related bacteremia the time to positivity of CVC blood culture was 24 h or less.

Conclusions

Negative CVC blood culture at 24 h seems useful for management of CVC in selected critically ill surgical patients developing a clinical sepsis. The subsequent risk of catheter-related bacteremia cannot be excluded advocating for an uninterrupted clinical and bacteriological survey.

### Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections: recommendations relevant to interventional radiology for venous catheter placement and maintenance [^112kkxgm]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis exit-site antiseptic ointments — trial data and availability indicate that three randomized controlled trials have evaluated the use of 10% povidone-iodine with a significant decrease in colonization, exit-site infection, or BSI, and benefit most prominent in subjects with nasal colonization by S. aureus; in the only study demonstrating a significant effect on mortality, bacitracin/gramicidin/polymyxin B ointment at the catheter insertion site was compared with placebo in 169 patients receiving hemodialysis, there is evidence from this study that the ointment can improve outcome, but gramicidin-containing ointment is not currently available in the United States and no similar data exist for other patient populations.

Infection source control — principles and timing in suspected sepsis state that we support early identification of infections requiring source control, and we recommend early consultation and procedural intervention to control infection sources, and no specific timing threshold for achieving source control currently exists. When infections are suspected that have an easily removable source (eg, indwelling vascular access catheter, soft tissue abscess), early action is appropriate, and source control should not delay the initiation of resuscitation or antibiotics; resuscitation and source control often need to occur concurrently.

### AABIP evidence-informed guidelines and expert panel report for the management of indwelling pleural catheters [^117X55Nh]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2020). High credibility.

Indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) skin and tunnel infections — clinical features, organisms, and management are described as follows: Cellulitis is characterized by redness, warmth, edema, and mild pain of the skin and immediate subcutaneous tissue, exit-site infections are defined as purulent drainage at the catheter-epidermal interface, and tunnel tract infections are defined as erythema, edema, induration and tenderness along the catheter tract, > 2 cm proximal from the exit site; some also advocate using ultrasound to demonstrate a fluid collection along the catheter tract surrounding the cuff as additional diagnostic support. The appropriate management of IPC-related soft tissue infections has not been studied and recommendations are based on indirect evidence and expert opinion; the microbiology of cutaneous infections associated with IPCs has not been well characterized, but within peritoneal dialysis catheter literature the most common organisms include Corynebacterium species and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In peritoneal dialysis catheter patients, oral antibiotics covering S. aureus species are typically sufficient, whereas patients with a history of pseudomonas infections or methicillin-resistant S. aureus might require more broad coverage; antibiotics alone are typically sufficient for these infections, though progression may warrant catheter removal, and in a review of 448 IPCs for malignant pleural effusions 14 localized skin infections were identified of which only 2 required catheter removal.

### Evaluation and treatment of neonates with suspected late-onset sepsis: a survey of neonatologists' practices [^112Dzt8j]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To ascertain current diagnostic and treatment practices for suspected late-onset sepsis in infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and identify areas that may benefit from clinical practice guidelines.

Methods

During June 2000, we conducted a multicenter survey of neonatologists and infection control professionals regarding practices related to late-onset sepsis in NICUs at children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Prevention Network.

Results

Personnel at 35 hospitals with NICUs completed surveys; 34 were infection control professionals, and 278 were neonatology clinicians, primarily attending neonatologists or neonatology fellows. At these facilities, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were the most frequent blood culture isolate from infants with late-onset sepsis accounting for 54% of bloodstream infections. When late-onset sepsis was suspected, 83% of clinicians drew only 1 blood culture when no central venous catheter was present or when a central vascular was present with no blood return. Thirty-two percent obtained 1 or more C-reactive protein concentration determinations. Sixty percent of clinicians prescribed a vancomycin-containing regimen for a 900 g, 3-week-old infant with suspected late-onset sepsis. The presence of a central venous catheter or shock increased empiric vancomycin use. The presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the NICU did not increase vancomycin use, but a vancomycin restriction policy decreased empiric vancomycin use. Clinicians at an individual NICU tended to have similar empiric antibiotic-prescribing practices: in 29 (83%) of 35 centers ≥ 75% of respondents had similar practice with regard to prescribing a vancomycin-containing regimen for empiric therapy. Forty-seven percent to 85% completed a full course of antimicrobials when a single blood culture was obtained and grew CoNS, but a significantly lower percentage of respondents (22%-47%) completed a full course when 1 of 2 blood cultures obtained grew CoNS. Eleven percent of respondents removed an umbilical catheter at the time of suspected sepsis, but fewer than 5% removed a nonumbilical central venous catheter for suspected sepsis. Most (≥ 61%) retained a nonumbilical catheter despite documentation of CoNS bacteremia.

Conclusions

Neonatologists varied in management of suspected late-onset sepsis, particularly that caused by CoNS. Procedures to prevent CoNS-positive blood cultures and to differentiate CoNS contaminants from pathogens are needed. For safely decreasing vancomycin use in NICUs, clinical practice guidelines should be developed, implemented, and evaluated. The guidelines should include optimal skin antisepsis and catheter disinfection before obtaining blood for culture, obtaining 2 blood cultures and using adjunctive tests and information to help differentiate contaminants from pathogens, and restriction on empiric vancomycin use.

### What is the predominant source of intravascular catheter infections? [^115XUNU6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The predominant source of intravascular catheter-related bloodstream infections has been a research and clinical question for more than 30 years. During that time, we've moved from the position of a single source predominating in all clinical scenarios to a more realistic appraisal that both skin at the insertion site and the catheter hub/connector (ie, an extraluminal and an intraluminal source of infection, respectively) are important and that maximally effective prevention programs must address both sources of infection.

### Complications of hemodialysis catheter bloodstream infections: impact of infecting organism [^112poThM]. American Journal of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Catheter-related bloodstream infections -(CRBSI) are associated with a high burden of morbidity and mortality, but the impact of infecting organism on clinical outcomes has been poorly studied.

Methods

This retrospective analysis of a prospective vascular access database from a large academic dialysis center investigated whether the organism type affected the clinical presentation or complications of CRBSI.

Results

Among 339 patients with suspected CRBSI, an alternate source of infection was identified in 50 (15%). Of 289 patients with CRBSI, 249 grew a single organism and 40 were polymicrobial. Fever and/or rigors were presenting signs in ≥ 90% of patients with Staphylococcus aureus or Gram-negative CRBSI, but only 61% of Staphylococcus epidermidis infections (p < 0.001). Hospitalization occurred in 67% of patients with S. aureus CRBSI versus 34% of those with S. epidermidis and 40% of those with a Gram-negative bacteria (p < 0.001). Admission to the intensive care unit was required in 14, 9, and 2% (p = 0.06); metastatic infection occurred in 10, 4, and 4% (p = 0.42); and median length of stay among patients admitted to the hospital was 4, 4, and 5.5 days (p = 0.60), respectively. Death due to CRBSI occurred in only 1% of patients with CRBSI.

Conclusion

CRBSI is confirmed in 85% of catheter-dependent hemodialysis patients in whom it is suspected. S. epidermidis CRBSI tends to present with atypical symptoms. S. aureus CRBSI is more likely to require hospitalization or intensive care admission. Metastatic infection is relatively uncommon, and death due to CRBSI is rare.

### Validation of the proposed definition for complicated coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia [^115d9Yew]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are a frequent cause of bacteremia, particularly in hospitalized patients with catheters and indwelling devices. However, because they are common skin commensals, CoNS are often isolated from blood cultures, with most cases representing contamination rather than true infection.

Because of CoNS' low virulence and association with catheter-related infections, the bacteremia's 30-day mortality is lower than that of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. However, studies investigating predictors of mortality in CoNS bacteremia are scarce. Factors previously associated with increased mortality include advanced age, severity of infection, comorbidities, inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, and lack of source control interventions.

Most CoNS infections are catheter-related, and guidelines recommend catheter removal as an essential source control measure. In cases where the catheter is removed and there is no evidence of metastatic infection, septic thrombophlebitis, or infective endocarditis, a short course of antimicrobial treatment (3–5 days) is sufficient. Some studies even suggest that catheter removal alone, without additional antimicrobial therapy, may be a safe approach, underscoring the importance of this intervention. For patients with retained long-term catheters, a prolonged course of antimicrobial treatment (10–14 days) combined with antibiotic lock therapy is recommended to achieve effective source control through high-concentration local antibiotic administration.

Unlike S. aureus bacteremia, there is no widely accepted definition of complicated disease for bacteremia caused by other species, including CoNS. Recently, Varisco et al proposed a definition of complicated CoNS bacteremia, modeled on the Infectious Diseases Society of America's criteria for complicated S. aureus bacteremia. The proposed definition includes 6 criteria: persistent fever or persistent bacteremia lasting ≥ 72 hours after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy, presence of implanted devices, metastatic complications, infective endocarditis, and, in catheter-related infections, failure to remove the catheter within 48 hours of bacteremia onset. Varisco et al found that approximately half of the patients met the criteria for complicated CoNS bacteremia and that these patients had higher mortality compared to those with uncomplicated bacteremia (22% vs 12%, P = 0.004).

This study aims to identify predictors of mortality in patients with CoNS bacteremia and evaluate the proposed definition of CoNS complicated bacteremia.

### Development and validation of a multivariable prediction model of central venous catheter-tip colonization in a cohort of five randomized trials [^114zvDHQ]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central venous catheters (CVC), namely CVCs used to administer drugs and catheters used to deliver renal-replacement therapies (DC), are essential in the care of critically ill patients. In Europe in 2017, CVC use was 70.1 per 100 patient-days. Up to two thirds of patients admitted in Intensive Care Units (ICU) are exposed to at least one CVC.

Unfortunately, their routine use is responsible for serious complications. Among these, the most life threatening is catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). Although its incidence is decreasing over time with a current rate of 0.2 to 5/1000 catheters-days, CRBSI is associated with mortality, prolonged ICU stays and higher hospitals costs. While guidelines exist for the diagnosis and management, the strict definition of CRBSI relies on catheter-tip culture after catheter removal, or blood cultures, which may delay the diagnosis. When a CRBSI occurs, urgent removal of the CVC is the cornerstone of the management strategy. Obtaining positive blood cultures may be difficult under broad-spectrum antibiotics, which led to the catheter-related infection (CRI) definition (non-bacteremic clinical sepsis plus catheter-tip colonization or CRBSI). There is no consensus on how to define and act on suspected CRI, a very frequent situation in the ICU.

### Staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters: is over-the-wire exchange an appropriate management option? [^1167w7DV]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Over-the-wire exchange of tunneled dialysis catheters is the standard of care per K/DOQI guidelines for treating catheter-related bacteremia. However, Gram-positive bacteremia, specifically with staphylococcus species, may compromise over-the-wire exchange due to certain biological properties. This study addressed the effectiveness of over-the-wire exchange of staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters compared with non-staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters.

Methods

Patients who received over-the-wire exchange of their tunneled dialysis catheter due to documented or suspected bacteremia were identified from a QA database. Study patients (n = 61) had positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or coagulase-negative staphylococcus not otherwise specified. Control patients (n = 35) received over-the-wire exchange of their tunneled dialysis catheter due to infection with any organism besides staphylococcus. Overall catheter survival and catheter survival among staphylococcal species were assessed.

Results

There was no difference in tunneled dialysis catheter survival between study and control groups (P = 0.46). Median survival time was 96 days for study catheters and 51 days for controls; survival curves were closely superimposed. There also was no difference among the three staphylococcal groups in terms of catheter survival (P = 0.31). The median time until catheter removal was 143 days for SE, 67 days for CNS, and 88 days for SA-infected catheters.

Conclusions

There is no significant difference in tunneled dialysis catheter survival between over-the-wire exchange of staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters and those infected with other organisms.

"Several situations necessitate the latter option of immediate CVC removal with delayed CVC placement", including "Clinically and hemodynamically unstable patients", "Persistent bacteremia 48 to 72 hours after initiating antibiotics", "Infections due to S aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fungi, or mycobacteria", and "Presence of a tunnel-site infection". The page also notes, "In uncuffed, temporary CVC, CRBSI due to Gram-negative bacilli, S aureus, enterococci, fungi, and mycobacteria warrant CVC removal", and that at removal, evaluation and disruption of a "fibrin sheath" can be performed.

Despite recent gains, intravascular catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) remains an important clinical problem resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, and excess economic cost. Successful prevention of CRBSI requires careful attention to insertion and maintenance protocols as well as judicious application of innovative technologic advancements. Appropriate treatment of CRBSI depends on a well-considered diagnosis, correct antimicrobial choice, removal of the offending device in many circumstances, and careful patient selection and application of antimicrobial lock therapy in patients in whom catheter salvage is attempted.

### Antibiotic locks for the treatment of catheter-related blood stream infection: still more hope than data [^116GT142]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic lock therapy (ALT), in conjunction with systemic antibiotics, is recommended by scientific societies as a treatment of uncomplicated catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in hemodynamically stable hemodialysis patients for whom catheter salvage is the goal. The rationale for this strategy is the eradication of intraluminal biofilms by the highly concentrated antibiotic used in the lock. However, the available evidence supporting this recommendation is scanty, and only includes small, short-term, observational studies (most of them single-arm), with different definitions of CRBSI cure and variable follow-up periods. Furthermore, the ability of an antibiotic to eradicate a biofilm is not predicted by its inherent spectrum of antibacterial activity, since sessile microorganisms in their biofilm display other mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics than their planktonic counter-parts. Additionally, penetration of some antibiotics frequently used into biofilms produced by common microorganisms appears to be low. In this editorial we provide a critical view on the available evidence regarding the efficacy of ALT on the treatment of CRBSI in hemodialysis patients, as well as the microbiological issues and technical challenges of this strategy.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^112UeNQN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)–associated infection — management favors treating through infection without routine catheter removal, with conditional guidance and very low confidence in effects. Though the incidence of IPC-related infection is low, catheter-related infection remains a concern, as well as a potential barrier to their use; aggregated data from three RCTs show IPC-related rates of cellulitis and pleural space infection of 7.3% and 4.6%, respectively. The evidence base includes observational series and a nested case series with clinical outcomes among 107 patients; in the remaining case series, 41 of 57 patients (72%) were managed without removing the infected IPC, the pooled mortality attributed to the IPC infection among these 57 patients was 12.3%, and when examining all case series with 107 patients the pooled mortality was 9.3%. There are no data suggesting that catheter removal is superior or inferior to keeping the catheter in place. In patients with IPC-associated infections, treating through the infection without catheter removal is usually adequate. We suggest catheter removal if the infection fails to improve (conditional recommendation; very low confidence in estimate of effects; Tables E4G and E5G).

### Antibiotic lock technique: a review of the literature [^112SyVW7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on the use of the antibiotic lock technique (ALT) as a treatment option for patients with highly needed catheters.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched (1980-August 2004). Search terms included antibiotic lock, catheter infection, and topical treatment.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles describing use of ALT in the treatment of catheter infections in humans and studies evaluating in vitro stability of antibiotics were included.

Data Synthesis

ALT has been used in patients with highly needed catheters, usually for parenteral nutrition, cancer chemotherapy, or dialysis. Catheters are considered highly needed when removal is not feasible or desirable due to lack of alternative injection sites for required therapy. Success rates in saving the infected catheter have been variable and may depend on the infecting organism. In addition, there are conflicting data in terms of compatibility of antibiotics with heparin solutions.

Conclusions

Consensus appears to be that the ALT can be tried for patients with highly needed catheters when infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci is documented and no systemic signs of sepsis, such as hypotension, are evident. Most of these patients are likely to need systemic therapy as well. Infection of the catheter associated with systemic gram-negative bacteremia or fungemia will most likely require removal of the catheter to prevent systemic complications. Additional research with the ALT is warranted given unanswered questions.

Studies of Gram-positive BSI

Gram-positive pathogens were the focus of 8 (10%) of the included studies, including three studies of enterococcal BSI: one retrospective study investigating catheter removal vs. retention in enterococcal CLABSI and another of persistent ICU-acquired vancomycin-resistant enterococcal BSI. One study examined Corynebacterium CRBSI. Four studies focused on Staphylococcus aureus BSI, examining a stewardship strategy, the role of ceftaroline and daptomycin as salvage therapy, outcomes of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) vs. methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) CRBSI, and risk factors for persistent MRSA BSI. Of these, one (13%) did not define SC, 2 (25%) used minimal definitions, and 5 (63%) defined SC as catheter removal, with 2 using CLABSI and 3 using CRBSI definitions. Two (25%) studies defined and/or reported secondary focus of infection.

Studies of Gram-negative BSI

Fourteen of the included studies (18%) focused on Gram-negative BSI, with emphasis on antimicrobial resistance. These included 1 (7%) study of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, 3 (21%) studies of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 3 (21%) studies of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Additional studies examined intra-abdominal source Klebsiella pneumoniae BSI (n = 2, 14%), polymicrobial vs. monomicrobial Gram-negative BSI (n = 1, 7%), and the role of follow-up blood cultures in Gram-negative BSI (n = 1, 7%). One (7%) study focused on catheter removal without reporting BSI sources, 11 (79%) reported a range of sources, and 2 (14%) focused on intra-abdominal infections. For SC definitions, 2 (14%) studies provided no definition, 2 (14%) used minimal definitions, 6 (43%) used concise definitions, and 3 (21%) provided comprehensive SC definitions.

### AABIP evidence-informed guidelines and expert panel report for the management of indwelling pleural catheters [^113Dxbuz]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2020). High credibility.

Recommendation 7 — Management of indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)-related pleural space infection without tunnel tract infection states: In patients with IPCs for the management of known or suspected malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) who develop a catheter-related pleural space infection without a concomitant tunnel tract infection, we suggest attempting continuous fluid drainage through the IPC over catheter removal (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Pleural space infections are generally reported to occur with < 5% of IPCs, and an IPC-related pleural space infection is suggested to exist when any of the following are present: obvious pus drained from the catheter; clinical symptoms with positive pleural fluid gram stain or cultures; or clinical symptoms with pleural fluid biochemical analysis supportive of infection, such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low glucose or low pH, and catheter colonization alone should not define infection. Evidence cited includes a 2013 retrospective analysis of 1021 patients with IPCs at 11 international centers with 50 IPC-related pleural infections; all patients were initially treated with antibiotics and catheter drainage; among infected patients, 74% were treated as inpatients, 3/50 died before infection resolution, with a 94% overall rate of infection control; catheter removal was performed in 46% of patients and reinsertion of a chest tube or IPC was required in 48% of those requiring removal, with no surgical interventions necessary. Additional cohorts included 25, 19, and 13 IPCs respectively, and another series of 672 patients with IPC for MPEs identified 25 IPC-related pleural infections with 60% treated as inpatients and 3/25 deaths within 30 days of infection.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^114rXWhc]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — intravascular catheter source control recommends prompt removal of intravascular access devices suspected to be the source once alternate access is secured. Specifically, for adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend prompt removal of intravascular access devices that are a possible source of sepsis or septic shock after other vascular access has been established (Best practice statement). Removal of a potentially infected intravascular access device is considered a part of adequate source control, and an intravascular device suspected to be a source of sepsis should be removed after establishing another site for vascular access and following successful initial resuscitation. In the absence of septic shock or fungemia, some implanted tunneled catheter infections may be treated effectively with prolonged antimicrobial therapy if removal is not practical, although catheter removal with adequate antimicrobial therapy is definitive and is the preferred treatment in most cases. The evidence review identified one relevant RCT and two observational studies with no evidence of a difference in mortality, and the quality of evidence was very low.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^1144xGeH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 26 — fibrin sheath–related central venous catheter (CVC) dysfunction and infection — states that fibrin sheaths are a known cause of CVC dysfunction and infection that cannot be treated with thrombolytic therapy alone, and that CVC exchange alone or exchange with balloon disruption likely results in disruption of the fibrin sheath. It notes that thrombolytics dissolve acute clot (< 14 days) and not tissue; thus, they are ineffective against fibrin sheaths, and also that fibrin sheaths can harbor bacteria. A prior typical management strategy for suspected catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is to remove the CVC, wait 48 to 72 hours, and reinsert a new CVC, but disrupting the fibrin sheath may eliminate CRBSI and has been shown not to increase bacteremia rates; thus, its disruption may assist in eliminating a source of recurrent infection. The guideline further recalls that the prior 2006 KDOQI guideline stated that a fibrin sheath causing CVC malfunction can be treated with CVC exchange with or without balloon angioplasty.

### Clinical review: new technologies for prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections [^113JcHpn]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Intravascular catheters have become essential devices for the management of critically and chronically ill patients. However, their use is often associated with serious infectious complications, mostly catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), resulting in significant morbidity, increased duration of hospitalization, and additional medical costs. The majority of CRBSIs are associated with central venous catheters (CVCs), and the relative risk for CRBSI is significantly greater with CVCs than with peripheral venous catheters. However, most CVC-related infections are preventable, and different measures have been implemented to reduce the risk for CRBSI, including maximal barrier precautions during catheter insertion, catheter site maintenance, and hub handling. The focus of the present review is on new technologies for preventing infections that are directed at CVCs. New preventive strategies that have been shown to be effective in reducing risk for CRBSI, including the use of catheters and dressings impregnated with antiseptics or antibiotics, the use of new hub models, and the use of antibiotic lock solutions, are briefly described.

### Catheter impregnation, coating or bonding for reducing central venous catheter-related infections in adults [^116voCze]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The central venous catheter (CVC) is essential in managing acutely ill patients in hospitals. Bloodstream infection is a major complication in patients with a CVC. Several infection control measures have been developed to reduce bloodstream infections, one of which is impregnation of CVCs with various forms of antimicrobials (either with an antiseptic or with antibiotics). This review was originally published in June 2013 and updated in 2016.

Objectives

Our main objective was to assess the effectiveness of antimicrobial impregnation, coating or bonding on CVCs in reducing clinically-diagnosed sepsis, catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI), all-cause mortality, catheter colonization and other catheter-related infections in adult participants who required central venous catheterization, along with their safety and cost effectiveness where data were available. We undertook the following comparisons: 1) catheters with antimicrobial modifications in the form of antimicrobial impregnation, coating or bonding, against catheters without antimicrobial modifications and 2) catheters with one type of antimicrobial impregnation against catheters with another type of antimicrobial impregnation. We planned to analyse the comparison of catheters with any type of antimicrobial impregnation against catheters with other antimicrobial modifications, e.g. antiseptic dressings, hubs, tunnelling, needleless connectors or antiseptic lock solutions, but did not find any relevant studies. Additionally, we planned to conduct subgroup analyses based on the length of catheter use, settings or levels of care (e.g. intensive care unit, standard ward and oncology unit), baseline risks, definition of sepsis, presence or absence of co-interventions and cost-effectiveness in different currencies.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Anaesthesia, Critical and Emergency Care Review Group (ACE). In the updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (OVID SP; 1950 to March 2015), EMBASE (1980 to March 2015), CINAHL (1982 to March 2015), and other Internet resources using a combination of keywords and MeSH headings. The original search was run in March 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed any type of impregnated catheter against either non-impregnated catheters or catheters with another type of impregnation in adult patients cared for in the hospital setting who required CVCs. We planned to include quasi-RCT and cluster-RCTs, but we identified none. We excluded cross-over studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data using the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently assessed the relevance and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We expressed our results using risk ratio (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number need to treat to benefit (NNTB) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, where appropriate, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We included one new study (338 participants/catheters) in this update, which brought the total included to 57 studies with 16,784 catheters and 11 types of impregnations. The total number of participants enrolled was unclear, as some studies did not provide this information. Most studies enrolled participants from the age of 18, including patients in intensive care units (ICU), oncology units and patients receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition. There were low or unclear risks of bias in the included studies, except for blinding, which was impossible in most studies due to the catheters that were being assessed having different appearances. Overall, catheter impregnation significantly reduced catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI), with an ARR of 2% (95% CI 3% to 1%), RR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.74) and NNTB of 50 (high-quality evidence). Catheter impregnation also reduced catheter colonization, with an ARR of 9% (95% CI 12% to 7%), RR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.76) and NNTB of 11 (moderate-quality evidence, downgraded due to substantial heterogeneity). However, catheter impregnation made no significant difference to the rates of clinically diagnosed sepsis (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; moderate-quality evidence, downgraded due to a suspicion of publication bias), all-cause mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07; high-quality evidence) and catheter-related local infections (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.07; 2688 catheters, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to wide 95% CI). In our subgroup analyses, we found that the magnitudes of benefits for impregnated CVCs varied between studies that enrolled different types of participants. For the outcome of catheter colonization, catheter impregnation conferred significant benefit in studies conducted in ICUs (RR 0.70;95% CI 0.61 to 0.80) but not in studies conducted in haematological and oncological units (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.11) or studies that assessed predominantly patients who required CVCs for long-term total parenteral nutrition (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.34). However, there was no such variation for the outcome of CRBSI. The magnitude of the effects was also not affected by the participants' baseline risks. There were no significant differences between the impregnated and non-impregnated groups in the rates of adverse effects, including thrombosis/thrombophlebitis, bleeding, erythema and/or tenderness at the insertion site.

Authors' Conclusions

This review confirms the effectiveness of antimicrobial CVCs in reducing rates of CRBSI and catheter colonization. However, the magnitude of benefits regarding catheter colonization varied according to setting, with significant benefits only in studies conducted in ICUs. A comparatively smaller body of evidence suggests that antimicrobial CVCs do not appear to reduce clinically diagnosed sepsis or mortality significantly. Our findings call for caution in routinely recommending the use of antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs across all settings. Further randomized controlled trials assessing antimicrobial CVCs should include important clinical outcomes like the overall rates of sepsis and mortality.

### Central venous catheter colonization with Staphylococcus aureus is not always an indication for antimicrobial therapy [^112nY2No]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Whether patients whose catheter tip grows Staphylococcus aureus but who have no concomitant bacteraemia should receive antimicrobials remains an unresolved issue. However, a proportion of patients with catheter tips colonized by S. aureus have no blood cultures taken because of low suspicion of sepsis and the meaning of this microbiological finding is unknown. We have analysed all catheter tips growing S. aureus during a 6-year period and have selected patients without blood cultures taken 7 days before or after central vascular catheter removal. Patient's evolution was classified into good and poor outcome. Poor outcome was defined as S. aureus infection within 3 months after catheter withdrawal or death in the same period with no obvious cause. Patients with good and poor outcomes were compared to assess whether antimicrobial therapy influenced evolution. Sixty-seven patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria and five (7.4%) had a poor outcome. The administration of early anti-staphylococcal therapy had no impact on the outcome of this population (p 0.99). The only factor independently associated with a poor outcome was the presence of clinical signs of sepsis when the catheter was removed (OR 20.8; 95% CI 2.0–206.1; p 0.009). Our data suggest that patients with central vascular catheter tips colonized with S. aureus should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of ongoing infection, but if these are not present then antimicrobial therapy does not seem justified.

Few studies describe the efficacy of antibiotic lock therapy (ALT) in long-term catheter-related bloodstream (CRBSI) infections. We applied local protocols combining Daptomycin (DPT) and Taurolidine ALT, associated with systemic antibiotic treatment (SAT), for conservative management of coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) CRBSI.

Methods

Patients admitted for CoNS-associated CRBSI and treated with DPT and Taurolidine as ALT were retrospectively analyzed. Success was defined as catheter retention 30days after ending treatment. Catheter removal within 30days was considered as failure.

Results

From April 2018 to September 2021, 22 subjects with CoNS-associated-CRBSI were included (95% with cancer, mean age 64years, 59% male). Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 82% of cases. Mean duration of DPT was 3.9 and 3days as ALT and SAT, respectively. SAT also included Rifampin for 3days. Taurolidine ALT was started on day 4 and was combined with oral SAT, that is, either Linezolid or Tedizolid. Mean duration of Taurolidine was 10.5days, while total antibiotic treatment lasted 13.5days. Clinical success and failure rates were 95% and 5%, respectively.

Discussion

Short course DPT as ALT, combined with SAT and Taurolidine ALT, allowed high rates of conservative management of catheters in case of CoNS-associated-CRBSI.

### A state of the art review on optimal practices to prevent, recognize, and manage complications associated with intravascular devices in the critically ill [^114hYSRL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Intravascular catheters are inserted into almost all critically ill patients. This review provides up-to-date insight into available knowledge on epidemiology and diagnosis of complications of central vein and arterial catheters in ICU. It discusses the optimal therapy of catheter-related infections and thrombosis. Prevention of complications is a multidisciplinary task that combines both improvement of the process of care and introduction of new technologies. We emphasize the main component of the prevention strategies that should be used in critical care and propose areas of future investigation in this field.

AABIP IPC-related pleural space infections — empiric antimicrobial therapy is addressed as follows: In patients with IPCs for the management of known or suspected MPEs who develop a catheter-related pleural space infection, we suggest empiric antibiotics with broad coverage for catheter-related organisms including S. aureus and gram-negative organisms, while awaiting results of microbiological testing (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Background notes that prompt empiric antimicrobial coverage is a critical part of management and that the choice of empiric antimicrobial agents depends on the local epidemiology of the potential culprit organisms, which in turn depends on source.

### Source control in bloodstream infections in patients with sepsis, septic shock, or requiring ICU admission: a scoping review with recommendations for standardizing research [^113vP9uy]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient recruitment was evenly distributed among ICU-only, hospital wards, and mixed ICU/ward cohorts, each comprising approximately one-third of studies. Severity was reported in 64 (83%) studies. Sepsis was reported in 16 studies, with a mean prevalence of 66% (SD ± 24%, range 21–100%). Septic shock was reported in 54 studies, with a mean prevalence of 44% (SD ± 24%, range 4–100%). SOFA scores were reported in 21 studies, with a median of 7 (IQR 5–8). APACHE II scores were reported in 20 studies, with a median of 21 (IQR 16–23).

SC was a primary research objective in 16 studies (21%), including one RCT comparing early catheter removal vs. watchful waiting in suspected CRBSI, 12 cohort studies directly evaluating the impact of SC or its timing on outcomes, two studies comparing guidewire exchange with Central Venous Catheter (CVC) removal and replacement, and one quality improvement study evaluating a multistep Gram-negative BSI management bundle, incorporating source-finding imaging with subsequent SC. Of the remaining 61 studies (79%), SC was either reported descriptively or used as an explanatory variable, most often in mortality-risk analyses. BSI relapse was assessed in 2 studies (3%).

Regarding study populations, candidemia was the focus of 36 studies (47%), while 20 studies (26%) investigated BSI due to specific bacterial pathogens or pathogen groups (e.g. Gram-negative, Carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter spp. Klebsiella spp. or Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Seven studies (9%) included all BSI, 9 (12%) focused on catheter-source BSI, and 5 (7%) examined BSI from other specified sources (e.g. intra-abdominal or urinary sources). In terms of reported results, 16 studies (21%) did not specify the infection source, while 40 (52%) described a range of BSI sources. Notably, 21% reported only catheter sources, a proportion higher than the number of catheter-specific studies, largely due to candidemia studies that documented catheter removal exclusively. Secondary metastatic infections were defined or reported in 9 studies (12%).

### Prevention and treatment of hemodialysis-related bloodstream infections [^117ArE74]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in the delivery of care, the annual all-cause mortality rate for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is still around 220 deaths per 1000 at risk patient-years. Infection-related causes are second only to cardiovascular events as a cause for mortality among ESRD patients. Almost two-thirds of all ESRD patients will require hemodialysis and they are at the highest risk for bloodstream infections. An effective method for reducing bloodstream infections is increasing the use of fistula for dialysis access, but, for a significant number of patients, catheter access is inevitable. Several interventions have been studied that primarily involves the application of antimicrobials at the catheter exit site. Other interventions include the use of antibiotic lock solutions, which have resulted in the development of antibiotic resistance. Novel connecting devices may be of use in the future, but studies are still needed to show their efficacy at preventing catheter-related bloodstream infections among hemodialysis patients. As insertion sites can be limited in hemodialysis patients, treatment of certain catheter-related bloodstream infections can be amenable to catheter retention as long as both systemic antibiotic and antibiotic lock therapies are also initiated. Until more data are available, catheter removal followed by systemic therapy is preferred for infections involving Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas species, Enterococcus species, and Candida species.

### Continuous antibiotic infusion for salvage therapy of partially implanted central venous catheter tunnel infections due to staphylococci [^112cyKkj]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Tunnel infection is an uncommon but serious complication observed in patients with partially implanted central venous catheters. International guidelines suggest that should include antibiotics and catheter removal. A success rate of only 5–20% was reported without catheter removal. We treated 13 episodes of tunnel Gram-positive bacterial infection occurring in pediatric patients with cancer or serious blood disorders with 24-hr intra-catheter antibiotic continuous infusion. This approach led to a 69% success rate. Continuous infusion might be an attractive option to treat tunnel Gram-positive bacterial infections when catheter removal might not be feasible or advisable.

### Anti-infective locks for treatment of central line-associated bloodstream infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116rw3Q2]. American Journal of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are associated with considerable morbidity, mortality and economic costs. In most cases, catheter removal is considered an essential component of managing CLABSI. However, in patients with poor access, catheter salvage may have to be attempted rather than removal and replacement of catheters. Anti-infective lock therapy (ALT) - instilling an antibiotic or antiseptic into the catheter lumen - is a novel way of treating CLABSI while attempting to salvage the catheter. However, data on the efficacy of ALT for catheter salvage is limited. In this systematic review, we critically review the evidence regarding the use of ALT for catheter salvage. We identified 8 studies including a total of 396 patients that compared ALT with systemic antibiotic therapy alone or an alternate method of catheter salvage (guidewire replacement). We found that the combination of systemic antibiotics and culture-guided lock therapy was superior to systemic antibiotics alone (OR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.10–0.39), with 10% of locked patients requiring replacement compared to 33% of subjects without locks. There was a 20% relapse rate in the ALT group and a 30% relapse rate in the control group (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.18–1.03). There was insufficient data on catheter exchange over a wire compared with ALT to permit conclusions. Our data support the use of ALT in conjunction with systemic antibiotics for catheter salvage. Large randomized controlled trials of ALT examining dose, dwell times and relapse rates stratified by infecting pathogen are needed.

### Treatment of positive catheter tip culture without bloodstream infections in critically ill patients. A case-cohort study from the OUTCOMEREA network [^115gcKgi]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than 50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) have a central venous catheter (CVC), and the mean device infection-adjusted rate in critically ill patients varies from 0.87 to 4.82 central line-associated bloodstream infections episodes per 1000 CVC-day depending on countries of detection. Catheter-associated bloodstream infections were associated with a substantially increased attributable mortality and an additional 15 days of ICU length-of-stay. Colonization of central catheters in the ICU is a frequent phenomenon, affecting more than 8% of intravascular catheter, depending on the study. Colonization is not sufficient by itself to define catheter infection but is classically considered as an acceptable surrogate for catheter infection, although poorly correlated with catheter-related infections. Since CVC colonization is the first step of CVC infection, it is likely that CVC colonization predisposes to catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs). Therefore, CVC removal is recommended as soon as the CVC is no longer needed to prevent both CVC colonization and infection. To date, there is no uniform approach to the management of colonized catheters, and the consequences in terms of bacteremic or non-bacteremic subsequent infections following catheter removal remain controversial in the literature. In 2009, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) highlighted the importance of this subject and the need to guide healthcare professionals in initiating an appropriate response to this issue.

Up to now, the conclusions of published studies on this topic are limited, because they are (i) heterogeneous, (ii) mostly monocentric and observational, and (iii) mostly describe a single pathogen. A recent national microbiological surveillance study including more than 15,000 positive catheter tips showed that several microorganisms (i.e. Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans) were associated with an increased risk of subsequent bacteremia. However, due to the retrospective nature of this study without access to clinical data, the role of systemic antibiotic treatment in adults with colonized CVC remains unresolved.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the role of systemic antibiotic therapy in patients with a colonized catheter tip with potentially pathogenic microorganisms, assessing the occurrence of bacteremic or non-bacteremic subsequent infections. Preliminary results of this manuscript have been presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID Barcelona, Spain, 27–30 April 2024).

### Clinical management of dialysis catheter-related bacteremia with concurrent exit-site infection [^11393pVT]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Dialysis catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) can frequently be treated with systemic antibiotics, in conjunction with an antibiotic lock, in an attempt to salvage the catheter. It is unknown whether CRB associated with an exit-site infection can be treated with such an approach. We retrospectively queried a prospective, computerized vascular access database, and identified 1436 episodes of CRB, of which 64 cases had a concurrent exit site. The frequency of concurrent exit-site infection was 9.6% with Staphylococcus epidermidis, 6.1% with Staphylococcus aureus, and only 0.7% with Gram negative CRB (p < 0.001 for Staphylococcus vs. Gram negative rods). Five serious complications (four major sepses and one endocarditis) occurred in 24 patients with S. aureus infection, but none in 32 episodes of S. epidermidis infection (p = 0.01). Catheter survival was significantly shorter in patients with S. aureus infections. The median catheter survival (without infection or dysfunction) was 14 days with S. aureus vs. 30 days with S. epidermidis infection (p = 0.035). In conclusion, concurrent exit-site infection is seen most commonly in association with Staphylococcal CRB. When the infecting organism is S. epidermidis, attempted salvage with systemic antibiotics and an antibiotic lock is reasonable. However, prompt catheter removal is indicated when the pathogen is S. aureus.

### Central venous catheter-related bacteremia in chronic hemodialysis patients: epidemiology and evidence-based management [^1134Yk2b]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Central venous catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease treated with chronic hemodialysis. Risk factors include Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization, longer duration of catheter use, previous bacteremia, older age, higher total intravenous iron dose, lower hemoglobin and serum albumin levels, diabetes mellitus and recent hospitalization. Symptoms that raise clinical suspicion of bacteremia in chronic hemodialysis patients are fevers and chills. When CRBSI is suspected, blood cultures should be obtained and empirical therapy with broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics initiated. The diagnosis of CRBSI is confirmed by isolation of the same microorganism from quantitative cultures of both the catheter and the peripheral blood of a patient that has clinical features of infection without any other apparent source. Gram-positive cocci, predominantly S. epidermidis and S. aureus, cause bacteremia in two-thirds of cases. Among the various approaches to management of CRBSI, removal and delayed replacement of the catheter, catheter exchange over a guidewire in selected patients, and the use of antimicrobial/citrate lock solutions have all been found to be promising for treatment and/or prevention; however, resolution of issues regarding selection, dose, duration and emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms with chronic use of antibiotic lock solutions, as well as the safety of long-term use of trisodium citrate lock solutions, await further randomized, multicenter trials involving larger samples of hemodialysis patients.

### Strategies for prevention of catheter-related infections in adult and… [^112dfZQa]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Selection of Catheters and Sites Peripheral and Midline Catheter Recommendations
- In adults, use an upper-extremity site for catheter insertion. Replace a catheter inserted in a lower extremity site to an upper extremity site as soon as possible. Category II
- In pediatric patients, the upper or lower extremities or the scalp can be used as the catheter insertion site. Central Venous Catheters Recommendations
- Weigh the risks and benefits of placing a central venous device at a recommended site to reduce infectious complications against the risk for mechanical complications. Category IA
- When adherence to aseptic technique cannot be ensured, replace the catheter as soon as possible, i.e., within 48 hours. Category IB. Site selection should be guided by patient comfort, ability to secure the catheter, and maintenance of asepsis as well as patient-specific factors, relative risk of mechanical complications, the availability of bedside ultrasound, the experience of the person inserting the catheter, and the risk for infection. Sterile gloves must be worn for placement of central catheters since a "no-touch" technique is not possible. Antimicrobial/Antiseptic Impregnated Catheters and Cuffs Recommendation Use a chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine or minocycline/ rifampin -impregnated CVC in patients whose catheter is expected to remain in place > 5 days if, after successful implementation of a comprehensive strategy to reduce rates of CLABSI, the CLABSI rate is not decreasing.

The comprehensive strategy should include at least the following three components: educating persons who insert and maintain catheters, use of maximal sterile barrier precautions, and a > 0. 5% chlorhexidine preparation with alcohol for skin antisepsis during CVC insertion. Category IA.

### Should central venous catheter be systematically removed in patients with suspected catheter related infection? [^112NHbuW]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clinical practice guidelines for the management of intravascular catheter-related infection (CRI) by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are unclear on what strategy to adopt in patients with central venous catheter (CVC) and suspected CRI. There are arguments in favour of and against immediate CVC removal on suspicion of CRI. On the one hand, catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) has been associated with increased mortality and delayed CVC removal could lead to worse prognosis if the focus of infection is the CVC itself. On the other hand, there are arguments against immediate CVC removal when CRI is suspected.

First, one reason to suspect CRI is the presence of fever, but critically ill patients frequently develop fever and the cause is not always CRBSI; there are many other causes of fever, including non-infectious processes (such as pancreatitis, pulmonary infarction or acute respiratory distress syndrome, et cetera) and infectious processes (pneumonia, urinary tract infection and central nervous system infection). Second, the incidence of CRBSI has decreased due to the implementation of evidence-based clinical practice during CVC insertion and maintenance. Third, in a randomized clinical trial involving 64 patients with suspected CRI, there were no differences in outcome between groups with early CVC removal and those with watchful waiting; however, in the watchful-waiting group, only 38% underwent catheter removal. Fourth, vascular catheterization by new puncture entails the risk of serious and even life-threatening mechanical complications such as vascular lesion, haematoma, haemothorax, pneumothorax, nerve injury and gas embolism. The objective of this study was to analyze clinical practice for CVC management in critically ill patients with suspected CRI, and its impact on patient prognosis.

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS)-related bacteremia — treatment durations by source: Duration of antibiotics depends on source, organism, and clearing of bacteremia. CRBSI secondary to Staphylococcus aureus is treated for 4 to 6 weeks with catheter removal; if not S aureus, when blood cultures become negative within 24 to 48 hours and there are no signs of metastatic infection, 2 weeks from first negative blood culture may be adequate. If no source is identified, treatment may be considered as with MCS pump and cannula infection.

### Catheter-related infections in patients with haematological malignancies: novel preventive and therapeutic strategies [^116mm7kd]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Central venous catheters are essential for the treatment of patients with haematological malignancies and the recipients of stem-cell transplant. This patient population is, however, at high risk for catheter-related bloodstream infections that can result in substantial morbidity, mortality, and health-care-associated costs. Efficient prevention, early diagnosis, and effective treatment are essential to providing the best care to these patients. Although confirming the catheter as a source of infection remains challenging, the Infectious Diseases Society of America definition of catheter-related bloodstream infection remains the most precise definition to use in these patients. Gram-positive bacteria, particularly coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp, remain the leading cause of catheter-related bloodstream infection, although an increase in Gram-negative bacteria as the causative agent has been noted. Although removal of the line and appropriate intravenous antibiotics remain the mainstay of treatment in most cases, novel technologies, including exchange with antibiotic-coated catheters and treatment with lock solutions, are particularly relevant in this patient population. In this Review we present the types of central venous catheters used in this patient population and analyse the different definitions of catheter-related infections, with an overview of their prevention and management.

### Comparing success rates in central venous catheter salvage for catheter-related bloodstream infections in adult patients on home parenteral nutrition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114iXZvd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Inclusion criteria

Adult patients (> 17 y old) receiving HPN with a bacterial CRBSI;
use of either systemic antibiotics, antimicrobial lock therapy (ALT), and/or catheter exchange as the CRBSI management approach;
evaluation of treatment efficacy (i.e. successful catheter salvage, recurrence rates, and/or infectious complications).

Main exclusion criteria

Use of ALT for prevention only;
use of catheter removal as the sole management approach.

In addition, studies that only involved patients with previous CRBSI treatment failure or infectious complications were excluded. Studies incorporating different patient populations were only included if the text outlined that patients on parenteral nutrition were included. Studies only containing children were excluded in order to limit the heterogeneity of the patient population and because of expected differences in CRBSI etiology, diagnosis, and management. When distinct publications had partly overlapping data due to the same patients' inclusion, the results were either combined or collected from the most extensive study to avoid duplicate data. Selected studies included interventional clinical trials and case-control and observational cohort studies.

Outcome measures

The major outcome of interest was successful catheter salvage rates, with a distinction between:

Overall catheter salvage rate = ratio of successfully salvaged catheters to total CRBSIs.
Successful catheter attempt rate = ratio of successful salvage attempts according to the protocol to total salvage attempts.

The secondary outcomes comprised recurrence, infectious complications, mortality, and catheter salvage rates per pathogen type. The infecting pathogens were divided into 4 microbiological categories: CNS, S. aureus, Gram-negative rods (GNR), and polymicrobial.

### Local signs at insertion site and catheter-related bloodstream infections: an observational post hoc analysis using individual data of four RCTs [^1141niwM]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Our findings have some important clinical Implications which, to date, have never been assessed. First, compared to the most recent literature available, local signs are associated with CRBSI, and their presence should elicit investigations for diagnosing potential intravascular catheter infections. Second, local signs may help clinicians in a specific clinical condition: if at least one local sign is present within the first 7 days of catheter maintenance, it further increases the probability to observe a catheter infection. Therefore, clinicians should deserve particular attention to the catheter insertion site in the first week after the insertion and a promptly catheter removal should be considered. Moreover, and not surprisingly, purulence at insertion site is a strong reason to remove a catheter. Interestingly, immunosuppression, pathological temperature at removal, catheter type, and severity of illness with the presence of local signs did not significantly help clinicians in predicting CRBSI. Moreover, the solely intuition of the physician who subjectively suspected an intravascular catheter infection in the presence of local signs did not increase the probability to observe a CRBSI. On the other hand, in catheters removed for suspected infection without any local signs, the probability to get infected remained low. An old RCT including a relatively low number of hemodynamically stable critically ill patients without proven bacteremia and local sign at insertion site illustrated that a "watchful waiting strategy" (versus immediate catheter removal) permitted a substantial decrease in the number of unnecessarily removed CVCs without increased morbidity. In the case of suspicion of infection without any local signs, a catheter retention may be considered and would reduce unessentially removals. A post hoc analysis for this subpopulation in our cohort showed that CRBSI were not associated with increased mortality (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.68–2.77, p = 0.38), thus suggesting, at least when catheters were routinely removed, a low mortality risk for this population.

### Comparing success rates in central venous catheter salvage for catheter-related bloodstream infections in adult patients on home parenteral nutrition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113qcQS1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review describes and compares the efficacy of 3 CRBSI management options for patients receiving HPN. These data show that successful catheter salvage can be achieved in the majority (68%) of HPN-dependent patients with a CRBSI, when catheter removal is not indicated. More importantly, the data indicate that ALT in addition to systemic antibiotics is superior to systemic antibiotic treatment alone for successful catheter salvage (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.21, 2.53; P = 0.003).

The benefit of ALT in tandem with systemic antibiotics has previously been described in a systematic review and meta-analysis in hemodialysis patients, which mainly comprised case-control studies. In line with our findings, the authors concluded that the addition of an antimicrobial lock solution is superior to systemic antibiotics alone; however, lack of good-quality clinical trials precluded firm conclusions from being drawn. Likewise, the yield of randomized controlled clinical trials in our systematic search was low, with only 1 RCT included. Although a notable nonsignificant difference in salvage success rates was observed between ALT and placebo groups (57% compared with 33%; P = 0.10), this study was underpowered and ceased prematurely because of slow patient inclusion.

The IDSA guidelines for the diagnosis and management of CRBSI give 2 recommendations regarding the use of ALT as an adjunct therapy for catheter salvage: 1) it is advised that ALT is used (evidence B-II); 2) it is recommended to attempt catheter salvage in uncomplicated CRBSI involving long-term catheters due to pathogens other than S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, fungi, or mycobacteria, with the use of both systemic antibiotics and ALT (B-II). These recommendations are in keeping with our findings, because the lowest catheter salvage success rates were found in CRBSIs caused by S. aureus. Nevertheless, the addition of ALT still resulted in higher catheter salvage success rates than systemic antibiotic treatment alone. Two studies showed that successful salvage rates of > 75% could be achieved even in CRBSIs caused by S. aureus. Caution may be required, however, because several of the included studies initially excluded catheter salvage in CRBSIs caused by S. aureus because of published guidelines and CVC removal within 72 h has been adopted as one of the key quality indicators for optimal S. aureus bacteremia management in antibiotic stewardship programs.

AABIP IPC catheter removal for catheter-related pleural space infection — In patients with IPCs for the management of known or suspected MPEs who develop a catheter-related pleural space infection, we suggest catheter removal and drainage of the pleural space with a new chest tube should be considered if any of the following are present: a tunnel tract infection, poor catheter drainage despite the use of fibrinolytics and DNase, or persistent sepsis despite antibiotics and drainage through the original IPC (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Given the lack of direct evidence and the overall low mortality associated with IPC-related pleural space infections, one might consider a trial of antibiotics without IPC removal, with the understanding that in the setting of virulent organisms failure rates are likely high, although one exception is the presence of coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection, for which high rates of catheter salvage have been reported. When there is failure to respond to treatment, suggested by either poor clinical response or inadequate IPC drainage, this should prompt catheter removal, and placement of a new chest tube for continued drainage is also suggested in the setting of persistent fluid after IPC removal.

### Source control in bloodstream infections in patients with sepsis, septic shock, or requiring ICU admission: a scoping review with recommendations for standardizing research [^115f1ATk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This scoping review has several limitations that contextualize its findings. Restricting the search to English-language publications and excluding case series, cohorts with fewer than 25 patients, unpublished studies, or conference abstracts may have omitted relevant evidence, potentially underrepresenting current SC practices. Excluding endocarditis and cardiac device infections, while necessary to focus on generalizable BSI management, may have overlooked insights into organ-specific SC interventions. The predominance of candidemia and catheter removal studies suggests publication bias, skewing the evidence base toward simpler interventions and limiting insights into complex sources like intra-abdominal infections. Manual study selection and data extraction, despite rigorous protocols, may have introduced errors.

Conclusion and recommendations for future studies on SC

SC is a cornerstone of BSI and sepsis management, yet its evidence base is limited by inconsistent definitions, variable timing metrics, inadequate adequacy assessments, and overrepresentation of candidemia and catheter removal studies. By adopting rigorous data collection and standardized variable definitions as outlined in Table 4, and mitigating biases like immortal time bias and confounding by indication, this framework could enhance comparability and generalizability across studies. We plan to organize a Delphi study with an expert panel to formalize these proposals into validated recommendations and invite severe infection researchers with expertise in source control to contact us to participate in this initiative. These improvements are essential to strengthen the evidence base, reduce heterogeneity, and improve clinical practice guidelines, ultimately optimizing outcomes for critically ill patients with BSI.

### How to manage central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections due to Gram-negative bacilli? [^113p3WDS]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this study was to review recent data evaluating the management of central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection due to Gram-negative bacilli (GNB).

Recent Findings

The incidence of GNB catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) has been increasing considerably in the last years, and this has raised a concern due to the high reported rate of multidrug-resistant in these infections what poses a considerable challenge for effective treatment. However, there are no specific guidelines for the management of GNB-CRBSI and optimal treatment duration has not been clearly defined. Recent studies have shown that the risk for complications is clearly different to what is stablished for Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, a short course of antibiotic therapy might be effective once the central venous catheter (CVC) has been removed and the monitoring complications through control blood cultures or echocardiography seem to be less helpful in GNB CRBSI.

### Efficacy of antibiotic-lock technique with teicoplanin in Staphylococcus epidermidis catheter-related sepsis during long-term parenteral nutrition [^115w3PJi]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The antibiotic-lock technique has been suggested to treat catheter-related sepsis in parenteral nutrition and to avoid catheter removal.

Methods

To determine the incidence of catheter-related sepsis, the bacteria involved, and the efficacy of the antibiotic-lock technique with teicoplanin, all patients (n = 263) undergoing parenteral nutrition from January 1997 to December 1999 in one center, with patients at the hospital (n = 209) and at home (54) were retrospectively studied. The antibiotic-lock technique with teicoplanin was systematically used in all suspected infections and maintained in staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) infections.

Results

A total of 21 of 263 patients had 34 infections (0.11/patient per year): 12 of 209 hospitalized and 9 of 54 home patients. A total of 10 of 34 infections were due to non-SE, and the catheter was immediately removed. The other 24 of 34 infections were due to SE; in 5 of 24, the catheter was removed after 48 hours of the antibiotic-lock technique because of persistent fever or thrombosis. A total of 5 of 12 patients had 2 or more infections on the same catheter. The antibiotic-lock technique prevented short-term catheter removal in these cases, but a second infection occurred within a median of 50 days. In 4 of 5 cases, a third infection occurred in a mean delay of 90 days so that the catheter was removed. In 3 of 5 patients, bacteria was analyzed with pulsed field gel electrophoresis, which showed that recurrent infections were due to the same strain in all cases.

Conclusions

In this study, the incidence of catheter-related sepsis was low and mostly related to SE. Our results do not support the use of the teicoplanin antibiotic-lock technique in SE infections.

### Outcome of totally implantable venous access device-related bacteraemia without device removal [^114zCRRq]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

The optimal management of bacteraemia related to the presence of totally implantable venous access devices (TIVADs) remains controversial, particularly in terms of whether to remove the infected catheter. The objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with success or failure of treatment of TIVAD-related bacteraemia in patients from whom the infected device was not removed. The outcome of 92 episodes of TIVAD-related bacteraemia and the factors predictive of an unfavourable outcome were evaluated retrospectively. In 32 (35%) episodes, the devices were removed immediately. In 60 episodes, patients were treated with antibiotics infused through the device; treatment was successful in 56% of these cases (66% for infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci). Only the presence of sepsis (OR 9.42, 95% CI 1.29–68.92, p 0.0271) and of local signs of infection (OR 9.61, 95% CI 1.98–46.49, p 0.0049) independently predicted the failure of catheter-retaining treatment. Finally, only one-third of the devices were retained. In conclusion, the large number of TIVADs that are removed because of infection justifies reconsidering the criteria for device removal. During catheter-retaining treatment, the presence of local signs of infection or reported sepsis were independent factors for reduced probability of retaining the device.

Source control — We recommend that emergent source control intervention be implemented as soon as possible after a diagnosis of an infection amenable to a source control procedure is made (BPS), and appropriate diagnostic testing to identify the site of infection and microbial etiology should be performed, with advice from specialist teams sought as appropriate to prioritize interventions needed to achieve source control. We recommend removal of intravascular access devices that are confirmed to be the source of sepsis or septic shock after other vascular access has been established and depending on the pathogen and the risks/benefits of a surgical procedure (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Prevention of vascular catheter-related bloodstream infections [^1145h8az]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) are responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and excess health care costs. It is increasingly evident that many CRBSI can be prevented with current knowledge and techniques. Preventive measures can be broadly grouped into clinical practice-based interventions and technologic innovations. Clinical practice-based interventions require changes in human behavior and can be subdivided into interventions before and at the time of insertion and postinsertion. Despite recent successes with prevention of CRBSI, pertinent questions regarding pathogenesis and prevention remain unanswered and work on improved surveillance, devices less prone to infection, and more effective prevention techniques are needed.

KDOQI Guideline 25 — CRBSI or bacteremia specifies that patients with suspected catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) should have blood cultures obtained from the CVC and peripheral source (dialysis circuit ± peripheral veins), and broad-spectrum antibiotics that treat both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms should be initiated immediately. Due to the high prevalence of methicillin-resistant S aureus, empiric therapy should include coverage for methicillin-resistant S aureus and be guided by local infection rates, antibiotic sensitivities, and dialysis center policies. Once the final organism and sensitivities are identified, patients should receive long-term antibiotic treatment according to the CDC or IDSA guidelines, for 4 to 6 weeks for uncomplicated S aureus.

### Validation of the proposed definition for complicated coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia [^114mttb5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, the proposed definition for complicated CoNS bacteremia failed to identify patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes.

The 30-day mortality rate was 9%, which is lower than the rates reported in previous studies (11%–24%), and lower to that of S. aureus bacteremia from our institution (15%). The most plausible explanation for the lower mortality observed in our study is the high rate of ID consultations, which led to improved outcomes by optimizing antimicrobial therapy and source control measures. Notably, ID consultations were provided in 94% of cases, with 87% occurring within 48 hours. In contrast, a previous study reported ID consultation in only 68% of cases during hospitalization. In the current study, 88% of patients received appropriate antimicrobial therapy within 48 hours, a rate comparable to those reported in earlier studies within a 72-hour timeframe (84%–88%). Additionally, source control procedures were performed more frequently in our cohort than in prior studies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess and demonstrate the beneficial role of early ID consultation in managing CoNS bacteremia. These findings support adding CoNS bacteremia to the growing list of pathogens (S. aureus, enterococci, streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida spp.) for which ID consultation is strongly recommended.

In addition to early ID consultation, prompt source control procedures were associated with improved outcomes. The absence of indicated source control interventions has previously been linked to worse outcomes in patients with CoNS bacteremia and bacteremia caused by other pathogens. This aspect of management is particularly critical for CoNS bacteremia, as most infections (84%) are associated with prosthetic material. Effective management may require device removal, debridement, or antibiotic lock therapy in cases of catheter-related bacteremia with retained long-term catheters. In patients with uncomplicated catheter-related bacteremia, catheter removal alone, without concomitant antimicrobial therapy, may be sufficient to control the infection.

As expected, a high Charlson Comorbidity Index was associated with worse outcomes. Previous studies on CoNS bacteremia have also identified advanced age and specific comorbidities, such as chronic renal or liver disease, cerebrovascular disease, and immunosuppression, as predictors of mortality. However, in contrast to earlier findings, the severity of infection was not significantly associated with adverse outcomes in our cohort. This discrepancy is likely attributable to the low prevalence of septic shock in our study (4%) compared to prior studies (7%–20%).

Catheter-related bloodstream infection

Question

What is the most effective approach and antibiotic therapy for the management of CRBSI?

Recommendation

Effective management of CRBSI involves timely diagnosis, prompt removal of vascular access if at all possible (source control), and appropriate antibiotic therapy for 7–14 days depending on the causative microorganism, as shown in table 3. Vancomycin plus a beta-lactam (such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a ceftazidime) is usually a good empiric regimen if the risk of ESBL is not high. Reference to the local antibiogram and hospital recommendations is recommended for the selection of empiric therapy.

Table 3
Summary of antibiotic durations for common ICU infections

Discussion

The diagnosis of CRBSI should be distinguished from secondary bacteremia due to other sources. Surveillance cultures for patients with central lines are not recommended when CRBSI is not suspected such as in an asymptomatic patient and should not be done when other cultures are more appropriate to evaluate for the clinically suspected infection (eg, respiratory cultures for a suspected pneumonia).

The choice of antibiotic therapy should be based on local susceptibility patterns and the severity of illness and should be de-escalated when culture data become available. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 7 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 days for Gram-negative bacilli,14 days for S. aureus (unless a complicated infection is present); and 14 days for Candida (in the absence of retinitis or risk factors for it, as described in the 'Bacteremia' section). Examples of when a S. aureus infection is considered complicated include endocarditis, osteomyelitis, foreign body or implant, metastatic infection, low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), immunocompromise, and recurrent infection. An infectious disease consultation should be sought in S. aureus CRBSI.

The management described here applies to non-tunneled lines. When a CRBSI is suspected, the central line should be removed. Catheter salvage options when the line cannot reasonably be removed are beyond the scope of this text.

### Managing intravascular catheter-related infections in heart transplant patients: how far can we apply IDSA guidelines for immunocompromised patients? [^116vKMES]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This study discusses the applicability to heart transplant patients of recently issued guidelines on the diagnosis, management and prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSIs). It also updates newly available information of possible interest to the care of heart transplant patients.

Recent Findings

Catheters remain the leading cause of early bloodstream infections in heart transplant patients. The cause of CR-BSI is mainly attributable to Gram-positive microorganisms. Very frequently, the origin of a bloodstream infection in a heart transplant patient with multiple catheters is not clear, and a precise diagnosis is required. Management without catheter removal may be undertaken when indicated. Empiric therapy should cover Gram-positive, multidrug resistant and Gram-negative bacteria along with Candida. Prolonged antibiotic treatment exceeding 14 days is recommended and should be continued up to 4–6 weeks in the case of Staphylococcus aureus. Prevention measures include education and training, maximal sterile barrier precautions during catheter insertion, a 2% chlorhexidine preparation for skin antisepsis, avoiding routine replacement of catheters and using antimicrobial/antiseptic impregnated short-term central vein catheters (CVCs) and chlorhexidine sponge dressings.

Summary

Until confirmatory data are obtained, present guidelines for diagnosing, managing and preventing CR-BSI can be applied to heart transplant patients. We would nevertheless highlight that the additional precautions should be taken of broader empiric antimicrobial therapy followed by longer duration treatment in these patients.

### Improving the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, including MRSA [^1155cCbY]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Problem

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of both community and hospital acquired bacteraemia, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is multi-faceted. It often requires prolonged courses of antimicrobial therapy as well as a thorough assessment and investigations to identify the source and seek any complications, such as metastatic foci. Given the meticulous approach required when treating patients with S. aureus bacteraemia, there is potential for some aspects of optimal management to be missed, especially in an environment where time and bed space are at a premium. Failure of any aspect of the optimal management, however, is associated with negative patient outcomes.

### Comparing success rates in central venous catheter salvage for catheter-related bloodstream infections in adult patients on home parenteral nutrition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173VR4w]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

The impact that recurrent CVC removal can have on future venous access implies that catheter salvage should be attempted wherever possible in HPN-dependent patients with CRBSI. Whereas guidelines recommend CVC removal in most cases of CRBSI, catheter salvage aims to retain the CVC with the use of appropriate catheter lock therapy and systemic antibiotics, usually for ≥ 10–14 d. Catheter salvage is attractive because it obviates the inconveniences and risks of CVC replacement, especially in those patients who have limited remaining venous access or who cannot tolerate prolonged periods without HPN. Catheter removal, on the other hand, reduces the risk of infection recurrence, persistent bacteremia, and metastatic infection. However, the appropriateness of catheter salvage in specific situations remains contentious. Current European HPN guidelines recommend attempting CVC salvage solely in patients with uncomplicated infections arising from Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), and Gram-negative bacilli. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines advocate catheter removal or replacement as a first-line approach to CRBSI. All guidelines agree on removing the CVC in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, for CRBSIs caused by yeasts, or in cases of complicated infections such as endocarditis, septic thrombosis, and other metastatic infections. However, the recommended treatment for certain high-virulence bacteria (e.g. S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) remains controversial. For instance, whereas the IDSA recommends CVC removal in case of S. aureus and Gram-negative infections, some IF expert centers report high rates of successful catheter salvage with these bacteria.

In addition to the indications for CVC salvage, several other uncertainties exist around CRBSI management. One of these is the added value of an antimicrobial lock solution next to conventional systemic antibiotic treatment and another is the option of guidewire exchange instead of catheter removal; antimicrobial lock solution consists of high concentrations of an antimicrobial agent (often combined with an anticoagulant) instilled into the catheter lumen. Guidewire exchange is a technique that has previously been reported in studies mainly concerning hemodialysis patients. This technique involves the insertion of a guidewire through the infected CVC into the vein, followed by removal of the infected catheter and placement of a new catheter over the guidewire. However, the optimal strategy to salvage a catheter remains unclear owing to the lack of well-designed randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

### Treatment of catheter-related bacteraemia with an antibiotic lock protocol: effect of bacterial pathogen [^114jCA7r]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The standard therapy of dialysis catheter-related bacteraemia involves both systemic antibiotics and catheter replacement. We reported recently that instillation of an antibiotic lock (highly concentrated antibiotic solution) into the catheter lumen after dialysis sessions, in conjunction with systemic antibiotics, can successfully treat many episodes of catheter-related bacteraemia without requiring catheter removal. The present study evaluated whether the likelihood of achieving a cure with this protocol depends on the type of pathogen.

Methods

This was a historically controlled interventional study of an antibiotic lock protocol for the treatment of catheter-related bacteraemia. We analysed prospectively the likelihood of clinical cure (fever resolution and negative surveillance cultures) with an antibiotic lock protocol among patients with dialysis catheter-related bacteraemia. In addition, infection-free catheter survival was evaluated for up to 150 days, and compared with that observed among patients managed with routine catheter replacement.

Results

Overall, the antibiotic lock protocol was successful in 33 of 47 infected patients (70%) with catheter-related bacteraemia. The likelihood of a clinical cure was 87% for Gram-negative infections, 75% for Staphylococcus epidermidis infections, and only 40% for Staphylococcus aureus infections (P = 0.04). The median infection-free catheter survival with the antibiotic lock protocol was longer than that observed among patients with routine catheter replacement (154 vs 71 days, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

The clinical success of an antibiotic lock protocol in eradicating catheter-related bacteraemia while salvaging the catheter is highly dependent on the bacterial pathogen. Thus, the overall success rate in an individual dialysis programme will depend on the relative frequencies of different bacterial pathogens.

### Clinical management of catheter-related infections [^114usXLr]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Central venous catheters represent a major source of nosocomial bloodstream infections, which cause considerable excess morbidity. It is currently unknown to what extent these infections contribute to mortality. Most catheter-related infections (CRIs) are caused by Gram-positive organisms (mainly coagulase-negative staphylococci). Definite diagnosis of CRI necessitates removal of the catheter in most cases. However, the recently described technique of differential time to positivity may allow diagnosis of CRI with the catheter left in place. Removal of the catheter has been standard clinical practice for the management of CRI in the past and is still recommended in many cases. In specific situations, such as infections of implanted catheters with coagulase-negative staphylococci, a trial of catheter salvage may be justified. In catheter-related bloodstream infection Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp., the catheter should be removed immediately, due to the high risk of metastatic infection and increased mortality. A clinical work-up for the detection of additional foci (including transesophageal echocardiography in S. aureus infections) is advisable in these cases. All CRIs should be treated with antibiotics to which the causative agent has been shown to be susceptible. In addition to systemic antimicrobial therapy, antibiotic lock therapy may be applied, especially in patients with implanted long-term catheters if catheter salvage is attempted.

### Bacteremia, central catheters, and neonates: when to pull the line [^1145i933]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Physicians who treat neonates who become bacteremic while dependent on central venous catheters face a serious and common dilemma. We sought 1) to evaluate the relationship between central venous catheter removal and outcome in bacteremic neonates, 2) to determine species of bacteria that are associated with an increased risk of infectious complications if the central catheter is not removed promptly, and 3) to provide evidence-based recommendations for central catheter management.

Method

A retrospective cohort study of all neonates who had central venous access and developed bacteremia between July 1, 1995, and July 31, 1999, was conducted in the Duke University neonatal intensive care unit.

Results

The outcome for patients in whom the central catheter was not removed within 24 hours of organism identification was significantly worse (odds ratio = 9.8) than it was for those whose catheters were removed promptly. For patients who were infected with Staphylococcus aureus or with nonenteric Gram-negative rods, delayed removal of the central catheter was associated with complicated bacteremia. Catheter sterilization was attempted in 27 neonates who were infected with enteric Gram-negative rods; only 10 of these infants retained their catheters without infection-related complications. Infants who had 4 consecutive blood cultures that were positive for coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) were at significantly increased risk for end-organ damage and death, compared with infants who had 3 or fewer positive blood culture for CoNS (odds ratio = 29.58).

Conclusions

Bacteremic infants experienced fewer infection-related complications when the central catheter was removed promptly. One positive blood culture for S aureus or a Gram-negative rod warrants central line removal in a neonate. Clinicians who are faced with a neonate who has 1 positive culture for CoNS may attempt medical management without central catheter removal, but documentation of subsequent negative blood cultures is crucial. Once a neonate has 3 positive blood cultures for CoNS, the central catheter should be removed.central line, neonate, bacteremia, bacteria, umbilical catheter, Broviac, percutaneous.

### Catheter-related blood stream infections in hemodialysis patients: a prospective cohort study [^117Ebk3N]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes in this study were dialysis catheter removal following bacteremia and relapse of bacteremia. The catheter removal or exchange was deemed timely if it occurred within 14 days of the first positive blood culture. In a sensitivity analysis, timely removal was defined as catheter removal within 72 h of the first blood culture. Based on published guidelines from the study period, catheter removal is required for all episodes of bacteremia with the exception of coagulase-negative Staphylococci. For bacteremia due to coagulase-negative Staphylococci, the CVC may be retained unless there is clinical deterioration or persistent or relapsing bacteremia. Relapse was defined as a repeat positive blood culture with the same species occurring more than two weeks and less than eight weeks from the initial positive blood culture. Secondary outcomes included the frequency of catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSI) and hospitalization due to CRBSI. In both renal programs, it is standard practice for HD unit staff to draw blood cultures when an infection is suspected clinically (i.e. fever) in the absence of another obvious source of infection. Two adjudicators reviewed the microbiology to confirm which were confirmed CRBSI, possible CRBSI, or secondary sources of bacteremia. A third adjudicator served to resolve any discrepancies. A confirmed CRBSI was defined as one or more blood cultures positive for an opportunistic pathogen (defined a priori) or two or more blood cultures positive for common skin contaminants, drawn within two days of each other. A possible CRBSI was defined as a single blood culture positive for a common skin contaminant. As peripheral blood cultures may not be feasible in HD patients (i.e. due poor peripheral access or saving a vein for future vascular access creation), differential time to positivity was not a requirement for the diagnosis of CRBSI. For episodes of bacteremia not meeting the above criteria, bacteremia from a secondary source was determined based on culture from another source or clinical judgment. Hospitalization due to CRBSI was defined as any hospitalization occurring during the two-week window following the first positive blood culture and any hospitalization with a repeat positive blood culture of the same species within six-months of the first positive blood culture.

The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of central venous catheter infections differ between short-term and long-term catheters. This review summarizes available data regarding the diagnosis and management of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) associated with long-term catheters. A review of various diagnostic modalities is provided, including methods of CRBSI diagnosis for catheters that are retained. Management of CRBSIs for long-term catheters is also addressed, with an emphasis on differentiating infections that require catheter removal from those that may allow catheter salvage. Data regarding catheter salvage with use of antibiotic lock therapy are also reviewed.

### Characteristics and outcomes of culture-negative versus culture-positive severe sepsis [^114krLJQ]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of infection

Infection was diagnosed clinically by the managing physicians. From the year 2005 onward, reference was made to the International Sepsis Forum Consensus Conference guidelines on definitions of infections where appropriate. Briefly, the diagnosis of pneumonia required a radiographic infiltrate plus a high clinical suspicion, including fever or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia, and purulent respiratory secretions. Patients were deemed culture-positive if etiologic agents were recovered from blood or pleural fluid, or if semi-quantitative cultures of sputum, blind endotracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage found moderate to heavy growths of bacteria with few epithelial cells seen on Gram stain examination (≤ 10 per high power field). Intra-abdominal infections included but were not limited to intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, biliary tract infections, pancreatic infections, enteritis, and colitis. Urinary tract infection was diagnosed through typical signs and symptoms including fever, urgency, frequency, dysuria, pyuria, hematuria, positive Gram stain, pus, and suggestive imaging. Urine cultures were deemed positive with the isolation of > 10⁵ colony forming units (cfu)/mL of microorganisms (or 10³ cfu/mL in catheterized patients). Soft tissue and skin infections included surgical site infections, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. Infective endocarditis was diagnosed based on the revised Duke criteria. When diagnosing bacteremia, common skin contaminants like coagulase-negative staphylococci, Bacillus species, Corynebacterium species, micrococci, and Propionibacterium species were disregarded unless they were deemed clinically significant by the managing physicians or cultured from two or more blood cultures. Primary bacteremia was diagnosed when the microorganism cultured was not related to an infection at another site. Catheter-related sepsis is the only infection for which microbiological confirmation was mandated by the International Sepsis Forum. For this study, the diagnosis of culture-positive catheter-related sepsis required a positive peripheral blood culture, while the diagnosis of culture-negative catheter-related sepsis was made clinically in the presence of pus or cellulitis at the exit site or tunnel tract infection.
