## Question

At what threshold is endarterectomy indicated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is indicated, focusing on thresholds by symptom status, stenosis severity, timing, and acceptable periprocedural risks, with an explicit decision algorithm and reconciliation of major guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how symptomatic versus asymptomatic status drives thresholds and urgency. Then, I should verify stenosis cutoffs for symptomatic patients, followed by asymptomatic thresholds and the required safety benchmarks. Next, I will review timing of intervention, integrate patient-specific modifiers that shift decisions, and reconcile guideline variations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise clinical algorithm and confirm the key risk thresholds and conditions under which CEA confers net benefit.

> Let me first confirm the foundational distinction: symptomatic disease means ipsilateral carotid territory symptoms within the past 6 months such as TIA, nondisabling stroke, or amaurosis fugax, whereas asymptomatic disease lacks recent focal neurological events; this split fundamentally alters benefit–risk and the urgency of revascularization. Hold on, I should verify that all major societies align here, and yes, ESVS 2023, ESO 2021, SVS 2022, and ESC 2024 all anchor recommendations to this dichotomy, which I need to keep front and center as I consider stenosis thresholds and timing [^117NrQnU] [^112E62c5] [^1147uP1h] [^115uNCC2].

> For symptomatic patients, I will now examine the high-grade stenosis range first; CEA is strongly recommended for 70–99% stenosis provided the 30-day stroke/death rate is under 6%, and I should double-check that multiple guidelines explicitly converge on this threshold and safety bar. Wait, let me verify: ESVS 2023, ESC 2024, and ESO 2021 all provide strong recommendations for CEA in symptomatic 70–99% if procedural risk is acceptable, which confirms this as a clear-cut indication where the absolute risk reduction outweighs periprocedural hazards [^113VQFN2] [^115uNCC2] [^115nYNZC].

> For moderate symptomatic stenosis (50–69%), I need to ensure I capture the more conditional nature of benefit; recommendations suggest CEA when 30-day stroke/death risk is under 6% and patient factors favor surgery, recognizing a smaller absolute benefit. Hold on, let me verify the guideline language: ESVS 2023 says consider CEA in 50–69% if safety criteria are met, ESO 2021 suggests CEA in this band, and SVS prioritizes CEA over CAS for > 50% symptomatic lesions in appropriate candidates, reinforcing the need for careful selection and center-level performance thresholds [^115fq8mA] [^112ckJDM] [^112bKY8p].

> For symptomatic stenosis under 50%, I should confirm that revascularization is unusual and reserved for exceptional scenarios such as recurrent TIAs or minor strokes despite optimal medical therapy when plaque instability is suspected, and only after multidisciplinary review. Wait, I should double-check ESVS: yes, ESVS 2023 allows consideration in highly selected cases, and observational data underscore the potential role of unstable plaque rather than luminal narrowing per se, but this remains the exception not the rule [^117NrQnU] [^116X9JzP] [^112nwXCh].

> Turning to asymptomatic disease, I need to verify the default higher threshold given the lower event rates with contemporary medical therapy; ESVS 2023 recommends considering CEA for 60–99% asymptomatic stenosis if the 30-day stroke/death risk is under 3%, life expectancy exceeds 5 years, and there is at least one clinical or imaging high-risk feature for future stroke. Let me make sure ESO is consistent: ESO 2021 similarly supports CEA in ≥ 60% asymptomatic patients judged at increased risk under medical therapy alone, which reinforces a selective, not automatic, approach [^112V6ZUd] [^116LyrvG].

> But wait, what if the threshold is stated as > 70% in some guidance; am I misremembering ESVS here? Hmm, wait a minute, SVS 2022 indeed favors intervention in asymptomatic stenosis greater than 70% when perioperative risk is under 3% and life expectancy is adequate, whereas ESVS and ESO frame consideration from 60–99% with added high-risk features; I initially conflated these, but the correction is that ESVS/ESO use 60–99% with risk stratification, while SVS emphasizes > 70% for average-risk patients, all still insisting on excellent safety metrics and sufficient longevity to realize benefit [^1147uP1h] [^112V6ZUd] [^112V6ZUd] [^116LyrvG].

> Next, I should review timing, because for symptomatic patients the benefit decays with delay; early CEA ideally within 14 days of the last event is recommended, and for unstable presentations like stroke-in-evolution or crescendo TIAs, urgent intervention within 24 hours may be warranted in experienced centers. Let me verify the cross-guideline agreement: ESO 2021 and SVS 2022 stress surgery within 2 weeks when indicated, ESC 2024 reiterates within 14 days, and ESVS 2023 allows urgent procedures within 24 hours for specific unstable scenarios, all contingent on institutional expertise and careful selection [^113trhE4] [^113rSJHx] [^1122FeSx] [^112cmTQy].

> I need to ensure I articulate the acceptable 30-day periprocedural risk thresholds since they are pivotal to net benefit: under 6% for symptomatic candidates and under 3% for asymptomatic candidates, acknowledging that some expert consensus suggests even tighter targets. Let me double-check the evidentiary basis: ESVS 2023 and SVS guidelines codify these limits, and meta-analyses comparing CEA and CAS emphasize procedural stroke risks as key drivers of the risk–benefit equation, with CEA generally showing lower periprocedural stroke but higher MI than CAS, reinforcing the importance of center-level performance and individualized trade-offs [^113VQFN2] [^115fq8mA] [^1147uP1h] [^112q3Ans] [^112V8k3Q] [^114H1DZf].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers that may lower or raise thresholds within guideline ranges; plaque vulnerability features like intraplaque hemorrhage or ulceration can increase embolic risk even with moderate stenosis, age modifies CAS versus CEA risk such that CEA is typically favored in older patients while CAS may be reasonable under age 70 in selected symptomatic cases, life expectancy over 5 years is essential to justify prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic disease, and anatomic factors can tilt selection toward CAS or CEA depending on arch access, calcification, lesion length, prior radiation, and restenosis. Hold on, I should verify the guidance supports multidisciplinary deliberation to synthesize these factors, and ESVS explicitly endorses MDT review and individualized modality selection in complex scenarios [^112nwXCh] [^115RVLMb] [^112V6ZUd] [^111Gs9Nm] [^112bsX7R] [^112GHW6q].

> I should double-check how to reconcile minor differences across societies; the core consensus is that symptomatic patients with ≥ 50% stenosis benefit from revascularization, especially at ≥ 70%, provided the 30-day stroke/death risk is under 6% and the procedure is performed expeditiously, whereas asymptomatic patients may be considered for CEA in the 60–99% (ESVS/ESO) or > 70% (SVS) range only if procedural risk is under 3%, life expectancy is adequate, and high-risk plaque or clinical features are present. Let me verify representative citations to ensure this synthesis is accurate across ESVS, ESO, SVS, and ESC documents, which it is, noting these differences reflect varying interpretations of modern medical therapy's impact and marginal benefit at intermediate severities [^113VQFN2] [^115fq8mA] [^112V6ZUd] [^1147uP1h] [^116LyrvG] [^115uNCC2].

> For symptomatic carotid stenosis, I will now outline the decision flow in prose and make sure each step aligns with the thresholds and timing: first, I should confirm a qualifying ipsilateral neurological event within 6 months and quantify stenosis with validated imaging; if stenosis is 70–99%, I should recommend CEA promptly, ideally within 14 days, ensuring the center's 30-day stroke/death rate is below 6%; if 50–69%, I should consider CEA when the procedural risk is below 6% and the patient profile is favorable; if under 50%, I should reserve intervention for rare, carefully vetted cases with recurrent events and suspected plaque instability after multidisciplinary review, all on a backbone of best medical therapy [^113VQFN2] [^115fq8mA] [^113trhE4] [^112bsX7R].

> For asymptomatic carotid stenosis, I should verify absence of recent symptoms, confirm stenosis severity, and then apply selective criteria; if stenosis is in the 60–99% range with high-risk plaque or clinical features, life expectancy exceeds 5 years, and the institution's 30-day stroke/death risk is under 3%, I should discuss CEA as an option, whereas under SVS guidance the threshold is generally > 70% for average surgical risk; if these safety and longevity conditions are not met, I should favor intensive medical therapy alone and reassess risk over time [^112V6ZUd] [^116LyrvG] [^1147uP1h] [^111RDND3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about modality; I need to ensure the choice between CEA and stenting reflects procedural risk profiles and anatomy, since meta-analyses show lower periprocedural stroke with CEA but lower MI and cranial nerve injury with CAS, and ESO suggests CAS may be considered in symptomatic patients under 70 in experienced hands, especially when surgical risk is high or anatomy favors endovascular approaches. Let me double-check representative comparative data and guideline allowances to support this nuanced selection [^112V8k3Q] [^114H1DZf] [^115RVLMb] [^112GHW6q].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure I clearly state that CEA indications are not a single number but a matrix of symptom status, stenosis grade, timing, and procedural safety: for symptomatic patients, ≥ 50% stenosis is the functional threshold, with a strong, unequivocal indication at ≥ 70% when the 30-day risk is under 6% and treatment is within 14 days; for asymptomatic patients, consideration typically begins at 60–99% with high-risk features (ESVS/ESO) or > 70% (SVS) and only when the 30-day risk is under 3% and life expectancy exceeds 5 years, all within a multidisciplinary, individualized framework that incorporates plaque phenotype, anatomy, age, and institutional outcomes [^113VQFN2] [^115fq8mA] [^112V6ZUd] [^1147uP1h] [^116LyrvG] [^1122FeSx].

Thresholds for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) depend on stenosis severity, symptom status, and procedural risk [^1169B4xe]. In symptomatic patients, CEA is indicated for **70–99% stenosis** [^113VQFN2] and should be performed **within 14 days** [^1122FeSx] when the 30-day stroke/death risk is < 6% [^115uNCC2]. For symptomatic **50–69%** stenosis [^115fq8mA], CEA may be considered if the 30-day risk is < 6%. In asymptomatic patients, CEA may be considered for **60–99% stenosis with high-risk features** [^112V6ZUd] when the 30-day risk is < 3% [^111RDND3] and life expectancy is ≥ 5 years. CEA is not recommended [^112bsX7R] for **< 50% symptomatic stenosis** [^117NrQnU] or **< 60% asymptomatic stenosis** [^112V6ZUd].

## Symptomatic carotid stenosis

Symptomatic carotid stenosis is defined by **recent neurological symptoms (within the past 6 months)** [^113VQFN2] — such as transient ischemic attack (TIA), amaurosis fugax [^112E62c5], or non-disabling stroke — attributable to carotid artery stenosis.

---

### Indications for CEA in symptomatic patients

- **Severe stenosis (70–99%)**: CEA is strongly recommended for patients with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis, provided the 30-day risk of death or stroke is < 6% [^115nYNZC] [^113VQFN2].

- **Moderate stenosis (50–69%)**: CEA is considered for patients with moderate symptomatic stenosis [^112ckJDM] if the 30-day risk of death or stroke is < 6% [^115fq8mA].

- **Timing**: CEA should be performed as early as possible [^1122FeSx], ideally within 14 days [^113rSJHx] of the initial neurological event, to maximize benefit [^113trhE4].

---

### Special considerations

Special considerations include **symptomatic near occlusion** [^114KtPv2] with distal vessel collapse and ongoing symptoms despite best medical therapy, in which CEA or carotid artery stenting (CAS) may be considered after multidisciplinary team review. CEA is generally **not recommended for low-grade symptomatic stenosis (< 50%)**, except in selected cases with recurrent TIAs or minor strokes despite optimal medical therapy and after thorough neurovascular workup with multidisciplinary review [^112bsX7R] [^116X9JzP].

---

## Asymptomatic carotid stenosis

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is defined by the absence of **recent neurological symptoms** attributable to carotid artery stenosis [^112V6ZUd].

---

### Indications for CEA in asymptomatic patients

In asymptomatic patients, indications include **severe stenosis (≥ 70%)** [^1147uP1h], for which CEA is recommended if the perioperative risk of stroke or death is < 3% [^115HKnA9] and life expectancy is at least 3–5 years [^111RDND3]. CEA may also be considered for **moderate stenosis (60–69%) when high-risk features are present** (e.g. rapid progression, silent infarction, microemboli, or vulnerable plaque) [^116LyrvG] and the perioperative risk is < 3% [^112tA3wy] [^112V6ZUd].

---

### Special considerations

Special considerations include **high-risk features** — rapid progression of stenosis, silent infarction on imaging, microemboli detected by transcranial Doppler, or vulnerable plaque characteristics [^112tA3wy] — which may warrant CEA in asymptomatic patients [^112V6ZUd] [^116LyrvG]. CEA is generally **not recommended when life expectancy is limited (< 3–5 years)** [^111RDND3] or when significant comorbidities increase perioperative risk [^1147uP1h].

---

## Procedural risk thresholds

The decision to perform CEA is guided by the **estimated perioperative risk of stroke or death** [^116okHxj]:

| **Patient group** | **Recommended perioperative risk threshold** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic patients | < 6% [^113VQFN2] [^115fq8mA] |
| Asymptomatic patients | < 3% [^1147uP1h] [^111RDND3] |

---

## Summary of indications

| **Patient group** | **Degree of stenosis** | **Indication for CEA** | **Perioperative risk threshold** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Symptomatic | 70–99% | Strongly recommended [^113VQFN2] | < 6% |
| Symptomatic | 50–69% | Considered [^115fq8mA] [^112ckJDM] | < 6% |
| Symptomatic | < 50% | Generally not recommended (except selected cases) [^112bsX7R] | < 6% |
| Asymptomatic | ≥ 70% | Recommended [^1147uP1h] | < 3% |
| Asymptomatic | 60–69% | Considered if high-risk features present [^112V6ZUd] | < 3% |
| Asymptomatic | < 60% | Not recommended [^112V6ZUd] | < 3% |

---

Carotid endarterectomy is indicated for **symptomatic patients with 70–99% stenosis** [^112E62c5] and for **asymptomatic patients with ≥ 70% stenosis** [^1147uP1h], provided perioperative risk is acceptable and life expectancy is reasonable. The decision to perform CEA should be individualized [^112GHW6q] based on patient-specific factors, including symptom status, stenosis severity, procedural risk, and life expectancy.

### Endarterectomy vs stenting for carotid artery stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113SGhRR]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The relative efficacy and safety of endarterectomy and stenting in patients with carotid stenosis remain unclear. In this review, we synthesize the available evidence derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the two procedures in terms of the risks of death, stroke (disabling and nondisabling), and nonfatal myocardial infarction.

We searched for RCTs in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Contents, Cochrane CENTRAL, expert files, and bibliographies of included articles. Two reviewers, working independently, determined trial eligibility and extracted descriptive, methodological, and outcome data from each eligible RCT. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to assess relative and absolute risks, and the I² statistic was used to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect among trials.

Ten RCTs with 3182 participants proved eligible. At 30 days, and compared with endarterectomy, carotid stenting was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of death (relative risk [RR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.27–1.37; I² = 0%), a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.17–1.11; I² = 0%), and a nonsignificant increase in the risk of any stroke (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.73–2.26; I² = 40%) and major/disabling stroke (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.32–3.52; I² = 45%). If one considers the two procedures equivalent if the absolute difference in events is < 2%, these results provide moderate-quality evidence for equivalence with respect to death (risk difference [RD] -0.40, 95% CI -1.02 to).

### Unstable atherosclerotic plaque in the common carotid artery: Diagnosis and treatment strategy [^112nwXCh]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The indication for carotid artery stenosis treatment is primarily based on the severity of internal carotid stenosis. There is increasing evidence that unstable plaques in the extracranial carotid artery may be responsible for ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attacks as a source of emboli, even in the presence of moderate stenosis. Physicians should be aware that morphological characteristics of carotid plaques indicating recent intra-plaque hemorrhage might necessitate intervention, even in the absence of severe stenosis. This report details a patient with an unstable plaque in the common carotid artery who met clinical criteria for intervention due to the risk of future stroke.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carotid artery stenosis, particularly carotid artery stenting in asymptomatic patients, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering carotid artery stenting in addition to optimal medical treatment. This is suggested as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for average-surgical-risk patients with a carotid artery stenosis of 60–99% when high-risk features are present.

### Informed consent: What level of risk to disclose with carotid artery endarterectomy [^113z7oYk]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

You are asked to see a 65-year-old man with an asymptomatic high-grade carotid artery stenosis. He is otherwise quite healthy, is receiving appropriate medical management, and has no contraindications for surgery. You recommend a carotid endarterectomy (CEA) as the best prophylactic measure against stroke. During the informed consent process, the patient asks for a specific estimate of the risks. What specific level of risk should you quote to your patient?

### Best medical therapy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis: Imminent or ineffective [^113gC1CD]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Carotid artery disease accounts for approximately 20% of all ischemic strokes, a major cause of morbidity, and the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. Landmark trials in the 1990s, such as the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial, established carotid endarterectomy (CEA) plus best medical therapy (BMT) as the standard of care for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis over 60%. However, advances in medical therapy and the emergence of carotid artery stenting (CAS) have prompted a reevaluation of treatment efficacy. Recent studies have questioned the superiority of CEA over BMT alone in reducing stroke risk, suggesting no significant difference in outcomes with contemporary medical management.

In addition, analysis from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs indicated minimal net benefit of CEA over BMT when accounting for all-cause mortality. Comparative studies have found no significant difference in long-term stroke-free survival between CEA and CAS. However, procedural risks vary, with higher myocardial infarction rates associated with CEA and higher stroke rates with CAS. Identifying high-risk plaques and patient-specific risk factors remains crucial. Meta-analyses have highlighted features such as neovascularization and lipid-rich cores as predictors of stenosis progression and ischemic events. Ongoing research, particularly the CREST-2 trial, aims to provide clear guidance on the optimal treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis. This trial emphasizes stringent adherence to modern BMT protocols and includes…

### Long-term outcomes after stenting versus endarterectomy for treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis: The International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS) randomised trial [^1146h9vk]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

Stenting is an alternative to endarterectomy for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis, but its long-term efficacy remains uncertain. We report long-term data from the randomised International Carotid Stenting Study comparison of these treatments.

- **Methods**: Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive stenting or endarterectomy at 50 centres worldwide. Randomisation was computer-generated centrally and allocated by telephone call or fax. Major outcomes were assessed by an independent endpoint committee that was unaware of treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was a fatal or disabling stroke in any territory from the time of randomisation to the end of follow-up. Analysis was conducted by intention to treat ([ITT] all patients) and per protocol from 31 days after treatment (all patients in whom the assigned treatment was completed). Functional ability was rated with the modified Rankin scale. This study is registered with number ISRCTN25337470.

- **Findings**: A total of 1713 patients were assigned to stenting (n = 855) or endarterectomy (n = 858) and followed up for a median of 4.2 years (IQR 3.0–5.2, maximum 10.0). Three patients withdrew immediately, resulting in an ITT population of 1710 patients. The number of fatal or disabling strokes (52 vs. 49) and the cumulative 5-year risk did not differ significantly between the stenting and endarterectomy groups (6.4% vs. 6.5%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.72–1.57, p = 0.77). Any stroke was more frequent in the stenting group than in the endarterectomy group (119 vs. 72 events; ITT population, 5-year cumulative risk 15.2% vs. 9.4%).

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^112q3Ans]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). High credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis is a cornerstone of stroke prevention and has been the subject of extensive clinical investigation, including multiple controlled randomized trials. The appropriate treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to the community of vascular surgeons. In 2008, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, only one randomized trial, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS), had been published. Since that publication, four major randomized trials comparing CEA and CAS have been published, and the role of medical management has been re-emphasized.

The publication updates and expands the 2008 guidelines with specific emphasis on six areas: imaging in identification and characterization of carotid stenosis, medical therapy (as stand-alone management and also in conjunction with intervention in patients with carotid bifurcation stenosis), risk stratification to select patients for appropriate interventional management (CEA or CAS), technical standards for performing CEA and CAS, the relative roles of CEA and CAS, and management of unusual conditions associated with extracranial carotid pathology. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system, as has been done with other Society for Vascular Surgery guideline documents. The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be less than 3% to ensure benefit for the patient.

### Has evidence changed practice? Appropriateness of carotid endarterectomy after the clinical trials [^112yHXu1]. Neurology (2007). High credibility.

To assess how the appropriateness of and indications for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) have changed following the publication of several large international randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to rationalize the use of CEA, the New York Carotid Artery Surgery Study (NYCAS) was conducted. NYCAS is a population-based cohort study of all CEAs performed on elderly patients from January 1998 through June 1999 in New York State. Detailed clinical data were abstracted from medical charts to assess the indications for and appropriateness of surgery using a list of 1,557 indications for CEA developed by national experts using RAND appropriateness methods. Deaths and strokes within 30 days of surgery were ascertained and confirmed by two physicians.

Among the 9,588 patients, the mean age was 74.6 years, and 93.6% had 70 to 99% carotid stenosis. Nearly three-quarters of patients (72.3%) underwent CEA for asymptomatic stenosis, 18.6% for TIA, and 9.1% for stroke. Overall, 87.1% of operations were done for appropriate reasons, 4.3% for uncertain reasons, and 8.6% for inappropriate reasons (vs. 32% inappropriate before the RCTs, p < 0.0001). Among procedures judged inappropriate, the most common reasons were high comorbidity in asymptomatic patients (62.2%), operating following a major stroke (14.2%), or for minimal stenosis (10.5%). Among asymptomatic patients, those with high comorbidity had over twice the risk of death or stroke compared to those without high comorbidity (7.13% vs. 2.69%, p < 0.0001).

Since the publication of the randomized controlled trials, there has been a noted decrease in inappropriate procedures, highlighting the trials' impact on clinical practice.

### Prediction of severe baseline asymptomatic carotid stenosis and subsequent risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease [^114ZihLW]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Carotid-specific interventions, such as carotid surgery and stenting, are also available. These interventions do not prevent all future strokes but approximately halve the long-term risk of stroke incidence. However, with declining risks of ipsilateral stroke over time (without intervention), these interventions should only be restricted to selected patients in whom the procedural risks are sufficiently outweighed. Previous studies showed comparable long-term outcomes after carotid surgery and stenting but higher procedural risks of carotid stenting. Risk models to select those patients at high risk of ipsilateral stroke under medical therapy that might warrant a carotid intervention have not been validated. Validated models will help in identifying a subset of patients in whom there might be a benefit of a carotid procedure but also to refrain from unnecessary procedures in patients with low risks of ipsilateral stroke. The latest Society for Vascular Surgery and European Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for the management of carotid disease have acknowledged a validated risk model as a research priority. If clear indications for carotid interventions in patients with ACAS are established, this will reinforce the need for selective screening.

### Timing of carotid intervention [^114asK69]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

In most patients, the indication for carotid intervention has been based on neurological symptoms in combination with the degree of stenosis in the ipsilateral carotid artery. Recently, the role of timing of revascularization in the prevention of restroke in symptomatic patients has gained interest. The evidence to underpin early surgery is principally based on a post hoc subgroup analysis performed by the Carotid Endarterectomy Trialists Collaboration (CETC) on pooled data from two RCTs. The results of these RCTs were published almost three decades ago, and patient adherence to antiplatelet therapy and statin was low to moderate. The number of patients needed to operate on to prevent one ipsilateral stroke in five years' time was five for patients randomized within two weeks following their last ischemic event, compared with 125 when randomized after more than twelve weeks. However, this was not a preplanned analysis and is therefore subject to potential confounding. The two-week threshold was selected for methodological convenience rather than having any clinical relevance. Some subgroups, such as men with non-ocular events, may benefit fully 14 days or more after the initial event, whereas the benefit for subgroups at low risk of restroke (such as women with ocular symptoms) remains uncertain and is being investigated in ECST-2 (European Carotid Surgery Trials 2). Nevertheless, based on the CETC analysis, most international guidelines on the treatment of carotid artery disease now recommend that carotid revascularization is undertaken within 14 days of the index event.

### European stroke organisation guideline on endarterectomy and stenting for carotid artery stenosis [^115HKnA9]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. The aim of this guideline is to analyze the evidence pertaining to medical, surgical, and endovascular treatment of patients with carotid stenosis. These guidelines were developed based on the ESO standard operating procedure and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The working group identified relevant questions, performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and wrote recommendations.

- **Carotid endarterectomy recommendations**: Based on moderate quality evidence, we recommend carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with ≥ 60–99% asymptomatic carotid stenosis considered to be at increased risk of stroke on best medical treatment (BMT) alone. We also recommend CEA for patients with ≥ 70–99% symptomatic stenosis, and we suggest CEA for patients with 50–69% symptomatic stenosis. Based on high quality evidence, we recommend CEA should be performed early, ideally within two weeks of the last retinal or cerebral ischaemic event in patients with ≥ 50–99% symptomatic stenosis.

- **Carotid artery stenting considerations**: Based on low quality evidence, carotid artery stenting (CAS) may be considered in patients < 70 years old with symptomatic ≥ 50–99% carotid stenosis.

Several randomized trials supporting these recommendations were started decades ago, and BMT, CEA, and CAS have evolved since. The results of another large trial comparing outcomes after CAS versus CEA in patients with asymptomatic stenosis are anticipated in the near future. Further trials are needed.

Secondary end points: Periprocedural stroke was reported in nine studies, two of which did not observe any stroke during this period. The average weighted incidence of stroke was 4.2% (95% confidence interval 2.7% to 6.1%) for carotid endarterectomy versus 5.7% (3.0% to 9.2%) for carotid artery stenting. The risk of stroke was significantly lower for carotid endarterectomy (odds ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.00; P = 0.049; I² = 48.4%, P = 0.071).

### Carotid plaque volume in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy [^113AETL9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The main indication for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the severity of carotid artery stenosis, even though most strokes in carotid disease are embolic. The relationship between carotid plaque volume (CPV) and symptoms of cerebral ischaemia, as well as the measurement of CPV by minimally invasive tomographic ultrasound imaging, were investigated.

- **Methods**: The volume of the endarterectomy specimen was measured using a validated saline suspension technique in patients undergoing CEA. The time from the last symptom and severity of stenosis measured by duplex ultrasonography were recorded. Middle cerebral artery emboli were counted using transcranial Doppler imaging (TCD) in a subset of patients.

- **Results**: A total of 339 patients were included, with 270 exhibiting symptomatic carotid stenosis and 69 asymptomatic. The mean (standard deviation) CPV was higher in symptomatic patients compared to asymptomatic ones (0.97(0.43) cm³ vs. 0.74(0.41) cm³; p < 0.001). CPV did not correlate with the severity of carotid stenosis (p = 0.770). The mean CPV was highest at 1.03(0.46) cm³ in the 4 weeks following cerebral symptoms, declining to 0.78(0.36) cm³ beyond 8 weeks. Among 33 patients who had TCD, mean CPV was 1.00(0.48) cm³ in the 27 patients with ipsilateral cerebral emboli compared to 0.67(0.16) cm³ in those without (p = 0.142). There was an excellent correlation between CPV measured by tomographic ultrasound imaging and the endarterectomy specimen in 34 patients (r = 0.93, p < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: CPV correlated with symptoms of cerebral ischaemia but did not correlate with carotid stenosis. It could be a potential indicator for CEA.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^113e58ow]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

Periprocedural mortality was reported as an end point in eight trials; in three, no deaths were observed in either group. The average weighted incidence of death was 1.4% (95% confidence interval 0.08% to 2.1%) for carotid endarterectomy and 1.2% (0.7% to 1.8%) for carotid artery stenting. Overall, there was no significant difference between patients treated with carotid endarterectomy versus carotid artery stenting (odds ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 2.31; P = 0.727; I² = 0%; P = 0.697).

Data on the composite endpoint of periprocedural disabling stroke or death was available from eight trials; no events were observed in two. The weighted average event rate was 2.9% (95% confidence interval 1.9% to 4.3%) for carotid endarterectomy versus 3.8% (2.3% to 5.7%) for carotid artery stenting. In the direct comparison, this difference was not significant (odds ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 1.05; P = 0.088; I² = 0%; P = 0.600). For the Stent-Supported Percutaneous Angioplasty of the Carotid Artery versus Endarterectomy (SPACE) trial, the composite endpoint was defined as ipsilateral disabling stroke or death. For the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS), only per protocol data were available for this endpoint, and these data were used instead of intention-to-treat data.

The rate of periprocedural myocardial infarction was reported in four trials. The weighted average infarction rate was 2.6% (95% confidence interval 0.4% to 6.3%) for carotid endarterectomy versus 0.9% (0.05% to 2.9%) for carotid artery stenting. The risk of infarction was significantly different between the two procedures.

### Treatment of carotid stenosis in asymptomatic, nonoctogenarian, standard risk patients with stenting versus endarterectomy trials [^111sPyQY]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is the most frequent indication for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the United States. Published trials and guidelines support CEA indications in selected patients with longer projected survival and when periprocedural complications are low. Transfemoral carotid artery stenting with embolic protection (CAS) is a newer treatment option. This study aimed to compare outcomes in asymptomatic, nonoctogenarian patients treated with CAS versus CEA.

Patient-level data was analyzed from 2544 subjects with ≥ 70% asymptomatic carotid stenosis who were randomized to CAS or CEA, in addition to standard medical therapy. One trial enrolled 1091 patients (548 CAS, 543 CEA), and another enrolled 1453 patients (1089 CAS, 364 CEA) who were less than 80 years old. Independent neurologic assessments and routine cardiac enzyme screenings were performed. The prespecified primary composite endpoint was any stroke, myocardial infarction, or death during the periprocedural period or ipsilateral stroke within four years after randomization.

There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between CAS and CEA (5.3% vs. 5.1%; hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.7–1.5; p = 0.91). Periprocedural rates for the components were as follows (CAS vs. CEA): any stroke (2.7% vs. 1.5%; p = 0.07), myocardial infarction (0.6% vs. 1.7%; p = 0.01), death (0.1% vs. 0.2%; p = 0.62), and any stroke or death (2.7% vs. 1.6%; p = 0.07). After this period, the rates of ipsilateral stroke were similar (2.3% vs. 2.2%; p = 0.97).

### Comparative effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy vs initial medical therapy in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^111Qu2cV]. JAMA Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have established that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is beneficial in preventing stroke in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. However, the most recent of the three trials that established the clinical benefit of CEA compared with medical therapy in asymptomatic patients was initiated 25 years ago. In the intervening period, new pharmacological advances, such as high-potency statins and improved antiplatelet regimens, as well as quality improvements in the treatment of blood pressure and diabetes, may be associated with the reduced stroke rate among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Empirical evidence in support of a reduction in stroke risk among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has been provided by a systematic review of several studies. If the decrease in stroke rate among patients with carotid artery stenosis is associated with improvements in primary stroke prevention, revascularization may no longer be the preferred treatment strategy.

Since the first RCT was published that demonstrated the superiority of CEA compared with medical therapy for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, concerns have emerged that the outcomes seen in a clinical trial setting may not be reproducible in non-RCT settings because of demonstrated less optimal surgical outcomes, higher complication rates in low-volume hospitals, and poor patient selection. The risk-to-benefit ratio of interventions may be less favorable outside of RCTs.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^113HCmZh]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative short-term safety and intermediate-term efficacy of carotid endarterectomy versus carotid artery stenting.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
- **Data sources**: BIOSIS, Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts database, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched, along with bibliographies from January 1, 1990, to July 25, 2009.
- **Study selection**: Randomised controlled trials comparing carotid endarterectomy with carotid artery stenting in patients with carotid artery stenosis, with or without symptoms, were selected.
- **Data extraction**: The primary endpoint was a composite of mortality or stroke. Secondary endpoints included death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or facial neuropathy as individual end points, and mortality or disabling stroke as a composite endpoint.
- **Data synthesis**: Eleven trials were included, comprising 4,796 patients. Of these, ten trials reported on short-term outcomes (n = 4,709) and nine on intermediate-term outcomes (1–4 years). The periprocedural risk of mortality or stroke was lower for carotid endarterectomy (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.95; P = 0.025) compared to carotid stenting, mainly due to a decreased risk of stroke (0.65, 0.43 to 1.00; P = 0.049). However, the risk of death (1.14, 0.56 to 2.31; P = 0.727) and the composite endpoint of mortality or disabling stroke (0.74, 0.53 to 1.05; P = 0.088) did not differ significantly. The odds of periprocedural myocardial infarction (2.69, 1.06 to 6.79; P = 0.036) or cranial nerve injury (10.2, 4.0 to 26.1; P < 0.001) were higher in the carotid endarterectomy group.

### Does the 'high risk' patient with asymptomatic carotid stenosis really exist [^1131QwKw]? European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Recent evidence indicates that the risk of stroke symptoms in non-operated, medically managed patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis has fallen significantly over the last 25 years. This suggests improvements in the efficacy of medical interventions for vascular disease. If the latest estimates of the average annual stroke rate for non-operated patients reflect contemporary medical intervention and surgical stroke/death rates match those of the randomized trials, the implication is that carotid surgery will not offer a stroke prevention advantage over medical intervention alone.

Furthermore, it is still not possible to identify patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis who have a higher than average ipsilateral stroke risk despite medical intervention. Even if such patients were one day reliably identified, they could also be at higher risk of stroke/death from instrumental interventions (surgery, angioplasty, or stenting), and randomized trials would be required to justify such procedures in routine clinical practice.

### Comparison of the five 2011 guidelines for the treatment of carotid stenosis [^112DowA2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). High credibility.

In 2011, five independent, international guideline committees reported their recommendations for the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. These included the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the Society for Vascular Surgery, the European Society of Cardiology, the Australasian, and the UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence. As the recommendations of these five guideline committees were based on the same published literature, it would be expected that they are similar, at least to a large extent. Surprisingly, there were considerable differences between the five guidelines regarding the management of both symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid patients. The differences in the recommendations between the five guideline committees are analyzed and discussed.

### Carotid artery stenting vs. endarterectomy [^113Jxbeg]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is superior to medical management for stroke prevention in patients with symptomatic and, to a lesser degree, asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis. However, large-scale registries have shown that the adverse event rates following CEA are commonly higher than observed in the trials.

In the last decade, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as a less invasive alternative to surgery. To address the efficacy of CAS, we performed a meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials comparing CAS with CEA in 4648 mainly symptomatic patients. The analysis showed that CAS was associated with a statistically significant increased death or stroke rate at 30 days compared with CEA (odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.26–2.02). However, most of the trials had inadequate requirements in terms of endovascular expertise and did not mandate the use of emboli protection devices.

Beyond 30 days, long-term follow-up of the trials previously reported suggests that both revascularization techniques are equivalent in terms of stroke prevention. Conversely, large-scale high-quality CAS registries — mostly with independent neurological assessment and clinical event committee adjudication — have reported results in the range of recommendation for CEA in over 20,000 patients, despite the fact that the majority of patients were at high risk for surgery. Until further data become available, the performance of CAS should be limited to protocols or centers of excellence and targeted especially to patients.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^112V8k3Q]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

To evaluate the relative short-term safety and intermediate-term efficacy of carotid endarterectomy versus carotid artery stenting, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. The data were sourced from BIOSIS, Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts database, ISI Web of Science, Google Scholar, and bibliographies, ranging from 1 January 1990 to 25 July 2009.

Randomized controlled trials compared carotid endarterectomy with carotid artery stenting in patients with carotid artery stenosis, with or without symptoms. The primary endpoint was a composite of mortality or stroke. Secondary endpoints included individual occurrences of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or facial neuropathy, and a composite endpoint of mortality or disabling stroke.

The synthesis included 11 trials with 4796 patients. Ten trials reported short-term outcomes (n = 4709), and nine reported intermediate-term outcomes (1–4 years). The periprocedural risk of mortality or stroke was lower for carotid endarterectomy, with an odds ratio of 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.95; P = 0.025), than for carotid stenting, primarily due to a decreased risk of stroke (0.65, 0.43 to 1.00; P = 0.049). The risk of death (1.14, 0.56 to 2.31; P = 0.727) and the composite endpoint mortality or disabling stroke (0.74, 0.53 to 1.05; P = 0.088) did not differ significantly. However, the odds of periprocedural myocardial infarction (2.69, 1.06 to 6.79; P = 0.036) or cranial nerve injury (10.2, 4.0 to 26.1; P < 0.001) were higher in the carotid endarterectomy group.

### A critical look at "high-risk" in choosing the proper intervention for patients with carotid bifurcation disease [^112pJ3oP]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Refinements in the technique of carotid endarterectomy have been accompanied by a growing literature calling into question the notion that a broad class of patients is at high risk for surgery due to clinical comorbidities. Moreover, progress in the percutaneous revascularization of carotid bifurcation disease has highlighted the need for direct comparisons between endarterectomy and stenting across the entire spectrum of perioperative risk. The improved safety of carotid stenting, to some extent due to the advent of cerebral protection devices, has further altered the risk-to-benefit analysis. Lastly, dramatic improvements in medical therapy for the systemic manifestations of atherosclerosis have prompted a reevaluation of carotid revascularization as the standard of care for patients with severe carotid bifurcation stenosis. Endarterectomy and stenting each have unique procedure-specific factors that determine whether a patient is at increased risk for perioperative complications. Determining which patients are at high risk for these modalities will impact the individualized treatment algorithm. This article examines the anatomical and physiologic conditions that can affect the anticipated outcome of each treatment modality. Ultimately, a tailored approach to each patient's clinical situation is likely to result in the best outcome following treatment.

### Management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis in patients undergoing general and vascular surgical procedures [^1141ZtMp]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Available data do not seem to support the strategy for carotid endarterectomy prior to surgical intervention in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. However, in patients with coronary artery disease, synchronous carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting should be considered where there is a proven surgical risk of 60% or bilateral carotid stenosis > 75% on the same side as the most severe stenosis. Clarification of the optimal strategy requires an adequately powered, multicenter, randomized clinical trial.

### Carotid endarterectomy [^114PH6fn]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is performed to prevent embolic stroke in patients with atheromatous disease at the carotid bifurcation. There is now substantial evidence to support early operation in symptomatic patients, ideally within two weeks of the last neurological symptoms. Thus, the anaesthetist may be faced with a high-risk patient in whom there has been limited time for preoperative preparation. The operation may be performed under local or general anaesthesia, and the advantages and disadvantages of both are explored in this review.

Carotid shunting may offer a degree of cerebral protection but carries its own risks and has not been proved to reduce morbidity and mortality. The use of carotid shunts is based on clinical judgement, awake neurological monitoring, and the use of monitors of cerebral perfusion. There is no ideal monitor of cerebral perfusion in the patient receiving general anaesthesia.

Both the intraoperative and postoperative periods may witness dramatic haemodynamic changes that may compromise the cerebral or myocardial circulations. In particular, postoperative hypotension may compromise both myocardial and cerebral perfusion, and severe hypertension can cause cerebral hyperperfusion. There is, as yet, limited evidence to guide the management of these problems.

In summary, CEA can yield significant benefit, but those with the most to gain from the operation also present the greatest challenge to the anaesthetist.

This study included all patients who underwent either carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) for carotid stenosis — whether asymptomatic, symptomatic, emergency, or for other indications — from 2012 to 2018 in German hospitals (Fig. 1). Patients who underwent procedures other than CEA/CAS, combined/converted procedures, combined carotid-coronary or carotid-peripheral artery procedures, or CAS procedures performed primarily to gain access for an intracranial intervention were excluded. Additionally, patients with unknown or diverse sex were excluded to avoid extensive output blocking due to protection issues at the time of writing. Patients were categorized as asymptomatic, symptomatic, or others. Symptomatic patients were subcategorized as symptomatic 'elective' (amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attack [TIA], stroke, or other elective symptoms) or symptomatic 'emergency' (crescendo TIA, stroke-in-evolution, or other emergency symptoms) based on the urgency of the care provided. In total, 221,282 patients were included.

### Treating individuals 3: From subgroups to individuals: General principles and the example of carotid endarterectomy [^115CfwvZ]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Clinicians often have to make treatment decisions based on the likelihood that an individual patient will benefit. In this article, we consider the relevance of relative and absolute risk reductions, and draw attention to the importance of expressing the results of trials and subgroup analyses in terms of absolute risk. We describe the limitations of univariate subgroup analysis in situations where there are several determinants of treatment effect and review the potential for targeting treatments with risk models, especially when benefit is probably going to be dependent on the absolute risk of adverse outcomes with or without treatment. The ability to systematically take into account the characteristics of an individual patient and their interactions, to consider the risks and benefits of interventions separately if needed, and to provide patients with personalized estimates of their likelihood of benefit is shown using the example of endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis.

### 30 day results from the SPACE trial of stent-protected angioplasty versus carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients: a randomised non-inferiority trial [^113JttUu]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy is effective in stroke prevention for patients with severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, and carotid artery stenting has been widely used as an alternative treatment. Since equivalence or superiority has not been convincingly shown for either treatment, we aimed to compare the two.

- **Methods**: 1200 patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis were randomly assigned within 180 days of transient ischaemic attack or moderate stroke (modified Rankin scale score of ≤ 3) to carotid artery stenting (n = 605) or carotid endarterectomy (n = 595). The primary endpoint of this hospital-based study was ipsilateral ischaemic stroke or death from time of randomisation to 30 days after the procedure. The non-inferiority margin was defined as less than 2.5% on the basis of an expected event rate of 5%. Analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered at Controlled Trials with the international standard randomised controlled trial number ISRCTN57874028.

- **Findings**: 1183 patients were included in the analysis. The rate of death or ipsilateral ischaemic stroke from randomisation to 30 days after the procedure was 6.84% with carotid artery stenting and 6.34% with carotid endarterectomy (absolute difference 0.51%, 90% CI -1.89% to 2.91%). The one-sided p-value for non-inferiority is 0.09.

- **Interpretation**: SPACE failed to prove non-inferiority of carotid artery stenting compared with carotid endarterectomy for the periprocedural complication rate. The results of this trial do not justify the widespread use in the short term of carotid artery stenting over carotid endarterectomy.

### European stroke organisation guideline on endarterectomy and stenting for carotid artery stenosis [^112VvNpX]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. The aim of this guideline is to analyze the evidence pertaining to medical, surgical, and endovascular treatment of patients with carotid stenosis. These guidelines were developed based on the ESO standard operating procedure and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The working group identified relevant questions, performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and wrote recommendations.

Based on moderate quality evidence, we recommend carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with ≥ 60–99% asymptomatic carotid stenosis considered to be at increased risk of stroke on best medical treatment (BMT) alone. We also recommend CEA for patients with ≥ 70–99% symptomatic stenosis, and we suggest CEA for patients with 50–69% symptomatic stenosis. Based on high quality evidence, we recommend CEA should be performed early, ideally within two weeks of the last retinal or cerebral ischaemic event in patients with ≥ 50–99% symptomatic stenosis.

Based on low quality evidence, carotid artery stenting (CAS) may be considered in patients under 70 years old with symptomatic ≥ 50–99% carotid stenosis. Several randomized trials supporting these recommendations were started decades ago, and BMT, CEA, and CAS have evolved since. The results of another large trial comparing outcomes after CAS versus CEA in patients with asymptomatic stenosis are anticipated in the near future. Further trials are needed.

### Carotid artery stenting versus endarterectomy for treatment of carotid artery stenosis [^115uCcH8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stenting is an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis. This review updates a previous version first published in 1997 and subsequently updated in 2004, 2007, and 2012.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and risks of stenting compared with endarterectomy in people with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched August 2018) and the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Citation Index to August 2018. We also searched ongoing trials registers (August 2018) and reference lists, and contacted researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing stenting with endarterectomy for symptomatic or asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis were included. Additionally, we included RCTs comparing carotid artery stenting with medical therapy alone.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One review author selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. A second review author independently validated trial selection, and a third review author independently validated data extraction. We calculated treatment effects as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with endarterectomy as the reference group. We quantified heterogeneity using the I² statistic and used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of evidence.

- **Main results**: We included 22 trials involving 9753 participants. In participants with symptomatic carotid stenosis…

Regarding surgical interventions for carotid artery stenosis, and more specifically concerning carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend considering urgent carotid endarterectomy. This procedure should preferably be performed within 24 hours in patients with 50–99% stenoses who present with stroke in evolution or crescendo TIAs.

### Systematic review of guidelines for the management of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis [^1169B4xe]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

We systematically compared and appraised contemporary guidelines on the management of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched for guideline recommendations on carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty/stenting (CAS) published in any language between January 1, 2008, and January 28, 2015. Only the latest guideline per writing group was selected. Each guideline was analyzed independently by 2 to 6 authors to determine clinical scenarios covered, recommendations given, and scientific evidence used.

- **Results**: Thirty-four eligible guidelines were identified from 23 different regions/countries in 6 languages. Of 28 guidelines with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis procedural recommendations, 24 (86%) endorsed CEA (recommended it should or may be provided) for ≈50% to 99% average-surgical-risk asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, 17 (61%) endorsed CAS, 8 (29%) opposed CAS, and 1 (4%) endorsed medical treatment alone. For asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients considered high-CEA-risk because of comorbidities, vascular anatomy, or undefined reasons, CAS was endorsed in 13 guidelines (46%). Thirty-one of 33 guidelines (94%) with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis procedural recommendations endorsed CEA for patients with ≈50% to 99% average-CEA-risk symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, 19 (58%) endorsed CAS, and 9 (27%) opposed CAS. For high-CEA-risk symptomatic carotid artery stenosis because of comorbidities, vascular anatomy, or undefined reasons, CAS was endorsed in 27 guidelines (82%).

### Randomized controlled trials comparing endarterectomy and endovascular treatment for carotid artery stenosis: A Cochrane systematic review [^114h6mj2]. Stroke (2009). High credibility.

Endovascular treatment of carotid stenosis may be an alternative to surgical endarterectomy. We conducted a systematic review of the randomized evidence to assess the benefits and risks of endovascular treatment compared to surgery.

- **Methods**: Cochrane registers and online databases were searched, and researchers in the field were contacted. Outcome events were compared using odds ratios (ORs) calculated using the Peto fixed effect and Mantel-Haenszel random effects models if there was significant heterogeneity.

- **Results**: Ten trials involving 3178 patients were included. Not all contributed to each analysis. The primary outcome comparison of any stroke or death within 30 days of treatment favored surgery (fixed-effects OR 1.35); however, the difference was not statistically significant using the random effects model. Endovascular treatment was significantly better than surgery in avoiding cranial neuropathy (OR 0.15) and myocardial infarction (OR 0.34). There was no significant difference between endovascular treatment and surgery in the following comparisons: 30-day stroke, MI, or death (OR 1.12); 30-day disabling stroke or death (OR 1.19); 30-day death (OR 0.99); 24-month death or stroke (OR 1.26); and 30-day death or stroke in endovascular patients treated with or without protection devices (OR 0.75).

- **Conclusions**: The data are difficult to interpret because the trials are heterogeneous. Five trials were stopped early, perhaps leading to an overestimate of the risks of endovascular treatment. The results do not support a change in clinical practice away from endarterectomy.

### Editor's choice - European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2023 clinical practice guidelines on the management of atherosclerotic carotid and vertebral artery disease [^112zasuH]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carotid artery stenosis, particularly carotid artery stenting in asymptomatic patients, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend considering carotid artery stenting in asymptomatic patients assessed by a multidisciplinary team to be at high risk for surgery. This is advised for patients with an asymptomatic 60–99% stenosis who present with at least one imaging or clinical characteristic associated with an increased risk of late stroke under best medical therapy, provided the anatomy is favorable, and the 30-day death/stroke rate is less than 3%.

### Carotid endarterectomy: who is the high-risk patient [^112Sd1vG]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The role of carotid endarterectomy in the prevention of stroke was validated by two randomized clinical trials: the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy (NASCET) and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS). However, these trials excluded patients at high risk for perioperative stroke and other morbidity, raising concerns about the applicability of the trial results to the general population. Some have suggested that these "high-risk" patients are better suited for carotid artery stenting, with the belief that stenting has lower morbidity and mortality. In this article, we review many of the commonly accepted high-risk factors for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and examine their outcomes. High-risk patients are more common than generally believed, and their outcomes may be the same with carotid endarterectomy as with carotid stenting. Truly "high-risk" patients with shortened life expectancy are best served with no intervention.

### Carotid endarterectomy: Still the standard of care for carotid bifurcation disease [^115bZ6JK]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis are based on studies performed over a decade ago. Since then, significant advances have been made in medical management, notably high-dose statin therapy and improved antiplatelet agents, as well as in carotid interventions, such as the advent of carotid artery stenting. Particularly with carotid stenting, the technology has progressed substantially and continues to advance rapidly. These advancements have necessitated new studies to compare these treatments with the gold standard of carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

In asymptomatic patients, the data does not justify medical management alone for severe (> 80%) carotid stenosis. Furthermore, studies in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients have failed to demonstrate the equivalence of carotid artery stenting (CAS) to CEA for significant carotid stenosis. Clearly, additional studies comparing CAS, CEA, and medical management are needed to further clarify this issue. In the future, advancements in CAS technology and techniques may greatly expand the role of CAS beyond its current role in certain high-risk patient subsets. However, for the time being, CEA still remains the gold standard for carotid intervention.

### Safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment of carotid artery stenosis compared with carotid endarterectomy: A Cochrane systematic review of the randomized evidence [^116WwvmT]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Endovascular treatment of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis may be an alternative to surgical endarterectomy. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of endovascular techniques, we conducted a systematic review of randomized studies that compared endovascular treatment with surgery for carotid stenosis.

- **Methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index for randomized trials of carotid angioplasty and/or stenting compared with surgery. We also contacted researchers in the field and balloon catheter and stent manufacturers.

- **Results**: Five trials involving 1269 patients were included. Analysis of 30-day safety data found no significant difference in the odds of treatment-related death or any stroke (odds ratio [OR], endovascular surgery, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 2.04), death or disabling stroke (OR, 1.22; CI, 0.61 to 2.41), or death, any stroke, or myocardial infarction (OR, 1.04; CI, 0.69 to 1.57). At 1 year after randomization, there was no significant difference between the two treatments in the rate of any stroke or death (OR, 1.01; CI, 0.71 to 1.44). Endovascular treatment significantly reduced the risk of cranial nerve injury (OR, 0.13; CI, 0.06 to 0.25). There was substantial heterogeneity between the trials for four of the five outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: No significant difference in the major risks of treatment was found; however, the wide confidence intervals indicate that it is not possible to exclude a difference in favor of one treatment.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^116C74sP]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for carotid artery stenosis, particularly in patients with coronary artery disease, the SVS 2022 guidelines recommend considering performing carotid endarterectomy before or concomitantly with CABG to potentially reduce the risk of stroke and stroke/death in patients with symptomatic CAS 50–99% requiring both carotid endarterectomy and CABG. The decision on the sequencing of the intervention should be based on clinical presentation and institutional experience.

### An international, multispecialty, expert-based Delphi consensus document on controversial issues in the management of patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis [^111UQjkc]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this international, multi-specialty, expert-based Delphi Consensus document was to address unanswered questions concerning the management of patients with asymptomatic (AsxCS) and symptomatic (SxCS) carotid stenosis, aiding clinicians in decision-making when guidelines are unclear.

Fourteen controversial topics were identified. A three-round Delphi Consensus process was conducted with 61 experts. The aim of Round 1 was to explore differing views and opinions on these unresolved topics. In Round 2, clarifications were solicited from each participant, and in Round 3, the questionnaire was redistributed for a final vote. Consensus was achieved with ≥ 75% agreement from the experts on specific responses.

The results indicated majority consensus on several points:

- **Lowering thresholds**: The periprocedural/in-hospital stroke/death thresholds for carotid intervention should be reduced from 6% to 4% for patients with SxCS and from 3% to 2% for patients with AsxCS.
- **Symptomatic time frame**: The time frame for classifying a patient as "recently symptomatic" should be decreased from 6 months to 3 months or less.
- **Stroke risk**: An 80% to 99% AsxCS presents a higher stroke risk compared to 60% to 79% AsxCS.
- **Revascularization criteria**: Additional factors, such as plaque features of vulnerability and silent infarctions on brain CT scans, should be considered in indications for revascularization in AsxCS patients.
- **Shunting practice**: The document suggests that shunting should be used in specific circumstances (remainder of statement truncated).

### Carotid endarterectomy: Can we select surgical candidates at high risk for stroke and low risk for perioperative complications [^117Ca23E]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Despite evidence of the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy from the large randomized multicenter trials completed in the 1990s, physicians who treat patients with carotid artery stenosis still face a challenging management decision. More recently, subgroup analyses have been conducted on asymptomatic and symptomatic patients enrolled in these trials to identify clinical and radiological factors that increase rates of morbidity and mortality associated with surgery, as well as those that increase the risk of stroke without surgery. Knowledge of these factors is important to recommend the best course of action for the individual patient. In this article, we summarize the conclusions of some of the subgroup analyses from the major carotid endarterectomy trials.

### Evolution of medical and surgical management of carotid disease from carotid endarterectomy to transfemoral carotid stenting to TCAR [^116xQc4e]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Patients with carotid stenosis can be broadly classified into two categories: symptomatic and asymptomatic. While there is little disagreement about the surgical management of symptomatic carotid stenosis, the optimal management strategy for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease has evolved significantly over the past five decades. With an increasing focus on the role of plaque morphology in the etiology of symptoms, there has been an increased emphasis on optimizing medical management targeted at plaque stabilization, especially for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease, while reserving the most aggressive surgical treatment options for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis.

This review summarizes the scientific evidence based on multiple large clinical studies, showing how the modern-day management of carotid stenosis has evolved. Multiple large randomized clinical trials have established carotid endarterectomy (CEA) as the treatment of choice for symptomatic patients with more than 50% stenosis of the carotid artery, or for those who have asymptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis.

With advancements in endovascular techniques, the technique of transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TF-CAS) was popularized. However, after multiple large randomized controlled trials demonstrated the superiority of CEA, the indications for TF-CAS as the initial operation of choice for carotid disease in all patients have been reduced. In the past five years, the introduction of the newer technique of transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) has shown promising results with significant potential benefit for patients.

### Safety of carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic stenosis by age: Meta-analysis with individual patient data [^115oitrU]. Stroke (2023). Low credibility.

The search of electronic published work produced 8,726 references (including 986 duplicates), of which 39 articles were eligible for inclusion. A total of 32 articles were further identified by hand-searching reference lists, 8 of which were eligible. Forty-seven studies, comprising 107,587 patients and 23,188 octogenarians, met the inclusion criteria: 7 prospective cohort studies, 25 retrospective cohort studies, 6 registries, and 7 randomized controlled trials. Most of the cohorts were from North America (n = 16), Europe (n = 11), with 3 from Asia, 1 from Australia, and 1 from New Zealand. The year of publication, demographic details, study design, and surgical methods are summarized in the text.

Data from 104,689 patients, including 21,115 octogenarians, were included in the meta-analysis of perioperative stroke, MI, and death. Older versus younger patients had a higher risk of stroke, MI, and death via in-study cut-point analysis (Figure 1). The risk of perioperative stroke was 1.89% (95% CI, 1.79–1.95%) overall, and 2.04% (95% CI, 1.94–2.14%) in octogenarians (390 strokes in 19,101 patients) versus 1.85% (95% CI, 1.75–1.95%) in non-octogenarians (1,395 strokes in 75,537 patients); P = 0.046. The risk of perioperative MI was 1.39% (95% CI, 1.32–1.46%) overall, and 1.66% (95% CI, 1.55–1.77%) in octogenarians (141 MI in 8,470 patients) versus 1.31% (95% CI, 1.24–1.38%) in non-octogenarians (349 MI in 26,722 patients); P = 0.009. Perioperative death was 0.65% (95% CI, 0.60–0.70%) overall, and 1.09% (95% CI, 0.94–1.25%) in octogenarians (203 deaths in 18,702 patients) versus 0.53%, indicating higher risks associated with advanced age.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of peripheral arterial and aortic diseases [^114ER2n5]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for carotid artery stenosis, and more specifically with respect to carotid endarterectomy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering carotid endarterectomy in addition to optimal medical treatment. This is advised for asymptomatic, average-surgical-risk patients over 75 years of age with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) of 60–99%, particularly in the presence of high-risk features.

### Identification of patient characteristics that may improve procedure selection for the treatment of carotid stenosis [^111Gs9Nm]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) are the predominant procedures used for treating carotid artery stenosis. Therapy indications, diagnostic measures, and treatment types need to be established under international guideline recommendations. In general, CEA is the standard therapy, whereas CAS may be considered an alternative in selected patients, especially symptomatic patients at high surgical risk.

The choice of procedure, whether CEA or CAS, should be based on patient-specific clinical and morphological variables, as well as the patient's personal preferences (level of evidence/grading of recommendation: expert consensus, German–Austrian guideline). The following characteristics and morphological variables are associated with higher risk when performing CAS, making CEA more beneficial: older age (greater than 70 years), a short time interval between the index event and treatment, difficult access for CAS, and morphological characteristics such as long stenosis, heavy calcification, vessel elongation, and plaque ulceration (expert consensus based on Naylor et al. and Aboyans et al.).

In contrast, the following characteristics are associated with higher risk when performing CEA: restenosis, post-radiation stenosis, skull base near stenosis, tandem stenosis, and contralateral paresis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (expert consensus). However, all grades of the latter recommendations are based on expert consensus only, as higher-level evidence, such as direct head-to-head randomized studies, is not available to justify a higher grade.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carotid artery stenosis, particularly concerning carotid artery stenting, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering carotid artery stenting in addition to optimal medical treatment for high-surgical-risk patients with a carotid artery stenosis (CAS) of 60–99%, provided they exhibit high-risk features.

### Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic, but "haemodynamically insignificant" carotid stenosis [^116X9JzP]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) guidelines in symptomatic carotid stenosis are based on NASCET and ECST criteria with 70% or greater carotid stenosis as estimated from a catheter angiogram being the major indication. This presents several problems: (1) lack of reliable correlation between non-invasive imaging and catheter angiography, which has largely been superseded by non-invasive imaging for investigating carotid stenosis; (2) errors inherent in estimating the degree of stenosis from catheter angiography; and (3) disregard for the fact that stroke risk also depends on plaque stability and the number of ischaemic events.

A retrospective review was conducted on ischaemic events, imaging results, operative findings, surgical complications, and stroke-free follow-up in 31 patients over a 23-year period with TIA/stroke (symptoms lasting more than 24 hours and/or imaging evidence of infarction) who had 70% or less carotid stenosis (on non-invasive imaging), but nonetheless underwent CEA.

Nineteen patients experienced small strokes, seven had TIAs, and five had ocular events. Twenty-eight patients showed features of unstable plaque on imaging, and 19 patients experienced multiple events before CEA. All had haemorrhagic, ruptured plaque at CEA. One patient suffered an intra-operative stroke, and only one patient suffered a further stroke/TIA with a mean follow-up of 4.2 years.

In conclusion, to predict the likelihood of major stroke in symptomatic carotid stenosis and the benefit of CEA, plaque stability and the number of ischaemic events might be as important as an estimate of the degree of stenosis.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^116okHxj]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis indicates that carotid endarterectomy is associated with better periprocedural outcomes than carotid artery stenting. This disparity was primarily driven by a difference in the risk of procedural non-disabling stroke, which seemed to be higher in patients treated with carotid artery stenting. Conversely, the risk of facial neuropathy and periprocedural myocardial infarction was higher with carotid endarterectomy. In the intermediate term to long term, primary or secondary endpoints did not differ significantly, suggesting similar efficacy of the two procedures.

Since carotid revascularization is carried out solely for the prevention of future events, the rate of procedural complications (especially stroke) is a key driver of the risk-benefit ratio. The trade-off between the procedural risk and the longer-term benefit has to be evaluated carefully; this also has to be kept in mind when interpreting trials comparing procedures for treating carotid artery stenosis, especially since none of the trials included a best medical therapy only group.

Carotid endarterectomy has been shown to reduce the overall risk for stroke and death compared with medical treatment in patients with relevant carotid artery stenosis, both with symptoms and without symptoms. Based on these trials, an acceptable upper limit of the perioperative rate for stroke or death has been determined to be around 3% for asymptomatic patients and 6% for patients with symptoms. Congruent with this, our analysis of mainly patients with symptoms showed a procedure-related event rate of 5.4%.

### Patient selection for carotid stenting versus endarterectomy: A systematic review [^111AoKbE]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stenting has emerged as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of severe extracranial carotid stenosis in patients with anatomical or clinical factors that increase their risk of complications with surgery. However, there remains substantial variability and uncertainty in clinical practice regarding the referral of patients for stenting versus endarterectomy. By undertaking a thorough review of the literature, we sought to better define which subsets of patients with "high-risk" features would likely benefit preferentially from carotid stenting or carotid endarterectomy.

Although only a single randomized trial comparing the outcomes of carotid stenting with distal protection and endarterectomy has been completed, a wealth of observational data was reviewed. Relative to endarterectomy, the results of carotid stenting seem favorable in the setting of several anatomic conditions that render surgery technically difficult, such as restenosis after prior endarterectomy, prior radical neck surgery, and previous radiation therapy involving the neck. The results of stenting are also favorable among patients with severe concomitant cardiac disease. Carotid endarterectomy, alternatively, seems to represent the procedure of choice among patients 80 years of age or older in the absence of other high-risk features.

Overall, existing data support the concept that carotid stenting and endarterectomy represent complementary rather than competing modes of therapy. Pending the availability of randomized trial data to help guide procedural selection, which is critical for informed decision-making, more comprehensive data are awaited.

### Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis [^117NrQnU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long-term disability. Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment, known as carotid endarterectomy, may reduce the risk of stroke but carries a risk of operative complications. This text is an update of the Cochrane Review, originally published in 1999 and most recently updated in 2011.

- **Objectives**: To determine the balance of benefit versus risk of endarterectomy plus best medical management compared with best medical management alone in people with recent symptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e. transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non-disabling stroke).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched in July 2016), CENTRAL (2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2016), Embase (1990 to July 2016), Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal, and handsearched relevant journals and reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data.

- **Main results**: We included three trials involving 6343 participants. As the trials differed in methods of measurement of carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke, we conducted a pooled analysis of individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient years of follow-up) after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials.

### Comparative effectiveness of carotid stenting to medical therapy among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^114UT6YY]. Stroke (2022). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stenosis accounts for approximately 11% of strokes worldwide. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted over two decades established that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is beneficial in preventing stroke in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. However, no completed trial is available that directly compared carotid artery stenting (CAS) to medical therapy (MT). One Europe-based trial was halted due to inadequate recruitment.

Carotid revascularization among asymptomatic patients is a primary prevention procedure that involves a trade-off between higher perioperative short-term risks, including stroke and death, in exchange for a lower long-term risk of stroke. Stroke risk from carotid artery stenosis has been declining since the original asymptomatic carotid trials were completed due to marked improvements in MT.

Stroke has now dropped in ranking from the third to the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. Given the declining stroke risk from asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke funded CREST-2 (Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial) to determine whether revascularization offers any benefit beyond aggressive risk factor control. CREST-2 was launched in 2014 and is an ongoing trial that involves two parallel RCTs: (1) CEA plus intensive MT versus intensive MT alone and similarly (2) CAS plus intensive MT versus intensive MT alone. CREST-2 has a projected completion date of 2025.

### An analysis of the recommendations of the 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^111RDND3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis currently account for the majority of carotid interventions performed in the United States. Therefore, this article reviews the 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) clinical practice guidelines for treating patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by the evidence practice center of the Mayo Clinic using a specified population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) framework.

- **Results**: Based on published randomized trials and related supporting evidence, the SVS recommends that patients with asymptomatic ≥ 70% stenosis may be considered for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR), or transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TFCAS) to reduce the long-term risk of stroke, provided the patient has a life expectancy of 3 to 5 years and the risk of perioperative stroke and death does not exceed 3%. The type of carotid intervention should be based on the presence or absence of high-risk criteria for each specified intervention. Data from CREST, ACT, and the Vascular Quality Initiative suggest that certain properly selected asymptomatic patients can be treated with carotid stenting with outcomes equivalent to CEA in the hands of experienced interventionalists. The institutions and operators performing carotid stenting must exhibit expertise sufficient to meet the established American Heart Association guidelines for treating patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

### Editor's choice - European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2023 clinical practice guidelines on the management of atherosclerotic carotid and vertebral artery disease [^112tA3wy]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carotid artery stenosis, particularly with respect to carotid artery stenting in asymptomatic patients, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend considering carotid artery stenting as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. This recommendation applies to average surgical risk patients with asymptomatic 60–99% stenosis who exhibit one or more imaging or clinical characteristics associated with an increased risk of late stroke, provided the 30-day stroke/death rate is less than 3%. For both carotid artery stenting and carotid endarterectomy, the guidelines suggest considering the patient's preferences, life expectancy, comorbidities, and anticipated longevity, with a timeframe of > 5 years for expected benefit.

In summary, the ESVS 2023 guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for the management of carotid and vertebral artery disease, taking into account the latest evidence and expert consensus to guide clinical decision-making in the treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

### Editor's choice - European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2023 clinical practice guidelines on the management of atherosclerotic carotid and vertebral artery disease [^114KtPv2]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for carotid artery stenosis, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend considering carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting following a multidisciplinary team review in symptomatic patients with carotid near occlusion, distal vessel collapse, and recurrent carotid territory symptoms despite best medical therapy.
