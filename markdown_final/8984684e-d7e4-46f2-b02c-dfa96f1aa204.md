## Question

What are the indications for surgical intervention in L5 nerve impingement?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for surgical intervention in L5 nerve root impingement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and correlating symptoms with imaging. Then, I should verify the severity of neurologic compromise and whether there are red flags. Next, I will review the adequacy and failure of conservative care. After that, I need to match the pathoanatomy to the appropriate surgical strategy. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, timing, and outcomes to synthesize a practical decision framework.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and ensure clinical–radiographic concordance, because surgery for L5 impingement requires radicular pain and/or objective deficits in the L5 distribution with MRI or CT evidence of compression at L4–L5 or L5–S1 that matches the exam, and I should double-check that the side and level align before proceeding [^114tTVZL] [^111Yzo5h] [^115Ubv8t].

> Wait, let me verify the severity of neurologic compromise, since this dictates urgency. Progressive motor weakness, especially foot dorsiflexion weakness or a developing foot drop, warrants urgent decompression, whereas isolated sensory changes alone are not an emergency, and I need to check for cauda equina features such as saddle anesthesia, bladder dysfunction, or bowel changes that would make this a surgical emergency rather than elective decompression [^114tTVZL] [^114FkcQK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing. I should confirm that most elective cases have completed an adequate trial of conservative therapy, typically 6 to 8 weeks, including NSAIDs, activity modification, and structured physical therapy, and I need to ensure there is persistent, function-limiting pain or a progressive deficit despite this, because early surgery is not superior to delayed surgery in the absence of progressive neurologic compromise [^114tTVZL] [^114Fn133] [^112PSLAP].

> I will now examine the pathoanatomy to match the surgical approach. For a herniated disc at L4–L5 or L5–S1 compressing the L5 root, standard microdiscectomy is appropriate, for central or lateral recess stenosis with L5 root involvement, decompressive laminectomy with targeted foraminotomy is indicated, and for extraforaminal entrapment such as far-out syndrome from L5 transverse process–sacral ala pseudoarthrosis, a focused extraforaminal decompression is required, and I should confirm the level and side with imaging before committing to the approach [^114tTVZL] [^114BjxgJ] [^115kpRuP] [^114noAdd].

> But wait, what if there is concomitant instability? I need to check for spondylolisthesis or iatrogenic instability, because in that scenario decompression alone may be insufficient and fusion may be indicated to stabilize the motion segment, whereas in pure stenosis without instability, decompression alone is preferred and adding fusion does not improve outcomes, so I should verify translational motion on flexion–extension films or intraoperative assessment before deciding on fusion [^114BjxgJ] [^112AXDTx] [^1144iqAt].

> Let me consider special scenarios that modify the threshold for surgery. In adolescents with L5 radiculopathy from disc herniation or spondylolysis, earlier operative intervention is reasonable if they fail conservative care because outcomes are less favorable than in adults with conservative therapy, and in patients with lumbosacral transitional anatomy and nearthrosis compressing the L5 root, extraforaminal decompression is often necessary when conservative measures fail, so I should confirm transitional anatomy on imaging and tailor the approach accordingly [^115JueRw] [^117MpRPk] [^115kpRuP] [^114noAdd].

> I should double-check the expected outcomes to set realistic expectations. For disc herniation with radiculopathy, surgery provides faster pain relief but long-term functional outcomes often converge with nonoperative care, and for spinal stenosis, decompressive surgery improves symptoms in selected patients who fail conservative therapy, with fusion reserved for instability, so I need to counsel that surgery is not mandatory if the patient prefers continued nonoperative care and there is no progressive deficit [^112PSLAP] [^1144iqAt] [^114BjxgJ].

> Next, I should review diagnostic adjuncts when the level is equivocal. Selective nerve root blocks can help localize the symptomatic level in multilevel disease, though evidence for their predictive value is limited, and diffusion tensor imaging can demonstrate microstructural changes in compressed L5 roots and may correlate with surgical benefit, but I need to ensure these are used to refine, not replace, careful clinical–radiographic correlation [^113YWqMj] [^111vF2WX] [^117PRrVo].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing nuance again. Urgent surgery is indicated for progressive motor deficit or cauda equina syndrome, whereas in the absence of progression, delaying surgery up to several months after a failed conservative trial does not worsen long-term outcomes, so I need to balance patient preference, occupational demands, and neurologic status rather than rushing to the operating room [^114tTVZL] [^114Fn133] [^112PSLAP].

> Let me synthesize the decision framework to ensure nothing is missed. Surgery for L5 nerve root impingement is indicated when there is concordant radicular pain and/or objective L5 deficits with confirmatory MRI or CT, there is either failure of at least 6 to 8 weeks of appropriate conservative therapy or a progressive neurologic deficit, and there are no contraindications to surgery, with the specific procedure tailored to the cause of compression and the presence of instability, and I should confirm each of these elements explicitly in the chart before scheduling [^114tTVZL] [^114BjxgJ] [^1144iqAt].

---

Surgery for L5 nerve impingement is indicated for **progressive neurological deficit** (motor weakness, foot drop, or sensory loss) [^114Fn133] or **persistent radicular pain** despite 6–12 weeks of conservative therapy [^1144iqAt] [^112PSLAP]. Emergent surgery is required for **cauda equina syndrome** or rapid progression of deficits [^114FkcQK]. Imaging must confirm L5 root compression [^111Yzo5h] and correlate with symptoms; surgery is not indicated for mild or incidental findings without symptoms [^114tTVZL]. Decompression (microdiscectomy, laminectomy, or foraminotomy) is the primary approach; fusion is reserved for instability or spondylolisthesis [^112AXDTx] [^114BjxgJ].

---

## Clinical indications for surgical intervention

### Absolute indications

Absolute indications require **immediate surgical intervention** to prevent irreversible neurological damage:

- **Progressive neurological deficit**: Motor weakness, foot drop, or sensory loss that is worsening despite conservative management [^114Fn133].

- **Cauda equina syndrome**: Urinary retention, saddle anesthesia, or bowel/bladder dysfunction [^114FkcQK].

- **Severe or rapidly progressive neurological deficit**: Acute foot drop or severe motor weakness [^114tTVZL].

---

### Relative indications

Relative indications require **careful consideration** of patient-specific factors, symptom severity, and response to conservative therapy:

- **Persistent radicular pain**: Continued leg pain, numbness, or weakness despite 6–12 weeks of conservative treatment (NSAIDs, physical therapy, epidural steroid injections) [^1144iqAt] [^114tTVZL].

- **Functional impairment**: Significant limitation in daily activities, work, or quality of life due to persistent symptoms [^114BjxgJ].

- **Recurrent or chronic symptoms**: Frequent recurrences or chronic symptoms significantly impacting patient well-being [^notfound].

---

## Imaging criteria

Imaging studies are essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide surgical planning. The following imaging findings are considered **indications for surgical intervention**:

| **Imaging modality** | **Findings indicating surgery** |
|-|-|
| MRI | - Disc herniation compressing the L5 nerve root <br/> - Foraminal stenosis <br/> - Lateral recess stenosis <br/> - Severe nerve root compression or displacement [^114rh3n5] |
| CT myelography | - Severe central canal stenosis <br/> - Foraminal stenosis <br/> - Nerve root impingement (alternative when MRI is contraindicated) [^111Yzo5h] [^117STKbf] |
| Plain radiographs | - Spondylolisthesis <br/> - Spinal instability <br/> - Degenerative disc disease contributing to nerve root compression [^1116Azyq] |

---

## Conservative management and its limitations

Conservative management is the initial approach for L5 nerve impingement, including NSAIDs, physical therapy, and epidural steroid injections [^1144iqAt]. However, **limitations** include limited effectiveness for severe or persistent neurological deficits, a high recurrence rate with continued nerve root compression, and poor response in patients with significant functional impairment or chronic symptoms [^114tTVZL].

---

## Surgical techniques

Several surgical techniques are employed for L5 nerve impingement, including:

- **Microdiscectomy**: Removal of herniated disc material compressing the L5 nerve root [^115EuZHV].

- **Laminectomy**: Decompression of the spinal canal or foramen to relieve nerve root compression [^114BjxgJ].

- **Foraminotomy**: Enlargement of the neural foramen to relieve nerve root compression [^117JGE11].

- **Fusion**: Indicated in cases of spinal instability, spondylolisthesis, or recurrent herniation [^112AXDTx].

---

## Risks and complications

Surgical intervention carries potential risks and complications, including:

- **Infection**: Wound infection or epidural abscess [^113DRXX2].

- **Bleeding**: Hematoma formation [^116nz5d7].

- **Nerve injury**: Permanent neurological deficit or chronic pain [^114JG47g].

- **Recurrence**: Persistent or recurrent symptoms [^116nz5d7].

- **Failed back surgery syndrome**: Chronic pain and disability despite surgical intervention [^117EqqgT].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing surgical decision-making

Several patient-specific factors influence the decision to proceed with surgery, including age, overall health, and **comorbidities**; occupation and activity level; and patient preferences and expectations. Younger, healthier patients may have **better surgical outcomes and faster recovery**, whereas patients with physically demanding jobs or high activity levels may require surgery to return to their pre-injury functional status. Shared decision-making is essential to **align treatment with patient goals** [^114BxPTm].

---

## Conclusion

Surgery for L5 nerve impingement is indicated for **progressive neurological deficits**, persistent radicular pain despite conservative therapy, and significant functional impairment. Imaging must confirm L5 root compression and correlate with symptoms. Surgical techniques include microdiscectomy, laminectomy, foraminotomy, and fusion, selected based on the underlying pathology and patient factors. Potential risks and complications must be discussed with patients, and shared decision-making is essential [^notfound].

Unlabelled

Failed Back Surgery Syndrome is a common and challenging clinical problem. Often the anatomic pain source is unclear. Relevant outcome studies are rarely diagnosis specific, and high level research studies comparing surgical and nonsurgical approaches to Failed Back Surgery Syndrome studies have not been published to date. Surgical strategies focus on decompressing neural impingement or fusing unstable or putatively painful intervertebral discs. Nonsurgical interventions range from nerve root specific blocks for pain relief to multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs geared toward improving function. This paper reviews the most common interventions and concludes with recommendations for the care of the individual patient.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — structured exercise and physical therapy evidence indicates mixed findings. A potential Level I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that four weeks of lumbar stabilization exercises result in decreased pain and improved function in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. A prospective randomized controlled trial evaluating physical therapy after selective nerve root blocks (SNRB) versus SNRBs alone included 44 patients, of whom 21 received SNRB in combination with physical therapy and the remaining 23 received only SNRBs, with outcomes assessed at six months. Intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses showed no significant difference between groups, and the authors concluded that physical therapy interventions after SNRBs were not more beneficial than SNRBs alone. Due to the small sample size, this study provides Level III therapeutic evidence that supervised exercise interventions intended to reduce symptoms after selective nerve root blocks were no more beneficial than selective nerve root blocks alone.

### Extreme lateral lumbar disc herniation in a 12-year child: case report and review of the literature [^111M9UMU]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Extreme lateral lumbar disc herniations (ELLDHs) occur more frequently among elderly patients, with a peak incidence in the sixth decade, and are rarely found in children. The patient presented is a 12-year-old boy with a 3-month history of right-sided leg pain. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an extreme lateral disc herniation on the right at L4-L5 with compression of the L4 nerve root. He subsequently underwent removal of extreme lateral herniated disc through an intertransverse approach under general anesthesia. At 11-month follow-up, the patient maintained resolution of preoperative symptoms and a neurological examination revealed no sensory or motor deficit. Surgical intervention may be indicated for patients with ELLDHs that fail with conservative treatment.

### L5 spinal nerve injury caused by misplacement of outwardly-inserted S1 pedicle screws [^114Krf58]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate L5 nerve root injuries caused by outwardly misplaced S1 pedicle screws. Pedicle screws remain the criterion standard for fixation of L5-S1 to correct lumbosacral instability. When inserting S1 pedicle screws, it is possible to injure the L5 nerve root if screws are inserted outwardly and the tip of the screw perforates the anterior cortex of the sacrum. Despite this risk, to our knowledge this type of injury has never been reported as a case series.

Methods

We experienced 2 cases of L5 nerve root injury caused by outwardly-inserted S1 pedicle screws. In both cases, bilateral S1 pedicle screws were inserted outwardly using a free-hand technique, and on one side, screws induced severe pain by impinging on an L5 root. Computed tomography after the selective rootgraphy of the injured nerve showed the nerve compressed laterally by screw threads in Case 1 and crushed between the screw threads and the sacral body in Case 2.

Results

In both cases, leg pain disappeared immediately after the infiltration of the nerve with lidocaine, but symptoms recurred within a few days in Case 1 and within an hour in Case 2. Conservative treatment of three spinal nerve infiltrations was effective in Case 1, but reinsertion of the rogue screw was necessary in Case 2.

Conclusions

Surgeons should recognize that lateral inclination of S1 pedicle screws can cause L5 nerve root injury, which may require reinsertion of the screw, especially in cases where insertion is difficult because of overlapping surrounding muscle or bony tissue.

### The risk of foraminal violation and nerve root impingement after anterior placement of lumbar interbody fusion cages [^116n8pjj]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

Three groups of six embalmed cadaver spines underwent placement of lumbar interbody fusion cages centered either at midline, 10% lateral of midline, or 20% lateral of midline. The spines were evaluated for evidence of neuroforamen violation or nerve root impingement.

Objectives

To determine the potential for foraminal violation or nerve root impingement after correct placement and lateral misplacement of lumbar interbody fusion cages.

Summary Of Background Data

Radicular symptoms after anterior cage placement have raised some concern about the potential for inadvertent device-related foraminal violation not adequately appreciated by intraoperative fluoroscopy.

Methods

Preoperative computed tomography scanning and plain radiography was used to measure endplate dimensions at L4-L5 and to template the appropriately sized interbody fusion cages. The cadaveric specimens were randomly divided into three groups of six (Groups I-III) and instrumented at L4-L5 either at midline (I) or 10% (II) or 20% (III) lateral of midline. Postoperative computed tomography and plain radiography was evaluated for evidence of neuroforamen violation, followed by dissection of the specimens.

Results

Foraminal violation occurred in one of six spines in group II (10% off midline) and in three of six spines in group III (20% off midline). Two of the three cadavers in group III with foraminal violation also were noted to have nerve root abutment on computed tomography scans and spinal dissection.

Conclusions

Excessive lateral placement of lumbar interbody fusion cages may result in foraminal violation and possible nerve encroachment. The "safe zone" for centering the cages extends approximately 5 mm on either side of midline.

Spinal involvement in coccidioidomycosis — indications, timing, and procedural considerations — are outlined as follows: There are 4 typical reasons to seek a surgical opinion, including bony destruction without instability where debridement may optimize medical therapy, bony destruction with instability where risk to the spinal cord or nerve roots may necessitate stabilization, spinal cord or nerve root compression which should be considered a surgical emergency, and significant sequestered paraspinal abscess where surgical or interventional radiologic intervention may be needed; back pain is intense and precedes neurological symptoms by several days or weeks, and urgent intervention is indicated for signs of nerve root or spinal cord dysfunction, especially if symptoms are progressing rapidly; selection of procedures includes immobilization for painful discitis and paravertebral spasm with imaging surveillance and close clinical observation at frequent intervals (perhaps weekly MRI), minimally invasive aspiration given that coccidioidial abscesses are often amenable to image-guided needle aspiration and aspiration can be therapeutic if adequate, and surgical debridement for which aggressive surgical debridement is essential.

### 1-year results of a randomized controlled trial of conservative management vs. minimally invasive surgical treatment for sacroiliac joint pain [^116nz5d7]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain (LBP) emanating from the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a common finding. Devices to fuse the SIJ are now commercially available, but high-quality evidence supporting their effectiveness is limited.

Objectives

To compare the safety and effectiveness of conservative management (CM) to minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion (SIJF) in patients with chronic LBP originating from the SIJ.

Study Design

Prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Setting

One hundred three adults in spine clinics with chronic LBP originating from the SIJ.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to CM (n = 51) or SIJF using triangular titanium implants (n = 52). CM consisted of optimization of medical therapy, individualized physiotherapy, and adequate information and reassurance as part of a multifactorial treatment. The primary outcome was the difference in change in self-rated LBP at 6 months using a 0–100 visual analog scale (VAS). Other effectiveness and safety endpoints, including leg pain, disability using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), quality of life using EQ-5D, and SIJ function using active straight leg raise test (ASLR), were assessed up to 12 months.

Results

At 12 months, mean LBP improved by 41.6 VAS points in the SIJF group vs. 14.0 points in the CM group (treatment difference of 27.6 points, P < 0.0001). Mean ODI improved by 25.0 points in the SIJF group vs. 8.7 points in the CM group (P < 0.0001). Mean improvements in leg pain and EQ-5D scores were large after SIJF and superior to those after CM. CM patients were allowed to crossover to SIJF after 6 months. Patients who crossed to surgical treatment had no pre-crossover improvement in pain and ODI scores; after crossover, improvements were as large as those originally assigned to SIJF. One case of postoperative nerve impingement occurred in the surgical group. Two SIJF patients had recurrent pain attributed to possible device loosening and one had postoperative hematoma. In the CM group, one crossover surgery patient had recurrent pain requiring a revision surgery.

Limitations

The primary limitation was lack of blinding and the subjective nature of self-assessed outcomes.

Conclusions

For patients with chronic LBP originating from the SIJ, minimally invasive SIJF with triangular titanium implants was safe and more effective than CM in relieving pain, reducing disability, and improving patient function and quality of life. Our findings will help to inform decisions regarding its use as a treatment option in this patient population. Key words: Sacroiliac joint dysfunction, pelvic girdle pain, randomized controlled trial, quality of life, spine implants.

### Magnetic resonance imaging predictors of surgical outcome in patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation [^114rh3n5]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort design.

Objective

To determine whether baseline magnetic resonance imaging findings, including central/foraminal stenosis, Modic change, disc morphology, facet arthropathy, disc degeneration, nerve root impingement, and thecal sac compression, are associated with differential surgical treatment effect.

Summary Of Background Data

Intervertebral disc herniation remains the most common source of lumbar radiculopathy treated either with discectomy or nonoperative intervention. Although magnetic resonance imaging remains the reliable "gold standard" for diagnosis, uncertainty surrounds the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging findings and treatment outcomes.

Methods

Three hundred seven "complete" images from patients enrolled in a previous trial were de-identified and evaluated by 1 of 4 independent readers. Findings were compared with outcome measures including the Oswestry Disability Index. Differences in surgery and nonoperative treatment outcomes were evaluated between image characteristic subgroups and TE determined by the difference in Oswestry Disability Index scores.

Results

The cohort comprised 40% females with an average age of 41.5 (± 11.6) years, 61% of whom underwent discectomy for intervertebral disc herniation. Patients undergoing surgery with Modic type I endplate changes had worse outcomes (-26.4 vs. -39.7 for none and -39.2 for type 2, P = 0.002) and smaller treatment effect (-3.5 vs. -19.3 for none and -15.7 for type 2, P = 0.003). Those with compression of ≥ 1/3 showed the greatest improvement within the surgical group (-41.9 for ≥ 1/3 vs. -31.6 for none and -38.1 for < 1/3, P = 0.007) and the highest TE (-23 compared with -11.7 for none and -15.2 for < 1/3, P = 0.015). Furthermore, patients with minimal nerve root impingement demonstrated worse surgical outcomes (-26.5 vs. -41.1 for "displaced" and -38.9 for "compressed", P = 0.016).

Conclusion

Among patients with intervertebral disc herniation, those with thecal sac compression of 1/3 or more had greater surgical treatment effect than those with small disc herniations and Modic type I changes. In addition, patients with nerve root "compression" and "displacement" benefit more from surgery than those with minimal nerve root impingement.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of low back pain in children and adolescents [^115JueRw]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Lumbar Disk Herniation

Lumbar disc herniation in pediatric and adolescent populations is uncommon with an incidence of 3.5% recently reported. Disk protrusion (primarily L4–5 or L5-S1) is more common in adolescents than in young children. In a study of 100 consecutive adolescent athletes presenting with acute low back pain, only 11% had disc pathology. Children and adolescents with disc herniation present with low back, buttock or hip pain worsened by bending forward, coughing, sneezing or straining with bowel movements. On examination, there is often limitation of forward flexion and positive straight-leg raise test. Weakness in a myotomal distribution, numbness in a dermatomal distribution and diminished reflexes are not common in adolescents with disc herniation. Investigations include radiographs and MRI of the lumbar spine. Careful inspection is required to differentiate between spondylolysis with nerve root impingement or disc herniation with nerve root impingement. Symptomatic treatment with rest, analgesics, and physical therapy is successful in the majority of patients but adolescents do not fare as well with conservative therapy as do adults. Early microdiscectomy for patients who do not respond to conservative treatment is advocated by some surgeons while others reserve operative therapy for progressive neurologic deficit.

### The short-term outcome of transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with radicular pain due to foraminal stenosis from lumbar isthmic spondylolisthesis [^112qMhuJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Isthmic spondylolisthesis (IS) is a spinal condition in which the vertebral body slips forward over the vertebra below. It is caused by a defect or fracture of the pars interarticularis connecting the upper and lower facet joints. Defects in the pars interarticularis can result from genetic failure of bone formation in the spinal vertebrae. Furthermore, the pars interarticularis fracture is induced by spinal stress from repetitive motions of spinal vertebrae, such as repetitive flexion/extension, axial loading, and rotational loading. Notably, IS is a common spinal condition with an incidence of between 4% and 8% in the general population.

Further, IS accelerates the degeneration of the intervertebral disc, which results in a diminished height of the neural foramen and increased stress on the facet joints posteriorly. Consequently, increased stress can result in hypertrophy of the facet joint and ligamentum flavum. These changes can lead to lower back pain and radicular pain. Importantly, the lowered height of the neural foramen typically causes foraminal stenosis. Moreover, the nerve root within the narrowed spinal foramen can be mechanically compressed and irritated by inflammation, and, in IS, the L5 nerve root in the L5-S1 foramen is the most commonly affected.

For the management of radicular pain from foraminal stenosis, various conservative treatments such as physiotherapy, oral medication, exercise, and other procedures can be applied. Transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) is one of the most effective conservative treatments for managing radicular pain caused by foraminal stenosis. Corticosteroids inhibit the synthesis of various pro-inflammatory mediators; thus, TFESI can reduce inflammatory pain, and the reduced inflammation on and around the nerve roots can partially relieve mechanical compression of the narrowed foramen. Previous studies have demonstrated the positive therapeutic effects of TFESI in reducing radicular pain due to foraminal stenosis. However, little is known regarding the therapeutic outcomes of TFESI for foraminal stenosis caused by IS.

In the current study, we evaluated the therapeutic outcomes of TFESI in patients with chronic radicular pain due to foraminal stenosis in IS. Furthermore, we evaluated outcomes according to the severity of IS.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^114tTVZL]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Discectomy — indications and limits are specified as follows: Indications for discectomy are all of: (1) radicular pain syndrome with current dermatomal pain and/or numbness, or myotomal muscle weakness all consistent with a herniated disc; (2) imaging findings by MRI, or CT with or without myelography that confirm persisting nerve root compression at the level and on the side predicted by the history and clinical examination; and (3) continued significant pain and functional limitation after at least 6 to 8 weeks of time and appropriate nonoperative therapy that usually includes NSAIDs), with progressive neurological deficits a separate indication for urgent surgery. For appropriate candidates, there is evidence that there is no need to rush patients into surgery as there is consistent evidence of a lack of differences in long-term functional recovery whether surgery is performed early or delayed. Discectomy is Not Recommended (B), High Confidence for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain (LBP) without radiculopathy, and there is no quality evidence that automated percutaneous discectomy, laser discectomy, or coblation therapy are effective treatments for any back or radicular pain problem, and thus they are Not Recommended (D), Low Confidence.

### Anatomical and surgical study of volume determination of the anterolateral epidural space nerve root L5 / S1 under the aspect of epidural perineural injection in minimal invasive treatment of lumbar nerve root compression [^111rVzqj]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Herniated intervertebral disc causes in a great number of cases of lumbar nerve root compression, especially in the segment L5/S1. Other reasons responsible for stress to the lumbar spinal root are the spinal canal stenosis and the postdiscotomy syndrome. For patients without neurological deficiencies, the conservative treatment includes different epidural injection techniques. Steroids are often applied. A specific injection technique needing only a small drug amount is the epidural perineural approach using a special two-needle technique. The anatomical spaces of the nerve roots have received little attention in therapy. We have determined the anterolateral epidural space nerve volume of the nerve root L5/S1, and compared the data collected in an anatomical study with operative measurements during discectomy. The volume determination in the human cadavers was performed with liquid silicone filling the anterolateral space after dissection. The in vivo measurements were performed during surgery at the site of the anterolateral space after discectomy. The anatomical studies showed us a mean value volume of 1.1 ml. The surgical volume determinations result in a mean volume of 0.9 ml. A better understanding of the anterolateral epidural space may allow a reduction of the injection volume in the conservative nerve root compression treatment, especially using the epidural perineural technique, avoiding the risk of side effects of high doses of steroids.

### Anatomical and surgical study of volume determination of the anterolateral epidural space nerve root L5 / S1 under the aspect of epidural perineural injection in minimal invasive treatment of lumbar nerve root compression [^114r833R]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Epidural injections play a crucial role in the conservative treatment of the lumbar spine nerve compression syndrome. The primary indication is the treatment of herniated vertebral disc, the lumbar spinal canal stenosis and the post discectomy syndrome. Different application techniques are known to reach the requested nerve root. In most cases the roots L5 and S1 are affected.

In general, the injected therapeutic substance is a local anaesthetic often in combination with a corticosteroid for antiphlogistic purpose. A number of different injection techniques are described in literature. Each special technique requires a different drug volume for best results under the aspect of analgesia and anti-inflammatory effect. The common epidural injection needs a dose of 40–80 mg triamcinolone in a volume of 10–20 mL using the loss of resistance technique. The similar epidural sacral injection in the hiatus sacralis needs equal amounts glucosteroids in similar volumes. The epidural–peridural interlaminar approach allows an injection in the anterolateral space containing the roots L5 and S1. This method requires rather smaller injection volume and a much lower dose of steroids in comparison to the other methods because the application takes place in direct contact to the affected nerve root. The anterolateral epidural space between the L5 root and the passage of the S1 root as the target of the injection therapy has an estimated volume of 2 ml. The amount of triamcinolone required was first given with 10 mg triamcinolone. The randomized controlled study from Becker et al. reduced the dose from 10 to 5 mg triamcinolone/injection. To determine the needed volume for an epidural–perineural injection, it makes sense to examine the capacity of the antero-lateral epidural space L5/S1.

### Full endoscopic transpedicular discectomy for a rostrally migrated L5-S1 disc herniation in the setting of previous lumbar surgery: a case report with intraoperative video [^113SNzQ2]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Importance

The surgical management of rostral disc herniations at L5-S1 poses challenges for conventional endoscopic approaches, particularly in patients who have had previous lumbar surgery. We present a full endoscopic transpedicular discectomy (FETD), whereby a pediculotomy is created to pass an endoscope through the pedicle for intracanal access. This addresses anatomic obstacles and potential complications associated with other endoscopic and minimally invasive or open techniques. To date, this is the only article to highlight this approach with a case report and intraoperative video.

Clinical Presentation

A 76-year-old man with a history of L3-S1 laminectomy presented with left leg pain and a near-complete left foot drop. An MRI revealed a left paracentral rostrally migrated disc herniation arising from L5-S1 with impingement of the exiting left L5 nerve root at the inferomedial aspect of the pedicle of L5. The patient consented to the FETD procedure. Using sequential reamers of increasing diameter and a high-speed burr, a superolateral to inferomedial pediculotomy was performed. This approach allowed us to target the pathology at the point of maximum compression without traversing the prior operative field. A transforaminal endoscopic approach was not possible with the iliac crest obstructing rostral angulation. The disc was successfully removed without any intraoperative complications, and after surgery, the patient's radiculopathy resolved without any radiographic evidence of instability.

Conclusion

FETD is a unique approach that demonstrates the versatility of endoscopic spine surgery, offering advantages over conventional approaches particularly for rostral disc herniations at L5-S1 in the setting of prior lumbar surgery.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^114BjxgJ]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Decompressive surgery for spinal stenosis (laminotomy/facetectomy, laminectomy) — evidence, indications, and recommendations: There were three high-quality and 22 moderate-quality studies incorporated into this analysis. The highest of the moderate-quality trials reported comparable results from physical therapy (PT) consisting of flexion exercises plus aerobic exercises versus decompressive surgery over 2 years, and although it is noteworthy that 57% of the PT group crossed over to surgery, one trial found no significant differences between a decompressive device and epidural steroid injection; another moderate-quality trial found superiority of decompressive surgery over nonoperative management for intractable symptomatic spinal stenosis. There is no quality evidence of benefit to adding lumbar fusion to decompression and fusion has no role in the surgical treatment of spinal stenosis, rather the role of fusion is to treat instability if proven to be present. Decompression surgery is thus Moderately Recommended (B), Moderate Confidence for treatment of patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis (neurogenic claudication) that is intractable to nonoperative management, and caution is warranted among elderly with multiple comorbidities. Indications are all of: (1) radicular-type pain involving usually multiple dermatomes with pain and/or numbness or myotomal muscle weakness all consistent with the nerve root levels affected; (2) imaging findings by MRI, or CT with or without myelography that confirm spinal stenosis and corroborate the dermatomal and myotomal findings predicted by the history and clinical examination; and (3) continued significant pain and functional limitation after at least 6 to 8 weeks of time and appropriate nonoperative therapy that usually includes flexion exercises plus aerobic exercise (walking or cycling), and NSAIDs, with progressive neurological deficits a separate indication for earlier surgery.

### Surgical vs nonoperative treatment for lumbar disk herniation… [^112PSLAP]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

To enhance readability, the plot symbols and error bars for the surgical group are slightly offset. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Context Lumbar diskectomy is the most common surgical procedure performed for back and leg symptoms in US patients, but the efficacy of the procedure relative to nonoperative care remains controversial. Objective To assess the efficacy of surgery for lumbar intervertebral disk herniation. Results Adherence to assigned treatment was limited: 50% of patients assigned to surgery received surgery within 3 months of enrollment, while 30% of those assigned to nonoperative treatment received surgery in the same period. Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated substantial improvements for all primary and secondary outcomes in both treatment groups. Between-group differences in improvements were consistently in favor of surgery for all periods but were small and not statistically significant for the primary outcomes.

Conclusions Patients in both the surgery and the nonoperative treatment groups improved substantially over a 2-year period. Because of the large numbers of patients who crossed over in both directions, conclusions about the superiority or equivalence of the treatments are not warranted based on the intent-to-treat analysis. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00000410. Lumbar diskectomy is the most common surgical procedure performed in the United States for patients having back and leg symptoms; the vast majority of the procedures are elective. However, lumbar disk herniation is often seen on imaging studies in the absence of symptoms1, 2 and can regress over time without surgery. 3 Up to 15-fold variation in regional diskectomy rates in the United States4 and lower rates internationally raise questions regarding the appropriateness of some of these surgeries. 5, 6.

Additionally, all participants were surgical candidates who had undergone advanced vertebral imaging showing disk herniation 14 at a level and side corresponding to the clinical symptoms. Patients with multiple herniations were included if only one of the herniations was considered symptomatic. Exclusion criteria included prior lumbar surgery, cauda equina syndrome, scoliosis greater than 15°, segmental instability, vertebral fractures, spine infection or tumor, inflammatory spondyloarthropathy, pregnancy, comorbid conditions contraindicating surgery, or inability/unwillingness to have surgery within 6 months. The surgery was a standard open diskectomy with examination of the involved nerve root.

15, 16 The procedure agreed on by all participating centers was performed under general or local anesthesia, with patients in the prone or knee-chest position. Surgeons were encouraged to use loupe magnification or a microscope. Using a midline incision reflecting the paraspinous muscles, the interlaminar space was entered as described by Delamarter and McCullough. 15 In some cases the medial border of the superior facet was removed to provide a clear view of the involved nerve root. Baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Overall, the study population had a mean age of 42 years, with majorities being male, white, employed, and having attended at least some college; 16% were receiving disability compensation. All patients had radicular leg pain, 97% in a classic dermatomal distribution. Most of the herniations were at L5-S1, posterolateral, and were extrusions by imaging criteria. 14 The 2 randomized groups were similar at baseline.

Limitations

While we review a novel case highlighting the application of RFA for peripheral rhizotomy in children and considerations regarding planning and execution, our findings are limited in that this case study does not include a large sample size from which statistically significant conclusions can be drawn. Furthermore, this technique successfully reached L1-L5, but we could not reach the S1 nerve roots. We used several methodologies to target the mixed spinal nerve, including computer navigation, neuromonitoring with EMG, and a parallel trajectory to maximize potential contact of the nerve to the RFA volume; however, there is no intraoperative or postoperative radiographic evidence of a lesional effect. Alternative strategies to prove this surgical technique could include a lateral contrast durogram to define the dural root sleeve further and maximize RFA needle placement and postoperative MRI to show a nerve root lesion. The durability of this treatment is unproven.

Adult isthmic spondylolisthesis — MRI and myelography observational evidence includes Annertz et al, in which "Seventeen patients, including 9 men and 8 women with a mean age of 41, underwent conventional radiography and MRI of the lumbar spine. Thirteen patients also received myelogram", with disc space reduction "in 9 of the 17 patients" "estimated to exceed 50%" and vertebral slipping "from 5 to 25 mm". Myelography showed waist-like dural sac deformation and bilateral root sleeve shortening "in 5 of the 13 patients", was "normal" in "4 patients", and often had minimal nerve root influence despite severe olisthesis, while MRI showed reactive vertebral changes "in eight cases", complete disc space reduction without protrusion "in 2 patients", a posterolateral bulge "in 14 patients", and symmetric protrusion "not exceeding 5 mm" in "four patients". Across "38 foramina", MRI categorized nerves as "normal nerve (n = 8); compressed nerve (n = 16); disappearance of fat and nerve not possible to identify (n = 9)", leading authors to note myelography "was of limited value" and that the study provides "Level III" evidence that "MR imaging provides superior imaging of the nerve root compared to myelography"; "post myelogram CT was not performed". A second study by Jinkins et al "conducted a prospective radiographic analysis" using MRI "in 15 consecutive patients" with assessments "blinded to the patients' clinical history", defining impingement as "circumferential or pincer-like entrapment of the nerve root and obliteration of the perineural fat", and diagnosing radiculopathy by electromyography or dermatomal lower-extremity pain.

### The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) evidence-based clinical guideline of interventional treatments for low back pain [^115u7PxB]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Standalone lumbar interspinous spacers are indicated to treat skeletally mature patients suffering from painful walking, numbness, and/or cramping in the legs (neurogenic claudication) secondary to a diagnosis of moderate degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, with or without Grade 1 spondylolisthesis, as confirmed by advanced radiographic imaging. They are indicated for those patients with impaired physical function who experience relief in flexion from symptoms of leg/buttock/groin pain, numbness, and/or cramping, with or without back pain, and who have undergone at least 6 months of non-operative treatment. Interspinous spacers may be implanted at one or two adjacent lumbar levels in patients in whom treatment is indicated at no more than two levels, from L1 to L5.

For this intended use, moderate degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis is defined as follows:
25% to 50% reduction in the central canal and/or nerve root canal (subarticular, neuroforaminal) compared to the adjacent levels on radiographic studies, with radiographic confirmation of any one of the following:

Evidence of thecal sac and/or cauda equina compression,
Evidence of nerve root impingement (displacement or compression) by either osseous or non-osseous elements,
Evidence of hypertrophic facets with canal encroachment.

And associated with the following clinical signs:
Presents with moderately impaired physical function defined as a score of ≥ 2.0 on the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ),
Ability to sit for 50 min without pain and to walk 50 feet or more.

The interspinous spacers may be contraindicated in the following situations:
Severe spinal stenosis with neurological deficits
Multilevel (more than 2 levels of spinal stenosis)
Spinal instability (> 3mm of translation)
Osteoporosis (high risk for spinous process fracture)
Scoliosis (Cobb angle > 17 degrees)
Baastrup's disease
Greater than grade I spondylolisthesis
Previous lumbar surgery at the affected level
Symptoms not relieved with forward flexion

Safety/Complications

The device and device-related adverse effects (AEs) as reported during the RCT, post hoc analyses, and clinical registries performed to date are quite minimal. The most commonly reported minor, self-limiting post-procedure adverse events included incisional pain and transient worsening of back pain. The following device- or procedure-related events have been reported:
23 spinous process fractures
10 wound complications
2 infections
50 reoperations/revisions

### Stretch on the L5 nerve root in high-grade spondylolisthesis reduction [^115xUiVp]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

L5 nerve root (L5-NR) injury after surgery for high-grade spondylolisthesis (HGS) was considered a nerve stretch associated with reduction. Currently, however, no study has directly measured the stretch on the L5-NR during HGS reduction procedures.

Methods

CT data of 4 patients with mild lumbar degeneration (control group [CG]) and 4 patients with HGS (spondylolisthesis group [SG]) were used for 3D printing to develop L5 vertebrae and sacrum models. These models were mounted on a self-designed reduction apparatus, which performed vertical translation (disc heights of 0, 5, and 10 mm), anterior-posterior translation (reduction, 0%-100%), and slip-angle correction (0° to -30°). The L5-NR was simulated by using a rabbit sciatic nerve. The cephalic side of the nerve was fixed at the upper base of the L5 pedicle, while the caudal side was connected to a high-precision sensor and an indicator to measure the tension (stretch) on the nerve during the reduction procedures in real time.

Results

The SG had shorter L5-NRs than the CG. At a 0-mm disc height, the peak tension on the L5-NR changed from 0 N (reduction 0%) to 1.81 ± 0.54 N (reduction 100%) in the SG and to 1.78 ± 0.71 N in the CG. At a 10-mm disc height, the tension changed from 1.50 ± 0.67 N to 4.97 ± 1.04 N in the SG and from 0.92 ± 0.45 N to 3.26 ± 0.88 N in the CG. In both the CG and SG, at the same disc height, all values from the complete reduction process were statistically significant. Furthermore, at the same degree of reduction, the comparisons between different disc heights were almost all statistically significant. Intergroup comparisons showed that an increased disc height would cause more tension on the L5-NR in the SG than in the CG. At a 10-mm disc height, all results between the groups demonstrated statistical significance. The slip-angle correction produced a slight increase in the tension on the L5-NR in both groups.

Conclusions

Increased disc height and reduction significantly increased the tension on the L5-NR, which demonstrated a nonlinear curve. The slip-angle correction from 0° to -30° slightly increased the tension on the L5-NR. Under the same degree of reduction and restored disc height, the SG had more tension on the L5-NR than the CG.

### The accuracy of the physical examination for the diagnosis of midlumbar and low lumbar nerve root impingement [^113DW8Wg]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study with prospective recruitment. OBJECTIVE.: To determine the accuracy of the physical examination for the diagnosis of midlumbar nerve root impingement (L2, L3, or L4), low lumbar nerve root impingement (L5 or S1) and level-specific lumbar nerve root impingement on magnetic resonance imaging, using individual tests and combinations of tests.

Summary Of Background Data

The sensitivity and specificity of the physical examination for the localization of nerve root impingement has not been previously studied.

Methods

Sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated for the ability of individual tests and test combinations to predict the presence or absence of nerve root impingement at midlumbar, low lumbar, and specific nerve root levels.

Results

LRs ≥ 5.0 indicate moderate to large changes from pre-test probability of nerve root impingement to post-test probability. For the diagnosis of midlumbar impingement, the femoral stretch test (FST), crossed FST, medial ankle pinprick sensation, and patellar reflex testing demonstrated LRs ≥ 5.0 (LR ∞). LRs ≥ 5.0 were observed with the combinations of FST and either patellar reflex testing (LR 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–21) or the sit-to-stand test (LR ∞). For the diagnosis of low lumbar impingement, the Achilles reflex test demonstrated an LR ≥ 5.0 (LR 7.1; 95% CI 0.96–53); test combinations did not increase LRs. For the diagnosis of level-specific impingement, LRs ≥ 5.0 were observed for anterior thigh sensation at L2 (LR 13; 95% CI 1.8–87); FST at L3 (LR 5.7; 95% CI 2.3–4.4); patellar reflex testing (LR 7.7; 95% CI 1.7–35), medial ankle sensation (LR ∞), or crossed FST (LR 13; 95% CI 1.8–87) at L4; and hip abductor strength at L5 (LR 11; 95% CI 1.3–84). Test combinations increased LRs for level-specific root impingement at the L4 level only.

Conclusion

Individual physical examination tests may provide clinical information that substantially alters the likelihood that midlumbar impingement, low lumbar impingement, or level-specific impingement is present. Test combinations improve diagnostic accuracy for midlum-bar impingement.

### The mannequin sign [^114VrndF]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective observational study.

Objectives

The critical appraisal of the mannequin sign in the validation of patients with symptoms of sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Sixty-five consecutive patients with magnetic resonance imaging-proven lumbar disc herniation and symptoms of sciatica. Mean patient age was 48 (range 28–62) years. Thirty-seven patients were male and 28 were female.

Methods

The mannequin sign is positive when a patient adopts an antalgic posture with the relevant lower limb flexed at the hip and knee with the pelvis tilting towards the affected side, in the classic manner of a mannequin's pose. Reproducibility of the sign was recorded when all patients were examined by a second clinician. Lumbar disc herniation with nerve root impingement was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging.

Results

The mannequin sign had 100% reproducibility and 80% sensitivity in diagnosing lumbar disc herniations with nerve root impingement. Twenty-four patients had L4-L5 disc herniations and 41 had L5-S1 disc herniations.

Conclusion

Astute clinical examination can minimize inaccurate diagnosis, unnecessary investigations, and even inappropriate surgical intervention. The mannequin sign, first observed and anecdotally reported by the senior author (D.C.), has now been critically appraised.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^115S1H6s]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing interventional procedures (risk stratification), ASIPP 2024 guidelines recommend to use the following risk categorization of interventional techniques

|Intermediate risk|- Caudal epidural injection <br/> - Caudal epidural adhesiolysis <br/> - Lumbar interlaminar epidural injection at L5, S1 <br/> - Cervical, thoracic, and lumbar transforaminal at L1 and L2|
|High risk|- Cervical, thoracic, and lumbar (above L5) interlaminar epidurals <br/> - Trigeminal ganglion, ophthalmic division, and sphenopalatine ganglion blocks <br/> - Discography and intradiscal procedures (lumbosacral, cervical, and thoracic) <br/> - Dorsal column and dorsal root ganglion stimulator trial and implantation <br/> - Intrathecal catheter and pump implant <br/> - Vertebral augmentation (sacral, lumbar, thoracic, and cervical) <br/> - Percutaneous and endoscopic disc decompression procedures <br/> - Minimally invasive lumbar decompression <br/> - Trigeminal and cranial nerve blocks and stimulation <br/> - Sympathetic blocks (stellate ganglion, thoracic sympathetic, splanchnic, celiac plexus, lumbar sympathetic, hypogastric plexus) <br/> - Percutaneous adhesiolysis with interlaminar or transforaminal approach (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar) <br/> - Intervertebral spinous prosthesis including lateral fusion <br/> - Sacroiliac joint fusion <br/> - Intracept procedure.|

### An unusual case of footdrop: anterior disc herniation mimicking a nerve sheath tumor [^111StR5n]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Extreme lateral disc herniations are described. Usually, the herniated disc is described as being at the lateral edge of the neural foramen. Herniated discs that lodge beyond this location need to be included in the differential of retroperitoneal lesions impinging on nerve roots.

Clinical Presentation

A 76-year-old woman presented with left leg radicular symptoms, including footdrop and a retroperitoneal lesion. Given the location of the lesion and its distance from the edge of the neural foramen, the differential diagnosis favored a nerve sheath tumor.

Intervention

An anterior retroperitoneal approach was taken. At the time of surgery, the lesion proved to be a herniated disc arising from the anterior surface of the L5-S1 disc space, medial to the psoas muscle. The disc herniation resulted in severe compression of the L5 nerve root as the root joined the lumbosacral plexus. This type of even more extreme lateral disc herniation is not widely reported. At this location, there are reports of clinicians confusing discs for tumors and occasionally tumors for discs. Given that some disc herniations are no longer visually adjacent to the foramen, perhaps extreme lateral disc herniation is not an ideal term. This individual case report is supplemented with a review of the literature on this rare condition with specific searches for disc, retroperitoneal, anterior herniation.

Conclusion

Using the term anterior disc herniation will aid clinicians in including herniated disc fragments in the differential diagnosis for lesions affecting nerve roots anterior to the spine in this retroperitoneal location.

### Evaluating lower back pain with the aid of imaging… [^114FkcQK]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Lower back pain is a problem commonly treated by family physicians and the most common cause of work disability in the United States. Most patients have simple back pain that resolves spontaneously or with minor interventions. The major task is to identify the 5 percent of patients who have serious disorders. Jarvik and Deyo discuss the differential diagnosis of lower back pain and review the appropriate work-up. Because the symptoms and pathologic causes may not be obviously related, making a definitive diagnosis can be difficult. The differential diagnosis can be categorized into mechanical causes that do not involve inflammation or infection; nonmechanical causes that include inflammation, infection, and infiltrative disease; and visceral causes that do not involve the spine. Some diagnoses, which remain controversial, include spinal instability and internal disc disruption.

The approach to correctly diagnosing lower back pain involves identifying underlying systemic disease, recognizing neurologic impairment that may require surgery, and acknowledging any psychosocial factors contributing to the pain. Sciatica is often the first clue to neurologic involvement in back pain, especially in younger adults. True radicular pain usually travels to below the knee. Herniated intervertebral discs, generally involving the L5 or S1 nerve roots, are the most common cause of sciatica. Spinal stenosis results from bone abnormality, soft tissue pressure, or both, and it occurs more commonly in older adults. The classic symptom of spinal stenosis is neurogenic claudication when the patient is standing. Numbness and tingling also may be present, with symptom relief when the patient is sitting and the spine is flexed.

Cauda equina syndrome, resulting from local compression, is a surgical emergency, with the most common symptoms being urinary retention, sciatica, sensory and motor deficits, abnormal straight-leg raising, and decreased sphincter tone. Sensory deficits frequently are present over the buttocks, thighs, and perineum. The authors used a comprehensive MEDLINE search to evaluate diagnostic strategies for lower back pain. Plain radiographs are the most common mode used. Anteroposterior and lateral views may be useful for revealing alignment, disc and vertebral body height, and gross impression of bone density and architecture. Oblique and spot lateral views are not routinely recommended by the former Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. Lumbar radiography has the potential of serious radiation exposure to the gonads that may be especially hazardous in young women.

Plain radiographs are less sensitive for metastatic lesions than are other imaging tests. When lytic or blastic lesions are seen, the specificity is high, but the sensitivity is low. Compression fractures may be seen well, but the chronicity of the fracture cannot be judged. Results are poorer for identification of bone infection, herniated discs, spinal stenosis, or nerve root impingement. Computed tomography has better sensitivity than plain lumbar radiography for identification of herniated discs, central stenosis, and nerve root impingement. Magnetic resonance imaging has better soft tissue contrast than computed tomography, allowing improved visualization of different parts of the disc, the vertebral marrow, and spinal canal. MRI does not use ionizing radiation but does not view cortical bone well and is a poor choice for identifying an acute fracture.

### A novel anatomo-physiologic high-grade spondylolisthesis model to evaluate L5 nerve stretch injury after spondylolisthesis reduction [^114JG47g]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Palsy of the fifth lumbar nerve is a well-known complication following surgical correction of high-grade spondylolisthesis due to traction on the nerve root during reduction. The incidence of neurological deficits, such as nerve root, cauda equina, and peripheral nerve palsy, has been reported as high as 45%, although 90% of cases eventually improve upon follow-up. Besides traction injury to the L5 nerve root during the reduction process, other possible mechanisms of L5 palsy include neurovascular dysfunction, foraminal morphometry, temporary displacement of the L5 nerve root during decompression, and hyperextension of the patient during positioning. In order to minimize postoperative L5 nerve palsy after reduction of high-grade spondylolisthesis, several authors hypothesize that most of the total L5 nerve strain occurs during the second half of reduction, and therefore suggest a reduction of no more than 50% and/or decompression of the L5 nerve roots prior to reduction. Other potentially protective measures include electromyography (EMG) monitoring and postoperative positioning of the patient in a hip- and knee-flexed position with progressive straightening leg extension over several days.

Aside from few case reports, which are predominantly limited to neurological deficits in general, the incidence of L5 nerve palsy in spinal surgery has not been well described in the literature. Although postoperative L5 nerve palsy with foot drop and dysesthesia is not life-threatening, they frequently necessitate longer hospitalization, intensive physiotherapy, and rehabilitation and can lead to permanent disability in the absence of spontaneous recovery. Furthermore, L5 nerve palsies in spinal surgery impair patients' ability to perform activities of daily living and burden the healthcare system with higher treatment costs.

Presently, the true mechanism underlying postoperative L5 nerve palsy remains unclear and is likely multifactorial in origin. However, a deeper understanding of the morphological parameters and anatomic relationships of the L5 nerve root during specific surgical procedures could add further insight to the stretch injury hypothesis. Herein, we simulate intraoperative reduction maneuvers for high-grade spondylolisthesis in order to analyze the anatomic displacement and stretching of the L5 nerve root and evaluate this process as a potential cause for postoperative L5 nerve palsy.

### Previously unreported complications associated with integrated cage screws following anterior lumbar interbody fusion: report of 2 cases [^114b1WeQ]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) is a widely performed surgical treatment for various lumbar spine pathologies. The authors present the first reports of virtually identical cases of complications with integrated screws in stand-alone interbody cages. Two patients presented with the onset of S-1 radiculopathy due to screw misplacements following an ALIF procedure. In both cases, an integrated screw from the cage penetrated the dorsal aspect of the S-1 cortical margin of the vertebra, extended into the neural foramen, and injured the traversing left S-1 nerve roots. Advanced neuroimaging findings indicated nerve root impingement by the protruding screw tip. After substantial delays, radiculopathic symptoms were treated with removal of the offending instrumentation, aggressive posterior decompression of the bony and ligamentous structures, and posterolateral fusion surgery with pedicle screw fixation. Postoperative radiographic findings demonstrated decompression of the symptomatic nerve roots via removal of the extruded screw tips from the neural foramina.

### Navigated radiofrequency ablation peripheral rhizotomy for lumbosacral hypertonia in a nonambulatory patient with spinal fusion: indications, surgical techniques, and lessons learned [^115s1seN]. Operative Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We present a pediatric patient with bilateral lower extremity hypertonia and severe scoliosis with instrumented spinal fusion who underwent a navigated RFA for nonselective peripheral rhizotomy. We successfully navigated to and ablated the bilateral L1-L5 peripheral nerves with this approach. We highlight this case to detail our operative technique and lessons learned.

Considerations for RFA Peripheral Rhizotomy in Pediatric Patients

Movement disorders in children most commonly manifest as hypertonia from pathologies such as cerebral palsy, congenital abnormalities, and metabolic conditions. Treatment is multimodal including bracing, therapies, medical management with antispasmodics, and ITB and rhizotomy evaluation. Unfortunately, the nonambulatory population of gross motor functional classification score IV and V patients do not benefit from selective rhizotomy; the surgical approaches to these patients are termed nonselective, palliative, or partial and sometimes include the addition of ventral root sectioning.

Dorsal afferent pathways are implicated in the pathophysiology of hypertonia from spasticity, and the interruption of this pathway produces the desired improvement. Therefore, there are many modifications to the surgical access and technique of dorsal rhizotomy, first described in the 1960sand further pioneered by Drs. Peacock and Park, with exposure ranging from multilevel laminectomy for access to each nerve root as it exits the spinal canal or focally over the conus, respectively.

Ventral-dorsal rhizotomy is an adaptation of dorsal rhizotomy to include sectioning of the ventral nerve roots. It is a tone control surgery for nonambulatory children, and not a gain-of-function surgery, with ventral rhizotomy performed in addition to the dorsal root sectioning when dystonia is present to further facilitate muscle relaxation. This surgical intervention may involve inclusion of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in the ablation field. The DRG is not the target of the RFA because injury to the DRG has been linked to allodynia. Here, we present the application of percutaneous RFA to achieve a nonselective ventral-dorsal rhizotomy, further expanding on modifications and techniques used to reduce hypertonia.

What constitutes failure of conservative management?

Surgery is also indicated, when there is a failure of conservative treatment, either for pain or neurologic deficit. Pain may arise from persistent infection, progressive destruction of vertebral structure, or the instability and deformity that ensue. The latter may be painful itself but may also cause nerve root impingement. Failure is construed when there is a lack of response to chemotherapy, with or without brace or bed rest, after a reasonable period, usually taken as 3–4 weeks.

Large abscesses may also cause pain, but modern imaging equipment has made possible procedures such as CT-guided drainage. Adequate drainage could often be obtained using these percutaneous techniques at least for iliopsoas abscesses. Anterior cervical and thoracic abscesses may prove to be too difficult. And as the clearance of abscess plays a vital role, surgical drainage will be necessary in these cases.

### Clinical observation of CT-guided intra-articular conventional radiofrequency and pulsed radiofrequency in the treatment of chronic sacroiliac joint pain [^115Muozr]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

At present, there are various treatment options for sacroiliac pain, including conservative treatment, interventional therapy, and surgical treatment. The treatment is selected according to the patient's condition, and conservative treatment is preferred. Most patients may have a better curative effect. However, some patients have poor conservative treatment effect and the course of the disease is prolonged. At this time, interventional therapy can be further considered. Interventional therapy has the advantages of small trauma, quick recovery, short operation time, and short postoperative hospital stay, while the surgical treatment is often the last choice because of the large trauma. IA injection of local anesthetics and cortisol directly into the joints can quickly decrease inflammation in and around the joints, relieve pain, and promote tissue repair, but the maintenance time is short and repeated treatment always has more side effects.RFD is one of the most rapidly developing technology in recent years. In some intractable sacroiliac pain, some scholars had achieved good results by using radiofrequency thermo-coagulation. Studies had shown that RFD was effective in treating chronic refractory SIJP. The effective rate of 6 months after treatment could reach 49.9%, and in some studies, the effective rate of 9 months after RFD reached 89%and could provide significant relief for up to one year. Gevargez et alapplied CRF to the posterior interosseous sacroiliac ligaments and the dorsal rami of the L5 spinal nerve. No pain was reported by 34.2%, and significant pain relief was experienced by 31.6%. Cohen et alretrospectively evaluated 40 patients in two institutions. The patients received RFD of L4–L5 primary dorsal rami and S1–S3 lateral branches. Fifty-two percent obtained positive results and believed that the CRF was effective in the treatment of sacroiliac pain, and the long-term effect was satisfactory. However, van Tilburg CW et alperformed radiofrequency on the S1–S4 nerve root lateral branches and L5 posterior branch. Compared with the sham group, the hypothesis of no difference in the pain reduction or global perceptual effect cannot be rejected. CRF could cause nerve damage, which easily led to local sensory retardation, sensory degeneration, abnormal pain, persistent weakness in the lower limbs, and other complications such as burning and numbness. As the maximum temperature of the PRF electrode does not exceed 42°C, there is no significant nerve damage in the PRF compared to the CRF. Ahadianfound that PRF was similar to CRF on demonstrating response rates for facet arthropathy, sacroiliac arthropathy, and many other chronic pain conditions. Vallejo et alperformed pulsed RFD on the lateral branch of the medial branch of L4, posterior primary rami of L5, and lateral branches S1–S2. A "good" (VAS decrease > 50%) or "excellent" (VAS decrease > 80%) pain relief was experienced by 72.7%, the long-term effect was satisfactory, and it was effective for the treatment of intractable SIJ dysfunction. At present, there are many studies on radiofrequency treatment of local ligament and denervation, but few studies on IA SIJ radiofrequency. Schianchi et al performed IA PRF on the shoulder, knee, trapeziometacarpal, and first metatarsophalangeal joints, and the pain in most of the joints was significantly alleviated. Studies had shown that PRF was superior to CRF in small joint-derived pain. The use of IA PRF in advanced knee osteoarthritis was also effective and safe, but the efficacy on the large joint of the SIJ was still unclear.

### The outcome of hip arthroscopy in the setting of lumbar spine disease is beneficial, yet limited: a systematic review of existing evidence [^113GU9dg]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare hip arthroscopy outcomes in femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) patients with concurrent symptomatic lumbar spine disease to the outcomes of arthroscopic FAI patients without spine disease.

Methods

A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines via PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar databases. Studies were valid for inclusion if they had an average follow-up ≥ 12 months and compared patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in hip arthroscopy patients with and without concurrent spinal disease. Data collected included study characteristics, patient demographics, follow-up intervals, surgical indications, spinal pathology, PROMs, and reoperation rates.

Results

Twelve studies were included in this systematic review. 3,107 patients who underwent hip arthroscopy were evaluated: 1,056 with coexisting lumbar spine disease (spine cohort) and 2,051 control subjects without spine disease (control cohort). The average follow-up period was 24 months. Across included studies, there were 35 instances wherein postoperative PROM scores reported by each cohort were compared. In all 35 instances, the spine cohort reported inferior postoperative PROM scores with the difference being significant (P < .05) on 23 PROMs. Collectively, 23 cases were available contrasting the proportion of each cohort to achieve the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). In 22 (95.65%) of these cases, the spine cohort achieved the MCID at a lower rate than the control cohort. There were 14 PROMs, wherein intragroup analyses were reported that compared the preoperative and postoperative score reported by the spine cohort. On all 14 PROMs, the spine cohort reported significant (P < .05) improvement after arthroscopic intervention.

Conclusion

FAI patients with coexisting lumbar spine pathology experience significant improvement from baseline state after arthroscopic intervention. However, the postoperative outcomes reported are inferior, and the improvement from arthroscopy was limited when compared to surgical control subjects with FAI and normal spinal anatomy.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV: systematic review of Level II, III, and IV studies.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^111wjTRA]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Features of somatic and radicular pain — somatic or referred pain versus radicular pain are contrasted across causes, symptoms, mechanical modification, radiation, and signs. Segment causes for somatic or referred pain include posterior elements such as "Posterior segment or element", "Facet joint pain", "Sacroiliac joint pain", "Myofascial syndrome", and "Internal disc disruption", whereas radicular pain lists "Anterior segment", "Disc herniation", "Annular tear, discogenic pain", and "Spinal stenosis". Symptoms differ with somatic described as "Dull, aching, deep" and "Like an expanding pressure", while radicular is "Sharp, shooting, superficial, lancinating" and "Like an electric shock". Somatic pain is "Poorly localized", "Covers a wide area", with "Back worse than leg", "No paresthesia", and "No radicular or shooting pain", whereas radicular pain is "Well localized", "Leg worse than back", has "Paresthesia present", is "Well defined", with "Radicular distribution". Mechanical modification shows somatic "Worse with extension" and "Better with flexion" with "No radicular pattern", while radicular is "Worse with flexion" and "Better with extension" with "Radicular pattern". Radiation for somatic is "Low back to hip, thigh, groin", with "Radiation below knee unusual" and "Quasi segmental", while radicular "Follows nerve distribution", with "Radiation below knee common" and "Radicular pattern". Signs differ in that sensory alteration is "Uncommon" for somatic and "Probable" for radicular; motor changes show somatic "Only subjective weakness" and "Atrophy rare" versus radicular "Objective weakness" and "Atrophy possibly present"; reflex changes are "None" for somatic and "Commonly described, but seen only occasionally" for radicular; straight leg raises show somatic "Only low back pain" versus radicular "Reproduction of leg pain", and somatic presents "No root tension signs" versus radicular "Positive root tension signs".

Complications and Typical Case

The ASD group showed two cases of postoperative complications. One case involved an intraoperative dural tear but showed a favorable recovery following postoperative treatment. Another case exhibited radiating pain 2 days postoperatively, indicating recurrent disc herniation. Symptoms improved after subsequent PTED. The non-ASD group showed one patient who suffered a postoperative complication, characterized by 4-grade strength and residual pain in the right iliopsoas muscle. Neuraxial steroids demonstrated satisfactory results. Typical case is shown in Figures 2, 3.

### Which kind of prognosis is better in the treatment of cervical and lumbar disc herniation with coblation nucleoplasty? [^113aT9Lz]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cervical or lumbar discogenic pain affects more than 50% of patients, which severely impair quality of life and impose a huge socioeconomic burden. Various treatments are available for discogenic pain, such as medication, physical therapy, nerve block, behavior management, psychotherapy, minimally invasive interventions, and fusion or non-fusion surgery. However, these treatments have obvious limitations and complications, and do not always yield satisfactory results.

In CDH and LDH, the discs in the spine bulge or protrude from their normal positions, which can cause pain or numbness in the corresponding region. Disc herniation is primarily occurring at levels of C6/7, L4/5 and L5/S1. In consistent with this finding, our results showed that CDH was mostly observed at the levels of C5/6 (52.73%) and C6/7 (41.82%), whereas LDH was mainly detected at the levels of L4/5 (50.79%) and L5/S1 (42.86%). Conservative treatment is the first choice for most patients with disc herniation, including physical therapy, anti-inflammatory and epidural steroid injection. Decompression surgery may be considered when the conservative treatment fails to improve the condition, including discectomy for radiculopathy from herniated intervertebral disc, decompressive laminectomy for symptomatic spinal stenosis with or without degenerative spondylolisthesis, and fusion for nonradicular pain with degenerative changes.

### Navigated radiofrequency ablation peripheral rhizotomy for lumbosacral hypertonia in a nonambulatory patient with spinal fusion: indications, surgical techniques, and lessons learned [^111u4oDP]. Operative Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

LESSONS LEARNED

Patient Selection

Nonambulatory patients with severe lower extremity hypertonia who might be considered for a lumbosacral rhizotomy but have significant open surgical access difficulty (eg, spinal fusion) are indicated for an RFA peripheral rhizotomy. The main limitations of RFA peripheral rhizotomy are the lack of direct visualization of the nerve root target and the limited ability to confirm the extent of ablation intraoperatively. We could not access the S1 nerve roots based on the length of the 15 cm RFA needle, and we had to take a very angled trajectory to L5 by entering through our L3 skin incision. Severe lordosis will worsen this access issue.

Our navigated technique relies on surgical adjuncts. We used the inferior pedicle as our target guide, aiming parallel and superior to access the peripheral nerve in the foramen. We have found that navigation improves OR efficiency over fluoroscopy and optimizes the successful targeting of the neuroforamina, especially in this child with a severe scoliotic deformity with a rotational component. The benefit of navigation was most evident when planning trajectories to the L5 nerve root, allowing us to avoid the iliac crest.

Severe spinal deformity with prior spinal fusion and heterotopic bone mass makes any attempt at open rhizotomy unlikely. The close approximation of rods, depth of heterotopic bone, and dural scarring make the risk profile of a conventional open approach very high, thus favoring this safe and effective minimal access technique. In addition, this technique decreases pathologic tone in the available range of motion; these patients often have comorbid contractures which any tone surgery will not treat.

### "Successful minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion in patients presenting with concomitant sacroiliac joint dysfunction and joint auto fusion" [^113yFKNh]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is a common cause of lower back pain, especially in patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery. While spontaneous bony fusion, i.e. auto-fusion, of the sacroiliac joint may provide mechanical stability, the underlying pathophysiology of this disease remains incompletely understood. Here, we present two patients with pre-operative auto-fused joints presenting with sacroiliac joint dysfunction who underwent successful minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion.

Case Presentations

Two patients presented with pre-existing radiologic auto-fusion of their sacroiliac joints with intra-articular injection-proven sacroiliac joint dysfunction refractory to conservative management. Both patients underwent minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion and reported complete and sustained pain relief persisting at one year post-operatively. Radiologic findings confirmed the appropriate placement of fixation hardware without complications.

Discussion

These cases challenge the conventional understanding that bony fusion resolves sacroiliac joint dysfunction by highlighting the potential role of non-mechanical factors, including neural contributions, in driving persistent pain. Neural innervation of the sacroiliac joint, including lateral branches of the L5-S3 dorsal rami, may be implicated, as supported by recent evidence of effective neural-based interventions.

Conclusions

This report highlights that sacroiliac joint dysfunction may be present in patients with pre-existing auto-fusion. The presence of bony fusion of the sacroiliac joint(s) may not preclude a diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and patients may benefit from minimally invasive fusion surgery. The underlying mechanism of sacroiliac joint dysfunction is complex and incompletely understood.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^115Ubv8t]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis imaging — MRI role applied to degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis: MRI is suggested as the most appropriate, noninvasive test to confirm the presence of anatomic narrowing of the spinal canal or the presence of nerve root impingement in patients with history and physical examination findings consistent with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (Grade B Recommendation), and this consensus is applied here with the understanding that symptoms of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis are related to anatomic narrowing or nerve root impingement similar to lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Differential treatment of nerve root compression pain caused by lumbar disc herniation applying nucleoplasty [^117W3XTi]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Nucleoplasty is a minimally invasive intervention use to perform disc decompression in cases of nerve root compression caused by disc herniation. It is important to find rational guidelines for choosing between nucleoplasty and microsurgery.

Objective

To analyze factors that may impact the results of nucleoplasty, and to validate the rational guidelines between minimally invasive treatment and open surgery.

Study Design

Prospective, non-randomized, cohort study with a minimal follow-up period of 18 months.

Methods

Patients were given a neurological examination, visual analogue scale and Oswestry disability questionnaire, obligatory MRI, optional RCT, and discography, only before nucleoplasty. Patients have been divided into the following groups: Group 1 - patients with a disc protrusion treated with nucleoplasty (n = 46), which has been divided into Subgroup 1A, those with a disc protrusion size ≤ 5 mm (n = 24), and Subgroup 1B, those with a disc protrusion size 6–9 mm (n = 22); Group 2 - patients with a disc extrusion treated with nucleoplasty (n = 27); Group 3 - patients with a disc extrusion or sequester treated with microdiscectomy (n = 65).

Outcome Measures

Clinically significant outcomes were a 50% relief of pain intensity and a 40% decrease of Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).

Results

A decrease of pain intensity and disability was found in all groups of patients, P < 0.0001; SP (statistical power) = 99–100%. Subgroups 1A and 1B showed no clinically significant differences in outcome, P = 0.99; SP = 5.3. Clinically significant results: Group 1–78%; 95% CI (confidence interval) [66; 90%], Group 2–44%; 95% CI [25; 65%], Group 3–93%; 95% CI [85; 98%]. Total annulus disruption increases the rate of unsatisfactory results of nucleoplasty, OR (odds ratio) = 4.5; 95% CI [1.57; 12.87] (logistic regression model, P = 0.0034). Nucleoplasty performed in cases of uncontained disc herniation (disc extrusion) have a significantly higher rate of unsatisfactory results versus microdiscectomy, OR = 19.06; 95% CI [2.29; 68.73] (logistic regression model, P < 0.0001).

Limitations

This study was limited by the small number of patients in each group.

Conclusion

The size of the disc protrusion does not significantly affect the outcome of nucleoplasty. The rational guideline for choosing between the 2 types of surgery is the integrity of the annulus.

### Rate of failure of indirect decompression in lateral single-position surgery: clinical results [^115DEBcF]. Neurosurgical Focus (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Lateral single-position surgery (LSPS) of the lumbar spine generally involves anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) performed in the lateral position (LALIF) at L5-S1 with or without lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) at L4–5 and above, followed by bilateral pedicle screw fixation (PSF) without repositioning the patient. One obstacle to more widespread adoption of LSPS is the perceived need for direct decompression of the neural elements, which typically requires flipping the patient to the prone position. The purpose of this study was to examine the rate of failure of indirect decompression in a cohort of patients undergoing LSPS from L4 to S1.

Methods

A multicenter, post hoc analysis was undertaken from prospectively collected data of patients at 3 institutions who underwent LALIF at L5-S1 with or without LLIF at L4–5 with bilateral PSF in the lateral decubitus position between March 2018 and March 2020. Inclusion criteria were symptoms of radiculopathy or neurogenic claudication, central or foraminal stenosis (regardless of degree or etiology), and indication for interbody fusion at L5-S1 or L4-S1. Patients with back pain only; those who were younger than 18 years; those with tumor, trauma, or suspicion of infection; those needing revision surgery; and patients who required greater than 2 levels of fusion were excluded. Baseline patient demographic information and surgical data were collected and analyzed. The number of patients in whom indirect decompression failed was recorded and each individual case of failure was analyzed.

Results

A total of 178 consecutive patients underwent LSPS during the time period (105 patients underwent LALIF at L5-S1 and 73 patients underwent LALIF at L5-S1 with LLIF at L4–5). The mean follow-up duration was 10.9 ± 6.5 months. Bilateral PSF was placed with the patient in the lateral decubitus position in 149 patients, and there were 29 stand-alone cases. The mean case time was 101.9 ± 41.5 minutes: 79.3 minutes for single-level cases and 134.5 minutes for 2-level cases. Three patients (1.7%) required reoperation for failure of indirect decompression.

Conclusions

The rate of failure of indirect decompression in LSPS from L4 to S1 is exceedingly low. This low risk of failure should be weighed against the risks associated with direct decompression as well as the risks of the extra operative time needed to perform this decompression.

### Editorial commentary: hip arthroscopy in patients with spine pain: outcomes vary compared to patients with isolated hip pathology, but many hip-spine patients Do just as well [^115jVQwY]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Low back pain present concurrently with hip impingement or labral pathology is frustrating for both patient and surgeon. It is difficult to distinguish true hip pathology from secondary low back symptoms, even with the use of diagnostic injections, cross-sectional imaging, electromyography, and/or nerve conduction studies. In addition, even properly indicated hip arthroscopy can exacerbate sciatic nerve dysfunction, a known complication from traction, and altered gait in the early postoperative period can aggravate sacroiliac and lumbar pathology. Moreover, difficult results vary in these patients after hip arthroscopy and show higher revision rates and less improvement in functional scores compared to patients with isolated hip pathology. Nevertheless, appropriately selected "hip-spine" patients show significant benefit from hip arthroscopy. Provided they have appropriate counseling, many hip-spine patients can undergo hip arthroscopy and experience a satisfying, durable outcome, and improvements at 1 year postoperatively are shown to be maintained at 5 or more years.

### Comparing the effectiveness and safety of dexamethasone, methylprednisolone and betamethasone in lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections [^112hRyL9]. Pain Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Particulate steroids are thought to exert their effects for long durations at injection sites. However, these types of steroids carry higher risks when used in epidural steroid injections. Catastrophic spinal cord complications, including sudden-onset paraplegia, have been reported due to intravascular particulate steroid preparations that cause embolisms and occlusion of blood vessels, resulting in spinal cord infarctions. Clinicians, therefore, recommend nonparticulate steroids to mitigate these adverse events. To our knowledge, this is the first retrospective study that addresses the effectiveness and safety of methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and betamethasone when used in transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESIs) for the treatment of lumbar radiculopathy.

Objectives

The primary goal of this study was to compare the proportion of patients who received injections of particulate steroids and required zero repeat injections within 12 months of their initial injection to the proportion of patients who received injections of nonparticulate steroids and also required zero repeat injections, as well as to compare the number of patients in the particulate cohort who required one or more repeat injections within 12 months of their initial injection to the number of patients in the nonparticulate cohort who required the same. The secondary goal was to evaluate the proportion of patients ultimately requiring surgery.

Study Design

This is a single-center, IRB-approved, retrospective study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of nonparticulate as compared to particulate steroid medications when used in TFESIs as minimally invasive treatments for chronic lumbar radiculopathy.

Setting

This study captured data (n = 1717) over a 4-year time frame (01/15/2018 to 01/15/2022).

Methods

The following data were collected from each patient's chart: age, gender, BMI, race, date of initial injection, number of repeat injections at the same lumbosacral level and on the same side within 12 months of the initial injection, and lumbar surgery date (if applicable). Inclusion criteria included: 1) having chronic low back pain of radicular etiology; 2) being at least 18 years old; 3) having experienced the failure of conservative therapy after 12 weeks (including physical therapy and/or medications); 4) having positive physical exam findings supporting nerve impingement (straight leg raise, slump test); and 5) showing lumbar MRI evidence of nerve impingement from disc herniation. Exclusion criteria included: 1) having received prior lumbar surgery at any level (L1-S1); 2) having been given prior TFESIs fewer than 6 months prior to initial injection; 3) having contracted a systemic infection at the proposed injection site; 4) undergoing active cancer treatment; and 5) having gotten any other spine injections.

Results

A significantly greater proportion of patients in the nonparticulate steroid cohort received 0 repeat injections (87.5% vs 71.4%, P < 0.001). The particulate steroid cohort demonstrated a significantly greater proportion of patients who received repeat injections within 12 months after the initial injections (12.5% vs 29.6%, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences among patients requiring surgery between the 2 cohorts. Other outcome measures included the identification of risk factors significantly associated with repeat injections. There was a statistically significant weak positive correlation between age and repeat injections (Pearson corr = 0.102; P < 0.001) and a weak negative correlation between ethnicity/race and repeat injections (point-biserial corr = -0.093; P < 0.001). No adverse events were reported.

Limitations

Not all clinicians included in this study used each of the 3 steroid types, and all clinicians used either particulate or nonparticulate steroids exclusively.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that the clinical outcomes associated with TFESIs of nonparticulate steroids are superior to those associated with TFESIs of particulate steroids when either variety of medication is used to treat lumbar radiculopathy. This is the first study to include a clinically useful predictive model using information on laterality, age, and steroid type.

### Evidence-based practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain [^114BxPTm]. Pain Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Evidence-based practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain are systematically developed and professionally derived statements and recommendations that assist both physicians and patients in making decisions about appropriate health care in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic or persistent pain. The guidelines were developed utilizing an evidence-based approach to increase patient access to treatment, to improve outcomes and appropriateness of care, and to optimize cost-effectiveness. All types of relevant and published evidence and consensus were utilized. The guidelines include a discussion of their purpose, rationale, and importance, including descriptions of the patient population served, the methodology, and the pathophysiologic basis for intervention. Multiple diagnostic and therapeutic interventional techniques are included in this document. Strong evidence was shown for diagnostic facet joint blocks for the diagnosis of facet joint pain, and lumbar provocative discography for discogenic pain. Moderate evidence was shown for sacroiliac joint blocks in the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain, and for transforaminal epidural injections in the preoperative evaluation of patients with negative or inconclusive imaging studies, but with clinical findings of nerve root irritation. Moderate to strong evidence was shown for multiple therapeutic interventional techniques including medial branch blocks and medial branch neurotomy; caudal epidural steroid injections and transforaminal epidural steroid injections; lumbar percutaneous adhesiolysis; and implantable therapies. These guidelines do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations. It is expected that a provider will establish a plan of care on a case-by-case basis, taking into account an individual patient's medical condition, personal needs, and preferences, and the physician's experience. Based on an individual patient's needs, treatment different from that outlined here could be warranted. These guidelines do not represent "standard of care".

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (update) [^117STKbf]. The Spine Journal (2013). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — future directions for research include the following: Continue to develop reliable and reproducible criteria for the diagnosis by cross-sectional imaging of central, subarticular recess and foraminal stenosis; Perform additional interobserver and intraobserver variability studies with MRI and CT myelography using dural sac area as a measure of central canal stenosis, and utilizing nerve root measures incorporating neural impingement as measures of lateral and foraminal stenosis; Future studies assessing the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions should utilize previously defined clinical measures of Lumbar Spinal Stenosis, and state of the art measures of central, lateral recess and neural foraminal stenosis on MRI, CT and CTM; and Perform additional prospective studies addressing the significance of additional findings on axial loaded cross-sectional imaging on patient prognosis and surgical decompression in patients with neurogenic intermittent claudication and radiculopathy. For neurophysiologic evaluation, Perform additional prospective studies addressing the utility of paraspinous mapping and electrodiagnostic testing in the evaluation of patients with clinical and radiologic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis; Future studies should also address the value of these tests in the evaluation of patients with equivocal clinical signs and symptoms, and patients with confounding diagnoses such as diabetes; and Future studies should focus on the ability of paraspinous mapping and electrodiagnostic testing to improve outcomes with surgical decompression.

### Management of an unusual sciatica [^1122t65g]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Extraforaminal entrapment of the L5 nerve root is uncommon, and its management can sometimes be very challenging.

Methods

We present the case of a 57-year-old female, complaining of a sciatica in her left leg, for 3 years, with no response to any kind of conservative treatment. MRI and CT scan revealed the presence of a large L5S1 strictly lateral osteophyte compressing the left L5 root in its extraforaminal path.

Results

The patient underwent a left anterior retroperitoneal approach with assistance from a vascular surgeon given the very close relation between the osteophyte and the left common iliac vein, lying just on top of it, osteophyte was removed in one piece with the use of an osteotome after retraction of the vessels. The patient progressively recovered from her left sciatic pain with a satisfactory clinical result at 1 year.

Conclusion

Literature is sparse on the treatment of extraforaminal entrapment of the L5 nerve root; the current case shows a successful treatment strategy with the use of an anterior approach for direct vision of the lesion and good control of the vessels.

Diagnostic facet joint nerve blocks — diagnostic facet joint injections may be performed either with an intraarticular approach or by blocking the facet joint nerves, and the evidence for diagnostic accuracy of facet joint nerve blocks is good in the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical regions. Common indications are listed as somatic or nonradicular neck, mid back, upper back or low back and headache, upper extremity pain, chest wall pain or lower extremity pain of at least 3 months duration, moderate to severe pain causing functional disability, failure to respond to conservative management including physical therapy modalities with exercise, chiropractic management, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, lack of evidence either for discogenic or sacroiliac joint pain, and lack of disc herniation or evidence of radiculitis.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 10: lumbar fusion for stenosis without spondylolisthesis [^112AXDTx]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Lumbar stenosis is one of the more common radiographic manifestations of the aging process, leading to narrowing of the spinal canal and foramen. When stenosis is clinically relevant, patients often describe activity-related low-back or lower-extremity pain, known as neurogenic claudication. For those patients who do not improve with conservative care, surgery is considered an appropriate treatment alternative. The primary objective of surgery is to reconstitute the spinal canal. The role of fusion, in the absence of a degenerative deformity, is uncertain. The previous guideline recommended against the inclusion of lumbar fusion in the absence of spinal instability or a likelihood of iatrogenic instability. Since the publication of the original guidelines, numerous studies have demonstrated the role of surgical decompression in this patient population; however, few have investigated the utility of fusion in patients without underlying instability. The majority of studies contain a heterogeneous cohort of subjects, often combining patients with and without spondylolisthesis who received various surgical interventions, limiting fusions to those patients with instability. It is difficult if not impossible, therefore, to formulate valid conclusions regarding the utility of fusion for patients with uncomplicated stenosis. Lower-level evidence exists, however, that does not demonstrate an added benefit of fusion for these patients; therefore, in the absence of deformity or instability, the inclusion of a fusion is not recommended.

### Clinical features of conjoined lumbosacral nerve roots versus lumbar intervertebral disc herniations [^117JGE11]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Unidentified nerve root anomalies, conjoined nerve root (CNR) being the most common, may account for some failed spinal surgical procedures as well as intraoperative neural injury. Previous studies have failed to clinically discern CNR from herniated discs and found their surgical outcomes as being inferior. A comparative study of CNR and disc herniations was undertaken. Between 2002 and 2008, 16 consecutive patients were diagnosed intraoperatively with CNR. These patients were matched 1:2 with 32 patients diagnosed with intervertebral disc herniations. Matching was done according to age (within 5 years), gender and level of pathology. Surgery for patients with CNR or disc herniations consisted of routine microsurgical techniques with microdiscectomy, hemilaminotomy, hemilaminectomy and foraminotomy as indicated. Outcomes were measured using the Oswestry Disability Index and the Short Form-36 Questionnaire. Clinical presentation, imaging studies and surgical outcomes were compared between the groups. Conjoined nerve root's incidence in this study was 5.8% of microdiscectomies performed. The S1 nerve root was mainly involved (69%), followed by L5 (31%). Patients with CNR tended to present with nerve root claudication (44%) compared to the radiculopathy accompanying disc herniations (75%). Neurologic deficit was less prevalent among patients with CNR. Nerve root tension tests were not helpful in distinguishing between the etiologies. Radiologist's suspicion threshold for nerve root anomalies was low (0%) and no coronal reconstructions were obtained. The surgeon's clinical suspicion accurately predicted 40% of the CNRs. Surgical outcomes did not differ between the cohorts regarding the rate of postoperative improvement, but CNR patients showed a trend toward having mildly worse long-term outcomes. Suspecting CNRs preoperatively is beneficial for appropriate treatment and avoiding the risk of intraoperative neural injury. With nerve root claudication and imaging suggestive of a "disc herniation", the surgeon should be alert to the differential diagnosis of a CNR. Treatment is directed at obtaining adequate decompression by laminectomy and foraminotomy to relieve the lateral recess stenosis. Outcomes can be expected to be similar to routine disc herniations.

### Diagnosis and management of lumbar spinal stenosis… [^1144iqAt]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Katz JN, Zimmerman ZE, Mass H, Makhni MC. Diagnosis and Management of Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: A Review. JAMA. 2022; 327: 1688–1699. doi: 10.1001/jama.2022.5921 Importance. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent and disabling cause of low back and leg pain in older persons, affecting an estimated 103 million persons worldwide. Most are treated nonoperatively. Approximately 600 000 surgical procedures are performed in the US each year for lumbar spinal stenosis. Observations. The prevalence of the clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis in US adults is approximately 11% and increases with age. The diagnosis can generally be made based on a clinical history of back and lower extremity pain that is provoked by lumbar extension, relieved by lumbar flexion, and confirmed with cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.

Nonoperative treatment includes activity modification such as reducing periods of standing or walking, oral medications to diminish pain such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy. In a series of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis followed up for up to 3 years without operative intervention, approximately one-third of patients reported improvement, approximately 50% reported no change in symptoms, and approximately 10% to 20% of patients reported that their back pain, leg pain, and walking were worse. Long-term benefits of epidural steroid injections for lumbar spinal stenosis have not been demonstrated. Surgery appears effective in carefully selected patients with back, buttock, and lower extremity pain who do not improve with conservative management.

For example, in a randomized trial of 94 participants with symptomatic and radiographic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, decompressive laminectomy improved symptoms more than nonoperative therapy on the Oswestry Disability Index. Among persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and concomitant spondylolisthesis, lumbar fusion increased symptom resolution in 1 trial on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical dimension score, but 2 other trials showed either no important differences between the 2 therapies or noninferiority of lumbar decompression alone compared with lumbar decompression plus spinal fusion. In a noninferiority trial, 71. 4% treated with lumbar decompression alone vs
72.

9% of those receiving decompression plus fusion achieved a 30% or more reduction in Oswestry Disability Index score, consistent with the prespecified noninferiority hypothesis. Fusion is associated with greater risk of complications such as blood loss, infection, longer hospital stays, and higher costs. Thus, the precise indications for concomitant lumbar fusion in persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis remain unclear. Conclusions and Relevance Lumbar spinal stenosis affects approximately 103 million people worldwide and 11% of older adults in the US. First-line therapy is activity modification, analgesia, and physical therapy. Long-term benefits from epidural steroid injections have not been established. Selected patients with continued pain and activity limitation may be candidates for decompressive surgery. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in children and adolescents: II. surgical management [^117MpRPk]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Surgical management is indicated for children and adolescents with spondylolysis and low-grade spondylolisthesis (≤ 50% slip) who fail to respond to nonsurgical measures. In situ posterolateral L5 to S1 fusion is the best option for those with a low-grade slip secondary to L5 pars defects or dysplastic spondylolisthesis at the lumbosacral junction. Pars repair is reserved for patients with symptomatic spondylolysis and low-grade, mobile spondylolisthesis with pars defects cephalad to L5 and for those with multiple-level defects. Screw repair of the pars defect, wiring transverse process to spinous process, and pedicle screw-laminar hook fixation are surgical options. The ideal surgical management of high-grade spondylolisthesis (> 50% slip) is controversial. Spinal fusion has been indicated for children and adolescents with high-grade spondylolisthesis regardless of symptoms. In situ L4 to S1 fusion with cast immobilization is safe and effective for alleviating back pain and neurologic symptoms. Instrumented reduction and fusion techniques permit improved correction of sagittal spinal imbalance and more rapid rehabilitation but are associated with a higher risk of iatrogenic nerve root injuries than in situ techniques. Wide decompression of nerve roots combined with instrumented partial reduction may diminish the risk of neurologic complications. Pseudarthrosis and neurologic injury presenting as L5 radiculopathy and sacral root dysfunction are the most common complications associated with surgical management of high-grade spondylolisthesis.

### American Society of Pain and Neuroscience best practice (ASPN) guideline for the treatment of sacroiliac disorders [^111JRdNE]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound (US)-guided lateral branch block uses the probe placed on the lower sacrum to identify the sacral hiatus which is midline. The probe is then moved to visualize the posterior foramina which will appear as gaps in the hyperechoic bony contour of the sacrum. The injections should also be placed at the lateral sacral crest between the S2 and S3 transverse tubercle, immediately above the S2 transverse tubercle, and at the level of the S1 tubercle directly.

Both intra-articular SIJ injections and lateral branch blocks have been utilized as a diagnostic tool for SIJ pain and as a precursor prior to performing lateral branch radiofrequency neurotomy. The specificity of intra-articular blocks has been questioned due to leakage of local anesthetic from the joint space, spread of local anesthetic to nearby structures, and coverage of the synovial portion of the joint without coverage of the interosseous or dorsal SI ligaments. Diagnostic blockade of the S1–3 lateral branches and the L5 primary dorsal rami (with possible inclusion of the L4 primary dorsal rami) is the preferred diagnostic approach prior to performing neuroablative techniques. In a pilot study by Cohen et al, 13 of 18 patients with SIJ pain experienced significant relief after undergoing diagnostic blocks at the L4–5 dorsal rami and S1–3 lateral branches. Among nine patients who achieved > 50% pain relief from diagnostic blocks, eight patients (89%) achieved ≥ 50% pain relief after lateral branch and L4–5 dorsal rami RFA which persisted at the 9-month follow-up. Dreyfuss et al performed a study on multi-site, multi-depth lateral branch blocks on twenty asymptomatic patients. Ten patients were randomized to receive 0.75% bupivacaine while ten patients were randomized to receive sham (normal saline) multi-site, multi-depth lateral branch blocks. After performing this procedure, provocation testing using a 25-gauge spinal needle probe into each subject's interosseous and dorsal SI ligaments was performed. Seventy percent of subjects in the cohort receiving 0.75% bupivacaine had an insensate interosseous and dorsal SI ligament, versus only 0–10% in the sham cohort. However, only 20% of the interventional cohort and 10% of the sham cohort did not feel SIJ capsular distention. Therefore, this study concluded that multi-site, multi-depth lateral branch blocks are effective in diagnosing extra-articular SIJ pain and may be a valuable tool in determining if lateral branch RFA may help with SIJ pain. However, multi-site, multi-depth lateral branch blocks may possibly not effectively block the intra-articular portion of the SIJ, which is innervated by both ventral and dorsal nerves.

### Diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking provides a valuable quantitative and clinical evaluation for compressed lumbosacral nerve roots: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117PRrVo]. European Spine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with fiber tracking in patients with compressed lumbosacral nerve roots.

Methods

A systematic literature search of databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) was carried out. FA values and ADC values were compared between compressed nerve roots and healthy controls. Pooled and subgroup analyses were performed using fixed or random-effect models based on I 2 heterogeneity.

Results

A total of 262 patients from ten studies with 285 compressed lumbosacral nerve roots and 285 contralateral normal nerve roots were included in the meta-analysis. It was showed in pooled results that FA value was significantly reduced (SMD -3.03, 95% CI [-3.75 to -2.31], P < 0.001) and ADC value was significantly increased (SMD 2.07, 95% CI [0.92 to 3.22], P < 0.001) in the compressed nerve roots, compared with contralateral normal nerve roots. Subgroup analysis comparing the FA values and ADC values in different nerve root ranges (L2-S1, L4-S1, L5-S1, L5, S1) revealed the different ranges of nerve roots were possible sources of heterogeneity.

Conclusions

This study showed that FA value reduction and ADC value increase were valuable indicators of compressed lumbosacral nerve roots. These changes may be related to the neurological symptoms of patients. DTI with fiber tracking can directly visualize and accurately locate the compression zone of nerve roots to help make surgical treatment plans, is more advanced than conventional MRI.

### Case reports: painful limbs / moving extremities: report of two cases [^115GjkjY]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Painful limbs/moving extremities is a relatively rare condition characterized by aching pain in one limb and involuntary movement in the affected fingers or toes. Its pathomechanism is unknown. We report two patients with painful limbs/moving extremities. In one patient with a painful arm and moving fingers, the symptoms were resolved after surgery.

Case Descriptions

Patient 1 was a 36-year-old man with a painful arm and moving fingers. Treatment with administration of analgesics was not effective. Postmyelographic CT showed stenosis of the right C5/C6 foramen attributable to cervical spondylosis and a defect of the contrast material at the foramen. He was treated with cervical foraminotomy. Patient 2 was a 26-year-old woman with a painful leg and moving toes. The pain and involuntary movement appeared 2 weeks after discectomy at L5/S1. Lumbar MRI and myelography showed no indications of nerve root compression. She was treated with a lumbar nerve root block. The pain and involuntary movement completely disappeared in both patients after treatment.

Literature Review

Numerous studies report treatments for painful limbs/moving extremities, but few report successful treatment. Recently, botulinum toxin A injection and epidural spinal cord stimulation have been used and are thought to benefit this condition. Successful surgical treatment previously was reported for only one patient.

Purposes and Clinical Relevance

If imaging indicates compression of nerve tissue, we believe surgical decompression should be considered for patients with painful limbs/moving extremities who do not respond to nonoperative treatment.

### Salvage of failed lateral sacroiliac joint fusion with a novel posterior sacroiliac fusion device: diagnostic approach, surgical technique, and multicenter case series [^113DRXX2]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Lateral Fusion Data

While the minimally invasive lateral approach to sacroiliac joint fusion has a remarkably improved safety profile as compared to the open approach first described in 1921, there is still an up to 16.4% risk of adverse events. In a systematic review by Shamrock et al evaluating fourteen studies, there was found to be a 2% incidence of wound infection and 1.6% incidence of nerve root impingement. Furthermore, weight-bearing restrictions for up to six weeks post-operatively could lead to increased morbidity. As such, there has been motivation to develop a novel therapeutic approach to treat sacroiliac joint dysfunction with an even lower risk profile.

Evidence for the lateral approach has mostly been positive for improving low back pain with the lateral SIJ fusion technique having two large prospective randomized controlled trials. In a prospective, randomized control trial conducted by Polly et al, 148 patients were randomly assigned to either minimally invasive SIJ fusion or conservative management. The surgical arm reported an improvement of 55.4 points on a 100-point VAS scale, as compared to a 12.2-point improvement in the conservative treatment arm. 68% of patients had an improvement in ODI greater than 15 points at 24 months, as compared to 7.5% in the conservative arm. Similarly, Dengler et al found both a statistically and clinically significant difference in pain, disability, and quality of life as compared to conservative management.

However, despite the positive evidence in support of lateral SIJ fusion, there is sufficient data in the literature to conclude that a subset of patients have refractory pain despite appropriate diagnosis and treatment with this therapy. A prospective, randomized control trial by Smith et al evaluating 141 subjects who underwent lateral SIJ fusion found that 30% of patients did not meet the minimum clinically importance difference (MCID) for VAS change (> 20 points) between 6 and 24 months follow-up. Similarly, a prospective single-arm study evaluating 172 patients who underwent lateral SIJ fusion found that 16% of patients failed to meet VAS MCID at 6–24 months follow-up. Further, the MCID for ODI (> 15 points) was not met in either trial in 27% and 34% of patients, respectively. This data reveals that while minimally invasive lateral SIJ fusion is a more efficacious and safe procedure as compared to the open approach, roughly one-third of patients undergoing lateral fusion will not have clinically satisfactory outcomes.

### Sagittal alignment in the degenerative lumbar spine: surgical planning [^112REc77]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Two examples of L5 vertebral body shapes that could factor into restoring segmental lordosis. The yellow lines indicate L5 vertebral end plates.

Although the prior argument emphasizes the importance of sagittal alignment in the degenerative spine, alignment itself is not an indication for surgical intervention. Patients' physical examination, symptomology, and clinical correlation of radiographic findings to patient-reported outcome measures remain the first line to indicate patients for a surgical procedure. Therefore, it is imperative to note that we do not encourage fusing additional segments to optimize the sagittal plane, but rather encourage a critical analysis of segmental lordosis throughout the lumbar spine and an aim of restoring the surgically indicated levels to the normative targets. Figure 4 illustrates 3 types of degenerative spine conditions; note the associated loss of segmental lordosis, cephalad or caudal, and hyperlordotic compensation in adjacent segments -.

5.1.2 Lumbar spinal stenosis — definition, affected levels, causes, symptoms, and surgical prevalence: Spinal stenosis is the result of abnormal narrowing of the spinal canal, lateral recess or the intervertebral foramina, resulting in pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. The two lower motion segments (L3-L4 and L4-L5) are the most commonly affected. Common causes include disc-related degeneration, osteophyte formation, herniated discs, arthritis, ligament or facet joint hypertrophy, epidural fat deposition, spinal tumors, and traumas. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common source of back and leg pain, and often involves weakness and numbness; more severe cases may present with neurological symptoms such as radiculopathy, myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome, and permanent numbness or paralysis can result from a long-term compression. Lumbar spinal stenosis is the most common cause of spinal surgery in patients over 65 years old.

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^111HmSCN]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Cryoneurolysis (CN) (or Cryoneuroablation or Cryoanalgesia) (Fig. 10)

Principle

Cryoneurolysis is an application of cold to the nerve to cause its denaturation. The physical principles relies on the Joule–Thompson effect, which is based on a rapid decompression of gas (either N 2 O or CO 2) at the extremity of the probe, capable of delivering ice-cold temperatures of up to −70 °C. At the tip of the needle, an ice ball is created in the surrounding tissues. It induces a conduction block, similar to the effect of local anesthetics (all nerves fibres stop conducting at −20 C°). Long-term pain relief from nerve freezing is obtained because of the vascular damage caused by ice crystals to the vasa vasorum, which causes endo-neural edema and cell death.

Fig. 10

CT-guided cryoablation at the right L5-S1 level. a: Anatomically accurate cryoprobe (white arrow) placement with the target midway between the upper end and middle of the ala of the sacrum (white star). b: 3D reconstruction showing the same cryoprobe placement. Cryoprobe needle tip (c): ice-ball formation at the cryoprobe tip (Joule–Thompson effect) (d)

Technique

As with RFA, the success of cryoneurolysis is dependent on patient selection and accurate probe placement, which should follow the same guidelines described by the ISIS. The extent and duration of the effect is therefore a function of the degree of cold obtained and the length of cold application. In contrast to RFA, a tangential approach of the probe is not essential. Minimal, if any, sedation should be used, as the patient must be conscious to respond to sensory and motor stimulation. Moreover, intra-procedural pain in CN appears to be tolerable.

Results

Lloyd proposed CN as superior to chemical neurolysis. However, CN technique has been described as less accurate than RF. The lasting effect compared to RF also seems unclear. No studies comparing CN and RFA in FJ pain management are available to date. Three recent prospective studies showed a reduction of pain at 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months, with a 50% pain decrease. A recent retrospective study by Wölter et al. in 2011 confirmed this trend. Advantages of CN include less tissue damage, less risk of neuroma or neuritis, and a larger denervation area at the needle tip.

Results

Patient

At the time of the DMC recommendation to stop enrollment, 140 patients were randomized (66 BVN ablation, 74 SC) at 20 out of 23 study sites. The percentage of patients with LBP symptoms ≥ 5 years was 71.4%. Overall, baseline ODI was 45.9; VAS was 6.8; and mean age was 49.7 years. Demographics and baseline characteristics of the two randomized populations were similar (see table 2).

Baseline characteristics

In the SC arm, seven patients withdrew or were lost to follow-up, and one patient exited for disc herniation surgery. Of the remaining 66 SC patients, 61 (92%) elected to receive BVN ablation and 5 declined ablation treatment (see figure 1).

Figure 1

BMI, body mass index; BVN, basivertebral nerve; ODI, Oswestry Disability Index; VAS, Visual Analog Scale.

Treatment results

In the BVN ablation arm, two vertebral bodies were treated in 51 patients (77.3%), three vertebral bodies in 14 patients (21.2%), and four vertebral bodies in 1 patient (1.5%). The most often treated vertebral body was L5 (98.5%), followed by S1 (62.1%), and L4 (54.5%). Mean procedure duration was 88.0 min (SD 37.1) from incision to closure. Targeting was adjudicated as successful in 97% of patients and in 99% of vertebral bodies. Similar targeting success was demonstrated following BVN ablation in the former SC arm with evaluable MRIs (93% of patients and 96% of vertebral bodies), with two subjects treated at L5/S1, who did not have a 6-week MRI to evaluate conservatively deemed a target failure. Patients with one or more levels of targeting failure are included in this ITT analysis.

### Foot tapping test as a simple quantitative index of motor function for lumbosacral radiculopathy [^1159g1tN]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective review of data from patients who underwent surgical treatment for lumbosacral radiculopathy.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of the foot tapping test (FTT) in evaluating lower limb motor function in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy pre and postsurgery.

Background

Lumbosacral radiculopathy is becoming increasingly common in aging populations. Despite standard treatments, paralysis often leads to incomplete postoperative recovery, necessitating early detection and interventions.

Patients and Methods

We enrolled individuals who underwent surgery for lumbosacral radiculopathy at our facility between 2009 and 2020. Patients with a history of lumbar surgeries, dialysis, rheumatoid arthritis, and transitional vertebrae were excluded. The FTT score was measured by having the sole of the foot tap as many times as possible for 10 seconds while keeping the heel in contact with the floor. The L4, L5, and S1 groups were assigned using the scores on the side of the radiculopathy, and the control group was assigned using the scores on the intact side. Data were analyzed using the Dunnett test for group comparisons and paired t -tests for pre and postsurgery comparisons.

Results

Of the 522 eligible patients, 80 (159 nerve roots, 1 patient with hemi-prosthetic leg) were analyzed. The preoperative FTT scores in the L4 and L5 groups were significantly lower than those in the control group, indicating functional impairment. One year postsurgery, all groups showed improvements in FTT scores, with the L5 group exhibiting significant improvements compared with the control; this was supported by the results of sensitivity analyses considering the effects of paralysis and pain.

Conclusion

The FTT is a valuable tool for the early detection of lower limb motor dysfunction in lumbosacral radiculopathy, particularly for L5 nerve root impairment, where it aids in timely surgical intervention and may improve postoperative outcomes and quality of life.

### An analysis of reasons for failed back surgery syndrome and partial results after different types of surgical lumbar nerve root decompression [^117EqqgT]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the evident progress in treating vertebral column degenerative diseases, the rate of a so-called "failed back surgery syndrome" associated with pain and disability remains relatively high. However, this term has an imprecise definition and includes several different morbid conditions following spinal surgery, not all of which directly illustrate the efficacy of the applied technology; furthermore, some of them could even be irrelevant.

Objective

To evaluate and systematize the reasons for persistent pain syndromes following surgical nerve root decompression.

Study Design

Prospective, nonrandomized, cohort study of 138 consecutive patients with radicular pain syndromes, associated with nerve root compression caused by lumbar disc herniation, and resistant to conservative therapy for at least one month. The minimal period of follow-up was 18 months.

Setting

Hospital outpatient department, Russian Federation

Methods

Pre-operatively, patients were examined clinically, applying the visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), discography and computed tomography (CT). According to the disc herniation morphology and applied type of surgery, all participants were divided into the following groups: for those with disc extrusion or sequester, microdiscectomy was applied (n = 65); for those with disc protrusion, nucleoplasty was applied (n = 46); for those with disc extrusion, nucleoplasty was applied (n = 27). After surgery, participants were examined clinically and the VAS and ODI were applied. All those with permanent or temporary pain syndromes were examined applying MRI imaging, functional roentgenograms, and, to validate the cause of pain syndromes, different types of blocks were applied (facet joint blocks, paravertebral muscular blocks, transforaminal and caudal epidural blocks).

Results

Group 1 showed a considerable rate of pain syndromes related to tissue damage during the intervention; the rates of radicular pain caused by epidural scar and myofascial pain were 12.3% and 26.1% respectively. Facet joint pain was found in 23.1% of the cases. Group 2 showed a significant rate of facet joint pain (16.9%) despite the minimally invasive intervention. The specificity of Group 3 was the very high rate of unresolved or recurred nerve root compression (63.0%); in other words, in the majority of cases, the aim of the intervention was not achieved. The results of the applied intervention were considered clinically significant if 50% pain relief on the VAS and a 40% decrease in the ODI were achieved.

Limitations

This study is limited because of the loss of participants to follow-up and because it is nonrandomized; also it could be criticized because the dynamics of numeric scores were not provided.

Conclusion

The results of our study show that an analysis of the reasons for failures and partial effects of applied interventions for nerve root decompression may help to understand better the efficacy of the interventions and could be helpful in improving surgical strategies, otherwise the validity of the conclusion could be limited because not all sources of residual pain illustrate the applied technology efficacy. In the majority of cases, the cause of the residual or recurrent pain can be identified, and this may open new possibilities to improve the condition of patients presenting with failed back surgery syndrome.

### Extraforaminal entrapment of the fifth lumbar spinal nerve by nearthrosis in patients with lumbosacral transitional vertebrae [^115kpRuP]. European Spine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) often have nearthrosis between the L5 transverse processes and the sacral ala; this causes the formation of new bone and synovial-like tissue, which can entrap L5 nerve root. The present study aimed to examine the role of nearthrosis in L5 nerve root compression in patients with LSTV.

Methods

From 2008 to 2018, 65 patients were surgically treated for severe leg pain/numbness caused by L5 extraforaminal stenosis. The patients were assessed regarding the presence of LSTV, radiographic features of nearthrosis, operative/radiological findings, and clinical outcomes. CT/MRI were used to classify the patients into three groups: group A had L5 nerve root compression that was not related to nearthrosis, group B had L5 nerve root impingement due to nearthrosis with new bone formation, and group C had L5 nerve root impingement due to nearthrosis with synovial-like tissue. The relationships between the type of LSTV (based on the Castellvi's classification) and these three groups were investigated.

Results

Although 26 of 65 patients had LSTV (40%), four were excluded because of less than 1-year follow-up. The 22 patients with LSTV were classified as type IA (n = 2), IIA (n = 13), and IIB (n = 7). In accordance with the radiological findings, there were eight patients in group A, six in group B, and eight in group C; the LSTV morphology did not significantly differ between groups.

Conclusions

L5 nerve root was compressed by nearthrosis in 64% of symptomatic patients with LSTV; this region should be carefully assessed in all symptomatic patients with LSTV.

Prognostic Blockade for Radiofrequency Neurotomy

The construct of dual comparative anesthetic blocks with two separate local anesthetics as a prelude to radiofrequency neurotomy has been established for cervical and lumbar facet denervation, although the extension of this paradigm to sacroiliac denervation has important limitations. First, sacroiliac innervation is inconsistent, second, the sacroiliac lateral branches are not always in the same tissue planes, and third, our understanding of the sources of innervation of the sacroiliac complex has been evolving. With respect to innervation, it was believed that the joint received innervation from the L4 medial branch, L5 dorsal ramus and the lateral S1, S2, and S3 lateral branches, leading Cohen et al in 2008to include these nerves in their randomized prospective controlled trial. Subsequently, the L4 medial branch was believed not to contribute to the sacroiliac complex, leading Patel et al in 2012 to exclude the L4 medial branch from their RCT. In both studies, the prognostic block technique differed. In the Cohen trial, the patients were randomized to sham procedure or radiofrequency neurotomy if they reported > 75% relief with one intra-articular corticosteroid and anesthetic injection 6 hours post-injection. In the Patel et al RCT, patients were eligible for study enrollment if they received > 75% relief of their index pain with two sets of single-site, single-depth, anesthetic blocks of the L5 dorsal ramus and S1-S3 sacral lateral branches.

Indications and Contraindications

Axial non-radicular pain is the most common clinical presentation in the contemporary pain clinic. Amongst this group of patients, mixed and nociceptive pain syndromes predominate with pain arising from the anterior and posterior elements, including facet joints, annular tears in the discs, and sacroiliac joints. Lower back and buttock pain without distal radicular and neuropathic features must be carefully evaluated to precisely define the primary source of pain. The presence of pain should be corroborated with at least three positive clinical signs, subsequent to which prognostic dual comparative multi-site multi-depth anesthetic blocks with > 75% relief with each block of the lateral S1, S2, S3 branches are the best indication for the sacral radiofrequency denervation procedure.

The procedure is contraindicated in anyone with localized infection, refusal and/or inability to provide informed consent, and pregnancy when fluoroscopy is indicated. Relative contraindications are poorly visualized anatomy and cases in which limited visualization of the sacral foraminal precludes adequate placement of the radiofrequency cannulas.

### Diffusion tensor imaging of lumbar spinal nerves reveals changes in microstructural integrity following decompression surgery associated with improvements in clinical symptoms: a case report [^112y1K6L]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The outcomes from spinal nerve decompression surgery are highly variable with a sizable proportion of elderly foraminal stenosis patients not regaining good pain relief. A better understanding of nerve root compression before and following decompression surgery and whether these changes are mirrored by improvements in symptoms may help to improve clinical decision-making processes. This case study used a combination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), clinical questionnaires and motor neurophysiology assessments before and up to 3 months following spinal decompression surgery. In this case report, a 70-year-old women with compression of the left L5 spinal nerve root in the L5-S1 exit foramina was recruited to the study. At 3 months following surgery, DTI revealed marked improvements in left L5 microstructural integrity to a similar level to that seen in the intact right L5 nerve root. This was accompanied by a gradual improvement in pain-related symptoms, mood and disability score by 3 months. Using this novel multimodal approach, it may be possible to track concurrent improvements in pain-related symptoms, function and microstructural integrity of compressed nerves in elderly foraminal stenosis patients undergoing decompression surgery.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^115EuZHV]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Management of sciatica varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints remain present for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients for sciatica in presence of a herniated lumbar disc, or severe sciatica with serious or progressive neurologic deficits and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. The primary rationale of surgery for sciatica is that surgery will relieve nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated disc material. The most common type of surgery is open microdiscectomy, surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with or without the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Other minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as endoscopic surgery have recently been developed. In the absence of serious neurologic deficits or for persistent non-radicular low back pain, consensus whether surgery is useful or not has not yet been established. Furthermore, the timing of the intervention with respect to prolonged conservative care has not been evaluated properly.

At present, several randomised trials have been published that have compared surgery with conservative treatment. The objective of this systematic review is to compare and summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgery compared with conservative treatment for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^114Fn133]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surgical considerations for low back disorders emphasize initial conservative care: "Within the first 3 months after onset of acute low back symptoms, surgery is considered only for serious spinal pathology or nerve root compression not responsive to an adequate trial of conservative therapy". Among patients with nerve root compression due to disc herniation and/or spinal stenosis, "recover activity tolerance within 1 month", and "There is no quality evidence that delaying surgery for this period worsens outcomes in the absence of progressive nerve root compromise". Prognosis is generally favorable because "With or without surgery, more than 70% of patients with apparent surgical indications eventually recover their premorbid activity level", whereas "surgery results in pain improvements in fewer than 40% of patients with questionable physiologic findings".

### Best practices for minimally invasive lumbar spinal stenosis treatment 2.0 (MIST): consensus guidance from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^111P4kHs]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Indications

Interspinous spacers are approved by the FDA to treat skeletally mature patients suffering from pain, numbness, and/or cramping in the legs (intermittent NC) secondary to a diagnosis of moderate degenerative LSS, with or without grade 1 spondylolisthesis. Spinal stenosis is confirmed by x-ray, MRI and/or CT evidence of thickened LF, narrowed lateral recess, and/or central canal or foraminal narrowing. Interspinous spacers are indicated for patients with impaired physical function who experience relief of their symptoms in flexion. These patients must have undergone at least 6 months of nonoperative treatment. Spacers are approved for one or two adjacent lumbar levels from L1 to L5.

Clear indications exist for the therapy and are supported by the literature. Identifying correct patients for the therapy is paramount to its success and to ensuring positive patient outcomes. Moderate degenerative LSS is defined in the literature as follows:

- 25% to 50% reduction in central canal and/or nerve root canal (subarticular, neuroforaminal) compared to the adjacent levels on radiographic studies, with radiographic confirmation of any one of the following:

- Evidence of thecal sac and/or cauda equina compression
- Evidence of nerve root impingement (displacement or compression) by either osseous or non-osseous elements
- Evidence of hypertrophic facets with canal encroachment

AND associated with the following clinical signs:

- Moderately impaired physical function (PF) defined as a score of ≥ 2.0 on the ZCQ
- Ability to sit for 50 minutes without pain and to walk 50 feet or more.

### Comparative outcomes of microsurgical dorsal root entry zone lesioning (DREZotomy) for intractable neuropathic pain in spinal cord and cauda equina injuries [^1174XRoB]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast, border zone pain may result from spinal nerve root damage, CEI, or intrinsic spinal cord injury. Spinal nerve root injury can occur from the initial trauma or develop later due to vertebral instability or impingement by facet joints or intervertebral discs. Several mechanisms can explain the etiology of border zone pain. First, the loss of inputs to the spinal cord results in altered central connectivity and neuronal activity. Second, damaged nerve roots of the cauda equina may spontaneously generate pain signals. Third, mechanical irritation of the cauda equina and restricted movement of the spinal nerve roots caused by arachnoid adhesions contribute to pain. Fourth, peripheral stimuli may evoke abnormal signals at the site of the axonal injury.

Our findings align with these pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the occurrence of neuropathic pain after SCI and CEI.

Regarding operative outcomes, no significant differences were observed in the comparative analysis of one-year surgical outcomes between the SCI and CEI groups. However, during long-term postoperative follow-up, 2 of the 6 patients in the SCI group developed recurrent neuropathic pain. We found that the median percentage of pain improvement and the number of patients with favorable outcomes were significantly greater in the CEI group during the long-term follow-up (p = 0.020 and p = 0.015, respectively). These results indicate that neuropathic pain caused by CEI responds better to DREZL than does pain caused by SCI. This difference may be attributed to the fact that all individuals in the CEI group had border zone pain, which responds well to the operation. Previous studies have also shown that CEI patients with neuropathic pain have better surgical outcomes with DREZL than do SCI patients with neuropathic pain. However, one study reported effective pain relief with DREZL in SCI patients but not in CEI patients.

60-Day PNS in the Treatment of Specific Pathologic States

60-day PNS treatment is appropriate after failure of prior treatments for the indications below, given that the expected benefits are more likely than not to be more beneficial than any other available standard treatments.

Inoperable Shoulder Pain (or Patient Resistant to Surgery)

Standard operative shoulder conditions include rotator cuff tears and glenohumeral arthritis. The recommended non-operative treatments for these conditions from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Evidence-Based Practice Guidelines include physical therapy and corticosteroid injections with local anesthetic based on moderate and strong evidence in rotator cuff tears and consensus only in glenohumeral arthritis. Physical therapy has been shown to improve pain and range of motion, but long-term studies are limited. Additionally, multiple meta-analyses show no significant, sustained pain improvement nor change in disease progression with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). As expected, the next recommended treatment from the AAOS is surgery. However, some patients may not be appropriate surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities, or they may wish to postpone surgery. Early evidence has shown that PNS is effective for treating shoulder pain. It can provide bridge therapy until patients get definitive surgery and/or in those cases where surgery would be contraindicated.

The evidence for PNS and rotator cuff tear pain is limited. In 2022, Chitneni et al reported two cases of suprascapular and axillary nerve 60-day PNS for treating rotator cuff tear pain. Both patients had been experiencing pain for more than one year. At three months post-PNS treatment, the patients were reporting 90% and 80% pain relief with a reduction in opioid usage, respectively. Similarly, Wilson et al described using PNS for patients with refractory pain from subacromial impingement of the rotator cuff. Adults with chronic shoulder pain for over six months and a diagnosis of subacromial impingement were recruited for the study. Ten patients were treated with three weeks of axillary nerve PNS and were followed for 12 weeks after PNS discontinuation. The ten subjects had an average overall reduction in pain of 36.6% at three weeks and 48.8% at 16 weeks compared to baseline. The subjects also showed improvements in disability and shoulder abduction range of motion. While this is not specifically 60-day PNS, the authors used the same 60-day PNS device, and the results suggest that PNS is a viable treatment for rotator cuff pathologies.

### Full endoscopic decompression surgery for far-out syndrome via pseudoarthrosis formed by L5 transverse process and sacral ala: a preliminary outcome [^114noAdd]. Pain Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Far-out syndrome (FOS) refers to the compression of the L5 nerve root in the extraforaminal region by a pseudoarthrosis formed between the L5 transverse process and the sacral ala. If conservative treatment for this condition fails, surgical intervention should be considered.

Objectives

This study aims to introduce a minimally invasive endoscopic technique for treating FOS via the pseudoarthrosis approach.

Study Design

A technical note and preliminary outcome.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the medical history, physical examination, auxiliary examinations, and imaging data as well as the visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Macnab scores of 5 FOS patients treated with minimally invasive endoscopic surgery at our hospital from April 2024 to July 2024. The implementation process of this surgical technique is illustrated through typical cases.

Results

We performed decompression surgery via the L5 transverse process-sacral ala pseudoarthrosis approach using full endoscopy, which successfully relieved the clinical symptoms in the 5 patients. The patients' postoperative VAS scores were significantly lower than the preoperative scores (P = 0.041). Similarly, the postoperative ODI scores were markedly decreased (P = 0.043), and the last follow-up showed a 100% excellent rate (Macnab score). Imaging examination indicated a sufficiently expanded extraforaminal outlet, and the nerve roots were adequately decompressed.

Limitations

The study involved a relatively small number of samples and a short follow-up period.

Conclusions

The full endoscopic decompression surgery via the L5 transverse process-sacral ala pseudoarthrosis approach can address the extraforaminal compression in FOS. This procedure is a feasible endoscopic surgical option that serves as a valuable supplement to the minimally invasive treatment for FOS.

Minimally Invasive Lateral Sacroiliac Fusion Evidence

The lateral approach to minimally invasive SIJ fusion involves dissection through the lateral gluteus muscles down to the ilium, where a device is used to transfix the ilium to the sacrum. The majority of evidence for minimally invasive lateral sacroiliac fusion and the highest level of evidence – two level-I prospective studies – comes from studies of a triangular titanium implant (SI Bone iFuse system; Santa Clara, CA) (Table 21, with recommendations in Table 22). There are currently 11 published level-IV retrospective studies, two level-II prospective cohort studies, and two level-I prospective studies of this technology. The RCT of minimally invasive lateral sacroiliac fusion versus nonoperative care by Polly et al determined that 82% of surgical patients and 26% of nonoperative patients achieved success which was defined by a composite score, and surgical patients received higher clinical benefit as measured by the VAS SIJ pain scores, ODI, SF-36, and EQ-5D. A total of 148 patients were randomly assigned to surgical versus nonsurgical care, and crossover from non-surgical to surgical care was allowed after 6 months.

Table 21
Evidence Summary for Minimally Invasive Sacroiliac Fusion

Table 22
ASPN Back Consensus Group Recommendations for Minimally Invasive Sacroiliac Joint Fixation

Complication rates for minimally invasive lateral sacroiliac fusion have been relatively low, and the most concerning complication is nerve impingement, which may require removal or repositioning of the device. In an analysis of implants from a manufacturer's database, Miller et al reported a nerve impingement rate of 0.9% and a 1.4% rate of improper device placement. The lateral approach may injure the L5, S1, or S2 nerves if the implant is malpositioned, and some have argued that navigation may be useful to reduce the risk of nerve injury. There is also some evidence that intraoperative neuromonitoring with EMG may also reduce the risk of nerve injury during minimally invasive SIJF.

Using controlled diagnostic blocks, "intervertebral discs, facet joints, sacroiliac joints, and nerve roots have been proven to be common sources of pain", whereas "vertebrae, muscles, and ligaments have not been identified by proven diagnostic techniques".
