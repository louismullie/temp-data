## Question

What loading dose of Keppra should be used for status?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what levetiracetam (Keppra) loading dose to use for status epilepticus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative adult recommendation and whether it specifies the loading dose and infusion time. Then, I should verify external corroboration and safety data across sources. Next, I'll need to consider pediatric evidence and pharmacokinetic differences. After that, I should review administration details and formulation interchangeability. Finally, I must account for renal function, elderly patients, and other special circumstances, and synthesize a concise recommendation while double-checking for common pitfalls in interpreting "maximum dose" language.

> Let me first confirm the adult status epilepticus loading recommendation from the most direct source; the FDA SPL entry specifies a levetiracetam IV loading dose of 60 mg/kg administered over 10 minutes with a maximum of 4,500 mg per day, which gives me a clear anchor for adult dosing in status epilepticus, but I should verify that I'm not missing caveats on timing or total ceiling in the acute setting [^116x3BCf].

> Wait, let me verify this across other sources so I don't over-rely on a single listing; the benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus literature commonly cites a loading range of 20–60 mg/kg up to a 4,500 mg ceiling, and rapid-infusion safety data show that 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg regimens are generally well tolerated without hemodynamic instability, which supports the higher end of the range in urgent care scenarios, although I should remember the relative credibility of each study when weighting conclusions [^1142mXiK] [^113Hw9Rr].

> Next, I should review pediatric evidence; the EcLiPSE trial used 40 mg/kg IV for pediatric convulsive status epilepticus with favorable tolerability, and a mixed-age rapid-infusion study including children supports safety up to 60 mg/kg, but hold on, let me not jump to conclusions — children often clear levetiracetam faster than adults, so weight-based dosing is appropriate and higher mg/kg exposure is pharmacokinetically reasonable, even if the most rigorously studied pediatric loading in RCTs is 40 mg/kg rather than 60 mg/kg [^117Gy9R6] [^113Hw9Rr] [^112hmvu8] [^114z1ZDN].

> I will now examine administration details; I should confirm that the load is delivered as an IV bolus over about 10 minutes and that rapid infusion with minimal dilution is acceptable in emergencies, while also recalling that IV and oral formulations are bioequivalent for exposure in non-emergent settings — still, in status epilepticus, I need to ensure IV is used for speed of onset, not PO, even though exposure equivalence exists when infused over 15 minutes in steady-state assessments [^116x3BCf] [^113Hw9Rr] [^113KfR5h] [^113Zg911].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations; levetiracetam is renally cleared, so while the acute loading dose in status epilepticus is typically given in full, subsequent maintenance dosing must be adjusted to creatinine clearance, particularly in elderly patients who often have reduced renal function, whereas hepatic impairment generally does not require adjustment and pregnancy may lower levels over time — implications mainly for maintenance and monitoring after the loading dose rather than for withholding the load itself [^114Ht3g4] [^113vcgba] [^1153VhZs] [^114xp2PH] [^112JXMky].

> Let me consider safety and practical trade-offs; levetiracetam avoids the cardiovascular instability associated with some alternatives and is easier to prepare and administer rapidly, though I should remember to monitor for behavioral activation, somnolence, and suicidality as therapy continues; in the acute setting the hemodynamic profile is generally favorable, supporting its role as a second-line agent in convulsive status epilepticus after benzodiazepines [^115NA1Ef] [^114RVLEK] [^117N2m2X] [^114UYftu].

> Hmm, wait a minute — there's a common point of confusion I should address explicitly; I initially thought "maximum daily dose" might default to the chronic ceiling of 3,000 mg/day used in maintenance epilepsy treatment, but that would be a mistake in the acute status epilepticus context; I should double-check and correct this: the chronic maintenance maximum of 3,000 mg/day does not apply to the acute loading recommendation, where the status epilepticus guidance permits a higher total of up to 4,500 mg in adults for the loading strategy, so I need to clearly distinguish these two maxima when advising clinicians [^117DiehD] [^116x3BCf].

> But wait, what if a service uses an alternative regimen; I need to check variability across compendia — some listings describe continuous infusion approaches such as 2–5 mg/kg/min to a total 1,000–3,000 mg, yet given modern emergency practice patterns and label-aligned guidance, a single bolus of 60 mg/kg up to 4,500 mg over about 10 minutes is the most direct and commonly supported approach for adults, with pediatric regimens most often using 40 mg/kg and allowing escalation toward 60 mg/kg in refractory cases while carefully monitoring response and safety [^116CWkB5] [^116x3BCf] [^117Gy9R6] [^113Hw9Rr].

> Synthesis and final recommendation — let me ensure clarity: for adults with status epilepticus, load levetiracetam 60 mg/kg IV over 10 minutes, not to exceed a total of 4,500 mg, then transition to renally adjusted maintenance dosing; for children with convulsive status epilepticus, 40 mg/kg IV is well supported and 40–60 mg/kg is reasonable in refractory scenarios, recognizing faster pediatric clearance and the safety of higher loading when clinically indicated, with renal function guiding maintenance thereafter [^116x3BCf] [^117Gy9R6] [^113Hw9Rr] [^114Ht3g4] [^114z1ZDN].

---

The recommended Keppra (levetiracetam) loading dose for status epilepticus is **60 mg/kg IV over 10 minutes** [^116x3BCf], with a **maximum loading dose of 4,500 mg** [^116x3BCf]. This dose is supported by FDA labeling and is widely used in clinical practice. Levetiracetam is favored for its rapid administration [^113Hw9Rr], minimal drug interactions [^111v7j5z], and a favorable safety profile; common adverse effects include somnolence, fatigue [^117N2m2X], and behavioral changes [^114nXYAA]. Dose adjustments are required in renal impairment [^114Ht3g4], and **supplemental dosing is needed after dialysis** [^113vcgba].

---

## Recommended loading dose

For status epilepticus, the recommended loading regimen includes a **standard loading dose** [^116x3BCf] of 60 mg/kg IV over 10 minutes and a **maximum loading dose** of 4,500 mg [^116x3BCf].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting loading dose

The recommended loading dose is supported by clinical evidence demonstrating rapid achievement of therapeutic levels [^114pJn8p] and **effective seizure control** [^117Gy9R6]. Levetiracetam's pharmacokinetics allow for rapid absorption and distribution, making it suitable for acute seizure management [^113KfR5h].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

Levetiracetam exhibits linear pharmacokinetics [^113JKEck], rapid absorption [^113KfR5h], and minimal protein binding, allowing for predictable dosing and rapid onset of action. Its mechanism of action involves **binding to synaptic vesicle protein SV2A** [^114k5kVa], modulating neurotransmitter release and reducing neuronal excitability.

---

## Safety and tolerability

Levetiracetam is **generally well-tolerated**, with minimal adverse effects. Common adverse reactions include somnolence, fatigue [^117N2m2X], behavioral changes, and hematologic abnormalities [^114nXYAA]. Rapid infusion of levetiracetam has been shown to be safe, with minimal cardiovascular or respiratory adverse effects [^113Hw9Rr].

---

## Comparison with other antiepileptic drugs

Levetiracetam is increasingly used as an alternative to traditional antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and valproate due to its favorable safety profile, **minimal drug interactions** [^111v7j5z], and ease of administration [^115NA1Ef]. Unlike phenytoin, levetiracetam does not require cardiac monitoring during infusion and has fewer drug interactions.

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustments are required based on creatinine clearance [^114Ht3g4].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No dose adjustment is generally required, but caution is advised in severe hepatic impairment [^114Ht3g4] [^114xp2PH].
- **Pregnancy**: Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy, requiring monitoring and dose adjustments [^112JXMky] [^112RVAi6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend levetiracetam as a **second-line agent** for status epilepticus, particularly in benzodiazepine-refractory cases. Its rapid administration, minimal drug interactions, and favorable safety profile make it a preferred choice in many clinical settings [^115NA1Ef].

### Keppra [^111v7j5z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Keppra (1500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption, its plasma clearance, or urinary excretion. There was also no effect on exposure to and excretion of the primary metabolite, UCB L057.

- **Other antiepileptic drugs**: Potential drug interactions between Keppra and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and valproate) were assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

- **Effect of AEDs in pediatric patients**: There was about a 22% increase in apparent total body clearance of levetiracetam when co-administered with enzyme-inducing AEDs, though dose adjustment is not recommended. Levetiracetam had no effect on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine.

- **Oral contraceptives**: Keppra (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, nor the levels of luteinizing hormone and progesterone, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

### Keppra [^114Ht3g4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50–80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30–50 mL/min), and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr < 30 mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

- **Hepatic impairment**: In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment.

- **Drug interactions**: In vitro data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above Cmax levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of, nor high-affinity substrates for, human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase, or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes.

### The case for levetiracetam to be included in essential medicine lists [^115NA1Ef]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Levetiracetam is one ASM that fulfills the "easy to use" criterion. It is rapidly absorbed, unaffected by food, and peak concentrations are quickly achieved. It has linear kinetics, with minimal protein binding, negligible hepatic metabolism, and is renally excreted. Therefore, it neither has the propensity for clinically relevant drug interactions nor is its plasma concentration influenced by protein levels. Schedules for commencing treatment are straightforward in comparison to lamotrigine. One issue is that tablets are large and taste bitter in crushed form.

Levetiracetam is available in tablet, oral solution, and injectable forms and is therefore suitable for various circumstances. Recent evidence from the SANAD II trials suggests that it is neither clinically nor cost-effective compared to valproate in generalized epilepsies and lamotrigine in focal epilepsies. Nevertheless, it is widely prescribed for various seizure types and epilepsies, except for absence seizures. There is persuasive evidence for its use as a second-line drug for convulsive status epilepticus. Its efficacy in terms of seizure termination is similar to phenytoin but with a quicker onset, probably related to the speed of its intravenous administration compared to phenytoin.

When used in monotherapy, levetiracetam is less teratogenic than other ASMs, making its use appealing in women in the reproductive age group. Therapeutic drug monitoring, although available, is not routinely required, apart from some situations, e.g. pregnancy, adherence check, intercritical illnesses, and extremes of age.

### Keppra [^113vcgba]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Studies involving levetiracetam in juvenile animals, specifically rats and dogs, showed no adverse effects on postnatal development. Juvenile rats were dosed between postnatal days 4 and 52, and juvenile dogs from weeks 3 to 7, with dosages up to 1800 mg/kg/day — approximately 7 and 24 times the maximum recommended pediatric dose of 60 mg/kg/day based on mg/m².

- **Geriatric use**: In clinical studies, 347 subjects aged 65 and over were treated with KEPPRA. No overall safety differences were observed compared to younger subjects. However, there were insufficient numbers of elderly subjects in controlled epilepsy trials to adequately assess the effectiveness of Keppra in these patients.

	- Levetiracetam is predominantly excreted by the kidneys, leading to an increased risk of adverse reactions in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, careful dose selection is essential. Monitoring renal function might be beneficial [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Renal impairment**: The clearance of levetiracetam decreases in patients with renal impairment and correlates with creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dose adjustment is recommended for these patients, and supplemental doses should be administered after dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Keppra XR [^113JKEck]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The bioavailability of KEPPRA XR tablets is similar to that of the immediate-release KEPPRA tablets. The pharmacokinetics (AUC and Cmax) were shown to be dose proportional following a single dose administration of 1000 mg, 2000 mg, and 3000 mg of extended-release levetiracetam. The plasma half-life of extended-release levetiracetam is approximately 7 hours.

Levetiracetam is almost completely absorbed after oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (< 10% bound), and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam, accounting for 24% of the dose, is enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. It is not dependent on liver cytochrome P450. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. The plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6–8 hours. Notably, the half-life is increased in the elderly, primarily due to impaired renal clearance, and in subjects with renal impairment.

The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.

### Levetiracetam [^113KfR5h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15-minute infusion.

Levetiracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. Levetiracetam injection and tablets are bioequivalent. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (< 10% bound), and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, and it is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. The plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6 to 8 hours. It is increased in the elderly, primarily due to impaired renal clearance, and in subjects with renal impairment.

### A clinical trial of enteral levetiracetam for acute seizures in pediatric cerebral malaria [^114pJn8p]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Therapeutic LVT concentrations were rapidly achieved with LVT levels > 20 μg/mL in 26 out of 29 patients (90%) within 4 hours of the loading dose. No child failed to achieve > 6 μg/mL after the loading dose. The LVT concentrations are shown in Figure 1. Steady-state troughs were below 6 mg/mL in 6 out of 29 patients (21%) and above 20 μg/mL in 6 out of 29 (21%). Most of the AUC values ranged between 50% and 200% of the expected population average, as depicted in Figure 2. Of the 67 samples collected within 4 hours of drug administration, 63 exceeded 30% of the predicted level, suggesting relatively normal absorption most of the time. Only 4 doses (8%) showed altered absorption. For subjects with low initial concentrations, subsequent samples revealed adequate concentrations, indicating that delayed rather than incomplete absorption was the problem.

- **Measured concentrations**: Measured relative to predicted levetiracetam concentrations among children with cerebral malaria receiving enteral LVT stratified by admission serum creatinine. (LVT = levetiracetam, SCr = serum creatinine)

- **Frequency of observed concentrations**: The frequency of observed levetiracetam concentrations 4 hours after the first dose and predicted steady-state troughs and average concentrations showed that all post-first dose and average steady-state levels were above 6 μg/mL. (LVT = levetiracetam)

The population pharmacokinetic analysis utilized 131 LVT concentrations from 30 subjects and was well described by a one-compartment model. Despite the modest number of subjects and samples, CL/F and V/F were estimated with good precision, with no bias evident based on the bootstrap analysis. The estimates for other parameters were consistent with expectations.

### Levetiracetam versus phenytoin for second-line treatment of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus (EcLiPSE): a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial [^117Gy9R6]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Other treatment-related factors might be relevant to the interpretation of our findings. These include the widespread use of levetiracetam as maintenance therapy for many childhood epilepsies because of its broad-spectrum activity and safety profile. In the EcLiPSE trial participants, levetiracetam was the most commonly used oral antiepilepsy drug at the time of presentation.

Anecdotally, clinicians are reluctant to give a loading dose of phenytoin to children in convulsive status epilepticus who are on oral maintenance phenytoin because of potential cardiovascular toxicity. There seemed to be no similar concerns for levetiracetam, and no increase in adverse events was observed when giving 40 mg/kg to children already receiving maintenance levetiracetam.

A substantial minority of children who present in convulsive status epilepticus for the first time are subsequently commenced on maintenance therapy. Levetiracetam is more likely than phenytoin to be used as maintenance therapy because of phenytoin's adverse event profile and complex pharmacokinetics. One observational study in adults showed that 8% of patients treated with intravenous fosphenytoin for convulsive status epilepticus were subsequently commenced on oral phenytoin, whereas 78% of those treated with intravenous levetiracetam were subsequently commenced on oral levetiracetam.

Ease of drug preparation and administration is also a factor in the management of convulsive status epilepticus. Throughout the EcLiPSE trial, levetiracetam was reported by clinical teams in the participating centres to be easier to prepare.

### Keppra [^114k5kVa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: The precise mechanism by which levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. A saturable and stereoselective neuronal binding site in rat brain tissue has been described for levetiracetam. Experimental data indicate that this binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, which is thought to be involved in the regulation of vesicle exocytosis. Although the molecular significance of levetiracetam binding to SV2A is not understood, levetiracetam and related analogs showed a rank order of affinity for SV2A, which correlated with the potency of their antiseizure activity in audiogenic seizure-prone mice. These findings suggest that the interaction of levetiracetam with the SV2A protein may contribute to the antiepileptic mechanism of action of the drug.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:
	- **Effects on QTc interval**: The effect of Keppra on QTc prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and placebo-controlled crossover study of Keppra (1000 mg or 5000 mg) in 52 healthy subjects. The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc was below 10 milliseconds. Therefore, there was no evidence of significant QTc prolongation in this study.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.
	- **Metabolism**: Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, whic

### Levetiracetam [^112RVAi6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Following a single-dose administration (20 mg/kg) of a 10% oral solution to pediatric patients with epilepsy (1 month to < 4 years), levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations were observed approximately 1 hour after dosing. Levetiracetam half-life in pediatric patients 1 month to < 4 years with epilepsy was shorter (5.3 h) than in adults (7.2 h), and apparent clearance (1.5 mL/min/kg) was faster than in adults (0.96 mL/min/kg).

Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that body weight was significantly correlated to the clearance of levetiracetam in pediatric patients; clearance increased with an increase in body weight.

- **Pregnancy**: Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Gender**: Levetiracetam Cmax and AUC were 20% higher in women (N = 11) compared to men (N = 12). However, clearances adjusted for body weight were comparable.

- **Race**: Formal pharmacokinetic studies of the effects of race have not been conducted. Cross-study comparisons involving Caucasians (N = 12) and Asians (N = 12), however, show that pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. Because levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected.

### Keppra [^112JXMky]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Keppra, during pregnancy. Women taking Keppra during pregnancy are encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry by calling 1–888–233–2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

- **Risk summary**: Prolonged experience with Keppra in pregnant women has not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage, based on published literature, which includes data from pregnancy registries and reflects experience over two decades [see Human Data]. In animal studies, levetiracetam produced developmental toxicity (increased embryofetal and offspring mortality, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, decreased embryofetal and offspring growth, and neurobehavioral alterations in offspring) at doses similar to human therapeutic doses [see Animal Data].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

- **Clinical considerations**: Levetiracetam blood levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. A decrease in levetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy, and this decrease is more pronounced during later stages.

### Rapid infusion of a loading dose of intravenous levetiracetam with minimal dilution: A safety study [^113Hw9Rr]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Intravenous antiepileptic drugs are required in patients needing urgent treatment or unable to take oral medication. The safety of intravenous levetiracetam has been established in prospective studies of adult epilepsy and healthy participants. The authors performed a prospective, single-center study to evaluate the safety of a rapid loading dose of intravenous levetiracetam. Patients were divided into three equal dosing groups (N = 15 each): 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg, corresponding to maximum doses of 1, 2, and 3 g. Electrocardiogram and safety assessment were performed during the infusion, with participants aged 4 to 32 years.

Postinfusion serum levetiracetam concentrations ranged from 14 to 189 microg/mL. There were no significant changes in blood pressure, no local infusion site reactions, and no electrocardiogram abnormalities. The authors concluded that high serum levels of parenteral levetiracetam can be achieved rapidly and safely, in a small infusion volume. This finding has important implications for the treatment of status epilepticus.

### Keppra [^117N2m2X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Keppra may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on Keppra to determine whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

- **Somnolence**: In controlled trials of adult patients with epilepsy experiencing partial-onset seizures, 15% of Keppra-treated patients reported somnolence compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. There was no clear dose response up to 3000 mg/day. In a study without titration, about 45% of patients receiving 4000 mg/day reported somnolence. Serious somnolence occurred in 0.3% of Keppra-treated patients compared to 0% in the placebo group. Approximately 3% of Keppra-treated patients discontinued treatment due to somnolence versus 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. In 1.4% of Keppra-treated patients and 0.9% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced. Additionally, 0.3% of the Keppra-treated patients were hospitalized due to somnolence.

- **Asthenia**: In controlled clinical studies of adult patients with epilepsy experiencing partial-onset seizures, 15% of Keppra-treated patients reported asthenia compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. Treatment was discontinued due to asthenia in 0.8% of Keppra-treated patients as compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.5% of Keppra-treated patients and 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to asthenia.

Somnolence and asthenia occurred most frequently within the first four weeks.

### KeppraXR [^1115J58M]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be instructed to only take Keppra XR once daily and to swallow the tablets whole. They should not be chewed, broken, or crushed. Inform patients that they should not be concerned if they occasionally notice something that looks like swollen pieces of the original tablet in their stool.

- **Withdrawal of Keppra XR**: Advise patients and caregivers not to discontinue use of Keppra XR without consulting their healthcare provider. Keppra XR should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see warnings and precautions (5.8)].

- **Pregnancy**: Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during Keppra therapy. Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry if they become pregnant [see use in specific populations (8.1)].

### Levetiracetam dosing optimization in neurocritical care population: Neuro-ARC study [^1169Kku8]. Neurocritical Care (2025). High credibility.

Levetiracetam, a first-line antiseizure medication, is primarily eliminated through the kidneys, with approximately 66% renal elimination. Consequently, its pharmacokinetics are significantly influenced by kidney function. Augmented renal clearance (ARC), a condition characterized by renal hyperfiltration, is frequently observed in critical care settings and can profoundly impact the disposition of renally eliminated drugs such as levetiracetam. Our objectives were to characterize levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in neurocritical care patients, identify covariates significantly influencing drug clearance, and provide clinicians with optimal dosage recommendations in those with and without ARC.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study involving patients admitted to the participating centers with life-threatening neurological illnesses. Each participant had up to four plasma samples collected, and the samples were analyzed using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. The creatinine clearance (CL CR) of enrolled participants was measured using the 8-hour urine collection method (measured CL CR [mCL CR]). Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed using Monolix software. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to explore various dosage strategies and to suggest optimal levetiracetam regimens.

- **Results**: Our study included 50 patients, with 35 patients (70%) experiencing ARC. Trough levetiracetam levels were significantly lower in the ARC group compared with the no-ARC group (median [interquartile range] 4.4 [11.5] vs.).

### Keppra [^114Bv662]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Keppra for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 4) conducted at 60 sites in North America. It involved pediatric patients aged 4 to 16 years with partial seizures uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients were on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, who still experienced at least 4 partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening, as well as at least 4 partial-onset seizures in each of the two 4-week baseline periods. These patients were randomized to receive either Keppra or a placebo.

The enrolled population included 198 patients (Keppra N = 101, placebo N = 97) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. The study consisted of an 8-week baseline period and a 4-week titration period followed by a 10-week evaluation period. Dosing was initiated at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. During the treatment period, Keppra doses were adjusted in 20 mg/kg/day increments at 2-week intervals to reach the target dose of 60 mg/kg/day.

The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire 14-week randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate, defined as the incidence of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency per week.

### KeppraXR [^1151bSJd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Absorption and distribution of extended-release levetiracetam are characterized by peak plasma concentrations occurring in about 4 hours. This represents a delay of approximately 3 hours compared to the immediate-release tablets.

A single administration of two 500 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets once daily produced comparable maximal plasma concentrations and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to that of one 500 mg immediate-release tablet taken twice daily under fasting conditions. With multiple dosages of extended-release levetiracetam tablets, the extent of exposure (AUC0–24) was similar to that after multiple dosages of immediate-release tablets. However, Cmax and Cmin values were 17% and 26% lower respectively, after extended-release tablet intake.

Consuming a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast before administering extended-release levetiracetam tablets resulted in a higher peak concentration and a longer median time to peak, with the median time to peak (Tmax) being 2 hours longer in the fed state.

Two 750 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets were found to be bioequivalent to a single administration of three 500 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets.

Metabolism of levetiracetam is not extensive in humans, primarily involving the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group to produce the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057, which accounts for 24% of the dose. This process is independent of liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.

### Assessment of a dose-response relationship of levetiracetam [^115HTPcm]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between levetiracetam dose and both efficacy and safety in adult patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Dose-response relationships for levetiracetam efficacy were evaluated using pooled data from three trials including adults with refractory partial epilepsy. Two were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials where doses of 1000–3000 mg/day of levetiracetam were administered as adjunctive therapy. The third consisted of two parts of a crossover randomized, double-blind study in which levetiracetam (1000 or 2000 mg/day) or placebo was added to ongoing therapy. Data from each part of the crossover trial were included as if it was an independent parallel-group study. A fourth randomized double-blind trial was added for the safety evaluation. It included data from adults receiving placebo or 2000 mg/day of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures.

The combined analysis showed an increasing effect with increasing dose. The responder rates (≥ 50% reduction in seizures) for placebo and levetiracetam 1000, 2000, and 3000 mg/day were 13.1%, 28.5%, 34.3%, and 41.3%, respectively. The respective values for seizure freedom were 0.8%, 4.7%, 6.3%, and 8.6%. There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship regarding adverse events, including those (asthenia, dizziness, somnolence) most commonly associated with this antiepileptic drug. Patients who do not become seizure-free at the lowest recommended levetiracetam dose (1000 mg/day) should be titrated to 2000 mg/day.

### Levetiracetam [^113Zg911]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.

- **Distribution**: The equivalence of levetiracetam injection and the oral formulation was demonstrated in a bioavailability study of 17 healthy volunteers. In this study, levetiracetam 1500 mg was diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution and infused over 15 minutes. The selected infusion rate provided plasma concentrations of levetiracetam at the end of the infusion period similar to those achieved at Tmax after an equivalent oral dose. It is demonstrated that levetiracetam 1500 mg intravenous infusion is equivalent to levetiracetam 3 x 500 mg oral tablets. The time-independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was demonstrated following 1500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with BID dosing. The AUC(0 to 12) at steady-state was equivalent to AUCinf following an equivalent single dose.

Levetiracetam and its major metabolite are less than 10% bound to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely.

- **Metabolism**: Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose), and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring.

### Evaluation of levetiracetam loading dose in adult patients with benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus [^1142mXiK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency defined as continuous seizure activity lasting more than five minutes or seizure activity without a return to baseline. Benzodiazepine-refractory SE refers to continuous seizure activity despite treatment with a benzodiazepine. Treatment of benzodiazepine-refractory SE includes levetiracetam, with loading doses ranging from 20 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 4500 mg. While levetiracetam exhibits minimal adverse effects, there is currently a lack of studies directly comparing the safety and efficacy of various loading doses of levetiracetam.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three loading doses of levetiracetam in the setting of benzodiazepine-refractory SE.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of adult patients with benzodiazepine-refractory SE who were treated with levetiracetam from April 1, 2016, to August 31, 2023. Patients with documented hypersensitivity to levetiracetam, those who were pregnant or incarcerated, and patients who received an alternative antiepileptic drug (AED) prior to levetiracetam were excluded. Patients with other identifiable causes of SE, including hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, or who were post-cardiac arrest, were also excluded. Patients were divided into three arms based on the loading dose of levetiracetam administered: ≤ 20 mg/kg (LEVlow), 21–39 mg/kg (LEVmed), or ≥ 40 mg/kg (LEVhigh). The primary endpoint was the rate of seizure termination, defined as the lack of need for an additional AED within 60 minutes.

### KeppraXR [^1153VhZs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7 ± 1 hour and is unaffected by either dose or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as an unchanged drug, which represents 66% of the administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg, and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance, and clearance is reduced in patients with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Elderly**: There are insufficient pharmacokinetic data to specifically address the use of extended-release levetiracetam in the elderly population. Pharmacokinetics of immediate-release levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61–88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38%, and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects.

- **Pediatric patients**: An open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, two-arm study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Keppra XR in pediatric patients (13 to 16 years old) and in adults (18 to 55 years old) with epilep.

The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in weekly seizure rates from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period) within the three treatment groups (x-axis) is presented in Figure 2.

- **Figure 2: Responder rate (≥ 50% reduction from baseline) in study 2: Period A**: The comparison of levetiracetam 2000 mg/day to levetiracetam 1000 mg/day for the responder rate was statistically significant (P = 0.02). The analysis of the trial as a cross-over yielded similar results.

Study 3 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 47 centers in Europe. It compared levetiracetam 3000 mg/day (N = 180) and placebo (N = 104) in patients with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, receiving only one concomitant AED. The study drug was given in two divided doses. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the two treatment groups described above.

The 16-week treatment period consisted of a 4-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed-dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED doses were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period).

- **Dosing for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures**:

	- **Adults 16 years of age and older**: Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.

	- **Pediatric patients 6 to < 16 years of age**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg (10 mg/kg twice daily) to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied.

- **Switching from oral dosing**: When switching from oral levetiracetam, the initial total daily intravenous dosage of levetiracetam should be equivalent to the total daily dosage and frequency of oral levetiracetam.

- **Switching to oral dosing**: At the end of the intravenous treatment period, the patient may be switched to levetiracetam oral administration at the equivalent daily dosage and frequency of the intravenous administration.

### Safety and tolerability of rapid administration undiluted levetiracetam [^117JykKe]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiepileptic drug widely used in patients due to its favorable safety profile. Studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) LEV typically involved volumes of at least 100 mL. Minimally diluted doses administered over 5–6 minutes were found to be both safe and effective. Given the complexities of admixing, this practice can be impractical and result in delays in antiepileptic therapy. This study aimed to retrospectively review the safety and tolerability of rapid administration of undiluted LEV doses ≤ 1000 mg.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study evaluated adverse drug reactions associated with undiluted LEV from January 1, 2018, to June 1, 2018. Patients were included if they received at least one dose of undiluted LEV and were ≥ 18 years old. Safety endpoints were reviewed and collected from the time of administration until hospital discharge. Endpoints included injection site pain and discomfort, injection site erythema, extravasation, IV line replacement, and any documented adverse effect leading to IV LEV discontinuation. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data.

- **Results**: A total of 199 patients were included in the study, comprising 1,626 doses of LEV. The majority of patients were administered LEV 1000 mg (60.8%) through a peripheral line (64.3%) and were prescribed LEV for seizure prophylaxis (58.3%). Patients received a mean of 8.1 ± 8 doses for a mean duration of therapy of 5 ± 4.5 days. Approximately 98.5% of patients did not experience an adverse effect, whereas 1.5% of patients experienced agitation, delirium, confusion, and/or lethargy.

This data shows a statistically significant improvement versus placebo.

- **Effectiveness in partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients 1 month to < 4 years of age**: Study 5 was a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Conducted at 62 sites across North America, South America, and Europe, Study 5 consisted of a 5-day evaluation period, including a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Eligible patients, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during a 48-hour baseline video EEG while on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age range: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with levetiracetam), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with levetiracetam), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with levetiracetam), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with levetiracetam).

### Keppra [^116AuDU7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Keppra as adjunctive therapy in patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 7), conducted at 50 sites in 8 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), experiencing at least 3 PGTC seizures during the 8-week combined baseline period (at least one PGTC seizure during the 4 weeks prior to the prospective baseline period and at least one PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period), were randomized to either Keppra or placebo.

The 8-week combined baseline period is referred to as "baseline" in the remainder of this section. Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day for adults or a pediatric target dose of 60 mg/kg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day (or 60 mg/kg/day for children) over 20 weeks (evaluation period). The study drug was given in 2 equally divided doses per day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the percent reduction from baseline in weekly PGTC seizure frequency for Keppra and placebo treatment groups over the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods).

The population included 164 patients (Keppra N = 80, placebo N = 84) with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (predominately juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand Mal seizures on awakening) experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

### Keppra XR [^114UYftu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among the drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5–100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing Keppra XR or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

- **Somnolence and fatigue**: Keppra XR may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience with Keppra XR to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

### Keppra XR [^116sLVBs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of immediate-release Keppra for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization (Studies 2, 3, and 4). The tablet formulation was used in all three studies.

In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to receive placebo, Keppra 1000 mg, Keppra 2000 mg, or Keppra 3000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 2 or Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Patients in Study 4 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least one year and had taken one AED. During the study, patients were on a stable dose regimen of at least one AED and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to experience at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

- **Study 2**: Study 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States, comparing immediate-release Keppra 1000 mg/day (N = 97), immediate-release Keppra 3000 mg/day (N = 101), and placebo (N = 95), given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients in Study 2 were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a 6-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period.

### Optimal dosing of levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis in critically ill patients: A prospective observational study [^114XPUXL]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Critically ill patients eliminate levetiracetam (LEV) more rapidly than healthy controls, yet low doses are commonly used for seizure prophylaxis in the ICU setting. We compared the rates of achievement of target serum levels and new-onset seizures (clinical and/or electrographic) among patients who received low (500 mg bid) versus high (750–1,000 mg bid) dose LEV.

- **Design**: Prospective, observational study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care, academic center.

- **Patients**: We included patients who received prophylactic LEV following traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, or supratentorial neurosurgery between 2019 and 2021. Patients with a history of seizure, antiseizure medication use, or renal failure requiring dialysis were excluded.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements**: LEV levels were obtained at steady state. The impact of low-dose versus high-dose LEV on the primary outcome of target LEV levels (12–46 μg/mL), and the secondary outcome of clinical and/or electrographic seizure, was assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, LEV loading dose, BMI, primary diagnosis, and creatinine clearance (CrCl).

- **Main results**: Of the 205 subjects included in analyses, n = 106 (52%) received LEV 500 mg bid (median 13 mg/kg/d), and n = 99 (48%) received LEV 750–1,000 mg bid (median 25 mg/kg/d). Overall, 111 of 205 patients (54%) achieved target levels: 48 (45%) from the low-dose group versus 63 (64%) from the high-dose group (odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1–3.7; p = 0.009). In multivariable analyses, high-dose LEV was associated with higher achievement of target serum levels compared to low-dose.

Notably, no patients discontinued treatment or required dose reduction due to these adverse reactions.

The number of patients exposed to KEPPRA XR was significantly smaller than those exposed to immediate-release KEPPRA tablets in controlled trials. Hence, some adverse reactions observed in the immediate-release KEPPRA trials are likely to occur in patients receiving KEPPRA XR.

- **Somnolence**: In controlled trials involving adult epilepsy patients with partial-onset seizures, 15% of those treated with immediate-release KEPPRA tablets reported somnolence, compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. There was no evident dose response up to 3000 mg/day. In studies without titration, 45% of patients receiving 4000 mg/day reported somnolence. Somnolence was considered serious in 0.3% of KEPPRA-treated patients compared to 0% in the placebo group. Discontinuation due to somnolence occurred in 3% of KEPPRA-treated patients versus 0.7% of those on placebo. Additionally, 1.4% of KEPPRA-treated patients and 0.9% of placebo patients necessitated dose reductions, while 0.3% of KEPPRA-treated patients required hospitalization due to somnolence.

- **Asthenia**: In controlled trials of adult patients with epilepsy experiencing partial-onset seizures, 15% of KEPPRA-treated patients reported…

### Levetiracetam [^1154prKF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosing for partial-onset seizures**: The recommended dosing for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy is the same as outlined below. There is no clinical study experience with administration of intravenous levetiracetam for a period longer than 4 days.

- **Adults 16 years of age and older**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit.

- **Pediatric patients**:
	- **1 month to < 6 months**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group.

	- **6 months to < 4 years**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose in 2 weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group.

	- **4 years to < 16 years**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily).

### Efficacy of levetiracetam as add-on therapy in the treatment of seizures in neonates [^116xSk6Q]. Neonatology (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, in our cohort of neonates admitted with encephalopathy and EEG-confirmed seizures, the effect of 1–3 loading doses of LEV as add-on therapy was limited. This was based on low rates of seizure reduction and seizure freedom, as well as a high need for additional ASM. This study argues in favor of promptly administering an additional ASM if LEV fails as add-on therapy in the treatment of symptomatic seizures in neonates. Further research is needed to assess what is the best strategy and order of ASM to treat seizures in neonates.

### Status epilepticus prognosis following levetiracetam administration: Analysis of loading doses [^117T5nhn]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Recommended loading doses of levetiracetam (LEV) for status epilepticus (SE) treatment have increased over time. However, this increase lacks an evidence-based foundation, and its benefit remains unclear. This study explores the effect of different LEV loading doses on SE prognosis.

- **Methods**: This retrospective analysis examined an SE adult registry from January 2016 to December 2021, including patients who received LEV as a second-line SE treatment. Patients were stratified according to LEV loading doses (threshold 35 mg/kg). The main outcomes assessed were global mortality, the use of LEV as the final SE treatment, and returning to baseline conditions at discharge, exploring LEV as a dichotomized or continuous dose.

- **Results**: Among 202 patients, 44 received LEV at ≥ 35 mg/kg and 158 below it. Global mortality, adjusted for SE severity and potentially fatal aetiology, was more frequent in the high LEV dose group (27.2% vs. 17.1%, odds ratio 3.14, 95% confidence interval 1.23–8.06; p = 0.017), while the prescription of LEV as the last treatment and the rates of returning to baseline conditions were comparable. Considering continuous LEV dosages or mortality in ongoing SE, however, no outcome reached statistical significance.

- **Conclusions**: Lower LEV loading doses do not appear to correlate with worse clinical outcomes, challenging existing guidelines. Further studies, ideally prospective, are needed on this topic.

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg once daily; increase by 1000 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum recommended dose of 3000 mg once daily.

See full prescribing information for use in patients with impaired renal function.

- **Recommended dosing**: For adults and adolescent patients, the recommended dosing for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy is the same, as outlined below.

	- **Adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older weighing 50 kg or more**: Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg once daily. The once daily dosage may be adjusted in increments of 1000 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg/day once daily.

- **Administration**: Keppra XR is administered once daily. Keppra XR tablets should be swallowed whole. The tablets should not be chewed, broken, or crushed.

- **Dosage adjustments in adult patients with renal impairment**: Keppra XR dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. To calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. First, estimate the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min using the appropriate formula. Then, adjust CLcr for body surface area (BSA).

- **Discontinuation of Keppra XR**: Avoid abrupt withdrawal from Keppra XR in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.

### Levetiracetam [^116fYfMn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In placebo-controlled studies investigating levetiracetam tablets for adult epilepsy patients, adverse reactions occurred in at least 1% of the patients. These reactions were more common than those in patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either levetiracetam or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

In controlled adult clinical studies using levetiracetam tablets, 15% of patients receiving levetiracetam and 12% of those receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction because of an adverse reaction. This indicates a slightly higher incidence associated with levetiracetam. The most common (> 1%) adverse reactions that resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction occurred more frequently in levetiracetam-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients.

- **Pediatric patients 4 years to < 16 years**: The adverse reaction data is derived from a pooled analysis of two controlled pediatric clinical studies using an oral formulation in patients aged 4 to 16 years with partial-onset seizures. The most common adverse reactions for pediatric patients receiving levetiracetam, in combination with other AEDs, were events that occurred more frequently than with placebo, such as fatigue and aggression.

### KeppraXR [^112mSM1m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: There were insufficient numbers of elderly subjects in controlled trials of epilepsy to adequately assess the effectiveness of Keppra XR in these patients. It is expected that the safety of Keppra XR in elderly patients aged 65 and over would be comparable to the safety observed in clinical studies of immediate-release Keppra tablets. There were 347 subjects in clinical studies of immediate-release Keppra who were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. There were insufficient numbers of elderly subjects in controlled trials of epilepsy to adequately assess the effectiveness of immediate-release Keppra in these patients. Levetiracetam is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Renal impairment**: The effect of Keppra XR on renally impaired patients was not assessed in the controlled study. However, it is expected that the effect on Keppra XR-treated patients would be similar to the effect seen in controlled studies of immediate-release Keppra tablets. Clearance of levetiracetam is decreased in patients with renal impairment and is correlated with creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with impaired renal function.

### A clinical trial of enteral levetiracetam for acute seizures in pediatric cerebral malaria [^112a49wq]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated the use of enteral levetiracetam (eLVT) in children with acute seizures and pediatric cerebral malaria. Participants allocated to eLVT received the optimal dose identified in the dose-escalation study for 72 hours. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were assessed at time points t = 0, 7, 24 hours, and 4–40 hours after the last dose. If clinical or electrographic seizures recurred or continued after the initial eLVT dose, an LVT level at the time of failure was captured. Escalation to the next dosing stratum occurred, and more frequent PK assessments were conducted (t = 0, 1.5, 4, 12, 24, 36, 40, and 84 hours). Benzodiazepines, with a maximum of 2 doses per 24 hours, were administered as needed for breakthrough seizures to allow time for eLVT absorption.

- **Dose escalation strategy**: The dose-escalation study was designed to identify a dose effective for most patients but did not clarify what dose of eLVT might benefit a child with refractory seizures or status epilepticus. Escalating therapy for any selected antiepileptic is a common approach to treating refractory seizures. Given the established safety profile of eLVT in other populations, data from other populations suggesting higher doses are beneficial for refractory seizures, an ability to rapidly cross over to phenobarbital (PB) if higher dose LVT was ineffective, and the value of acquiring additional insights into the clinical and pharmacokinetic effects of escalating eLVT in this population, dose escalation of eLVT was undertaken for those children who failed the standard dose.

- **Usual care comparison**: In the first year of the RCT, children randomized to 'usual care' received phenobarbital 20 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 5 mg/kg every 12 hours (Q12h) for 72 hours. In the second year of the RCT, the Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) recommended a revised approach for children randomized to 'usual care', receiving phenobarbital adjusting according to specific guidelines.

### Levetiracetam [^113ysPse]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in weekly seizure rates from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period) within the two treatment groups (x-axis) is presented in Figure 3.

- **Effectiveness in partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients 4 years to 16 years of age**: Study 4 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age with partial seizures uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Study 4 was conducted at 60 sites in North America. The study consisted of an 8-week baseline period and a 4-week titration period followed by a 10-week evaluation period. Eligible patients who still experienced, on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, at least 4 partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening, as well as at least 4 partial-onset seizures in each of the two 4-week baseline periods, were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo.

Dosing was initiated at 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. During the treatment period, levetiracetam doses were adjusted in 20 mg/kg/day increments at 2-week intervals to the target dose of 60 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of efficacy was a between-group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly seizure frequency.

### Keppra [^114z1ZDN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 24 pediatric patients (age 6–12 years) following a single dose (20 mg/kg). The body weight-adjusted apparent clearance of levetiracetam was approximately 40% higher than in adults.

A repeat dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in pediatric patients (age 4–12 years) at doses of 20 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 60 mg/kg/day. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam and its metabolite (ucb L057) in 14 pediatric patients demonstrated rapid absorption of levetiracetam at all doses with a Tmax of about 1 hour and a t1/2 of 5 hours across the three dosing levels. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in children was linear between 20 to 60 mg/kg/day. The potential interaction of levetiracetam with other AEDs was also evaluated in these patients. Levetiracetam had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate, or lamotrigine. However, there was about a 22% increase in apparent clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with an enzyme-inducing AED (e.g. carbamazepine).

Following single-dose administration (20 mg/kg) of a 10% oral solution to children with epilepsy (1 month to < 4 years), levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations were observed approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetic results indicated that half-life was shorter (5.3 h) than for adults (7.2 h), and apparent clearance was faster (1.5 mL/min/kg) than for adults (0.96 mL/min/kg).

### Keppra [^113vqvSb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Keppra for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 5), conducted at 62 sites across North America, South America, and Europe. This study involved pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 4 years, whose seizures were uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible participants were on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs and had experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG. They were randomized to receive either Keppra or a placebo.

The study enrolled 116 patients, with 60 receiving Keppra and 56 receiving a placebo. All participants had refractory partial-onset seizures, which may or may not have been secondarily generalized. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows:

- **1 month to less than 6 months**: 4 treated with Keppra
- **6 months to less than 1 year**: 8 treated with Keppra
- **1 year to less than 2 years**: 20 treated with Keppra
- **2 years to less than 4 years**: 28 treated with Keppra

The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period, including a 1-day titration phase followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Keppra dosing was determined by age and weight:

- Children 1 month to less than 6 months old were given a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day.
- Children 6 months to less than 4 years old were given a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day.

The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate, defined as the percentage of patients with a reduction of ≥ 50% in seizure frequency.

### Prospective open-label, single-arm, multicenter, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic studies of intravenous levetiracetam in children with epilepsy [^116DKerg]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam given via intravenous administration has been shown to be an effective alternative in adults with epilepsy when oral administration is not feasible. This study was a prospective single-arm, multicenter study to assess tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous levetiracetam in children with epilepsy. Children with epilepsy ages 1 month to 16 years requiring intravenous levetiracetam were enrolled.

Assessments included vital signs, electrocardiogram, hematology, chemistry, plasma concentrations of antiepileptic medications, weight, physical/neurological examinations, and pharmacokinetics. A total of 52 patients were enrolled. Mild to moderate treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 63%, the most frequent being pyrexia and dry mouth. Most other treatment-emergent adverse events were considered unrelated to intravenous levetiracetam administration. Therefore, intravenous levetiracetam in the acute setting was overall well tolerated in children 1 month to 16 years.

### Evaluation of levetiracetam dosing strategies for seizure prophylaxis following traumatic brain injury [^114NZ2dQ]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Low credibility.

Although levetiracetam has been increasingly used as an alternative to phenytoin for early posttraumatic seizure prophylaxis following traumatic brain injury (TBI), an optimal dosing strategy has not been elucidated. The objective of this study is to determine whether different dosing strategies of levetiracetam are associated with the incidence of early posttraumatic seizures when used as prophylaxis following TBI.

- **Methods**: This retrospective single-center cohort study included admitted patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of TBI, receiving levetiracetam for early posttraumatic seizure prophylaxis between July 1, 2013, and September 1, 2019. The primary outcome of this study was to evaluate three different dosing strategies of levetiracetam (≤ 1000 mg/day, 1500 mg/day, and ≥ 2000 mg/day) and associated rates of early posttraumatic seizures. Secondary outcomes were to summarize absolute total daily maintenance doses of levetiracetam among patients who experienced early posttraumatic seizures compared with those who did not, to determine the impact of three different dosing strategies on hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality, and to assess patient-specific variables on the occurrence of posttraumatic seizures. Overlap propensity score weighting was used to address the potential for confounding.
