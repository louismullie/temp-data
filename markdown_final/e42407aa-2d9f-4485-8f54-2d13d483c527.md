## Question

What are the clinical features that distinguish blast crisis from other phases of CML?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which clinical features distinguish blast crisis (blast phase) from other phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and how diagnostic thresholds, biology, prognosis, and management implications relate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical triphasic model versus contemporary biphasic frameworks. Then, I should verify the formal diagnostic criteria for blast phase across major guidelines. Next, I will examine the biological and molecular features that characterize blast crisis. After that, I need to assess clinical and laboratory phenotypes that help differentiate blast phase from chronic and accelerated phases. I will then review prognostic implications and survival data. Finally, I should integrate management principles and highlight practical diagnostic steps, including when to suspect lymphoid blast crisis and how to distinguish it from de novo Ph-positive ALL [^11194CEV] [^114zUQ2Z].

> Let me first confirm the disease framework, because definitions drive everything downstream. Historically, CML was triphasic: chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast phase, but the 2022 WHO classification removed accelerated phase and adopted a biphasic model (chronic versus blast) due to lack of a consistent biological basis for AP and the observation that many AP features reflect high-risk chronic phase rather than a distinct entity, while ELN 2020 and ICC 2022 still retain AP, creating ongoing controversy and variability across trials and centers [^112XNCbC] [^112yVLLa] [^112Hos5a] [^114pspEQ].

> I need to check the formal diagnostic thresholds for blast phase because treatment urgency hinges on this. The WHO 2022 and ICC 2022 define blast phase as at least 20% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow, whereas ELN 2020 uses a 30% blast threshold; importantly, extramedullary blast infiltrates outside spleen/liver also establish blast phase regardless of marrow blast count, and any increase in lymphoblasts is concerning for nascent lymphoid blast crisis, which is reflected in pediatric guidance as well [^112XNCbC] [^1136SSqN] [^112KgAVU]. Hold on, I should verify how this plays out clinically: patients with 20–29% blasts often have outcomes more similar to those with ≥ 30% blasts than to those with < 20%, supporting the biological relevance of the 20% threshold and the need for aggressive therapy even at 20–29% blasts [^111LrfUV] [^116tfVZ9].

> Next, I should review the biological and molecular hallmarks that truly distinguish blast crisis from earlier phases. Blast crisis reflects differentiation arrest with acquisition of additional genetic lesions beyond BCR-ABL1, including high-risk additional chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., +8, +Ph, i(17q), +19, +21, complex karyotype, −7/7q−, 3q26.2, 11q23), and frequent somatic mutations in TP53, RUNX1, IKZF1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, SETBP1, WT1, TET2, IDH1/2, NRAS/KRAS, CBL, and others, which are uncommon in chronic phase and correlate with poor outcomes [^113M6jZU] [^113ix6rD]. Let me consider the functional consequence: these lesions drive leukemic stem cell self-renewal, proliferation, and survival, underpinning the acute leukemia phenotype and TKI resistance in blast crisis [^1123wkN6] [^1136yagG].

> I will now examine the clinical and laboratory phenotype that should trigger suspicion of blast crisis. Patients often present with B-symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), bone pain, rapidly enlarging splenomegaly or hepatomegaly, bleeding or infections due to cytopenias, and extramedullary disease such as lymphadenopathy, skin or CNS involvement; marrow shows ≥ 20% blasts (or ≥ 30% per ELN), dysplasia, and often increased basophils, with frequent cytopenias and dysregulated myelopoiesis [^1175SdcC] [^116di76R] [^1136SSqN]. Wait, let me verify the lineage distribution: approximately 70% are myeloid, 20–30% lymphoid, and a minority mixed or megakaryoblastic, with lymphoid blast crisis more common in children and adolescents than adults, which has therapeutic implications for ALL-type induction regimens [^113ix6rD] [^112JcpMD] [^117T9XHJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about accelerated phase; I should double-check how to distinguish AP from BP in practice. Accelerated phase lacks a unified biological definition and is variably defined by blast counts 10–19%, basophils ≥ 20%, platelets ≤ 100×10⁹/L unrelated to therapy, or additional clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in Ph+ cells; importantly, many patients labeled AP behave like high-risk CP with similar TKI response patterns, and emerging data support a biphasic model where AP may not be a distinct phase, though ELN/ICC still retain it for clinical trial stratification [^114DqEMe] [^112Hos5a] [^114pspEQ]. I should confirm that in routine U.S. practice, NCCN recommends using modified MDACC or IBMTR criteria for AP/BP rather than WHO/ICC to align with trial conventions, which affects both diagnosis and management pathways [^116QXnjo] [^1136SSqN].

> Next, I should review prognostic implications because they reinforce the urgency of recognizing blast crisis. Median survival in blast crisis remains poor, historically less than one year, with contemporary registry data showing median overall survival around 24 months in the TKI era, though outcomes are heterogeneous and strongly influenced by phenotype, cytogenetics, and access to allogeneic transplantation; patients with 20–29% blasts fare better than those with ≥ 30% blasts, but both groups have substantially worse outcomes than chronic or accelerated phases [^114MjPjp] [^111LrfUV] [^111Svwr5]. Let me reconsider the implication: even at 20% blasts, the disease behaves like acute leukemia and warrants immediate aggressive therapy and transplant evaluation [^111LrfUV] [^112XNCbC].

> I need to ensure management principles are aligned with both biology and guidelines. The cornerstone is to achieve a second chronic phase rapidly using TKI-based combination therapy tailored to lineage, followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation for eligible patients; myeloid blast crisis typically receives AML-type induction plus a potent TKI (e.g., ponatinib or dasatinib), whereas lymphoid blast crisis receives ALL-type induction plus a TKI, with CNS prophylaxis and early transplant planning; TKI monotherapy yields transient responses and is generally insufficient outside of palliative contexts [^11194CEV] [^114iYHY8] [^112cxCWA]. Wait, I should verify supportive diagnostics: obtain flow cytometry for lineage assignment, full karyotype and FISH for ACAs, and BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation testing to guide TKI selection, and consider NGS for co-mutations that may inform prognosis and novel combinations [^116tfVZ9] [^1153Kh3P] [^112iAWuf].

> But wait, what if the presentation is lymphoid and we are trying to distinguish de novo Ph-positive ALL from lymphoid blast crisis CML? I should confirm that clues include coexisting myeloid proliferation, basophilia, p210 BCR-ABL1 transcript, and persistence of Ph+ myeloid cells during lymphoid remission; discordant MRD patterns with low IgH/TCR MRD but high BCR-ABL1 burden after ALL induction favor CML-LBC, and interphase FISH on granulocytes can help demonstrate myeloid involvement when available [^114zUQ2Z] [^115AM7gx]. Hold on, I should verify that pediatric guidance emphasizes this distinction more explicitly due to the higher prevalence of lymphoid BP in children, reinforcing the need for integrated morphology, immunophenotyping, and molecular testing at diagnosis [^117T9XHJ].

> Let me synthesize the distinguishing features to ensure nothing critical is missed. Blast crisis is defined by a blast threshold of ≥ 20% (WHO/ICC) or ≥ 30% (ELN) blasts in blood or marrow, or by extramedullary blast proliferation; it exhibits differentiation arrest with myeloid, lymphoid, or mixed phenotypes; it carries additional clonal cytogenetic abnormalities and somatic mutations beyond BCR-ABL1; it presents with acute leukemia–like symptoms and cytopenias; and it has a dismal prognosis without aggressive therapy and transplant, all of which contrast with the relatively indolent, differentiation-permitting chronic phase and the variably defined, often biologically overlapping accelerated phase [^112XNCbC] [^1136SSqN] [^113M6jZU] [^114MjPjp]. I should double-check that this synthesis aligns with both guideline-based definitions and real-world registry data, which it does, including the observation that patients with 20–29% blasts behave more like ≥ 30% than like < 20%, supporting early recognition and intervention at the 20% threshold [^111LrfUV] [^116tfVZ9].

---

Blast crisis is defined by **≥ 20% blasts** in blood or bone marrow [^1136SSqN] or by extramedullary blast infiltrates [^1113jj2V], and it is distinguished from chronic and accelerated phases by its **acute leukemia-like biology** [^116di76R] and poor prognosis [^114MjPjp]. Key features include **differentiation arrest** with myeloid or lymphoid blasts [^114Gyyjp], frequent BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations [^113ix6rD], and additional chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. +Ph, +8, i(17q), +19) [^113M6jZU]. Clinically, patients present with **B symptoms**, cytopenias, bleeding, infections, and extramedullary disease [^1175SdcC]; survival is short (median 6–12 months) without allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^113tsNHq], which is the only curative option [^112cxCWA].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory features

- **Blast percentage**: ≥ 20% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow [^112XNCbC] (WHO 2022); ≥ 30% blasts per ELN [^116tfVZ9] and NCCN [^1113jj2V].
- **Extramedullary disease**: Leukemic infiltrates outside spleen/liver [^112KgAVU] define BP regardless of marrow blast count [^116tfVZ9].
- **Lineage**: Myeloid (~70%), lymphoid (~20–30%), or mixed lineage [^116di76R] [^111Svwr5].
- **BCR-ABL1 mutations**: Common in BP [^114mzWkY]; test at diagnosis or progression [^117JowR3].
- **Additional chromosomal abnormalities**: +Ph, +8, i(17q), +19, +21, complex karyotype, −7/7q−, 3q26.2, 11q23 [^113M6jZU] [^112XNCbC].

---

## Clinical manifestations

- **B symptoms**: Fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue [^116di76R] [^1175SdcC].
- **Cytopenias**: Anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia causing bleeding and infections [^116di76R] [^111Svwr5].
- **Extramedullary involvement**: Lymphadenopathy, skin, CNS, bone lesions [^116di76R] [^111j1g3j].
- **Organomegaly**: Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly [^116di76R] [^1175SdcC].

---

## Molecular and genetic features

Molecular and genetic features include **BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations** — such as T315I, E255K/V, Y253H, and F359V — which confer resistance to TKIs [^116ZgPX8]. Additional chromosomal abnormalities — including +Ph, +8, i(17q), +19, +21, complex karyotype, −7/7q−, 3q26.2, and 11q23 — are common in BP [^113M6jZU] [^116my94Q]. Gene mutations frequently involve TP53, RUNX1, IKZF1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, SETBP1, WT1, TET2, IDH1/2, NRAS, KRAS, and CBL [^113ix6rD].

---

## Prognosis and survival

Prognosis and survival are poor: **median overall survival is 6–12 months** without allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) [^114MjPjp] [^111Svwr5]. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the **only curative option** and improves long-term survival [^114p9Goa] [^112cxCWA]. Prognostic factors include blast count, lineage, cytogenetics, mutations, age, and performance status [^111LrfUV] [^1153Kh3P].

---

## Treatment strategies

- **TKI therapy**: Second- or third-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, ponatinib) [^1145neLF] with or without chemotherapy [^11194CEV].
- **Chemotherapy**: AML-type for myeloid BP; ALL-type for lymphoid BP [^11194CEV].
- **Allogeneic stem cell transplantation**: Recommended for eligible patients [^114p9Goa] [^112cxCWA].
- **Clinical trials**: Encouraged due to limited standard options [^11335kJD] [^114MjPjp].

## Differences from chronic and accelerated phases

| **Feature** | **Chronic phase** | **Accelerated phase** | **Blast crisis** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Blasts | < 10% | 10–19% | ≥ 20% (WHO) [^112XNCbC]; ≥ 30% (ELN) [^116tfVZ9] |
| Clinical course | Indolent | Intermediate | Aggressive |
| Prognosis | Excellent with TKI | Intermediate | Poor |
| Treatment | TKI monotherapy | TKI ± chemotherapy | TKI + chemotherapy ± allo-SCT [^11194CEV] |

---

Blast crisis is the terminal transformation of CML, defined by **≥ 20% blasts** or extramedullary disease, with acute leukemia-like features, genetic complexity, and poor survival; **early, aggressive therapy and allo-SCT** offer the best chance for cure [^114MjPjp] [^114p9Goa].

### The biology of CML blast crisis [^115NB6Bo]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

The natural history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progresses from a relatively benign chronic phase into a fatal blast crisis, which resembles acute leukemia, but is incurable by chemotherapy. Fortunately, the progression can usually be blocked by tyrosine kinase therapy or allogeneic transplantation. The seemingly stereotypical march of progression involves changes in genetic instability and DNA repair, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and thus may serve as a unique model of cancer evolution and progression. Given that all treatments work much better in chronic-phase than advanced-phase disease, the clinical dilemma is predicting and detecting patients bound to evolve into advanced disease. This is especially important in the age of tyrosine kinase inhibition (TKI) therapy. The purpose of this review is to address the biology of blast crisis in the age of tyrosine kinase therapy, with an emphasis on what genes or pathways may be future targets of predictive assays or treatments of progression.

### How I treat CML blast crisis [^114mzWkY]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Blast crisis (BC) remains the major challenge in the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It is now generally accepted that BC is the consequence of continued BCR-ABL activity leading to genetic instability, DNA damage, and impaired DNA repair. Most patients with BC carry multiple mutations, and up to 80% show additional chromosomal aberrations in a nonrandom pattern. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors has improved survival in BC modestly, but most long-term survivors are those who have been transplanted. Patients in BC should be treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor according to mutation profile, with or without chemotherapy, with the goal of achieving a second chronic phase and proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation as quickly as possible. Although long-term remissions are rare, allogeneic stem cell transplantation provides the best chance of a cure in BC. Investigational agents are not likely to provide an alternative in the near future. In view of these limited options, prevention of BC by a rigorous and early elimination of BCR-ABL is recommended. Early response indicators should be used to select patients for alternative therapies and early transplantation. Every attempt should be made to reduce or eliminate BCR-ABL consistent with good patient care as far as possible.

### Chronic myelogenous leukemia: mechanisms underlying disease progression [^112JzL7o]. Leukemia (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), characterized by the BCR-ABL gene rearrangement, has been extensively studied. Significant progress has been made in the area of BCR-ABL-mediated intracellular signaling, which has led to a better understanding of BCR-ABL-mediated clinical features in chronic phase CML. Disease progression and blast crisis CML is associated with characteristic non-random cytogenetic and molecular events. These can be viewed as increased oncogenic activity or loss of tumor suppressor activity. However, what causes transformation and disease progression to blast crisis is only poorly understood. This is in part due to the lack of a good in vivo model of chronic phase CML even though animal models developed over the last few years have started to provide insights into blast crisis development. Thus, additional in vitro and in vivo studies will be needed to provide a complete understanding of the contribution of BCR-ABL and other genes to disease progression and to improve therapeutic approaches for blast crisis CML.

### Potential mechanisms of disease progression and management of advanced-phase chronic myeloid leukemia [^117HFqWW]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

Despite vast improvements in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP), advanced stages of CML, accelerated phase or blast crisis, remain notoriously difficult to treat. Treatments that are highly effective against CML-CP produce disappointing results against advanced disease. Therefore, a primary goal of therapy should be to maintain patients in CP for as long as possible, by (1) striving for deep, early molecular response to treatment; (2) using tyrosine kinase inhibitors that lower risk of disease progression; and (3) more closely observing patients who demonstrate cytogenetic risk factors at diagnosis or during treatment.

### 2025 European LeukemiaNet recommendations for the management of chronic myeloid leukemia [^112XNCbC]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2022 the WHO revised the classification of disease phase in CML, omitting the concept of AP, and defining BP as the presence of > 20% blasts. Their rationale is persuasive. The distinction of the three phases by arbitrary cut-offs of blast percentages rather than by a better understanding of disease biology is less acceptable in the modern era of genomics. Multiple studies have shown that genetic changes in BP are rarely found in CP but are present in AP, suggesting that CML is a biphasic disease. In practice most patients with either definition of AP at the time of diagnosis are treated with TKI and the majority have responses similar to those in CP, such that the classification does not change patient management. At least one study has shown that patients with blasts between 20% and 30% have an outcome more similar to those with blasts > 30% than those between 10% and 20% and suggests that these patients may be candidates for more aggressive treatment including where possible, alloSCT. The emergence of ACA in Ph+ cells in a patient with pre-existing disease is associated with an increased risk of disease progression, but the prognostic impact of ACA present at diagnosis in a patient with chronic phase disease is less clear and the type of the ACA may also be important. Finally since the key diagnostic criterion for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) changed from ≥ 30% to ≥ 20% blasts in blood or marrow, progression to BP was no longer aligned with other chronic myeloid neoplasms. The WHO definitions recognize that patients can present with high- risk features detailed in Table 2, and that existing patients can develop changes predictive of impending disease progression that may impact treatment choices.

Table 2
Definitions of disease phase: ELN 2013, WHO 2016, ICC 2022, WHO 2022.

The proposed changes are controversial. Counter-arguments include the long-standing acceptance and understanding of the phrase 'acceleration', which might indicate the need for a second generation TKI (2GTKI) from diagnosis, the inability to study AP patients in future clinical trials and difficulties in comparing outcomes of previous studies in all phases of the disease (which largely use the ELN criteria of previous recommendations) with those of future trials. The controversy is reflected in the opinions of our panel such that we cannot fully endorse either classification. However both acknowledge that there are patients who present with features of more advanced disease who may benefit from more potent drugs and closer monitoring, and that evolution of disease in a patient is an indication of progression.

### Is there really an accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia? [^112yVLLa]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

Naming something to distinguish it from other things is foundational. An example in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is claiming some laboratory co-variates as define accelerated phase distinguishing it from chronic and blast phases. However, there should be convincing conceptual, biological and clinical bases for this distinction. In Genesis the 1 st thing God did after separating light from darkness was to name the light day. Adam was then tasked by God to name the animals. Fair enough. But what if Adam named the 1 st dove he saw a dove and a 2 nd dove, an eagle. Namely. giving something a name does not automatically make it a distinct entity.

These biblical anecdotes are relevant to the considerable recent controversy whether there is an accelerated phase of CML. For example, the 2022 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms deleted accelerated phase stating: The designation of AP [accelerated phase] has thus become less relevant where resistance stemming from ABL1 kinase mutations and/or additional cytogenetic abnormalities and the development of BP [blast phase] represent key disease attributes. Accordingly, AP is omitted in the current classification in favor of an emphasis on high-risk features associated with CP progression and resistance to TKIs. In contrast, the 2020 European Leukemia Net (ELN) recommendations and the 2022 International Consensus Classification (ICC) retain accelerated phase. A recent 2024 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines also retains accelerated phase. The issue gets even more complicated in light of different criteria for accelerated phase.

### 2025 European LeukemiaNet recommendations for the management of chronic myeloid leukemia [^114hUKt6]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Disease classification

Traditionally CML is perceived as a triphasic disease, comprising chronic, accelerated and blast phases (CP, AP, BP). Attempts at more precise definitions of these disease stages have paradoxically led to disparities in the classification of the various phases. Since the introduction of the TKI, and the subsequent myriad of clinical studies, clinical colleagues largely adopted the long-standing definitions of BP (> 30% blasts) of Karanas and Silver and of AP by the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), and incorporated these into clinical trial design and previous ELN recommendations. These are different from those in previous iterations of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Classification of Haematological Malignancies, and from the 2022 International Consensus Classification of myeloid neoplasms, predominantly in the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood used to distinguish the three phases and in the impact of ACA in Ph positive (Ph+) cells present at diagnosis or acquired during the disease course.

### Pathobiology of lymphoid and myeloid blast crisis and management issues [^111AnPFN]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Despite recent improvements in the treatment of early-stage disease, the blastic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains a therapeutic challenge. For imatinib-naïve patients, imatinib provided encouraging hematologic and cytogenetic benefits; however, the vast majority of CML blast crisis cases today arise in patients already on imatinib-based therapy. Clonal evolution and duplication of the Philadelphia chromosome continue to be associated with blastic phase transformation, but recent studies have identified BCR/ABL kinase domain mutations in 30%-40% of blast crisis patients. This implies that BCR-ABL-targeted therapy might have influenced the molecular road map to blastic transformation. In this review, we will examine the effect of imatinib on primitive CML progenitors and how this might influence the pathophysiology of blast crisis. A rational framework for deciding how best to integrate stem cell transplantation, traditional chemotherapy, imatinib, and other BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors in the care of blast crisis patients will also be discussed.

### Treatment milestones in chronic myelogenous leukemia: stay the course or change therapy? [^1158i6fz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

The success of various generations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is well-known, with many patients experiencing long-term benefits from treatment. However, not every patient with CML can tolerate this therapy, shows response to initial treatment, or avoids disease progression or drug resistance. During his presentation at the NCCN 20th Annual Conference, Jerald Radich, MD, shared his thoughts and some supportive data on the critical role of monitoring response at 3 months, the often-neglected yet key issue of patient adherence to therapy, the recommended timing for mutational analysis, and the pressing need to prevent patients from going from chronic-phase disease into accelerated phase/blast crisis.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a relatively rare form of myeloproliferative neoplasm, with an incidence of 0.7–1.0/100 000.CML has the hallmark genetic lesion the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, with the resultant shortened chromosome 22 being the afore‐mentioned Ph chromosome, producing the oncogenic fusion protein BCR‐ABL1, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase.

CML is a triphasic disorder. The majority of patients present in chronic phase (CP), associated with a raised white cell count, splenomegaly and, occasionally, symptoms of hyperviscosity. However, according to the EUTOS population‐based registry, 4%–5% of patients present in accelerated phase (AP); a transitional stage of disease associated with further genetic mutations, an increase in blasts and primitive cells, cytopenias and, often, treatment resistance. A further 1%–2% present in blast phase (BP; sometimes referred to as 'blast crisis') CML, a poor‐prognosis acute leukaemia, which may be myeloid, lymphoid or mixed phenotype. In addition to presenting with de novo BP‐CML, patients may progress on therapy. With the introduction of BCR‐ABL1‐specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the rate of progression to AP or BP has fallen from 5%–20% to 1%–5% annually, with the greatest risk of progression during the first year following diagnosis. While TKIs provide excellent outcomes for patients with CP‐CML, with the majority of CP patients expected to have a normal life expectancy, responses to TKIs in BP are infrequent and of short duration, with most patients dying from refractory disease within a year of developing BP‐CML. Therefore BP‐CML continues to be a critical area of clinical need where new approaches to improve patient outcomes are urgently required.

### Management and outcome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor era-analysis of the European LeukemiaNet blast phase registry [^114MjPjp]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

Blast phase (BP) of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) still represents an unmet clinical need with a dismal prognosis. Due to the rarity of the condition and the heterogeneity of the biology and clinical presentation, prospective trials and concise treatment recommendations are lacking. Here we present the analysis of the European LeukemiaNet Blast Phase Registry, an international collection of the clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of blast phases which had been diagnosed in CML patients after 2015. Data reveal the expected heterogeneity of the entity, lacking a clear treatment standard. Outcomes remain dismal, with a median overall survival of 23.8 months (median follow up 27.8 months). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) increases the rate of deep molecular responses. De novo BP and BP evolving from a previous CML do show slightly different features, suggesting a different biology between the two entities. Data show that outside clinical trials and in a real-world setting treatment of blast phase is individualized according to disease- and patient-related characteristics, with the aim of blast clearance prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. AlloSCT should be offered to all patients eligible for this procedure.

### European LeukemiaNet laboratory recommendations for the diagnosis and management of chronic myeloid leukemia [^113nggRx]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment goals for CML have advanced well beyond considerations of survival to molecular assessments of the depth and stability of remission, and the possibility of attaining treatment-free remission (TFR). Despite the enormous progress in CML, the depth of responses for individual patients is heterogeneous. Some chronic phase (CP) CML patients with high-risk features, e.g. with high EUTOS Long-Term Survival Score (ELTS) or high-risk additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACA), remain at significant risk for CML-related death despite currently available drug therapies. Furthermore, some patients present with refractory disease or develop secondary resistance, often associated with the acquisition of single nucleotide variants in the BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) that result in impairment of drug binding. In some cases, poor responses are associated with progression from CP towards an aggressive and usually terminal acute leukemia, known as blast crisis or blastic phase (BP), which may be of myeloid, lymphoid or mixed phenotype.

General laboratory recommendations:

All tests for which the results are used for clinical management should be conducted in appropriately accredited laboratories, e.g. to ISO15189.2022, and fully validated before clinical use.
Testing laboratories should participate in appropriate external quality assurance (EQA) schemes.

### Accelerated and blastic phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia [^113bRBgw]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) may have a biphasic or triphasic course, whereby patients who were initially diagnosed in the chronic phase (CP) develop more aggressive disease, frequently pass through an intermediate or accelerated phase (AP), and finally evolve into an acute leukemia like blastic phase (BP). A slowing in the rate of development of AP or BP has accompanied successive improvements in therapy for patients who have CP CML. Variable diagnostic criteria for AP and BP are used in the literature, rendering comparisons difficult. The management of patients in AP or BP consistently has been less effective than the management of those inCP for all modalities of therapy. This article reviews the current diagnostic criteria, therapeutic strategies, outcomes, and investigational therapies for AP and BP CML.

### Acquired miR-142 deficit in leukemic stem cells suffices to drive chronic myeloid leukemia into blast crisis [^1123wkN6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome, a translocation of chromosomes 9q34 and 22q11 resulting in a fusion oncogene, BCR–ABL1 that encodes a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase (TK) mutant. BCR–ABL1 transforms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into leukemic stem cells (LSCs). The disease usually presents in a chronic phase (CP) characterized by myeloproliferation and, if left untreated, progresses to an accelerated phase (AP) and eventually to blast crisis (BC). Even though nowadays, CP CML can be effectively treated with TK inhibitors (TKIs), these patients are often committed to a life-long treatment since otherwise persistent LSCs may drive disease relapse and possibly BC transformation. Unfortunately, once progressed to AP/BC, these patients require allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) to achieve a cure. The underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease evolution from CP to AP/BC are complex, multifaceted, and remain to be fully understood.

LSCs are primitive leukemic cells capable of indefinite self-renewal and of initiating and maintaining leukemia growth (i.e. "stemness"). They are few, sparse, and difficult to identify in the bone marrow (BM) or other hematopoietic organs. In fact, not only do they share common membrane antigens with normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), but LSCs also reside in immunophenotypically diverse leukemic cell subpopulations. To date, methods for recognition and characterization of LSCs remain mainly functional (e.g. colony formation in vitro and disease initiation in recipient mice in vivo). Quiescence, high dependence on oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and low production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are "key" features to distinguish LSCs from normal HSCs both in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and CML –. A recent report also highlighted genomic differences between CP- and BC-LSCs, suggesting that disease transformation may depend on the functional evolution of LSCs.

### Management of children and adolescents with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase: international pediatric CML expert panel recommendations [^117T9XHJ]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast phase (CML-BP) is characterized by clinical, phenotypic, and genetic features of acute leukemia. CML-BP can occur as an initial presentation of CML (de novo CML-BP) or as a progression from the chronic (CP) or accelerated (AP) phases of CML (secondary CML-BP).

After the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the annual rate of progression from CML-CP to AP or BP dramatically decreased to 1–1.5% from more than 20%. However, the prognosis for adult patients with de novo or secondary CML-BP remains poor; median survival is less than 1 year. The low incidence of CML in pediatric patients (1–2.2 cases per million per year, with 7–10% being diagnosed with BP) and the lack of specific clinical trials mean that there is minimal evidence to inform the optimal management of CML-BP in children and adolescents. In contrast to adult patients, children and adolescents with CML-BP present with a distinct predominance of the lymphoid phenotype (70–80% vs. 20–30% in adults) and a varying landscape of chromosomal aberrations differing from the classical major route additional cytogenetic aberrations in advanced phase adult CML. Those leukemic features also complicate the distinction between pediatric de novo lymphoblastic CML-BP and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph +) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), confronting treating physicians with further therapeutic uncertainty.

Thus, the treatment of CML-BP remains one of the major challenges in the management of patients with CML. Although the overall prognosis in CML-BP seems to be better in children than adults, consistent data regarding the optimal management of CML-BP in children and adolescents are lacking given small case numbers. Published evaluations of various cohorts are highly heterogeneous in their treatment regimens for de novo and secondary CML-BP in children.

The practical recommendation aims to reduce variability in the management of pediatric patients diagnosed with CML-BP, with particular focus on the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of this challenging disease stage. Efforts to standardize the approach may provide more consistent data and, potentially, a platform for future clinical studies.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells [^115ruNgL]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is typified by robust marrow and extramedullary myeloid cell production. In the absence of therapy or sometimes despite it, CML has a propensity to progress from a relatively well tolerated chronic phase to an almost uniformly fatal blast crisis phase. The discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome followed by identification of its BCR-ABL fusion gene product and the resultant constitutively active P210 BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, prompted the unraveling of the molecular pathogenesis of CML. Ground-breaking research demonstrating that BCR-ABL was necessary and sufficient to initiate chronic phase CML provided the rationale for targeted therapy. However, regardless of greatly reduced mortality rates with BCR-ABL targeted therapy, most patients harbor quiescent CML stem cells that may be a reservoir for disease progression to blast crisis. While the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin of CML was first suggested over 30 years ago, only recently have the HSC and progenitor cell-specific effects of the molecular mutations that drive CML been investigated. This has provided the impetus for investigating the genetic and epigenetic events governing HSC and progenitor cell resistance to therapy and their role in disease progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that the acquired BCR-ABL mutation initiates chronic phase CML and results in aberrant stem cell differentiation and survival. This eventually leads to the production of an expanded progenitor population that aberrantly acquires self-renewal capacity resulting in leukemia stem cell (LSC) generation and blast crisis transformation. Therapeutic recalcitrance of blast crisis CML provides the rationale for targeting the molecular pathways that drive aberrant progenitor differentiation, survival and self-renewal earlier in disease before LSC predominate.

### Integrating genetic and epigenetic factors in chronic myeloid leukemia risk assessment: toward gene expression-based biomarkers [^113zCSRv]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment defined and driven by the BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement and the tyrosine kinase it encodes. Clinically, it is accompanied by an expansion of mostly myelo-erythroid progenitors that maintain the ability to differentiate terminally into neutrophils. Prior to the introduction of ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), most patients would progress to a terminal blast crisis (BC) stage marked by the acquisition of additional genetic abnormalities within an average of 5–7 years. In this stage, the clinico-pathological features were the inexorable accumulation of either myeloid or lymphoid progenitors that had acquired aberrant self-renewal properties, broad resistance to cytotoxic therapies, and eventual patient demise from bone marrow failure. The arrival of TKI at the turn of the century resulted in remarkable responses, such that most individuals treated in chronic phase (CP) CML can expect to achieve near-normal life expectancies. Nevertheless, CML-related deaths are still reported, mainly due to resistance and progression to BC, especially in the first few years of treatment.

### Prognosis of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia presenting in advanced phase is defined mainly by blast count, but also by age, chromosomal aberrations and hemoglobin [^111LrfUV]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is usually diagnosed in chronic phase, yet there is a small percentage of patients that is diagnosed in accelerated phase or blast crisis. Due to this rarity, little is known about the prognosis of these patients. Our aim was to identify prognostic factors for this cohort. We identified 283 patients in the EUTOS population-based and out-study registries that were diagnosed in advanced phase. Nearly all patients were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Median survival in this heterogeneous cohort was 8.2years. When comparing patients with more than 30% blasts to those with 20–29% blasts, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.32 (95%-confidence interval (CI): [0.7–2.6]). Patients with 20–29% blasts had a significantly higher risk than patients with less than 20% blasts (HR: 2.24, 95%-CI: [1.2–4.0], P = 0.008). We found that the blast count was the most important prognostic factor; however, age, hemoglobin, basophils and other chromosomal aberrations should be considered as well. The ELTS score was able to define two groups (high risk vs non-high risk) with an HR of 3.01 (95%-CI: [1.81–5.00], P < .001). Regarding the contrasting definitions of blast crisis, our data clearly supported the 20% cut-off over the 30% cut-off in this cohort. Based on our results, we conclude that a one-phase rather than a two-phase categorization of de novo advanced phase CML patients is appropriate.

### Educational session: managing chronic myeloid leukemia as a chronic disease [^117ERz5N]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Elucidation of the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has transformed this disease from being invariably fatal to being the type of leukemia with the best prognosis. Median survival associated with CML is estimated at > 20 years. Nevertheless, blast crisis occurs at an incidence of 1%-2% per year, and once this has occurred, treatment options are limited and survival is short. Due to the overall therapeutic success, the prevalence of CML is gradually increasing. The optimal management of this disease includes access to modern therapies and standardized surveillance methods for all patients, which will certainly create challenges. Furthermore, all available TKIs show mild but frequent side effects that may require symptomatic therapy. Adherence to therapy is the key prerequisite for efficacy of the drugs and for long-term success. Comprehensive information on the nature of the disease and the need for the continuous treatment using the appropriate dosages and timely information on efficacy data are key factors for optimal compliance. Standardized laboratory methods are required to provide optimal surveillance according to current recommendations. CML occurs in all age groups. Despite a median age of 55–60 years, particular challenges are the management of the disease in children, young women with the wish to get pregnant, and older patients. The main challenges in the long-term management of CML patients are discussed in this review.

### Management and outcome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor era-analysis of the European LeukemiaNet blast phase registry [^112JcpMD]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has become a paradigm of successful targeted treatment for hematologic malignancies. Inhibition of the abnormal tyrosine kinase BCR::ABL1 has transformed this once deadly disease in a controllable entity, with most patients having a normal life expectancy and with some patients being able to successfully stop treatment after having achieved a deep molecular response. Despite the success of CML treatment, progression to blast phase (BP), an aggressive form of acute leukemia associated with unfavorable prognosis, may occur. Prior to the introduction of TKI virtually all patients who did not undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) progressed to BP, with a mortality rate of more than 20% per year in the majority of studies. The implementation of TKI into CML management has dramatically changed this scenario, and nowadays less than 5% of patients develop BP disease. Nevertheless, in contrast to major advances in chronic phase (CP) CML, outcome is still dismal for this important minority of patients. BP can be of myeloid, lymphoid, mixed, or megakaryoblastic phenotype, can evolve from a previous CML, but can also be the disease presentation at diagnosis, the so-called de novo BP. Treatment of BP with TKI monotherapy often leads to short-term remissions, with inevitably almost all patients experiencing a disease relapse if alloSCT is not performed. Due to the rarity of this condition and the lacking of clinical trials most of the available recommendations are based on retrospective analyses and expert consensus. Further, the definition of BP is not homogeneous. The ELN recommendation panel considers a BP when the proportion of blasts in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow is ≥ 30%. Conversely, the WHO define a BP already with a percentage of blasts ≥ 20%. Although the prognosis of patients with 20–29% blasts seems to be similar to the one of patients with ≥ 30% of blasts, definitions should be harmonized, in order to have uniform inclusion criteria into clinical trials and registries. The biology of BP also poses an additional challenge. Although some features of BP are well characterized, it remains unclear how the biology of the disease might have changed after the introduction of TKI. To address these open issues, and to set the basis for the set-up of future clinical trials, an international registry was established with the aim of collecting biological and clinical data on CML in BP to better understand disease characteristics and treatment approaches in the TKI era.

### 2025 European LeukemiaNet recommendations for the management of chronic myeloid leukemia [^114WTNZ7]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and other national and international groups have agreed on common definitions and standards for cooperative research, and guided management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) worldwide for almost three decades (NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025: chronic myeloid leukemia). Hitherto the emphasis has been on preventing progression to the blast phase (BP) and prolonging survival, a strategy that has de facto led to some patients having sufficiently deep molecular responses to trial discontinuation of treatment. While maximizing the number of patients who may achieve treatment free remission (TFR) is a laudable goal, we also recognize that many patients will remain on life-long medication and for them, optimizing both their response and their quality of life is paramount. In this, the 5th iteration of the ELN recommendations for management of CML, we will highlight new information that directly affects patient care and move towards even more personalized treatment. Our recommendations are for adults only; guidelines for the management of pediatric patients have been published recently.

Our intention is not to repeat in detail previously available information and recommendations that are largely unchanged. Instead we will focus on the results and interpretation of new evidence-based data that are ready to be incorporated into patient care. References will be largely limited to those published since March 2020.

### Is there really an accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia at presentation? [^113HJ9GP]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is considerable recent controversy whether CML is a bi- or tri-phasic disease; chronic (CP) and blast phase (BP) with or without an intermediate accelerated phase (AP). From a biological perspective chronic phase CML is best considered a leukaemia but not a cancer lacking unregulated proliferation. CP cells differentiate normally and respond to normal physiological stimuli. CP bone marrow CD34-positive cells do not form colonies granulocyte/macrophage colonies in vitro without appropriate stimuli (like normal CD34-positive cells and they cannot easily reconstitute immune compromised mice). In untreated CP CML the concentration of blood granulocytes reaches an apogee without further increase. It is estimated the abnormal granulocyte mass can be explained by as few as 2–4 extra late cell divisions. In gene expression profiling (GEP) the pattern of expression suggests 2 phases rather than 3 phases.

### Is there really an accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia at presentation? [^112Hos5a]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinically, CML was initially divided into 2 phases: CP versus terminal, blast or not chronic phases. The suggestion of an AP was based on identifying co-variates associated with an increased risk of transforming to BP. These co-variates differ between different AP classifications. Moreover, in the context of tyrosine kinase-inhibitor (TKI)-therapy this increased transformation risk is modest. Also, people classified as presenting in AP receive the same TKI-therapy as those presenting in CP. Based on these considerations AP was removed from the World Health Organization (WHO) 2022 CML classification. However the 2020 European Leukaemia Net (ELN) recommendations, 2022 International Consensus Classification (ICC) and 2024 National Comprehensive Cancer Guidelines retain AP phase CML.

We interrogated data from 2122 subjects with CML presenting in CP (n = 1837) or AP (n = 285) using definitions in the ELN 2020 criteria and 2053 subjects presenting in CP (n = 1748) or AP (n = 305) using the 2022 ICC criteria. We found most subjects classified as AP had outcomes like those of subjects in CP defined as intermediate- or high-risk in the European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) Long-Term Survival (ELTS) risk score. About 25 percent, those with increased blasts only or with decreased platelets had worse transformation-free survival (TFS) or survival but not both. However, these worse outcomes were only in subjects failing to meet the 2020 ELN TKI-therapy-response criteria. Proportions of CP and AP subjects meeting the 2020 ELN TKI-response milestones were similar. These data indicate co-variates used to identify AP do not identify a distinct phase but are predictors of the likelihood of response to TKI-therapy. Our conclusions support the 2022 WHO CML classification removing AP. We conclude CML should be divided into CP and terminal, acute or not chronic phases without an intermediate AP.

### Clonal evolution in chronic myelogenous leukemia [^116my94Q]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Clonal evolution (CE) may be a marker of disease progression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is thought to reflect the genetic instability of the highly proliferative CML progenitors. The frequency of CE increases with advancing stage, rising from 30%in accelerated phase and up to 80% in blast crisis. Given its association with disease progression, CE is considered a feature that defines accelerated-phase CML; however, not all studies have demonstrated a uniformly poor outcome for patients with CE. Chromosomal abnormalities in Ph chromosome negative metaphases increasingly have been recognized in patients treated with imatinib. The true incidence of this phenomenon is not clear but appears to occur in 2% to 17% of imatinib-treated patients. Regardless of the precise mechanism and the long-term clinical implications, the findings described in this article underscore the importance of routine cytogenetic analysis for patients treated with imatinib. The continued study of these phenomena will help us to understand better the pathogenesis of CML and improve the long-term treatment of patients with CML.

### How I treat newly diagnosed chronic phase CML [^111x84UD]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The progress made in the understanding of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) since the recognition of a common chromosomal abnormality to the introduction of ever more effective tyrosine kinase inhibitors is unprecedented in cancer. The expected survival for patients diagnosed with CML today, if properly managed, is probably similar to that of the general population. When managing patients with CML the goal is to achieve the best long-term outcome and we should base the treatment decisions on the data available. The results from cytogenetic and molecular analyses have to be interpreted judiciously and all available treatment options integrated into the treatment plan properly. The availability of several treatment options in CML is an asset, but the temptation of rapid succession of treatment changes because of perceived suboptimal response or for adverse events that could be managed needs to be avoided. Any decision to change therapy needs to weigh the expected long-term outcome with the current option versus the true expectations with any new option, particularly as it relates to irreversible outcomes, such as transformation to blast phase and death. In this manuscript, we discuss the treatment approach that has helped us manage successfully a large CML population.

### Treatment of blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia: a rare and challenging entity [^114Gyyjp]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the success of BCR-ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib in chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), patients with blast phase (BP)-CML continue to have a dismal outcome with median survival of less than one year from diagnosis. Thus BP-CML remains a critical unmet clinical need in the management of CML. Our understanding of the biology of BP-CML continues to grow; genomic instability leads to acquisition of mutations which drive leukaemic progenitor cells to develop self-renewal properties, resulting in differentiation block and a poor-prognosis acute leukaemia which may be myeloid, lymphoid or bi-phenotypic. Similar advances in therapy are urgently needed to improve patient outcomes; however, this is challenging given the rarity and heterogeneity of BP-CML, leading to difficulty in designing and recruiting to prospective clinical trials. This review will explore the treatment of BP-CML, evaluating the data for TKI therapy alone, combinations with intensive chemotherapy, the role of allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, the use of novel agents and clinical trials, as well as discussing the most appropriate methods for diagnosing BP and assessing response to therapy, and factors predicting outcome.

Summary

Despite the success of BCR‐ABL‐specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib in chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), patients with blast phase (BP)‐CML continue to have a dismal outcome with median survival of less than one year from diagnosis. Thus BP‐CML remains a critical unmet clinical need in the management of CML. Our understanding of the biology of BP‐CML continues to grow; genomic instability leads to acquisition of mutations which drive leukaemic progenitor cells to develop self‐renewal properties, resulting in differentiation block and a poor‐prognosis acute leukaemia which may be myeloid, lymphoid or bi‐phenotypic. Similar advances in therapy are urgently needed to improve patient outcomes; however, this is challenging given the rarity and heterogeneity of BP‐CML, leading to difficulty in designing and recruiting to prospective clinical trials. This review will explore the treatment of BP‐CML, evaluating the data for TKI therapy alone, combinations with intensive chemotherapy, the role of allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, the use of novel agents and clinical trials, as well as discussing the most appropriate methods for diagnosing BP and assessing response to therapy, and factors predicting outcome.

### Management of children and adolescents with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase: international pediatric CML expert panel recommendations [^114jmyri]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia has improved significantly with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and treatment guidelines based on numerous clinical trials are available for chronic phase disease. However for CML in the blast phase (CML-BP), prognosis remains poor and treatment options are much more limited. The spectrum of treatment strategies for children and adolescents with CML-BP has largely evolved empirically and includes treatment principles derived from adult CML-BP and pediatric acute leukemia. Given this heterogeneity of treatment approaches, we formed an international panel of pediatric CML experts to develop recommendations for consistent therapy in children and adolescents with this high-risk disease based on the current literature and national standards. Recommendations include detailed information on initial diagnosis and treatment monitoring, differentiation from Philadelphia-positive acute leukemia, subtype-specific selection of induction therapy, and combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Given that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation currently remains the primary curative intervention for CML-BP, we also provide recommendations for the timing of transplantation, donor and graft selection, selection of a conditioning regimen and prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease, post-transplant TKI therapy, and management of molecular relapse. Management according to the treatment recommendations presented here is intended to provide the basis for the design of future prospective clinical trials to improve outcomes for this challenging disease.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) disease phases and natural history: CML occurs in three different phases (chronic, accelerated, and blast phase) and is usually diagnosed in the chronic phase in developed countries, and untreated chronic phase CML (CP-CML) will eventually progress to accelerated phase CML (AP-CML) or blast phase CML (BP-CML) in 3 to 5 years on average. Gene expression profiling has shown a close correlation of gene expression between AP-CML and BP-CML, and activation of the beta-catenin signaling pathway in CML granulocyte-macrophage progenitors may be a key pathobiologic event in the evolution to BP-CML.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1118Nxm2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is defined by the presence of Philadelphia chromosome resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t9;22] that gives rise to a BCR::ABL1 fusion gene. CML occurs in 3 different phases (chronic, accelerated, and blast phase) and is usually diagnosed in the chronic phase in developed countries. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is a highly effective treatment option for patients with chronic phase-CML. The primary goal of TKI therapy in patients with chronic phase-CML is to prevent disease progression to accelerated phase-CML or blast phase-CML. Discontinuation of TKI therapy with careful monitoring is feasible in selected patients. This manuscript discusses the recommendations outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with chronic phase-CML.

### Accelerated-phase CML: de novo and transformed [^112h4oZq]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the dramatic improvements in outcomes for the majority of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients over the past 2 decades, a similar improvement has not been observed in the more advanced stages of the disease. Blast phase CML (BP-CML), although infrequent, remains poorly understood and inadequately treated. Consequently, the key initial goal of therapy in a newly diagnosed patient with chronic phase CML continues to be prevention of disease progression. Advances in genomic investigation in CML, specifically related to BP-CML, clearly demonstrate we have only scratched the surface in our understanding of the disease biology, a prerequisite to devising more targeted and effective therapeutic approaches to prevention and treatment. Importantly, the introduction of the concept of "CML-like" acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has the potential to simplify the differentiation between BCR::ABL1-positive ALL from de novo lymphoid BP-CML, optimizing monitoring and therapeutics. The development of novel treatment strategies such as the MATCHPOINT approach for BP-CML, utilizing combination chemotherapy with fludarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin in addition to dose-modified ponatinib, may also be an important step in improving treatment outcomes. However, identifying patients who are high risk of transformation remains a challenge, and the recent 2022 updates to the international guidelines may add further confusion to this area. Further work is required to clarify the identification and treatment strategy for the patients who require a more aggressive approach than standard chronic phase CML management.

### Discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia: when and for whom? [^116QDfTA]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has led to remarkable improvement in the overall survival of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), until recently these drugs were not considered curative as patients needed to be treated indefinitely. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was considered to be the only curative therapy for patients with CML. Over the last decade, several studies have demonstrated that a proportion of patients may be able to stop TKI therapy without relapse, potentially rendering them cured of their disease. After discontinuing TKI therapy, the levels of BCR-ABL1 in the peripheral blood should be monitored closely by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), especially in the first year, and monitoring should continue indefinitely. This approach has been safe, with essentially all patients with a molecular relapse responding to re-initiation of TKI therapy and only a few case reports of disease progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis among thousands of patients discontinuing therapy. This rare phenomenon of sudden transformation to accelerated phase or blast crisis has also been reported in responding patients who remain on TKI. With discontinuation, approximately 50% of patients will stay in remission and will not need to restart therapy.

This goal of being off drug therapy, also known as treatment-free remission (TFR), is emerging as the new aim of CML therapy. TFR has several benefits for patients, including improved quality of life, reduced cost to patients and society and decreased risk of long-term complications. Our aim in this article is to review the results of trials on stopping TKI in patients with CML and to discuss some clinical and biological questions raised by the observations.

### Is there really an accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia? [^115w9F6A]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

Biologically, we think chronic phase CML is best considered a preleukaemia rather than a leukaemia. We suggest this because chronic phase cells differentiate normally, respond to normal physiological regulatory signals regulatory signals such as granulocyte- and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factors (G- and G/M-CSFs), function mostly normally, have normal or near normal lifespans and undergo normal terminal differentiation. There are simply too many of them. There is no convincing evidence of uncontrolled proliferation in chronic phase CML. For example, the cells do not form myeloid colonies spontaneously in vitro and mostly function normally in vivo. In persons with chronic phase CML blood granulocyte concentration increases appropriately in infections and in rare persons with cyclical neutropenia and chronic phase CML the blood granulocyte concentration cycles like persons with cyclical neutropenia without CML. Lastly, in untreated chronic phase CML the blood granulocyte concentration usually reaches an stable apogee. Moreover, the gene expression profile (GEP) of chronic phase CML cells resembles normal CD34-postive cells. The increased granulocyte mass in chronic phase CML is explainable by as few as 2–4 extra late-stage cell divisions.

Clinically, CML was initially divided into chronic and terminal or blast phases. Many of these people were in what is termed blast phase and had brief survivals. The proposition of an intermediate accelerated phase was based on identifying co-variates at diagnosis or during the disease course associated with an increased risk of transforming to blast phase. These co-variates were identified before the era of TKI-therapy and differ between classifications. However, accelerated phase was removed from the 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of CML because with TKI-therapy few people with chronic phase CML transform to blast phase.

In an analysis of > 2000 people with CML in either chronic or accelerated phases at diagnosis based on the 2020 ELN and 2022 ICC criteria we found most subjects classified as accelerated phase had outcomes like persons in chronic phase identified as intermediate- or high-risk cohorts classified by the European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) Long-Term Survival score (ELTS) risk classification. The other 20 percent had some worse outcomes but only if they failed to meet the 2020 ELN TKI-therapy-response milestones. A recent study reported failing to meet these milestones before 1-year has little impact on survival. Noteworthily, even if someone is designated to be in accelerated phase they receive the same TKI-therapy a someone in chronic phase.

### Onset of blast crisis in chronic myeloid leukemia patients in treatment-free remission [^113ix6rD]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2.
Patient characteristics at onset of blast crisis.

BC currently is an exceptional event during the course of CML with 0.7–4.5% of CP-CML patients on IM front-line treatment progressing to BC3 especially during early years. These progressions occur in patients with secondary resistance or suboptimal response or failure to TKI, and are myeloid in 75%, or lymphoid in 25% of the cases. The prognosis of BC remains poor, despite intensification procedures. According to the large number of patients enrolled, France is currently a pioneer in TFR clinical studies (≥ 600 patients). Based on these studies we estimate the risk of BC in TFR as being very low, below 0.1%. Until now, only two cases have been reported. We hereby report six cases occurring after 41 (range, 6–124) months median sustained MR4.5 prior to cessation and for four of these six cases after a median of 40 months of cessation, while the two remaining patients went into BC following TKI resumption after 6 and 11 months of TFR. Interestingly, four of six BC were lymphoid which is not the current pattern of BC seen in TKI first-line treatment (75% myeloid,), and all of the cases with one exception (patient 5) occurred suddenly as seen in BC cases observed in patients in cytogenetic response on imatinib or IFN-α, and in Al Fayez et al. in TFR. The same clone as identified by identical ASXL-1 mutation (patient 6) or a derived sub-clone identified by identical ASXL-2 and EP300 mutations, with clonal evolution (patient 5) were detected again at BC. This suggests that stem cells, had survived the various TKI challenges and although undetectable, had remained unstable and capable of promoting disease transformation. Clearly, the malignant cells or an aggressive subfraction of them had not been eradicated. In addition, these two patients harbored a myeloid phenotype. ABL-1 mutations may be observed in up to 80% of BC cases and while occurring in late-CP patients, are associated with a greater likelihood of progression. Other mutations or CNV are historically known to be associated with progression, particularly genes involved in myeloid (~25% TP53 mutated or deleted) or lymphoid phenotypes (50% p16 deleted). Recently, other genes have been identified as being involved at CP diagnosis as well as at BC diagnosis, such as RUNX-1, IKZF1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, SETBP1, WT1, TET2, IDH1, NRAS, KRAS, CBL. In this article, mutation(s) and/or CNV were identified in all the BC patients, which is a common finding, however, in two of six patients some mutations/deletions in two genes, EP300 (patients 3 [LBC] and 5 [MBC]) and SETD2 genes (patients 1 and 4, [both LBC] were found to have recurred. These two genes are involved in epigenetic regulations and are rarely reported in de novo lymphoblastic B-ALL (~3.86–10% of cases,) or in CML-BC (< 5%). Whether or not these represent BC-TFR-related markers requires further investigation. Complex copy number alterations were found in two of six patients, comparable to that of Ochi et al.TKI probably exert sustained therapeutic pressure on residual leukemia stem cells and progeny, thus preventing overt genetic instability for being induced in BCR::ABL1 + stem cells.

Treatment of advanced-phase CML

Progression of CML to end-phase has fortunately become a rare event. End-phase CML comprises early progression with emerging high-risk ACA and late progression with failing hematopoiesis and blast cell proliferation. BP is a late feature of progression. Currently, diagnosis rests on the percentage of blasts (20% or 30%) in blood or marrow. Not all patients dying of CML reach the BP-defining blast levels. Once BP has occurred, survival is generally < 1 year with death due to infection or bleeding.

Early indicators of progression are the appearance of ACA, somatic mutations, and occasionally clinical deterioration without obvious explanation. Flow cytometry distinguishes between lymphoid and myeloid BP allowing appropriate selection of treatment. Lymphoid BP has more treatment options and a better outcome than myeloid BP.

After KD-mutation analysis, treatment consists of intensive combination chemotherapy with or without a TKI in preparation for a prompt allo-SCT if possible (Table 6). In patients with resistance to a 2GTKI without specific mutations ponatinib is preferred over change of 2GTKI, unless cardiovascular risk factors are present. In patients who cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy regimens, a more palliative approach with less intensive therapy according to immunophenotype should be considered.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia: a review [^116di76R]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic myeloid leukemia:

- **Definition**: CML is a malignant clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells resulting in unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow.
- **Pathophysiology**: CML is caused by a chromosomal abnormality termed as Philadelphia chromosome, which results from the presence of BCR-ABL oncogene.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include fatigue, weight loss, abdominal fullness, bleeding, purpura, splenomegaly, leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytosis. Disease progression may lead to bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, severe anemia, infections, lymphadenopathy, CNS disease, and increased risk of death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CML is associated with a mortality crude rate of 0.78.

### The biology of CML blast crisis [^1149rP2n]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) evolves from a chronic phase characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome as the sole genetic abnormality into blast crisis, which is often associated with additional chromosomal and molecular secondary changes. Although the pathogenic effects of most CML blast crisis secondary changes are still poorly understood, ample evidence suggests that the phenotype of CML blast crisis cells (enhanced proliferation and survival, differentiation arrest) depends on cooperation of BCR/ABL with genes dysregulated during disease progression. Most genetic abnormalities of CML blast crisis have a direct or indirect effect on p53 or Rb (or both) gene activity, which are primarily required for cell proliferation and survival, but not differentiation. Thus, the differentiation arrest of CML blast crisis cells is a secondary consequence of these abnormalities or is caused by dysregulation of differentiation-regulatory genes (ie, C/EBPalpha). Validation of the critical role of certain secondary changes (ie, loss of p53 or C/EBPalpha function) in murine models of CML blast crisis and in in vitro assays of BCR/ABL transformation of human hematopoietic progenitors might lead to the development of novel therapies based on targeting BCR/ABL and inhibiting or restoring the gene activity gained or lost during disease progression (ie, p53 or C/EBPalpha).

### Is there really an accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia? [^114NDT8y]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

These data imply the co-variates defining accelerated phase are predominately correlated with late response to TKI-therapy rather than a distinct phase of CML. In other cancers, including the acute and chronic leukaemias, we do not create a new disease phase based on adverse predictive or prognostic co-variates at diagnosis or evolving under therapy. Why should we in CML? When these co-variates emerge in someone originally in chronic phase we suggest they are simply no longer in chronic phase. An example is acquisition high-risk additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Interestingly, 48 years ago Sakurai and colleagues reported similar additional cytogenetic abnormalities in 1 or a few CML cells at diagnosis when large numbers of metaphases were analyzed. This is, of course, not surprising given the estimated latency of chronic phase CML from acquiring BCR::ABL1 to diagnosis is about 10 years based on data from the A-bomb survivors. The implication is a person has the genetic abnormality which causes CML years before the diagnosis with considerable time to develop additional cytogenetic abnormalities currently associated with accelerated phase. Lastly, GEP data suggest only 2 phases of CML. Based on these biological and clinical considerations and data we suggest eliminating accelerated phase as was done in the 2022 WHO classification is appropriate.

Having eliminated accelerated phase the last issue is what to call the non-chronic phase of CML when it transitions from being a preleukaemia to a leukaemia? The original terms were terminal and blast phases. Acute and advanced phases were added later. Blast, leukaemia and acute phases are inaccurate descriptors as some people in this phase lack increased blasts or have only decreased platelets or increased basophils. Terminal, acute, advanced and not chronic phases are more accurate.

In summary, based on the biological and clinical considerations and data we cite we suggest CML has 2 phases, chronic and terminal, advanced or non-chronic phases. We favour advanced which gives latitude of interpretation. Regardless of which term is used we need consensus. Lastly, the data we cite support the 2022 WHO classification of CML eliminating accelerated as a phase of CML.

### Blast and accelerated phase CML: room for improvement [^11335kJD]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). With TKI therapy, the percentage of patients who progress to accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) CML has decreased from more than 20% to 1% to 1.5% per year. Although AP- and BP-CML occur in a minority of patients, outcomes in these patients are significantly worse compared with chronic phase CML, with decreased response rates and duration of response to TKI. Despite this, TKIs have improved outcomes in advanced phase CML, particularly in de novo AP patients, but are often inadequate for lasting remissions. The goal of initial therapy in advanced CML is a return to a chronic phase followed by consideration for bone marrow transplantation. The addition of induction chemotherapy with TKI is often necessary for achievement of a second chronic phase. Given the small population of patients with advanced CML, development of novel treatment strategies and investigational agents is challenging, although clinical trial participation is encouraged in AP and BP patients, whenever possible. We review the overall management approach to advanced CML, including TKI selection, combination therapy, consideration of transplant, and novel agents.

EFFICACY

Chronic myeloid leukaemia

CML is a disorder of the haematopoietic stem cell consistently associated with the BCR-ABL fusion gene. It is characterised by the proliferation of the myeloid series, although lymphoid cells may also arise from the malignant clone. Three phases of the disease are recognised. In the chronic phase, there is indolent leukocytosis with infiltration of the liver and spleen. In the accelerated phase, there may also be acquisition of additional cytogenetic abnormalities and an increase in the proportion of immature cells in the blood or marrow. In blast crisis, which may be of lymphoid or myeloid lineage, the clinical picture resembles de novo acute leukaemia and carries a very poor prognosis.

Imatinib in newly diagnosed chronic phase

Prior to the introduction of imatinib, the accepted standard therapy for newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase was interferon α and cytarabine. A recently published study randomised 1106 patients to interferon–cytarabine combination therapy or imatinib at a dose of 400 mg daily. With a median follow-up of 19 months, no difference in the overall survival could be demonstrated. However, crossover to imatinib therapy occurred in 318 out of 553 patients (58%) in the interferon–cytarabine group, largely due to intolerance of interferon-related side effects. The rates of complete haematologic response (CHR) (95 vs 56%), complete cytogenetic response (CCR: 76 vs 15%) and freedom from progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis (97 vs 92%), all showed a statistically significant improvement in the imatinib group.

Imatinib in chronic phase after interferon failure

Patients with prior exposure to interferon are mostly in the late chronic phase (⩾12 months from diagnosis). Of 454 late chronic phase patients started on imatinib at 400 mg daily, 95% achieved CHR and 41% CCR with freedom from progression in 89% at 18 months. These results for imatinib therapy are inferior to those observed in patients treated at diagnosis.

Two studies have looked at dose escalation in order to improve the response rates in this group. With imatinib treatment at 800 mg daily in interferon-failed chronic phase, CHR was achieved in 100% and major cytogenetic response (MCR) in 90%. After 3 months, dose reduction due to toxicity had occurred in 42%, with the most common grade III–IV toxicities being haematological. Among patients started on imatinib 400 mg daily, dose escalation was an effective salvage therapy for refractoriness or relapse, but the overall results with this strategy were inferior to those reported with treatment initiated at a higher dose.

### Integrating genetic and epigenetic factors in chronic myeloid leukemia risk assessment: toward gene expression-based biomarkers [^111a5sqA]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Cancer treatment is constantly evolving from a one-size-fits-all towards bespoke approaches for each patient. In certain solid cancers, including breast and lung, tumor genome profiling has been incorporated into therapeutic decision-making. For chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), while tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is the standard treatment, current clinical scoring systems cannot accurately predict the heterogeneous treatment outcomes observed in patients. Biomarkers capable of segregating patients according to outcome at diagnosis are needed to improve management, and facilitate enrollment in clinical trials seeking to prevent blast crisis transformation and improve the depth of molecular responses. To this end, gene expression (GE) profiling studies have evaluated whether GE signatures at diagnosis are clinically informative. Patient material from a variety of sources has been profiled using microarrays, RNA sequencing and, more recently, single-cell RNA sequencing. However, differences in the cell types profiled, the technologies used, and the inherent complexities associated with the interpretation of genomic data pose challenges in distilling GE datasets into biomarkers with clinical utility. The goal of this paper is to review previous studies evaluating GE profiling in CML, and explore their potential as risk assessment tools for individualized CML treatment. We also review the contribution that acquired mutations, including those seen in clonal hematopoiesis, make to GE profiles, and how a model integrating contributions of genetic and epigenetic factors in resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and blast crisis transformation can define a route to GE-based biomarkers. Finally, we outline a four-stage approach for the development of GE-based biomarkers in CML.

### Novel drug candidates for blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia from high-throughput drug sensitivity and resistance testing [^1123X8et]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (CML BC) remains a challenging disease to treat despite the introduction and advances in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. In this study we set out to identify novel candidate drugs for CML BC by using an unbiased high-throughput drug testing platform. We used three CML cell lines representing different types of CML blast phases (K562, EM-2 and MOLM-1) and primary leukemic cells from three CML BC patients. Profiling of drug responses was performed with a drug sensitivity and resistance testing platform comprising 295 anticancer agents. Overall, drug sensitivity scores and the drug response profiles of cell line and primary cell samples correlated well and were distinct from other types of leukemia samples. The cell lines were highly sensitive to TKIs and the clinically TKI-resistant patient samples were also resistant ex vivo. Comparison of cell line and patient sample data identified new candidate drugs for CML BC, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitors. Our results indicate that these drugs in particular warrant further evaluation by analyzing a larger set of primary patient samples. The results also pave way for designing rational combination therapies.

Recommendations

Diagnosis of CML-BP and patients at risk for progression

Accurate diagnosis of suspected CML-BP is critical for further therapeutic steps. The definitions of CML-BP are not consistent across international committees. The European LeukemiaNet defines CML-BP as 30% or more blast cells in blood or bone marrow and/or the demonstration of extramedullary blastic infiltrates with the exception of the liver and spleen. The World Health Organization and recent International Consensus Classification (ICC) classification sets the threshold value for blasts at 20%. Furthermore, in the current WHO classification, CML-AP is no longer a diagnostic category and growing importance is given to patients at risk for progression based on somatic mutations, TKI resistant BCR::ABL1 mutations and/or additional chromosomal aberrations (ACAs). It is also emphasized that the detection of lymphoblasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow, even in the range below 10%, is generally considered consistent with the diagnosis of blast phase. The ICC similarly states that increasing numbers of lymphoblasts (> 5%) in peripheral blood or bone marrow may indicate impending lymphoid BP and should prompt further investigations. A comparison of the World Health Organization classification system with the 20% cut-off used in the imatinib trials showed that the response rate was significantly better in adult patients with 20–29% blasts than those with 30% or more. Current pediatric guidelines recommend classification according to ELN criteria. However, the above-mentioned additional genetic features should also be included in pediatric CML for improved diagnostics.

### Is there really an accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia at presentation? [^111MzubD]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Whether there is really a distinct accelerated phase (AP) at diagnosis in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in the context of tyrosine kinase-inhibitor (TKI)-therapy is controversial. We studied 2122 consecutive subjects in chronic phase (CP, n = 1837) or AP (n = 285) at diagnosis classified according to the 2020 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification. AP subjects with increased basophils only had similar transformation-free survival (TFS) and survival compared with CP subjects classified as ELTS intermediate-risk. Those with increased blasts only had worse TFS but similar survival compared with CP subjects classified as ELTS high-risk. AP subjects with decreased platelets only had similar TFS but worse survival compared with subjects classified as ELTS high-risk. Proportions of CP and AP subjects meeting the 2020 ELN TKI-response milestones were similar. However, worse TFS at 3-month and survival at 6- or 12-month were only in AP subjects failing to meet ELN milestones. Findings were similar using the 2022 International Consensus Classification (ICC) criteria for AP replacing decreased platelets with additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Our data support the 2022 WHO classification of CML eliminating AP. We suggest adding a very high-risk cohort to the ELTS score including people with increased blasts or decreased platelets and dividing CML into 2 phases at diagnosis: CP and acute or blast phases.

### A multicellular basis for the origination of blast crisis in chronic myeloid leukemia [^117Tajn4]. Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by a specific chromosome translocation, and its pathobiology is considered comparatively well understood. Thus, quantitative analysis of CML and its progression to blast crisis may help elucidate general mechanisms of carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Hitherto, it has been widely postulated that CML blast crisis originates mainly via cell-autonomous mechanisms such as secondary mutations or genomic instability. However, recent results suggest that carcinogenic transformation may be an inherently multicellular event, in departure from the classic unicellular paradigm. We investigate this possibility in the case of blast crisis origination in CML. A quantitative, mechanistic cell population dynamics model was employed. This model used recent data on imatinib-treated CML; it also used earlier clinical data, not previously incorporated into current mathematical CML/imatinib models. With the pre-imatinib data, which include results on many more blast crises, we obtained evidence that the driving mechanism for blast crisis origination is a cooperation between specific cell types. Assuming leukemic-normal interactions resulted in a statistically significant improvement over assuming either cell-autonomous mechanisms or interactions between leukemic cells. This conclusion was robust with regard to changes in the model's adjustable parameters. Application of the results to patients treated with imatinib suggests that imatinib may act not only on malignant blast precursors, but also, to a limited degree, on the malignant blasts themselves.

### The role of aberrant transcription factor in the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia [^117RrYie]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disease with distinct biological and clinical features. The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and BCR/ABL fusion gene is the major cytogenetic and molecular marker of CML chronic phase. However, the molecular mechanisms of disease progression are not well known. Recent studies have shown that a several of transcription factors such as AML1, C/EBPalpha, HOX and GATA family play important role in hematopoiesis. In addition, the aberrations of these transcription factors including mutations or translocations have also been found to contribute the disease progression. Hence, BCR/ABL and aberrant transcription factors may result in the phenotype of CML blast crisis together.

### Update on current monitoring recommendations in chronic myeloid leukemia: practical points for clinical practice [^1169ZGvy]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Excellent therapeutic options exist for the treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Therefore, managing CML patients has become a more common practice for many physicians. Most chronic-phase CML patients achieve durable cytogenetic and molecular responses on first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. However, careful monitoring and assessment of adherence are essential for successful outcomes and to identify patients at risk for failing therapy. The European LeukemiaNet and National Comprehensive Cancer Network provide guidance and strategies for monitoring and managing patients treated with TKIs. These recommendations continue to evolve as approved treatment options expand to include second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. How measurements of response are defined and data supporting recent recommended changes to monitoring are reviewed here. These changes include increasing recognition of the importance of early response. The relevance of achieving deep molecular responses will also be addressed.

### Blast count and cytogenetics correlate and are useful parameters for the evaluation of different phases in chronic myeloid leukemia [^114JxmCY]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2005). Low credibility.

Staging of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) phases is based on cytomorphological criteria that vary considerably between different staging systems. Thus, staging of CML is heterogeneous and causes problems with respect to the comparison of therapeutical strategies and clinical outcome. We evaluated 59 patients with CML in different stages of the disease. In order to define which cytomorphological parameters correlate with cytogenetics we investigated cytomorphology and cytogenetics in parallel in all cases. As a result, bone marrow blast count demonstrated a highly significant correlation with the respective cytogenetic results of the patients and was clearly linked to the frequency and complexity of clonal evolution. We therefore propose to focus staging systems of CML on the correlation of the percentage of bone marrow blasts and the cytogenetic results.

### Pathogenesis and management of accelerated and blast phases of chronic myeloid leukemia [^113tsNHq]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

The treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been a model for cancer therapy development. Though most patients with CML have a normal quality and duration of life with TKI therapy, some patients progress to accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP), both of which have a relatively poor prognosis. The rates of progression have reduced significantly from over > 20% in the pre-TKI era to < 5% now, largely due to refinements in CML therapy and response monitoring. Significant insights have been gained into the mechanisms of disease transformation including the role of additional cytogenetic abnormalities, somatic mutations, and other genomic alterations present at diagnosis or evolving on therapy. This knowledge is helping to optimize TKI therapy, improve prognostication and inform the development of novel combination regimens in these patients. While patients with de novo CML-AP have outcomes almost similar to CML in chronic phase (CP), those transformed from previously treated CML-CP should receive second- or third- generation TKIs and be strongly considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Similarly, patients with transformed CML-BP have particularly dismal outcomes with a median survival usually less than one year. Combination regimens with a potent TKI such as ponatinib followed by allo-SCT can achieve long-term survival in some transformed BP patients. Regimens including venetoclax in myeloid BP or inotuzumab ozogamicin or blinatumomab in lymphoid BP might lead to deeper and longer responses, facilitating potentially curative allo-SCT for patients with CML-BP once CP is achieved. Newer agents and novel combination therapies are further expanding the therapeutic arsenal in advanced phase CML.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells [^114pspEQ]. Leukemia (2019). Medium credibility.

Some persons appear to have a transition phase between chronic and acute phases termed as accelerated phase. Because of these diverse, arbitrarily defined, but not biologically based definitions of the accelerated phase, we consider CML a fundamentally biphasic disease. This is not a new concept. Many of the original CML chemotherapy trials done by CALGB divided the disease into chronic and non-chronic phases. There are many definitions of accelerated phase all of which are arbitrary, for example, defining accelerated phase by > 10% blood or bone marrow blasts, > 15% and > 20% blood basophils, platelets < 100 × 10E+9/L etc. means the same person can be in chronic phas e in one study and accelerated phase in another. Then, there is the obvious problem of someone saying that 19% blasts are in the chronic phase and the rest of them with 20% in the accelerated phase. There is no biological basis for such an arbitrary boundary. Adding to this, the daily variability of blast percent in someone with CML who could be in chronic phase one day, accelerated phase the next and back to chronic phase the next. And there is the problem of precision. Surveying 100–200 blood cells to determine percent blasts has reasonably wide confidence intervals, which can easily span any arbitrary boundary like 20%. Then we add to this inter-observer and intra-observer variability. The same arbitrariness applies to using additional cytogenetic abnormalities to define accelerated phase. Sandberg et al. reported that they could detect cytogenetic abnormalities used by some to define accelerated phase in many newly-diagnosed persons with CML when they surveyed 100 s of metaphases. These persons typically had clinical features of chronic phase and most remained in chronic phase for years, sometimes decades. This is not surprising given the long latency from the start of CML to its diagnosis (see below). Others reported some, but not all additional cytogenetic abnormalities used to define accelerated phase are not associated with an increased risk of dying from CML. Hehlmann and co-workers recently reported some additional chromosome abnormalities used to define accelerated phase do not correlate with an increased probability of death survival in persons with CML. The sum of these considerations supports the concept of CML as a bi-phasic disease.

### Single-cell transcriptomics uncovers distinct molecular signatures of stem cells in chronic myeloid leukemia [^1136yagG]. Nature Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics are ideally placed to unravel intratumoral heterogeneity and selective resistance of cancer stem cell (SC) subpopulations to molecularly targeted cancer therapies. However, current single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches lack the sensitivity required to reliably detect somatic mutations. We developed a method that combines high-sensitivity mutation detection with whole-transcriptome analysis of the same single cell. We applied this technique to analyze more than 2,000 SCs from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) throughout the disease course, revealing heterogeneity of CML-SCs, including the identification of a subgroup of CML-SCs with a distinct molecular signature that selectively persisted during prolonged therapy. Analysis of nonleukemic SCs from patients with CML also provided new insights into cell-extrinsic disruption of hematopoiesis in CML associated with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we used this single-cell approach to identify a blast-crisis-specific SC population, which was also present in a subclone of CML-SCs during the chronic phase in a patient who subsequently developed blast crisis. This approach, which might be broadly applied to any malignancy, illustrates how single-cell analysis can identify subpopulations of therapy-resistant SCs that are not apparent through cell-population analysis.

### Management of the advanced phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia in the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors [^115kyYKY]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2009). Low credibility.

Imatinib has revolutionised the management of chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Unfortunately it has had less of an impact on the management of the advanced phases of CML. These historically difficult-to-treat phases of disease remain largely resistant to therapy. Even when responses are obtained with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, they are brief, particularly in blast phase (BP) disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only curative option for these patients and should be considered early as an integral part of the treatment plan. But transplant outcomes are dependent on cytogenetic and gross disease burden at the time of transplant. This review will compare and contrast the various tyrosine kinase- and non-tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based treatments for accelerated and BP CML before allogeneic transplantation.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) and European LeukemiaNet (ELN) differ on the diagnostic criteria for BP‐CML, with the WHO citing 20% or more blasts and the ELN 30% or more blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. A study by Cortes et al.evaluated outcomes for BP‐CML patients according to both WHO and ELN criteria. Overall survival (OS) was significantly better in patients with 20%–29% blasts as compared to those with blasts at 30% or more with three‐year OS of 42% versus 10%, respectively. Within the recent MATCHPOINT clinical trial for UK patients with BP‐CML, the ELN definition of 30% or more blasts was used as an entry criterion. Extramedullary blast proliferation is also diagnostic of BP‐CML, regardless of disease phase in the bone marrow.

Where a diagnosis of BP‐CML is suspected, a bone marrow aspirate should be performed to evaluate morphology, immunophenotyping to confirm if myeloid, lymphoid or mixed phenotype, and full karyotype to identify any additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs). The ACAs which may be diagnostic of AP‐CML, e.g. extra Ph chromosome, isochromosome 17q, trisomy 8 or 19, may also be present at diagnosis of de novo BP‐CML or following progression from CP‐ or AP‐CML. Where the aspirate is a dry tap, a trephine should be performed, and where possible a portion of this sent for karyotyping. A BCR‐ABL1 kinase domain mutation should be performed at diagnosis of de novo BP or on progression to AP‐ or BP‐CML. Next‐generation sequencing (NGS) panel assessment to identify commonly mutated lymphoid or myeloid genes may also be considered, but remains an experimental approach in CML.

### Cancer treatment with kinase inhibitors: what have we learnt from imatinib? [^112XKa4W]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Imatinib in accelerated phase

The accelerated phase of CML typically follows several years of chronic phase and is associated with decreased response to therapy and a shortened median survival of less than 1 year. A multicentre study reporting on 181 patients treated with imatinib for accelerated phase CML suggests lower response rates and increased toxicity in comparison with the chronic phase. Patients were initially commenced on imatinib at 400 mg daily, but after efficacy and safety data became available, subsequent patients were treated with 600 mg daily. CHR was achieved in 53% and sustained for at least 1 month in 34%. CCR was achieved in 17%. With a median follow-up in excess of 10 months, there was a significant improvement in overall survival and freedom from progression for the higher dose group. Grade III–IV haematological toxicity occurred in 58% and severe nonhaematological toxicity was uncommon (< 5%).

Imatinib in blast crisis and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)

In blast crisis of CML and in de novo Ph+ ALL, BCR-ABL retains sensitivity to imatinib, but additional genetic abnormalities conferring drug resistance are common. In patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL or lymphoid blast crisis and in myeloid blast crisis, CHR was achieved in around 20%. Despite good haematological response, in most cases relapse occurred early with a median survival of only 20–30 weeks. Relapse is commonly associated with emergence of mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase.

Discriminating Ph + ALL from CML-BP lymphoid phenotype

Most children and adolescents with de novo CML-BP present with lymphoid blasts, leading to diagnostic uncertainty in discriminating that entity from Ph + ALL. Certain morphological criteria, such as increased numbers of basophils or eosinophils when patients present with less than 70% blast cells in bone marrow, could be indicative of CML-BP rather than Ph + ALL. Leukocytosis with left-shifted myeloid maturation might also point toward a diagnosis of CML-BP. Current studies have shown that pediatric patients with de novo CML-BP often present with high leukocyte counts at the time of diagnosis. The presence of the p210 BCR-ABL1 fusion protein is likewise suggestive but has also been observed in 10–20% of Ph + ALL cases. Other molecular markers, such as IZKF1 deletions, also occur in both entities and are not solely characteristic of Ph + ALL. In most cases, a valid distinction between the entities based on morphology, immunophenotyping, molecular genetics, and transcript type at the time of diagnosis is impossible. However, indicators to better discriminate them can emerge during therapy. Typical Ph + ALL affects the lymphoid lineage only; in CML-BP lymphoid phenotype, the BCR::ABL1 rearrangement is present in both the lymphoblastic and expanded myeloid cell clones. Therefore, at the end of an ALL induction in CML-BP, a discrepancy is often observed between low minimal residual disease (MRD) as assessed by immunoglobulin G heavy chain (IgH) or T cell receptor gene (TCR) rearrangement markers or flow cytometry (because of a preferential reduction in the lymphoid blast clone) and the still relatively high proportion of t(9;22) translocation–positive cells (of the still expanded BCR :: ABL1- positive hematopoiesis) in florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or transcript analysis. This discordant MRD dynamic is also described as a feature of the subset of Ph + ALL designated as CML-like disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of sorted cells does not yield reliable results because of the adverse balance between exponential amplification in PCR and the purity of the cell populations sorted from clinical samples. In principle, interphase FISH on neutrophils might expose the BCR::ABL1 rearrangement on cells of myeloid origin after a major blast reduction has occurred — for example, after two weeks of ALL-based induction treatment. The limitations of that method are a lack of universal availability of the test or the achievement of a remission that is already too deep to detect the BCR::ABL1 fusion by FISH. With respect to test availability, dried, unstained bone marrow smears stored frozen (−18 °C) can be wrapped in aluminum foil and sent to specialized laboratories. However, even with those extended diagnostic procedures (Table 3), a definitive distinction can remain elusive in some patients.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder that accounts for approximately 10% of new cases of leukemia. The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has led to a reduction in mortalities. Thus, the estimated prevalence of CML is increasing. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the European Leukemia Net guidelines incorporate frequent molecular monitoring of the fusion BCR-ABL transcript to ensure that patients reach and keep treatment milestones. Most patients with CML are diagnosed in the chronic phase, and approximately 10% to 30% of these patients will at some time in their course meet definition criteria of resistance to imatinib.

### An important oversight in the World Health Organization diagnostic classification: chronic myeloid leukemia with thefusion clone [^113XvgDi]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the presence of t(9;22)(q34; q11), resulting in the BCR::ABL fusion gene. CML typically advances through three phases: chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase, and blast phase (BP). Around 70% of cases display myeloid blasts, with 20–30% featuring lymphoid blasts during the transformation into BP. However, a less recognized subtype of CML involves the presence of the PML::RARA fusion clone. This subtype can manifest as de novo CML with a minor PML::RARA fusion clone, de novo CML accompanied by acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and CML transforming into promyelocytic blastic crisis (PBC). In this context, we present a case and the findings of a literature review, addressing various aspects such as diagnosis, clinical features, treatment, and survival specific to this unique subtype of CML. This study was approved by the Institutional Review and Ethics Board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University (IIT2024169 and IIT2014146).

A 58-year-old female patient with CML-CP was admitted to hospital in September 2018. Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of a t(9;22)(q34; q11.2) translocation in bone marrow cells. The International Scale percent ratio (IS%) of the p210 BCR::ABL fusion transcript was 31%. The patient was initially treated with 400 mg of imatinib daily. After 6 months, she achieved complete hematologic remission and complete cytogenetic remission. Unfortunately, the complete hematologic remission was lost 7 months into imatinib treatment, leading to a switch to dasatinib, and subsequently, another switch to nilotinib. At 10 months of treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the patient experienced a transformation of CML to PBC. Detailed descriptions of bone marrow morphology, karyotyping, quantification of fusion genes, next-generation gene sequencing, and ABL kinase mutations are provided in Figure 1A-E and Online Supplementary Table S1.

Diagnostic work-up

When CML is diagnosed, a bone marrow aspirate is required for morphology, since the proportion of blast cells and of basophils is important to distinguish CP from accelerated phase (AP) and blastic phase (BP), and for cytogenetics. A core biopsy may be done to evaluate the degree of fibrosis which has prognostic importance and may identify nests of blasts not evident in the aspirate. Cytogenetics should be performed by CBA of Giemsa-stained metaphases from bone marrow cells. A qualitative reverse transcriptase PCR on peripheral blood cells is mandatory to identify the type of BCR-ABL1 transcripts that can be appropriately followed when assessing response to TKI therapy. About 2–4% of patients harbor atypical BCR-ABL1 transcripts lacking ABL1 exon2 (e13a3 or e14a3) or resulting from atypical BCR breakpoints (e.g. e1a2, e6a2, e8a2, or e19a2) that may yield a false negative PCR using routine primer/probe sets in qualitative or quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR protocols. If not tested at diagnosis, a false impression may be given that a patient is in complete molecular response after TKI treatment. A quantitative PCR is not mandatory at diagnosis. If a molecular assay demonstrates BCR-ABL1, but the Ph-chromosome cannot be identified by cytogenetics, a FISH test is required. The diagnostic work-up is completed by a physical examination with particular reference to spleen and liver size, a standard biochemical profile including hepatitis B serology, cholesterol, lipase, and hemoglobin A1c values, and an electrocardiogram (Table 1).

Diagnostic work-up, baseline.

Performing other tests and diagnostic procedures depends on characteristics of the individual patient, medical history, and comorbidities.

The definitions of CP, AP, and BP are based on hematologic and clinical parameters and unchanged from previous published versions. However, resistance to two TKIs, detection of a BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD)-mutation, or emergence of additional chromosome abnormalities in Ph+ cells (ACA) raise concerns for progression of disease.

### Chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL1 + [^1144EjWL]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Session 1 of the 2007 Workshop of the Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology focused on chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL1+ (CML). CML is a myeloproliferative neoplasm arising at the level of a pluripotent stem cell and consistently associated with the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. CML most commonly manifests in a chronic phase of the disease with neutrophilic leukocytosis, and the demonstration of the Philadelphia chromosome is the ultimate confirmation of the diagnosis. However, in select cases, the initial diagnosis remains challenging, and a number of issues pertaining to the manifestations and disease evolution remain unresolved. These issues have been illustrated by the cases submitted to our workshop and include unusual manifestations of CML, including manifestation in the accelerated and/or blast phase, and patterns of disease progression and therapy resistance in the era of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

### Why is it critical to achieve a deep molecular response in chronic myeloid leukemia? [^1143fdxz]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

The most recent NCCN guidelines differ from previous versions in which a BCR-ABL1 value of ≤ 0.1% at 12 months indicated TKI-sensitive disease. The value is now ≤ 1% at 12 months and TKI-resistant disease is defined as > 1% at ≥ 15 months. However, the NCCN still recognizes the value of MMR at 12 months and a statement is included in the 2020 guidelines: " BCR-ABL1 0.1% at 12 months is associated with a very low probability of subsequent disease progression and a high likelihood of achieving a subsequent MR4.0, which may facilitate discontinuation of TKI therapy".

A recent analysis of the German CML-Study IV confirmed the optimal response time to achieve 1% BCRABL1 at about 12 to 15 months for progression-free survival, with progression being development of accelerated phase, blast crisis or death. The study also investigated when it is necessary to regard lack of MMR as treatment failure, indicating that a switch of therapy is warranted. The landmark time point of 2.5 years to achieve MMR showed the largest difference between those with or without MMR with regard to progression-free survival. A specific time to achieve DMR for progression-free survival was not detected. The updated ELN recommendations now state a change of treatment may be considered if MMR is not reached by 36–48 months.

### Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute myeloid leukemia: a rare aggressive leukemia with clinicopathologic features distinct from chronic myeloid leukemia in myeloid blast crisis [^111DrzdB]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

We performed a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of the morphologic features, immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and BCR-ABL transcript characterization of cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute myeloid leukemia (Ph+ AML). We compared these cases with cases of documented chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast crisis (CML-MBC). Patients with Ph+ AML were less likely to have splenomegaly or peripheral basophilia and had lower bone marrow cellularity and myeloid/erythroid ratios than patients with CML-MBC. Additional specific cytogenetic abnormalities that typically occur in CML-MBC were less common in Ph+ AML. Of 7 patients with Ph+ AML treated with imatinib mesylate, 6 showed at least a partial hematologic response, but the responses were of a short duration (median, 2.5 months). The median survival of patients with Ph+ AML was 9 months, similar to that of patients with CML-MBC (7 months). Ph+ AML is a rare aggressive acute leukemia with some features distinct from CML-MBC.

### Resistance and relapse with imatinib in CML: causes and consequences [^116ZgPX8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

The 60-month update of the Immediate Risk-Stratification Improves Survival (IRIS) study, a trial of standard-dose imatinib in patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, showed an 89% projected rate of overall survival. Although this is an enormous improvement over all previously available therapies, approximately 16% of patients experienced failed therapy with imatinib and 7% progressed to accelerated phase or blast crisis. Therefore, resistance continues to be a clinical problem. Exploiting the full potential of imatinib requires close attention to patient response to recognize suboptimal response and treatment failure as early as possible and to make timely adjustments to the therapeutic strategy. This article reviews the definitions and mechanisms of primary and acquired imatinib resistance. Particular emphasis is placed on point mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL as a mechanism of drug resistance, because they highlight important issues related to drug design and the biology of CML. Given the wealth of publications on the subject, including all information was not feasible and choices had to be made.

### Bcr-abl expression levels determine the rate of development of resistance to imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia [^113KjBMU]. Cancer Research (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) starts with the acquisition of a BCR-ABL fusion gene in a single hematopoietic stem cell, but the time to progression is unpredictable. Although the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is highly effective in the treatment of CML, its continuous administration is associated with development of resistance, particularly in advanced phase or blast crisis. We investigate here whether a feature of disease progression (i.e., elevated expression of Bcr-Abl in CD34+ progenitor cells from CML patients in blast crisis) has any bearing on the kinetics of resistance to imatinib. By studying cell lines that exogenously express Bcr-Abl over the range found from chronic phase to blast crisis of CML, we show that cells expressing high amounts of Bcr-Abl, as in blast crisis, are much less sensitive to imatinib and, more significantly, take a substantially shorter time for yielding a mutant subclone resistant to the inhibitor than cells with low expression levels, as in chronic phase. Our data suggest that the differential levels of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein expressed by CD34+ CML cells may reflect the extent and duration of their response to imatinib; the relatively high levels of oncoprotein in advanced-phase disease may underlie the observed rapid development of resistance.

### Impact of emerging ACA on survival in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [^113M6jZU]. Leukemia (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We write to expand on our prior publication in Leukemia (Hehlmann et al. High-risk additional chromosomal abnormalities at low blast counts herald death by CML. Leukemia 2020; 34: 2074–86).

Additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACA), in particular high-risk ACA, provide insights into end-phase and progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and predict survival regardless if they are present at diagnosis or emerge, more frequently, in the course of the disease. ACA which rise from around 10% in chronic phase to up to 90% in blast crisis may be the central mediators of progression.

Not all ACA predict survival equally, but evidence indicates that high-risk ACA do predict a poor prognosis. Currently, high-risk ACA comprise +8, +Ph, i[17q], +19, +17, and +21 (historically called major route because of their frequency in blast crisis of > 5%), complex aberrant karyotypes, −7/7q- and 3q26.2 and 11q23 abnormalities. The latter 3 were historically called minor route, because of their frequency in blast crisis of < 5%. All other ACA, for the time being, may be called low-risk ACA. There is evidence that also low-risk ACA have a negative impact on survival, though to a much lesser degree than high-risk ACA.

### Diagnostic and prognostic value of new biochemical and immunohistochemical parameters in chronic myeloid leukemia [^117MUqrv]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a stem-cell disease characterized by multilineage expansion of clonal BCR/ABL+ cells. Transformation from chronic into accelerated and blast phase of CML is usually associated with drug resistance and is accompanied by typical clinical and/or laboratory features, such as splenomegaly, increase in precursor cells, disturbed megakaryopoiesis, basophilia or marrow fibrosis. Because of new treatment options, early recognition of disease-acceleration is of importance. In this article, we review most recent developments in diagnostic procedures employing basophil-related biochemical and histopathological markers. These tests are useful to quantitate basophil-lineage cells in the peripheral blood in CML, to determine and quantify basophilia in the bone marrow, and to detect focal accumulations of blast cells and megakaryocytes as well as increased angiogenesis and fibrosis in bone marrow sections. Application of these markers may assist in determining the phase of disease and may help to better predict the prognosis in individual patients.

Myeloid Blast Crisis

260 patients with myeloid blast crisis were enrolled. These patients had greater than or equal to 30% blasts in PB or BM and/or extramedullary involvement other than spleen or liver; 95 (37%) had received prior chemotherapy for treatment of either accelerated phase or blast crisis ("pretreated patients") whereas 165 (63%) had not ("untreated patients"). The first 37 patients were started at 400 mg; the remaining 223 patients were started at 600 mg.

Effectiveness was evaluated primarily on the basis of rate of hematologic response, reported as either complete hematologic response, no evidence of leukemia, or return to chronic phase CML using the same criteria as for the study in accelerated phase. Cytogenetic responses were also assessed. Median duration of treatment was 4 months with 21% of patients treated for greater than or equal to 12 months and 10% for greater than or equal to 24 months (maximum = 35 months). Efficacy results are reported in Table 20. The hematologic response rate was higher in untreated patients than in treated patients (36% vs 22%, respectively) and in the group receiving an initial dose of 600 mg rather than 400 mg (33% vs 16%). The confirmed and unconfirmed major cytogenetic response rate was also higher for the 600-mg dose group than for the 400-mg dose group (17% vs 8%).

Discussion

Optimization of the management of CML in BP is still an unmet clinical need. Recently, an international consortium of experts on pediatric CML published treatment recommendations for the management of pediatric CML in BP. The effort of this consortium is the first attempt to provide recommendations for a consistent therapy in CML-BP. A similar consensus for adult patients is still lacking.

Importantly, in the adult population, even when large retrospective analyses are available, these are mostly monocentric, and thus accounting only partly for the heterogeneity across different countries.

Data reported here, not only come from a large international registry, but also only includes patients diagnosed with BP after 2015. This differs from previously published data sets that mainly include patients diagnosed until 2016, and provides a more realistic picture of current therapy strategies in Europe. Age, sex and phenotype distribution were in accordance with available literature data. For those patients diagnosed in CP, median time to development of BP was 10 months shorter than what has been reported by the MD Anderson group. A possible reason for this finding could be the above-mentioned different recruitment period. It could be speculated that better knowledge of the biology of CML and a wider availability of TKI in recent years prompted to quicker changes in therapy in patients with suboptimal response. This may have resulted in the selection of a higher risk population in our cohort, that progressed faster into CML-BP. An additional difference is that Jain et al. included patients with CML-BP defined according to the ELN criteria (30% blasts), whilst this registry included patients with CML-BP according to the WHO definition (≥ 20% blasts). In patients included in this registry, outcomes were dismal for both groups, strengthening the notion that CML-BP should be defined when the percentage of blasts is equal or greater than 20%.

Clinical trials in the TKI era have mostly utilized MDACC or IBMTR criteria, and the use of the International Consensus Classification (ICC) or the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for the diagnosis of AP-CML and BP-CML is not recommended.

### Disruption of IKAROS activity in primitive chronic-phase CML cells mimics myeloid disease progression [^1151PmY7]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Without effective therapy, chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) evolves into an acute leukemia (blast crisis [BC]) that displays either myeloid or B-lymphoid characteristics. This transition is often preceded by a clinically recognized, but biologically poorly characterized, accelerated phase (AP). Here, we report that IKAROS protein is absent or reduced in bone marrow blasts from most CML patients with advanced myeloid disease (AP or BC). This contrasts with primitive CP-CML cells and BCR-ABL1-negative acute myeloid leukemia blasts, which express readily detectable IKAROS. To investigate whether loss of IKAROS contributes to myeloid disease progression in CP-CML, we examined the effects of forced expression of a dominant-negative isoform of IKAROS (IK6) in CP-CML patients' CD34(+) cells. We confirmed that IK6 disrupts IKAROS activity in transduced CP-CML cells and showed that it confers on them features of AP-CML, including a prolonged increased output in vitro and in xenografted mice of primitive cells with an enhanced ability to differentiate into basophils. Expression of IK6 in CD34(+) CP-CML cells also led to activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and transcriptional repression of its negative regulators. These findings implicate loss of IKAROS as a frequent step and potential diagnostic harbinger of progressive myeloid disease in CML patients.

### European LeukemiaNet recommendations for the management of chronic myeloid leukemia: 2013 [^1127jU3d]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Advances in chronic myeloid leukemia treatment, particularly regarding tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mandate regular updating of concepts and management. A European LeukemiaNet expert panel reviewed prior and new studies to update recommendations made in 2009. We recommend as initial treatment imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib. Response is assessed with standardized real quantitative polymerase chain reaction and/or cytogenetics at 3, 6, and 12 months. BCR-ABL1 transcript levels ≤ 10% at 3 months, < 1% at 6 months, and ≤ 0.1% from 12 months onward define optimal response, whereas > 10% at 6 months and > 1% from 12 months onward define failure, mandating a change in treatment. Similarly, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) at 3 months and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) from 6 months onward define optimal response, whereas no CyR (Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph+] > 95%) at 3 months, less than PCyR at 6 months, and less than CCyR from 12 months onward define failure. Between optimal and failure, there is an intermediate warning zone requiring more frequent monitoring. Similar definitions are provided for response to second-line therapy. Specific recommendations are made for patients in the accelerated and blastic phases, and for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Optimal responders should continue therapy indefinitely, with careful surveillance, or they can be enrolled in controlled studies of treatment discontinuation once a deeper molecular response is achieved.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia presenting in lymphoblastic crisis, a differential diagnosis with Philadelphia-positive B-lymphoblastic leukemia [^115AM7gx]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2020). Medium credibility.

Rare patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) can present initially in lymphoblastic crisis (LBC) mimicking Ph+B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We retrospectively reviewed 275 adults who diagnosed initially as Ph+B-ALL and identified 28 patients with at least one of three features supporting the diagnosis of CML-LBC: 1) a large discrepancy between the blast count and Ph+clone; 2) Ph+clone persistent when B-ALL in remission; 3) BCR/ABL1 fusion detected in segmented cells. BCR-ABL1 fusions were p210 in 25 patients and p190 in 3 patients. In comparison to patients with Ph+B-ALL, patients with CML-LBC were older; had higher leukocyte and absolute neutrophil counts; higher immature myeloid cells in peripheral blood; lower blast counts; and inferior outcomes. In addition, we prospectively analyzed 26 patients with Ph+B-lymphoblastic leukemia and identified 8 patients with features more consistent with CML-LBC. These findings highlight the importance of distinguishing CML-LBC from de novo Ph+B-ALL.

Regarding medical management for chronic myeloid leukemia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of advanced phase CML (general principles), NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend to take into account the following treatment considerations for advanced phase chronic myeloid leukemia:

- disease progression to advanced phase while on TKI therapy has a worse prognosis than de novo advanced phase chronic myeloid leukemia

- evaluation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation as indicated

- selection of TKI is based on prior therapy and/or BCR::ABL1 mutation profile

- CNS involvement has been described in blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Perform lumbar puncture and offer CNS prophylaxis for lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia.

Chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia descriptive analysis (Table 1)

Patient 1 is a 37-year-old male, with CP-CML diagnosed in 2000 treated with IFN-α+AraC from 2000–2001. He was switched to imatinib (IM) following IFN-α failure. After > 5 years of IM and 2 years of DMR, he made a first cessation attempt, but lost major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months (M12). After IM resumption he switched to dasatinib 2011–2013 before attempting TFR for a second time. Patient 2 is a 56-year-old female, with CP-CML diagnosed in 2003 treated with IFN-α for 7 months and then with IM from 2003 to 2016. After 10 years of MR4.5 she stopped IM for TFR. Patient 3 is a 32-year-old female, partly reported in, diagnosed in CP in 1996, treated with IFN-α+AraC from 1996 to 1999 who became intolerant while in DMR. She started IM in 2006, following molecular recurrence. After 3 years IM and 30 months MR4.5 she stopped IM in 2009 for a second attempt at TFR. Patient 4 is a 60-year-old female with CP-CML diagnosed in 2012, treated with nilotinib from 2012 to 2016. After nilotinib intolerance, while in sustained DMR, she switched to dasatinib that was also withdrawn 4 months later due to intolerance. Patient 5 is a 51-year-old male, CP-CML diagnosed in 2007 and treated with IM until 2013. After 6.25 years and 4.5 years of MR4, he stopped IM in 2013 for TFR. Patient 6 is a 58-year-old, CP-CML diagnosed in 2010 and treated with nilotinib from 2011–2014. Discovery of atherosclerosis resulted in nilotinib dose reduction from 2014 to 2016 and suspension after 5 years and > 3 years in sustained MR4.5.

### Imatinib induces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast crisis: results of a phase II study [^113xiYGH]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Blast crisis is the most advanced stage of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is highly refractory to therapy. CML is caused by expression of the chimeric BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase oncogene, the product of the t(9;22) Philadelphia translocation. Imatinib (Glivec, formerly STI571) is a rationally developed, orally administered inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. A total of 260 patients with CML were enrolled in a phase II trial, of whom 229 had a confirmed diagnosis of CML in blast crisis. Patients were treated with imatinib in daily oral doses of 400 mg or 600 mg. Imatinib induced hematologic responses in 52% of patients and sustained hematologic responses lasting at least 4 weeks in 31% of patients, including complete hematologic responses in 8%. For patients with a sustained response, the estimated median response duration was 10 months. Imatinib induced major cytogenetic responses in 16% of patients, with 7% of the responses being complete. Median survival time was 6.9 months. Nonhematologic adverse reactions were frequent but generally mild or moderate. Episodes of severe cytopenia were also frequent and were attributable to the underlying condition and treatment with imatinib. Drug-related adverse events led to discontinuation of therapy in 5% of patients, most often because of cytopenia, skin disorders, or gastrointestinal reactions. These results demonstrate that imatinib has substantial activity and a favorable safety profile when used as a single agent in patients with CML in blast crisis. Additional clinical studies are warranted to explore the efficacy and feasibility of imatinib used in combination with other antileukemic drugs.

### Childhood chronic myeloid leukemia treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^115vhAPp]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

CML historically was divided into the following three clinical phases: Chronic phase. Chronic phase, which lasts for approximately 3 years if untreated, usually presents with symptoms secondary to hyperleukocytosis such as weakness, fever, night sweats, bone pain, respiratory distress, priapism, left upper quadrant pain, and, rarely, hearing loss and visual disturbances. However, in the era of using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, this phase is less prognostically relevant. Blast crisis phase. Blast crisis is notable for the bone marrow showing greater than 20% blasts or chloromatous lesions or the presence of increased lymphoblasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow. The clinical picture of CML is indistinguishable from acute leukemia. Approximately two-thirds of blast crisis is myeloid, and the remainder is lymphoid, usually of B lineage. Patients in blast crisis will die within a few months.

The 5th edition of the WHO classification now divides clinical presentation into either chronic phase or blast phase and eliminates the accelerated phase. This change was partially due to the impact of TKIs on the disease course, which has reduced the proportion of patients who develop progression. Also, the 5th edition of the WHO classification identifies certain chronic phase characteristics as high risk for disease progression and TKI resistance. These characteristics, present at diagnosis or during TKI therapy, include the following:

- **High-risk features of chronic-phase CML at diagnosis include the following**:

- High European Treatment and Outcome Study long-term survival score.
- Ten percent to 19% myeloid blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. Presence of lymphoblasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow is indicative of blast crisis–phase disease.
- Clusters of small megakaryocytes associated with significant bone marrow fibrosis.
- High-risk features of chronic-phase CML during treatment with TKIs include the following:

- Failure to achieve a complete hematologic response to the first TKI.
- Development of hematologic, cytogenetic, or molecular indications of resistance to two sequential TKIs.
- Development of new additional chromosomal abnormalities and/or occurrence of compound variants in the BCR:: ABL1fusion gene during TKI therapy.

### Diagnosing and managing advanced chronic myeloid leukemia… [^114ehuUB]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

It is thought that CML is initiated when a hematopoietic stem cell acquires the t reciprocal translocation, which the cytogenetic correlate is the Philadelphia chromosome. Based on the increase in CML incidence in survivors of the atomic bombings on Japan, the latency between this initial event to the clinical manifestation is estimated to be approximately 8 years. 1Whether or not a clonal genetic lesion predates the acquisition of Ph or whether additional genetic abnormalities are required to produce CP-CML is a matter of debate. However, recent next-generation sequencing studies suggest both scenarios are possible. 2Without effective therapy, CP-CML invariably progresses to an acute leukemia termed BP-CML, sometimes through an intermediate stage referred to as AP-CML. In the developed world, the vast majority of patients are diagnosed in the chronic phase, frequently when an abnormal complete blood count leads to a diagnostic workup.

Presentation with AP/BP-CML is more common in countries with lower socioeconomic status, probably reflecting delays in diagnosis as a result of insufficient access to medical care. The term "advanced CML" is not clearly defined and variably used to include AP/BP-CML only or also CP-CML resistant to standard therapy. Molecular Underpinning of Blastic Transformation The salient morphologic feature of BP-CML is loss of cellular differentiation capacity, which may occur suddenly or gradually through the intermediate stage of AP-CML. Progression is frequently associated with clonal cytogenetic evolution. The distinction between major and minor route abnormalities is of limited clinical significance once transformation has occurred. However, in newly diagnosed CP-CML major route abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome with imatinib treatment.

TKI resistance defines a high-risk situation and should be approached as a diagnosis with important clinical implications. Key pieces of information derived from this workup are disease phase, BCR-ABL1mutation status, and karyotype, including CCA/Ph +. Perspective Despite the unparalleled success of TKI in CML, progression during first-line TKI therapy, and transformation to accelerated- or blastic-phase continue to carry a poor prognosis. Although BCR-ABL1 mutations are a well-established mechanism of TKI resistance, many cases of clinical resistance remained mechanistically unexplained and are thought to be a result of activation of alternative signaling pathways.

Patients may also present with the following symptoms:

- Fatigue.
- Unexplained weight loss.
- Drenching night sweats.
- Fever. Transition between the chronic, accelerated, and blastic phases may occur gradually over 1 year or more, or it may occur abruptly. Patients with accelerated-phase CML show signs of progression without meeting the criteria for blast crisis. The following signs and symptoms indicate a change to accelerated-phase CML:
- Progressive splenomegaly.
- Increased leukocytosis and/or thrombocytosis.
- Progressive anemia. The following signs and symptoms indicate a change to a blast crisis, in addition to the accelerated-phase CML symptoms:

- Thrombocytopenia.
- Increasing and painful splenomegaly or hepatomegaly.
- Fever.
- Bone pain.
- Development of destructive bone lesions. In the accelerated phase, differentiated cells persist, although they often show increasing morphological abnormalities.

The patient experiences increased anemia, thrombocytopenia, and marrow fibrosis. Chronic-Phase CML Chronic-phase CML is characterized by bone marrow and cytogenetic findings as listed below with less than 10% blasts and promyelocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The following factors are predictive of a shorter chronic phase after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors:

- Older age.
- Cytogenetic abnormalities in addition to the Philadelphia chromosome.
- A higher proportion of marrow or peripheral blood blasts.
- Anemia. Predictive models using multivariate analysis have been derived. The rate of progression from chronic phase to blast crisis is 5% to 10% in the first 2 years and 20% in subsequent years. For more information, see the Treatment of Chronic-Phase CML section. Accelerated-Phase CML Accelerated-phase CML is characterized by 10% to 19% blasts in either the peripheral blood or bone marrow.

For more information, see the Treatment of Accelerated-Phase CML section. Blastic-Phase CML Blastic-phase CML is characterized by 20% or more blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. When 20% or more blasts are present along with fever, malaise, and progressive splenomegaly, the patient has entered blast crisis. For more information, see the Treatment of Blastic-Phase CML section.

CML has four phases:

1. Accelerated phase
- can last weeks to months.
2. Chronic phase
- involvement is usually limited to blood, bone marrow and spleen, although the liver may be infiltrated.
3. Blastic phase
- lymph nodes and tissue may be involved. The blastic phase is a progression from the chronic phase. It remains the same histology: Chronic myelogenous leukemia.
4. Terminal phase
- last phase and survival is usually only weeks or months. Criteria for CML, accelerated phase: CML, accelerated phase criteria Any 1 or more of the following hematologic/cytogenetic criteria or response-to-TKI criteria:
