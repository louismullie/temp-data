## Question

Orthostatic hypotension clinical presentation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical presentation of orthostatic hypotension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the consensus definition and thresholds. Then, I should verify symptom categories, including atypical and subtle features, and the high prevalence of asymptomatic presentations. Next, I will consider temporal phenotypes such as initial and delayed orthostatic hypotension. After that, I need to review epidemiology, high-risk populations, and medication associations. Then, I will assess clinical impact and outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize diagnostic pitfalls and a pragmatic approach, noting where my initial assumptions may need correction based on guideline specifics and evidence strength.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic criteria so I do not overstate or understate thresholds. Classic orthostatic hypotension is defined as a sustained fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt, and some guidelines also accept a decrease of systolic blood pressure to less than 90 mmHg, particularly when spontaneous symptoms are reproduced during the orthostatic challenge, although I should be careful not to imply that SBP < 90 mmHg alone, in the absence of reproduced symptoms, is sufficient by itself in all contexts, because the ESC frames this as confirmatory when it matches the patient's spontaneous symptom pattern [^112DCV2o] [^112X4rJU]. Wait, let me verify the supine hypertension nuance; in patients with supine hypertension, a larger threshold drop such as 30 mmHg systolic or 15 mmHg diastolic is often more appropriate to account for higher baselines, and the recommended bedside protocol is after at least 5 minutes supine, measure just prior to standing and again at 1 and 3 minutes, with tilt testing when needed to confirm or clarify equivocal cases [^111jn2Ym] [^113MytTA].

> Hold on, let me reorganize the symptom categorization cleanly into hallmark, subtle, atypical, and associated features while keeping the same content. Typical symptoms on standing include dizziness or lightheadedness, visual blurring or tunnel vision, presyncope and syncope, weakness and fatigue, leg buckling, impaired concentration, and sometimes orthostatic dyspnea, and they characteristically improve with recumbency, whereas atypical complaints include head, neck, and shoulder discomfort often termed coat-hanger pain from muscle ischemia, chest discomfort mimicking angina without fixed coronary disease, and even back pain, with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting particularly recognized in pediatric orthostatic intolerance, and I should emphasize that these symptom clusters are driven by cerebral and systemic hypoperfusion rather than primary vestibular disease [^113612CJ] [^111s41GT] [^112qcyg6].

> But wait, what if there are no symptoms at all despite a large blood pressure fall; I need to check the strength of evidence for asymptomatic presentations and the symptom–blood pressure dissociation. Multiple studies show poor correlation between the magnitude of the orthostatic blood pressure drop and symptom severity, with a substantial proportion of patients being asymptomatic or reporting atypical complaints despite marked hypotension, which means history alone can miss profound cases and clinicians must not anchor on dizziness as a screening tool, especially in older adults [^113iw1gF] [^113K4VHQ] [^111HBx54].

> Next, I should review temporal phenotypes because timing helps me differentiate initial, classic, and delayed forms. Initial orthostatic hypotension manifests within the first 15 seconds of standing and often requires continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring for diagnosis, classic orthostatic hypotension evolves within 3 minutes, and delayed orthostatic hypotension emerges after 3 minutes, sometimes only uncovered by prolonged standing or tilt protocols, and I should remember that symptoms often cluster in the morning and after meals due to circadian and postprandial effects that exacerbate splanchnic pooling and impaired autonomic compensation [^117K1NdP] [^113cSMNZ] [^115f5hXG] [^117K1NdP].

> I will now examine epidemiology and high-risk associations so I can target screening appropriately. Prevalence rises with age from roughly 5% to 30% in community-dwelling older adults and higher in institutionalized or neurodegenerative cohorts, and strong links exist with Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, diabetic autonomic neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and exposure to medications that impair autonomic or volume responses such as dopaminergic agents and various antihypertensives, which means the threshold for orthostatic testing should be low in these contexts and medication reviews are essential [^111s41GT] [^113612CJ] [^113LDpg6] [^117K1NdP] [^113FBVBW].

> I should confirm the clinical impact because recognizing harm potential guides urgency. Orthostatic hypotension independently associates with falls, fractures, syncope, cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and increased all-cause mortality, and importantly, asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension doubles the risk of unexplained falls over time, so even "silent" orthostatic hypotension is not benign and warrants attention beyond symptom relief alone [^115EHL5J] [^113612CJ] [^113K4VHQ] [^113rDGxT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about underrecognition without specifying the concrete pitfalls and a corrective diagnostic approach. Patients often do not volunteer orthostatic symptoms, routine vital signs are obtained seated, symptoms are mistakenly attributed to aging or comorbidity, and compensatory behaviors like slow rising can mask the syndrome, so I need to ensure orthostatic vital signs are performed routinely in at-risk patients with measurements after at least 5 minutes supine followed by standing at 1 and 3 minutes, pursue tilt testing when suspicion remains high despite normal bedside testing, consider prolonged standing or continuous monitoring to detect delayed or initial orthostatic hypotension, and in selected cases use ambulatory or home monitoring with posture annotation to capture real-world fluctuations and supine hypertension coexistent with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^111jn2Ym] [^113MytTA] [^115f5hXG] [^112DCV2o] [^117K1NdP].

> Hmm, wait a minute, earlier I almost implied that a drop to systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg is a stand-alone diagnostic criterion; I should double-check and clarify that in ESC syncope guidance, a fall of at least 20/10 mmHg or a decrease to systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg that reproduces the patient's spontaneous symptoms confirms orthostatic hypotension as the mechanism of syncope, which reinforces the need to correlate hemodynamics with the clinical syndrome rather than using a single number in isolation [^112DCV2o] [^112X4rJU].

> Let me consider practical implications briefly so the recognition flows into action without overextending beyond presentation. Initial management focuses on identifying and addressing reversible causes including medication contributors, instituting nonpharmacologic measures such as fluid and salt optimization, head-up sleeping, compression, and physical counter-maneuvers, and when symptoms persist, agents like fludrocortisone and midodrine are first-line with caution about supine hypertension and dosing timing, while octreotide may be considered for refractory postprandial hypotension in select syncope patients, keeping the overarching goal as symptom control and safety rather than achieving a specific standing blood pressure target [^113612CJ] [^115UjaoT] [^113sJq7p] [^1135g37L] [^111iAPaY] [^111a8mjN].

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) presents with **dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, and syncope** upon standing, typically resolving with recumbency [^111s41GT] [^115EHL5J]. Symptoms typically begin **within 3 minutes of standing** [^112X4rJU], worsen in the morning or after meals [^112rSTnM], and may include "coat-hanger" neck/shoulder pain, cognitive slowing, or orthostatic dyspnea [^113612CJ] [^111s41GT]. Many patients, especially older adults, are asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms; therefore, routine orthostatic BP measurement is essential [^113K4VHQ] [^113X16Sj]. OH increases fall risk and can cause injuries, particularly in the elderly [^117F3Csr] [^113rDGxT].

---

## Typical symptoms

- **Dizziness and lightheadedness**: Common and often the earliest symptoms upon standing [^111s41GT].

- **Visual disturbances**: Blurred vision or visual "graying out" due to transient cerebral hypoperfusion [^111s41GT].

- **Weakness and fatigue**: Generalized weakness, fatigue, or leg buckling on standing [^115EHL5J].

- **Syncope or presyncope**: Transient loss of consciousness or near-fainting episodes [^112DCV2o].

- **Coat-hanger pain**: Neck and shoulder discomfort from muscle hypoperfusion [^113612CJ].
- **Cognitive impairment**: Difficulty concentrating, slowed thinking, or confusion when upright [^111s41GT].

- **Orthostatic dyspnea**: Shortness of breath on standing [^113612CJ].

---

## Atypical symptoms

Atypical manifestations may include **headache and chest pain** that mimic angina, particularly in patients with autonomic dysfunction [^111s41GT] [^113612CJ]. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as **nausea, abdominal discomfort, or early satiety** occur, particularly in neurogenic OH [^117AT4jJ]. Psychiatric symptoms, including **anxiety and depression**, may coexist with or be exacerbated by OH [^1136cjLN].

---

## Symptom timing and triggers

- **Timing**: Symptoms typically occur within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt [^112X4rJU] [^113MytTA].

- **Morning predominance**: Symptoms are often worse in the morning due to overnight fluid redistribution [^117K1NdP].

- **Postprandial exacerbation**: Large meals, especially carbohydrate-rich, can worsen symptoms [^112rSTnM].

- **Heat exposure**: Warm environments or hot showers can trigger symptoms [^112rSTnM].

- **Physical exertion**: Exercise or prolonged standing can precipitate symptoms [^113612CJ].

## Asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension

A significant proportion of patients, particularly older adults, may have **asymptomatic OH** [^113iw1gF], detected only by routine orthostatic BP measurement [^113K4VHQ] [^113X16Sj]. Asymptomatic OH is clinically important [^113K4VHQ] because it increases the risk of **falls, fractures, and cardiovascular events** [^113rDGxT] [^115EHL5J].

---

## Clinical presentation in specific populations

### Elderly patients

In older adults, OH is **common and frequently asymptomatic** or presents with atypical symptoms [^113K4VHQ]. OH significantly increases the risk of falls, fractures, and functional decline [^113rDGxT]. It is often associated with comorbid hypertension, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases [^111HBx54].

---

### Patients with neurodegenerative disorders

In Parkinson's disease, OH is a **common non-motor symptom** that may present early in the disease course [^115Ys43s]. In multiple system atrophy, OH is a hallmark feature, often severe and associated with autonomic failure [^115YK7rC]. In pure autonomic failure, OH is a primary manifestation and is typically accompanied by other autonomic symptoms [^111s41GT].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Orthostatic blood pressure measurement**: Supine BP after 5 minutes rest, then standing BP at 1 and 3 minutes; OH is defined as a ≥ 20 mmHg systolic or ≥ 10 mmHg diastolic drop within 3 minutes [^112DCV2o] [^113612CJ].

- **Head-up tilt table testing**: Useful when bedside testing is inconclusive or unsafe [^113MytTA] [^113612CJ].

- **Autonomic function tests**: Valsalva maneuver, heart rate variability, and catecholamine measurements to differentiate neurogenic from non-neurogenic OH [^1156ADPY] [^111jn2Ym].

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^111s41GT]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

According to consensus guidelines, orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt. Since the magnitude of blood pressure drop also depends on baseline values, it was suggested that a drop of 30 mmHg may be a more appropriate criterion for OH in patients with supine hypertension. Blood pressure is a clinical measure, and the patients are not necessarily aware of its dysregulation. The prevalence of OH increases with age and is commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and pure autonomic failure (PAF). In the general aged population, the prevalence rates of OH range between 5% and 30%.

- **Hallmark symptoms**: Upon postural challenge, symptoms include dizziness, visual disturbances, presyncope, and syncope. However, the majority of patients experience more subtle general complaints such as tiredness, impaired cognitive performance, weakness, fatigue, leg buckling, visual blurring, and orthostatic dyspnea. Patients may also experience discomfort in the head, neck, shoulders, or chest. The latter may be reminiscent of anginal pain in the absence of coronary heart disease.

### Prevalence of orthostatic hypotension and associated factors among older people with hypertension in Northern Ethiopia [^111HBx54]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with orthostatic hypotension (OH) can be symptomatic or asymptomatic, and symptomatic hypotension is associated with morbidity or cardiovascular mortality. In our study, among the participants with OH, 35 out of 57 (61.4%) reported experiencing symptoms. Common symptoms of symptomatic OH include, but are not limited to, lightheadedness, weakness or tiredness, difficulties in thinking or concentrating, blurred vision, pre-syncope, and syncope. OH symptoms can adversely impact quality of life and, in some cases, may be incapacitating. However, there is a poor relationship between the magnitude of the orthostatic blood pressure fall and the degree of symptoms.

The proportion of symptomatic OH varies across studies depending on the method used to assess symptoms. For instance, a previous study found that OH symptoms were present in a quarter (25.6%) of older patients with hypertension in primary care. A third of participants with OH in our study did not report any OH symptoms, which was consistent with previous work. A study assessing symptoms in OH patients using the same tool we used (Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire, OHQ) revealed that 57% reported symptoms of orthostatic intolerance with standing and 55% after physical activity. This was consistent with our study.

- **Limitations**: This was an institution-based study and did not include a random sample of community-dwelling older people with hypertension. Therefore, our sample may not accurately represent the older population in the community. As symptoms were actively queried, our results may have overestimated the recognition of symptoms, resulting in information bias.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition and an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms such as orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, as they are often asymptomatic, further complicating the diagnosis. Seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension are summarized in the study.

### Orthostatic hypotension: A practical approach [^113612CJ]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more systolic or 10 mm Hg or more diastolic within three minutes of standing from the supine position or on assuming a head-up position of at least 60 degrees during tilt table testing. Symptoms are due to inadequate physiologic compensation and organ hypoperfusion and include headache, lightheadedness, shoulder and neck pain (coat hanger syndrome), visual disturbances, dyspnea, and chest pain.

The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in the community setting is 20% in older adults and 5% in middle-aged adults. Risk factors such as diabetes mellitus increase the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in all age groups. Orthostatic hypotension is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular risk and falls, and up to a 50% increase in relative risk of all-cause mortality.

Diagnosis is confirmed by performing a bedside simplified Schellong test, which consists of blood pressure and heart rate measurements after five minutes in the supine position and three minutes after moving to a standing position. If the patient is unable to stand safely or if the clinical suspicion for orthostatic hypotension is high despite normal findings on the bedside test, head-up tilt table testing is recommended.

Orthostatic hypotension is classified as neurogenic or nonneurogenic, depending on etiology and heart rate response. Treatment goals for orthostatic hypotension are reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Initial treatment focuses on the underlying cause and adjusting potentially causative medications.

### Orthostatic hypotension in the elderly: Diagnosis and treatment [^117F3Csr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a common problem among elderly patients, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While acute orthostatic hypotension is usually secondary to medication, fluid or blood loss, or adrenal insufficiency, chronic orthostatic hypotension is frequently due to altered blood pressure regulatory mechanisms and autonomic dysfunction.

The diagnostic evaluation requires a comprehensive history, including symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, careful blood pressure measurement at various times of the day and after meals or medications, and laboratory studies. Laboratory investigation and imaging studies should be based upon the initial findings, with an emphasis on excluding diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases, amyloidosis, diabetes, anemia, and vitamin deficiency as the cause.

Whereas asymptomatic patients usually need no treatment, those with symptoms often benefit from a stepped approach, with initial nonpharmacological interventions including avoidance of potentially hypotensive medications and use of physical counter maneuvers. If these measures prove inadequate and the patient remains persistently symptomatic, various pharmacotherapeutic agents can be added, including fludrocortisone, midodrine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The goals of treatment are to improve symptoms and make the patient as ambulatory as possible rather than trying to achieve arbitrary blood pressure goals.

With proper evaluation and management, the occurrence of adverse events, including falls, fractures, functional decline, and myocardial ischemia, can be minimized.

### Asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension and risk of falls in community-dwelling older people [^113K4VHQ]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

Many older people with orthostatic hypotension (OH) may not report typical symptoms of dizziness, light-headedness, or unsteadiness. However, the relationships between OH and falls in the absence of typical symptoms are not yet established.

- **Methods**: Continuous orthostatic blood pressure (BP) was measured during active stand using a Finometer at Wave 1 of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing in participants aged ≥ 70 years. OH, with and without dizziness, was defined as a sustained drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 and/or diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg at 30, 60, and 90 seconds post-standing. The association between symptoms of dizziness and orthostatic BP was assessed with multi-level mixed-effects linear regression; logistic regression models assessed the longitudinal relationship between OH and falls at 6-year follow-up (Waves 2–5).

- **Results**: Almost 11% (n = 934, mean age 75 years, 51% female) had OH, two-thirds of whom were asymptomatic. Dizziness was not associated with systolic BP drop at 30 (β = 1.54 [-1.27, 4.36]; p = 0.256), 60 (β = 2.64 [-0.19, 5.47]; p = 0.476) or 90 seconds (β = 2.02 [-0.91, 4.95]; p = 0.176) after standing in adjusted models. Asymptomatic OH was independently associated with unexplained falls (odds ratio 2.01 [1.11, 3.65]; p = 0.022) but not explained falls (OR 0.93 [0.53, 1.62]; p = 0.797) during follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Two-thirds of older people with OH did not report typical symptoms of light-headedness. Dizziness or unsteadiness after standing did not correlate with the degree of orthostatic BP drop or recovery. Participants with asymptomatic OH had a significantly higher risk of unexplained falls.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^112X4rJU]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, specifically concerning orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend confirming syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when there is a fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline value by ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by ≥ 10 mmHg, or a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg, thereby reproducing spontaneous symptoms.

### Orthostatic hypotension and risk of clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease in middle-aged adults [^1137zWaX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Requests for the data, analytic methods, and study materials used in this study for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure may be submitted to the ARIC Study publications committee.

- **Study population**:
	- The ARIC Study is a prospective cohort, which enrolled 15,792 adults, aged 45 to 64 years, between 1987 and 1989 from four U.S. communities. Participants have been followed for over two decades. The original ARIC Study protocol included physical examinations, medical interviews, and laboratory tests. In this analysis, we excluded the following: (1) participants who did not have an OH assessment at baseline (1987–1989) because of late implementation of this protocol (N = 2555); (2) participants who had a history of CHD (N = 766), HF (N = 752), or stroke (N = 284); (3) participants who were missing relevant covariate data at baseline as well as underrepresented racial groups (N = 3222); or (4) those who were missing measurement or follow-up data for outcomes of interest (N = 4094). This resulted in a study population of 9139 participants (some participants met multiple exclusion criteria).

- **History definitions**:
	- History of CHD was based on ECGs (silent MI), self-report, or self-reported history of previous coronary procedures. History of HF was defined as active use of medications to treat HF or self-reported symptoms associated with HF on the basis of the Gothenburg criteria. History of stroke was based on self-report. We excluded participants with self-reported CHD, congestive heart failure, or stroke to study a population without known CVD to assess the association between orthostatic hypotension and cardiovascular disease.

### Prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111SJYoy]. Age and Ageing (2021). Low credibility.

Initial orthostatic hypotension (OH) is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years or older, particularly when measured continuously, highlighting the need to screen and diagnose initial OH. Future research should investigate whether the inclusion of symptoms in the definition of initial OH is clinically relevant. Furthermore, there is a need to establish a consensus on the diagnosis of initial OH using continuous blood pressure devices to consistently identify participants with initial OH.

### Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: The role of radiology in diagnosis and management [^116TU6XT]. Clinical Radiology (2022).

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a condition that results from leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spine and typically presents with a debilitating orthostatic headache. However, it can also be associated with a wide range of other symptoms. The causes of spontaneous CSF leaks that lead to SIH include dural tears, leaking meningeal diverticula, and CSF-venous fistulas. Imaging plays a central role in the initial diagnosis of SIH and in its subsequent investigation and management.

This article reviews the typical neuroimaging manifestations of SIH and discusses the utility of different myelographic techniques for localizing spinal CSF leaks, as well as the role of image-guided treatment.

### Orthostatic hypertension: A newcomer among the hypertension phenotypes [^111X7gFF]. Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

The measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the upright posture is recommended by all hypertension guidelines to detect orthostatic hypotension, especially in elderly patients. However, numerous studies have shown that an exaggerated BP response to standing (RTS) is often present in the general population, and it may be of clinical value. For years, the prognostic role and clinical significance of orthostatic hypertension (OHT) remained undefined because data were sparse and often inconsistent. In addition, the diagnostic criteria of OHT varied from study to study, making it difficult to interpret data regarding the cardiovascular risk associated with this condition.

In recent years, evidence has been accumulating that OHT is associated with an increased risk of hypertension, hypertension-mediated organ damage, cardiovascular disease, and mortality, thereby enhancing our knowledge of the pathophysiology, clinical relevance, and prognostic role of this condition. This has led some authorities to propose a definition based on both the orthostatic pressor response and the absolute BP levels while standing. Most information on OHT comes from studies performed in elderly subjects, whereas much less is known about its prevalence and clinical significance in young individuals. The aim of the present review is to summarize the available evidence regarding the prevalence, reproducibility, diagnosis, pathogenetic mechanisms, and risk of adverse outcomes associated with OHT, focusing on potential differences related to age.

### Neurological update: Non-motor symptoms in atypical parkinsonian syndromes [^113LDpg6]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in idiopathic RBD, with greater degrees of dysfunction at baseline being associated with phenoconversion from RBD to DLB. Urinary symptoms and orthostatic hypotension, the two most common symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, are also listed as part of the diagnostic criteria for MSA. We noted a greater prevalence of urinary dysfunction (not limited to urinary incontinence) in patients with MSA (79.7%) or PD (79.9%), compared to PSP (49.3%), DLB (42%), or CBD (53.8%) (p < 0.001).

- **Falls and blood pressure drop**: A subset of individuals with DLB and MSA frequently experience falls that can occur early. Orthostatic hypotension, defined as a drop in blood pressure of more than 20 mmHg, is present in over 60% of those with MSA.

### Orthostatic hypotension: Epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment [^115EHL5J]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common cardiovascular disorder, occurring with or without signs of underlying neurodegenerative disease. OH is diagnosed based on an orthostatic challenge, which signifies a persistent systolic/diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20/10 mm Hg upon standing. Its prevalence is age-dependent, ranging from 5% in patients 70 years of age. OH can complicate the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary heart disease. It can cause disabling symptoms, faints, and traumatic injuries, substantially reducing the quality of life. Despite often being asymptomatic or presenting with minimal symptoms, the presence of OH independently increases mortality and the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

In this review, we outline the etiology and prevalence of OH in the general population, summarize its relationship with morbidity and mortality, propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm, and delineate challenges and future perspectives.

### Orthostatic blood pressure recovery patterns in suspected syncope in the emergency department [^113cSMNZ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Orthostasis is a frequent trigger for (pre)syncope, but some forms of orthostatic (pre)syncope have a worse prognosis than others. Routine assessment of orthostatic blood pressure (BP) in the emergency department (ED) can detect classic orthostatic hypotension but often misses these other forms of orthostatic (pre)syncope. This study aimed to determine the frequency of abnormal orthostatic BP recovery patterns in patients with (pre)syncope by using continuous non-invasive BP monitoring.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective cohort study on suspected patients with (pre)syncope in the ED of a tertiary care teaching hospital between January and August 2014. Orthostatic BP was measured during the active lying-to-standing test with Nexfin, a continuous non-invasive finger arterial pressure measurement device. Orthostatic BP recovery patterns were defined as normal BP recovery, initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed BP recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and reflex-mediated hypotension.

- **Results**: Of 116 patients recruited, measurements in 111 patients (age 63 years, 51% male) were suitable for analysis. Classic orthostatic hypotension was the most prevalent abnormal BP pattern (19%) but only half of the patients received a final diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. Initial orthostatic hypotension and delayed BP recovery were present in 20% of the patients with (pre)syncope, of whom 45% were diagnosed with unexplained syncope. Reflex-mediated hypotension was present in 4% of the patients.

- **Conclusion**: Continuous non-invasive BP measurement can potentially identify more specific and concerning causes.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^117AT4jJ]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a distinctive and treatable sign of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. It is caused by the failure of noradrenergic neurotransmission and is associated with a range of primary or secondary autonomic disorders, including pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease with autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, as well as diabetic and nondiabetic autonomic neuropathies. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is commonly accompanied by autonomic dysregulation involving other organ systems, such as the bowel and the bladder.

In this review, we provide an overview of the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, focusing on neurodegenerative disorders.

### Common syndromes of orthostatic intolerance [^114ZmB6w]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system, adequate blood volume, and intact skeletal and respiratory muscle pumps are essential components for rapid cardiovascular adjustments to upright posture (orthostasis). Patients lacking sufficient blood volume or having defective sympathetic adrenergic vasoconstriction develop orthostatic hypotension (OH), prohibiting effective upright activities. OH is one form of orthostatic intolerance (OI) defined by signs, such as hypotension, and symptoms, such as lightheadedness, that occur when upright and are relieved by recumbence.

Mild OI is commonly experienced during illnesses and when standing up rapidly. The latter is denoted "initial OH" and represents a normal cardiovascular adjustment to the blood volume shifts during standing. Some people experience episodic acute OI, such as postural vasovagal syncope (fainting), or chronic OI, such as postural tachycardia syndrome, which can significantly reduce quality of life. The lifetime incidence of at least one fainting episode is approximately 40%. For the most part, these episodes are benign and self-limited, although frequent syncope episodes can be debilitating, and injury may occur from sudden falls.

In this article, mechanisms for OI having components of adrenergic hypofunction, adrenergic hyperfunction, hyperpnea, and regional blood volume redistribution are discussed. Therapeutic strategies to cope with OI are proposed.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^111jn2Ym]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of nOH in individuals who screen positive for OH:

After screening to identify a patient as being at risk for OH, an accurate assessment of the underlying cause(s) is required to determine the appropriate treatment recommendation. A stepwise approach is recommended for diagnosis of nOH, specifically starting with measurement of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, followed by more detailed autonomic testing in select cases.

- **Stepwise approach to diagnosis of nOH**: The hallmark test for OH is measurement of change in blood pressure from supine, after at least 5 minutes of rest, to standing (or head-up tilt). Guidelines define OH as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing (or HUT). However, in patients with supine hypertension (a supine systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg), a 30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure or a 15-point fall in diastolic blood pressure may be a more appropriate criterion for patients with nOH, as the magnitude of blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure.

- **In-clinic monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate**: The recommended gold standard measurement of OH includes having patients rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and then stand for 3 minutes. Blood pressure measurements are taken just prior to standing and at both 1 minute and 3 minutes thereafter.

### Serotonin syndrome presenting as acute dizziness with supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension [^117UxQBc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a drug-induced clinical syndrome characterized by a combination of cognitive, neuromuscular, and autonomic dysfunctions. Symptoms may range from mild, non-specific manifestations such as tremors and diarrhea to severe outcomes like coma and sudden death. In this case, we describe SS presenting with acute dizziness associated with supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension.

A man in his mid-30s with a 10-month history of anxiety, depression, and chronic tension-type headache was on amitriptyline (25 mg daily) and sertraline (50 mg daily). The increase of sertraline to 75 mg daily and amitriptyline to 75 mg daily, along with the addition of tramadol, led to the development of acute severe dizziness. Physical examinations demonstrated supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension. He met the diagnostic criteria of SS. The administration of cyproheptadine provided a complete resolution of dizziness, supine hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, and other clinical features of SS.

### Prevalence of orthostatic intolerance in long Covid clinic patients and healthy volunteers: A multicenter study [^11192MDm]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Low credibility.

Orthostatic intolerance (OI), including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) and orthostatic hypotension (OH), is often reported in long Covid, but published studies are small with inconsistent results. We sought to estimate the prevalence of objective OI in patients attending long Covid clinics and healthy volunteers, and associations with OI symptoms and comorbidities. Participants with a diagnosis of long Covid were recruited from eight UK long Covid clinics, and healthy volunteers were recruited from the general population. All undertook the standardized National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT). Participants' history of typical OI symptoms (e.g. dizziness, palpitations) before and during the NLT were recorded.

Two hundred seventy-seven long Covid patients and 50 frequency-matched healthy volunteers were tested. Healthy volunteers had no history of OI symptoms or symptoms during the NLT or PoTS; however, 10% had asymptomatic OH. One hundred thirty (47%) long Covid patients had a previous history of OI symptoms and 144 (52%) developed symptoms during the NLT. Forty-one (15%) had an abnormal NLT, 20 (7%) met criteria for PoTS, and 21 (8%) had OH. Of patients with an abnormal NLT, 45% had no prior symptoms of OI. Relaxing the diagnostic thresholds for PoTS from two consecutive abnormal readings to one abnormal reading during the NLT resulted in 11% of long Covid participants (an additional 4%) meeting criteria for PoTS, but not in healthy volunteers.

More than half of long Covid patients experienced OI symptoms during NLT and more than one in 10 patients met the criteria for e

### Orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic disorders in the hypertension clinic [^1151Afwy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Hypertension specialists are often consulted regarding orthostatic hypotension (OH) or the combination of OH with supine hypertension. These clinical presentations are typically linked to various underlying autonomic disorders. A comprehensive medical history and clinical examination, with careful attention to autonomic signs and the neurological system, may suggest the possible etiology or a differential diagnosis. Sometimes, the onset of OH is temporally associated with drug therapy for hypertension or other diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, while in other cases, no definitive association can be made.

Most hypertension specialists can initiate basic evaluation and treatment. Treatment approaches to OH must aim primarily to alleviate symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion and also consider supine hypertension. Several lifestyle modifications and drug therapies can ameliorate symptoms of OH. Short-acting antihypertensive therapy may be useful in controlling nocturnal supine hypertension.

### Hypotension unawareness in profound orthostatic hypotension [^112zpMwa]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Clinicians depend on the history provided by patients when considering the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension.

- **Methods**: Patients with a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 60 mm Hg from baseline during a head-up tilt table test were included. They were classified according to their symptoms during the test. The localization of the cause of orthostatic hypotension was sought in each of these groups.

- **Results**: Eighty-eight (43%) patients had typical symptoms, 49 (24%) had atypical symptoms, and 68 (33%) were asymptomatic. The average decrease in systolic blood pressure was 88 mm Hg, 87.5 mm Hg, and 89.8 mm Hg in the typical, atypical, and asymptomatic groups, respectively (P = 0.81). Patients reported severe dizziness with a similar frequency as lower extremity discomfort, and backache and headache were also common atypical complaints. Patients with a peripheral cause of dysautonomia were able to sustain the longest upright position during the head-up tilt table test (21 minutes, compared with central dysautonomia at 15 minutes) (P = 0.005). There was no correlation between the cause of dysautonomia and the occurrence of symptoms during the head-up tilt table test (P = 0.58).

- **Conclusion**: A third of the patients with severe orthostatic hypotension are completely asymptomatic during the head-up tilt table test, and another quarter have atypical complaints that would not lead physicians toward the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. These findings suggest that these patients might not provide adequate information in diagnosing profound orthostatic hypotension.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms associated with orthostatic intolerance [^112qcyg6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2005).

The term orthostatic intolerance is used to describe symptoms of hemodynamic instability such as lightheadedness, fatigue, impaired cognition, and syncope that develop on assuming an upright posture. Common forms of orthostatic intolerance in childhood include postural tachycardia syndrome and neurally mediated hypotension.

- **Objective**: A descriptive report of the clinical characteristics of patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms who are ultimately found to have orthostatic intolerance.

- **Methods**: A medical record review of all patients referred to the pediatric gastroenterology service at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center who had an abnormal tilt table test between June 1996 and December 2000.

- **Results**: Of 24 eligible subjects aged 9–17 years (mean, 14.3 years), four had postural tachycardia syndrome, eight had both postural tachycardia and neurally mediated hypotension, and 12 had neurally mediated hypotension alone. The most common presenting gastrointestinal symptoms were abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The median number of gastrointestinal symptoms per patient was 3 (range, 1–7), and 87% of the patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms for more than 1 year, while 48% experienced symptoms for more than 3 years. Follow-up information was available on 18 patients, with 78% (14 of 18) achieving complete resolution of symptoms with treatment of orthostatic intolerance.

- **Conclusion**: Pediatric patients with chronic upper gastrointestinal symptoms may have underlying orthostatic intolerance.

### An update on MSA: Premotor and non-motor features open a window of opportunities for early diagnosis and intervention [^115YK7rC]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical manifestations of non-motor features:

- **Cardiovascular failure in MSA**: Early symptoms in multiple system atrophy (MSA) are frequently related to cardiovascular and autonomic failure, preceding motor manifestations. In a recent study, the majority of MSA patients (77%) recalled early autonomic symptoms, initially not recognized as manifestations of a neurodegenerative disease.

- **Criteria for diagnosis**: According to Gilman et al, the criteria for diagnosing probable MSA involve autonomic dysfunction, including urinary incontinence (the inability to control the release of urine from the bladder, with erectile dysfunction in males) or orthostatic hypotension (OH), defined as a decrease in blood pressure within 3 minutes of standing by at least 30 mmHg systolic or 15 mmHg diastolic. Importantly, autonomic dysfunction may be the only presenting feature in some MSA patients.

- **Symptoms of OH**: Symptomatic OH, the main symptom of cardiovascular autonomic failure, often manifests as syncope, dizziness, nausea, headache, and weakness and has been reported in 43–81% of all MSA patients. Cardiovascular autonomic failure associated with degeneration of the nucleus ambiguus has been reproduced in an MSA mouse model.

- **Differential diagnosis**: An important differential for autonomic failure in the early stage of MSA is the diagnosis of pure autonomic failure (PAF). Orthostatic hypotension and its related symptoms, such as light-headedness or dizziness, and sudomotor dysfunction, are the most common presenting features in PAF. While bladder symptoms are also present in some PAF patients, these features are less severe than in MSA.

### Rexulti [^116TDEG4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics, such as Rexulti, cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The risk is generally greatest during the initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti plus antidepressant therapy (ADT) in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in Rexulti plus ADT-treated patients compared to placebo plus ADT-treated patients included dizziness (2% versus 2%) and orthostatic hypotension (0.1% versus 0%).

In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti in adult patients with schizophrenia, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in Rexulti-treated patients compared to placebo patients included dizziness (2% versus 2%), orthostatic hypotension (0.4% versus 0.2%), and syncope (0.1% versus 0%).

In 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti in patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in patients treated with Rexulti compared to patients treated with placebo included dizziness (3% versus 3%), orthostatic hypotension (1% versus 1%), and syncope (0.2% versus 0.8%).

Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension, such as elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, or those on concomitant antihypertensive medication, as well as patients with known cardiovascular disease, including a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities.

### Symptom recognition is impaired in patients with orthostatic hypotension [^113iw1gF]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Failure to recognize symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (OH) may result in falls, syncope, and injuries. The relationship between orthostatic changes in blood pressure and symptom occurrence and severity is not known. The goal of the present study was to define the relationship between the occurrence and severity of the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (OH) and (1) the upright systolic blood pressure (SBP) and (2) the fall in SBP after tilting in patients with OH.

We prospectively studied 89 patients with OH. Reported BP values include the lowest BP in the first 3 minutes of tilt and the change in blood pressure during tilt. Subjects were queried about symptoms of orthostatic intolerance while supine and during the first 3 minutes of tilt testing using Question 1 of the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire.

Mean tilted SBP was 101.6 ± 26.1 mm Hg and mean SBP fall 47.9 ± 18.1 mm Hg. Mean symptom scores when upright were: light-headedness (2.3/10 ± 2.7), dizziness (1.6/10 ± 2.5), and impending blackout (0.8/10 ± 1.9). The majority of patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and no discrete cutoff for symptoms was observed.

The magnitude of the SBP fall (r = -0.07, P = NS) and the lowest upright SBP (r = 0.08, P = NS) did not correlate with any reported symptom. These results suggest a poor relationship between the magnitude of the orthostatic BP fall, the upright orthostatic BP, and symptoms. Many patients are asymptomatic despite substantial SBP falls and low orthostatic blood pressures. These findings have implications for clinical care of patients with OH.

### Incidence and outcome of orthostatic hypotension in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation [^117LtRmR]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

To document the incidence and outcome of orthostatic hypotension in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation and to determine clinical variables associated with it, this cohort study was conducted in the inpatient setting of a tertiary rehabilitation center.

Seventy-one stroke patients (41 men, 30 women; mean age, 58.4 ± 10.7 years) with a first clinical stroke were admitted for rehabilitation within 4 weeks of the stroke.

- **Not applicable**: Interventions.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patients' blood pressure was measured in the supine position and on tilting at 90 degrees within 3 days of admission. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 20 mmHg or more.

Orthostatic hypotension was present in 37 (52.1%) patients, of whom 13 had severe hypotension (standing SBP ≤ 100 mmHg). Twelve (32.4%) patients with orthostatic hypotension were positive for hypotensive symptoms and signs, with 2 patients experiencing near syncope. Orthostatic hypotension was significantly associated with older patients, a lower admission functional status (as measured on the Modified Barthel Index), and more severe hemiparesis. It was, however, not related to the site of stroke or the use of antihypertensives. On discharge, orthostatic hypotension had resolved in 23 patients. The presence of orthostatic hypotension did not influence functional outcome or the length of stay in rehabilitation.

Orthostatic hypotension was common in stroke patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. It should be suspected in older patients who have…

Regarding screening and diagnosis for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend defining orthostatic headache as a headache meeting the following criteria:

- **Absent or mild**: Headache should be absent or only mild (1–3 on the verbal rating scale) on waking or after prolonged lying flat.
- **Onset time**: Onset should occur within 2 hours of becoming upright.
- **Improvement in severity**: There should be good improvement in severity (> 50% on the verbal rating scale) within 2 hours after lying flat.
- **Consistent timing**: Consistent timing of onset and offset.

### Igalmi [^114TkoQ5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Igalmi causes dose-dependent hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and bradycardia. In clinical studies, 18%, 16%, and 9% of patients treated with 180 mcg of Igalmi, 120 mcg of Igalmi, and placebo, respectively, experienced orthostatic hypotension [defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 10 mmHg after 1, 3, or 5 minutes of standing] at two hours post-dose. In those studies, 7%, 6%, and 1% of patients treated with 180 mcg of Igalmi, 120 mcg of Igalmi, and placebo, respectively, experienced a heart rate (HR) of ≤ 50 beats per minute within two hours of dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In clinical studies with Igalmi, patients were excluded if they had treatment with alpha-1 noradrenergic blockers, benzodiazepines, other hypnotics, or antipsychotic drugs four hours prior to study drug administration; had a history of syncope or syncopal attacks; SBP < 110 mmHg; DBP < 70 mmHg; HR < 55 beats per minute; or had evidence of hypovolemia or orthostatic hypotension.

Reports of hypotension and bradycardia, including some resulting in fatalities, have been associated with the use of another dexmedetomidine product given intravenously (Igalmi is for sublingual or buccal use and is not approved for intravenous use). Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported after administration of this other dexmedetomidine product to young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone and when this product was given by rapid intravenous or bolus administration.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^112DCV2o]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of syncope, specifically in relation to diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension-induced syncope, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend confirming syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when there is a fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline by ≥ 20 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by ≥ 10 mmHg. A decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg that reproduces spontaneous symptoms also confirms the diagnosis.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^115f5hXG]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

If standard orthostatic blood pressure testing does not reveal orthostatic hypotension (OH) in an at-risk individual with unexplained postural symptoms, falls, or syncope, then any of the following are appropriate as next steps:

1. Conducting extended at-home blood pressure monitoring with results recorded by the patient or caregiver.
2. Implementing 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring where the patient can annotate times when supine or standing to determine a typical range of blood pressures during the day and, with patient annotation of position, help to understand fluctuations.
3. Using autonomic function tests.

Some individuals may develop delayed OH later than 3 minutes of standing, which can be identified with prolonged standing blood pressures or prolonged tilt table testing (HUT).

The specialized tests described below are considered by the panel to be beyond the scope of many primary care clinicians and usually require referral to a center specializing in autonomic disorders.

- **Specialized tests for a definitive diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH)**:
	- Autonomic reflex testing, including heart rate variability to paced breathing, heart rate and blood pressure response to a Valsalva maneuver, and continuous blood pressure response to a prolonged HUT.
	- Other tests may include plasma fractionated catecholamine levels and/or sudomotor function testing.

These specialized tests may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of nOH by demonstrating baroreflex dysfunction based on HUT testing with beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement.

### Forteo [^114fcx6F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Forteo should be administered initially in circumstances where the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur. In short-term clinical pharmacology studies of Forteo in healthy volunteers, transient episodes of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension were observed in 5% of volunteers. Typically, these events began within 4 hours of dosing and resolved without treatment within a few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the first several doses, was relieved by placing the person in a reclining position, and did not preclude continued treatment.

- **Risk of digoxin toxicity**: Hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity because Forteo transiently increases serum calcium. Consider the potential onset of signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity when Forteo is used in patients receiving digoxin [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Advise patients with cardiovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, and/or uncontrolled hypertension or hypotension to seek medical care if their condition worsens. Use with caution in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, thromboangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, or Sjögren's syndrome and advise patients to seek medical care if signs and symptoms of potentiation of vascular insufficiency develop. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma develop.

- **Potential impacts on cardiovascular disease**: Alpha-adrenergic agonists may impact blood pressure. Rhofade cream should be used with caution in patients with severe or unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, and uncontrolled hypertension or hypotension. Advise patients with cardiovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, and/or uncontrolled hypertension/hypotension to seek immediate medical care if their condition worsens.

- **Potentiation of vascular insufficiency**: Rhofade cream should be used with caution in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, thromboangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, or Sjögren's syndrome. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if signs and symptoms of potentiation of vascular insufficiency develop.

- **Risk of angle closure glaucoma**: Rhofade cream may increase the risk of angle closure glaucoma in patients with narrow-angle.

### Prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1125eR9U]. Age and Ageing (2021). Low credibility.

Initial orthostatic hypotension (OH) is associated with higher risks of falls, frailty, and syncope in older adults. It affects 27.8% (95% CI: 17.9–40.5%) of the general older population and 35.2% (95% CI: 24.2–48.1%) of geriatric outpatients. Continuous blood pressure monitoring is recommended to diagnose initial OH.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope can have a variety of aetiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries. Syncope is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by a rapid and spontaneous recovery.

Standing for 2 to 3 minutes is usually sufficient to observe the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope; however, in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 minutes of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management. A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is defined as a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.

- **Potential causes of syncope**: Neurogenic OH (nOH; that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction) can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (e.g. hypovolaemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, and falls. Neurogenic OH is frequently comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

In those cases in which the aetiology…

### Abilify [^1153UoqX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Abilify may cause orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonism. The incidence of orthostatic hypotension-associated events from short-term, placebo-controlled trials of adult patients on oral Abilify (n = 2,467) included (Abilify incidence, placebo incidence) orthostatic hypotension (1%, 0.3%), postural dizziness (0.5%, 0.3%), and syncope (0.5%, 0.4%). For pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 years (n = 732) on oral Abilify, the events included orthostatic hypotension (0.5%, 0%), postural dizziness (0.4%, 0%), and syncope (0.2%, 0%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- The incidence of a significant orthostatic change in blood pressure (defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mmHg accompanied by an increase in heart rate ≥ 25 bpm when comparing standing to supine values) for Abilify was not meaningfully different from placebo (Abilify incidence, placebo incidence) in adult oral Abilify-treated patients (4%, 2%), or in pediatric oral Abilify-treated patients aged 6 to 18 years (0.4%, 1%).

	- Abilify should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including Abilify, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and consequent injury.

### Tasmar [^112jTzKe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Hypotension/syncope**: Dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease patients has been associated with orthostatic hypotension. Tolcapone enhances levodopa bioavailability and, therefore, may increase the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension. In TASMAR clinical trials, orthostatic hypotension was documented at least once in 8%, 14%, and 13% of the patients treated with placebo, 100 mg, and 200 mg TASMAR tid, respectively. A total of 2%, 5%, and 4% of the patients treated with placebo, 100 mg, and 200 mg TASMAR tid, respectively, reported orthostatic symptoms at some time during their treatment and also had at least one episode of orthostatic hypotension documented (however, the episode of orthostatic symptoms itself was invariably not accompanied by vital sign measurements). Patients with orthostasis at baseline were more likely than patients without symptoms to have orthostatic hypotension during the study irrespective of treatment group. Additionally, the effect was greater in tolcapone-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. Baseline treatment with dopamine agonists or selegiline did not appear to increase the likelihood of experiencing orthostatic hypotension when treated with TASMAR. Approximately 0.7% of the patients treated with TASMAR (5% of patients who were documented to have had at least one episode of orthostatic hypotension) eventually withdrew from treatment due to adverse events presumably related to hypotension.

- **Clinical trial observations**: In controlled Phase 3 trials, approximately 5%, 4%, and 3% of tolcapone 200 mg tid, 100 mg tid, and placebo patients, respectively, reported experiencing orthostatic hypotension.

### Orthostatic hypotension [^116MVUBT]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a physical finding defined by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology as a systolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing. The condition, which may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, is encountered commonly in family medicine. In healthy individuals, muscle contraction increases venous return of blood to the heart through one-way valves that prevent blood from pooling in dependent parts of the body. The autonomic nervous system responds to changes in position by constricting veins and arteries and increasing heart rate and cardiac contractility. When these mechanisms are faulty or if the patient is hypovolemic, orthostatic hypotension may occur.

In individuals with orthostatic hypotension, gravitational opposition to venous return causes a decrease in blood pressure and threatens cerebral ischemia. Several potential causes of orthostatic hypotension include:

- **Medications**.
- **Non-neurogenic causes**: Impaired venous return, hypovolemia, and cardiac insufficiency.
- **Neurogenic causes**: Multisystem atrophy and diabetic neuropathy.

Treatment generally is aimed at the underlying cause, and a variety of pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic treatments may relieve symptoms.

### Latuda [^113Kqj5R]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Latuda may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, potentially due to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated adverse reactions can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. These risks are generally greatest at the beginning of treatment and during dose escalation. Patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions, or at increased risk of developing complications from hypotension, include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medication, a history of cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), a history of cerebrovascular disease, and patients who are antipsychotic-naïve. In such patients, consider using a lower starting dose and slower titration, and monitor orthostatic vital signs.

Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital sign measurement, was defined by the following vital sign changes: a ≥ 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and a ≥ 10 bpm increase in pulse from sitting to standing or supine to standing positions.

- **Schizophrenia**:
	- **Adults**:
		The incidence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope reported as adverse events from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies was: orthostatic hypotension [0.3% (5/1508) versus placebo 0.1% (1/708)] and syncope [0.1% (2/1508) versus placebo 0% (0/708)].

In short-term schizophrenia clinical studies, orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.8% with Latuda 40 mg and 2.1% with Latuda 80 mg.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, specifically with respect to the orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when there is an asymptomatic fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from a baseline value of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 10 mmHg, or a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg, in the presence of symptoms consistent with orthostatic hypotension.

### Vraylar [^112Vtr17]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension and syncope**: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Generally, the risk is greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was infrequent in trials of VRAYLAR and was not more frequent on VRAYLAR than placebo; syncope was not observed. Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension (e.g. elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, and concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications), patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), and patients with cerebrovascular disease. VRAYLAR has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease, as such patients were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials.

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including VRAYLAR, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

- **Seizures**: Like other antipsychotic drugs, VRAYLAR may cause seizures. This risk is greatest in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113pcNNH]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is a prevalent disorder. Clinicians from a variety of specialties need to be well-informed about the diagnosis and management of nOH, as it carries a significant burden of morbidity and has also been associated with increased mortality. Clinicians should, therefore, familiarize themselves with this condition and evolving management options, which offer substantial symptomatic improvement. This communication will focus primarily on nOH, while recognizing that orthostatic symptoms are often multifactorial; for example, patients with nOH may have their symptoms worsened by medications, hypovolemia, intrinsic cardiovascular disease, and other factors.

The literature on nOH is fraught with inconsistencies in the definition and methods of diagnosis and suffers from a lack of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards 'best practice'. As nOH is a subset of orthostatic hypotension (OH), it should be noted that patients with nOH and OH may experience the same symptoms but for different reasons.

The following consensus definition of OH was devised by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology, and endorsed by the European Federation of Autonomic Societies and the World Federation of Neurology: OH is "… a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg, or both, within 3 min of standing or head-up tilt to at least 60° on a tilt table".

In addition to meeting the definition for OH, patients with nOH have impairment of the autonomic nervous system.

### Hypotensive unawareness in Parkinson's disease-related autonomic dysfunction [^1148F5sQ]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

This case demonstrates how orthostatic hypotension, in the absence of typical symptoms such as light-headedness or dizziness when changing posture, can contribute to the burden of falls in Parkinson's disease. At least one-third of people with severe orthostatic hypotension do not report typical symptoms, and this figure appears to be higher in patients with Parkinson's disease. This is important clinically, as it can increase the difficulty in ascribing falls to orthostatic hypotension, especially given other competing reasons in Parkinson's disease. Orthostatic hypotension symptoms can act as a prompt for the patient to take preventive measures against falls-related injuries. Therefore, there is a clinical requirement to screen for and manage orthostatic hypotension in patients with Parkinson's disease to prevent falls, even in those who do not report typical symptoms.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^111RwECf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

- **Guideline statements**:

	- **Q1. What key clinical features should lead to the diagnosis of SIH being considered?** SIH should be considered in any patient presenting with orthostatic headache (other than following iatrogenic dural puncture or major trauma); 'end of the day' or 'second half of the day' headache with improvement of the headache on lying flat (as defined below); thunderclap headache which is followed by orthostatic headache; and new daily persistent headache with an initial orthostatic quality. The presence of associated symptoms should increase the suspicion of SIH.

	- We recommend a working definition of orthostatic headache as a headache that meets the following criteria:

	- Absent or only mild (1–3/10 on verbal rating scale (VRS)) on waking or after prolonged lying flat.
	- The onset of the headache occurs within 2 hours of becoming upright.
	- After lying flat, the headache should have a 'good' improvement in severity (> 50% on VRS) within 2 hours.
	- The timing of headache onset and offset is consistent.

	- **Q2. What differential diagnoses of SIH should be considered and how should the diagnoses be confirmed?** Differential diagnoses of SIH include postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), orthostatic hypotension, cervicogenic headache, and migraine. PoTS and orthostatic hypotension are diagnosed from a detailed autonomic history and hemodynamic autonomic responses to formal standing tests to document objective evidence of postural tachycardia (increase in heart rate by > 30 beats per minute) or orthostatic hypotension.

### Management of hypertension in the setting of autonomic failure: A pathophysiological approach [^115dZAAz]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

We discuss two cases presenting clinically with disabling orthostatic hypotension and severe supine hypertension, which is a common presentation of autonomic failure and poses challenges to conventional treatment. Clinical findings of isolated autonomic failure were the most prominent manifestation in case 1, whereas a movement disorder was the key finding in case 2. The differential diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension is discussed from a pathophysiological approach. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of disorders of the autonomic nervous system is fundamental for the effective management of these patients and provides insight into more common disorders such as essential hypertension.

### Mirapex [^115LwrAS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Symptomatic hypotension in patients using dopamine agonists is notable, as in both clinical studies and clinical experience, these compounds seem to impair systemic blood pressure regulation, leading to orthostatic hypotension — especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in particular, exhibit a compromised ability to respond to orthostatic challenges. Consequently, individuals with Parkinson's disease and RLS receiving dopaminergic agonists usually require careful monitoring for orthostatic hypotension symptoms during dose escalation and must be informed of this risk [see Precautions, Information for Patients].

In clinical trials of pramipexole, an unexpected finding emerged: despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not higher among those taking Mirapex® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets compared to those on placebo. This outcome, particularly at higher doses for Parkinson's disease, was surprising, given previous experiences with dopamine agonist therapy risks.

While this result might indicate a unique property of pramipexole, it could also relate to the study conditions and the characteristics of the trial population. Patients were titrated very carefully, and individuals with active cardiovascular disease or significant baseline orthostatic hypotension were excluded. Additionally, clinical trials for RLS patients did not include orthostatic challenges with intensive blood pressure monitoring.

### Orthostatic blood pressure recovery patterns in suspected syncope in the emergency department [^111bb6qd]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

It has only recently been recognized that delayed blood pressure (BP) recovery is a cause of unexplained falls and (pre)syncope. It has been associated with similar short-term and long-term risks as classic orthostatic hypotension. In the present syncope guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology and by ACC/AHA/HRS, delayed BP recovery, as a variant of orthostatic hypotension, is not mentioned. In our population, 43% of the patients with delayed BP recovery were classified as unexplained syncope. Compared with those with classic orthostatic hypotension, patients with delayed BP recovery were older, had a higher prevalence of hypertension, and had a higher admission rate. Delayed BP recovery can be seen as a physical sign of subclinical impaired physiology. Therefore, we suggest that older patients presenting to the emergency department with a history of orthostatic (pre)syncope shortly after standing up, but with a negative oscillometric orthostatic BP measurement, be referred to a syncope unit to detect the underlying cause.

Initial orthostatic hypotension was present in eight (7%) patients in our study. This is a common (3%–10%) but unrecognized cause of syncope, usually seen in younger patients. The clinical diagnosis is based on a typical history of (pre)syncope directly on standing and no classic orthostatic hypotension during oscillometric orthostatic BP measurement. The diagnosis becomes certain with detection of initial orthostatic hypotension during continuous non-invasive BP measurement and recognizable symptoms. Recognition by the physician is important because management is simple.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117K1NdP]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients in each of these groups have a higher risk of OH/nOH when compared to the normal population. For these five categories of patients, clinicians should ask about cardinal symptoms of OH, their frequency and severity, how long they can stand, and the effect of symptoms on their activities of daily living. Questions about symptoms should also note the time of day when the symptoms occur, as symptoms of OH/nOH are most likely to occur in the morning and after meals.

If a patient gives a positive response to one or more of the screening questions, they should be considered at risk for OH/nOH. In such cases, a more comprehensive evaluation, including orthostatic vital signs, needs to be conducted to confirm a diagnosis of OH/nOH. From a practical standpoint, at the minimum, the patient should be asked a variation of the question, "Do you have symptoms when you stand up or within 3–5 minutes of standing, and do they get better when you sit or lie down?"

Because falls are of considerable consequence to aging patients, a specific question about the circumstances of falls is appropriate. Clinicians must recognize that some patients are reluctant to admit symptoms of OH or falls, fearing that they may lose their autonomy due to family members' insistence on enhancing their safety.

- **Screening questions for suspected OH/nOH**:
	* Any positive response should prompt further investigation with orthostatic blood pressure measurements.

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^113rDGxT]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Our study results indicate that syncope and orthostatic hypotension are two factors that may be overlooked during fracture prevention. During the last decade, falls clinics have been implemented on a small scale. Falls clinics and syncope units constitute an important tool in the management of unexplained falls, syncope, and orthostatic hypotension. Although large randomised studies are currently lacking, our findings support the importance of implementing multidisciplinary teams with falls and syncope specialists. In addition, general preventive efforts against fracture and fall should be undertaken, for example, restrictive use of medications known to increase fall risk (e.g. antihypertensive and psychotropic drugs), implementation of home hazard reduction (e.g. rails, nonslip mats, the use of shoes with nonslip soles), and tailored exercise programmes improving mobility and quality of life. Lifestyle changes with proper nutrition are also essential since nutritional status is an independent predictor of falls in older people living in the community.

The observed increased risk of incident fractures in individuals with orthostatic hypotension compared with syncope in the present study may result from possible concomitant diseases such as Parkinson's disease or dementia, which are well-established factors associated with postural instability and gait dysfunction that may lead to an increased risk for falls and injuries. Although such investigations are beyond the scope of this study, further research is necessary to explore these associations thoroughly.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^113ze6DC]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, specifically concerning orthostatic rehabilitation, the SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend considering orthostatic rehabilitation. This addresses deconditioning affecting both skeletal muscle and autonomic postural responses in patients who have been bedbound, particularly those exhibiting symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, pre-existing postural tachycardia syndrome, and/or hypermobility syndromes.

### Neupro [^113FBVBW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Symptomatic hypotension**: Dopaminergic agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, resulting in postural/orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, both Parkinson's and Restless Legs Syndrome patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily (1) require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and (2) should be informed of this risk.

An increased risk for decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed when supine, standing, and changing from supine to standing position in patients treated with NEUPRO. In patients taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, orthostatic (change from supine to standing) decreases in systolic blood pressure (at least 20 mm Hg or greater) was 16% for NEUPRO and 14% for placebo in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, 32% for NEUPRO and 27% for placebo in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and 13% for NEUPRO and 11% for placebo in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome.

More severe decreases in systolic blood pressure (40 mm Hg or greater) and in diastolic blood pressure (20 mm Hg or greater) also occurred more frequently (NEUPRO incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) in patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease during measurements when supine, standing, or changing from supine to standing.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^115dLWq1]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can seriously impair patients' quality of life and is associated with increased morbidity, especially in the elderly. In several neurological diseases associated with autonomic failure, NOH is a major contributor to disease burden and reduced quality of life. A structured approach is important in the management of patients with NOH. Non-pharmacological interventions should be the first line of therapy. If the symptoms persist and the patients are severely affected, pharmacological interventions are required.

### Orthostatic hypotension: A prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease [^115Ys43s]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder involving both motor and nonmotor symptoms. The prodromal phase of PD can start as early as 20 years prior to diagnosis and is dominated by nonmotor signs, including constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder, and hyposmia. Orthostatic hypotension has also been described as a common nonmotor sign of PD, but was typically attributed to a later stage of the disease.

Recent studies have suggested that orthostatic hypotension can already develop in the prodromal phase of PD. Determining whether orthostatic hypotension should be considered a prodromal marker of PD is important because prodromal markers allow earlier recognition of PD and could help identify individuals eligible for neuroprotective trials. Furthermore, early recognition and treatment of orthostatic hypotension and other nonmotor symptoms of PD are required because these symptoms negatively impact quality of life.

The association between orthostatic hypotension and the risk of PD has been limitedly studied so far. Some small studies have shown an increased risk of PD in participants with orthostatic hypotension. Also, a large registry-based study has demonstrated that participants with hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, carried an increased risk of PD. However, the association between orthostatic hypotension and PD has not been prospectively studied in a large sample of the general population yet.

Thus, we aimed to identify whether orthostatic hypotension in the general population is…

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117EdaHs]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, little published literature is available on a "standardized approach" to the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with orthostatic hypotension/neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH/nOH) and associated supine hypertension. As such, the recommendations of this panel, which were based on the discussions and experiences of the panel along with evidence in the literature, should provide clinicians with a useful working approach to dealing with this complex condition.

The panel recommended that additional study in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension is necessary. In particular, additional studies of the treatment of nOH should be conducted to refine the diagnosis and treatment algorithms and to provide definitive evidence of efficacy and safety of medications that are currently used, but not approved, for the treatment of patients with nOH.

### Orthostatic hypotension among outpatients with ischemic stroke [^114oJhNn]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension is an essential component of stroke prevention; however, the clinical management of patients with cerebrovascular disease is complicated by orthostatic hypotension (OH). The primary objectives were to determine the prevalence of OH in a stroke outpatient clinic, describe categories of OH, and identify factors independently associated with the presence of OH.

- **Methods**: Veterans with stroke, cared for in a multidisciplinary stroke clinic, were included. OH was defined as a ≥ 20 mmHg fall in systolic blood pressure (BP), a ≥ 10 mmHg fall in diastolic BP, or a ≥ 10 mmHg fall in systolic BP with symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with OH, including demographics, comorbidities, stroke severity, and baseline BP.

- **Results**: Among 60 patients with stroke, 16 (27%) patients had OH. Among those with OH, half were hypertensive, seven were normotensive, and one was hypotensive. A history of coronary artery disease was independently associated with the presence of OH.

- **Conclusions**: Orthostatic hypotension is present in about one quarter of outpatients with stroke, and coronary artery disease appears to be a risk factor. Stroke patients should be screened for OH given that the presence of positional BP changes may alter clinical management.

### Canadian guideline for Parkinson disease [^112rSTnM]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, specifically for the management of autonomic dysfunction, the CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend offering the following general measures for orthostatic hypotension:

- **Avoid aggravating factors**: Such as large meals, alcohol, exposure to warm environments, and drugs known to cause orthostatic hypotension (e.g. diuretics or antihypertensive drugs). Recognize that levodopa and dopamine agonists may also worsen orthostatic hypotension.

- **Increase salt intake**: This is recommended for symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.

- **Ensure head-up tilt of the bed**: This should be done at night.

- **Wear elastic stockings**.

- **Recognize postprandial hypotension**: In some patients, hypotension occurs only after meals. Warn patients about this effect and advise taking frequent small meals.

### Orthostatic hypotension and psychiatric comorbidities in patients with dizziness [^1136cjLN]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

The present study was undertaken to investigate orthostatic hypotension and psychiatric comorbidities, specifically anxiety and depression, in patients experiencing dizziness.

- **Materials and methods**: Sixty-three patients with nonspecific dizziness and 27 volunteer subjects were evaluated using the head-up tilt test (HUTT) and the Standardized Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Axis I.

- **Results**: Orthostatic hypotension was induced by HUTT in 44% of patients and in 15% of volunteers (P = 0.0082). We found that the incidence of anxiety and depression was significantly higher in patients with nonspecific dizziness than in controls (P < .05). Orthostatic hypotension was related to age but not to antihypertensive therapy and sex. Dizziness during the HUTT was reported by 49% of patients and 33% of volunteers (P = 0.2469). Among patients, dizziness was found to be related to sex (female) and anxiety. A correlation between dizziness and anxiety was also present in volunteers. The head-up tilt test induced vasovagal reactions in 2 volunteers.

- **Conclusions**: Orthostatic hypotension is present in a high percentage of patients with orthostatic dizziness, and anxiety and depression are important factors in the onset of dizziness. A high percentage of abnormal responses in volunteer subjects seems to indicate that the HUTT is not suitable for routine use.
