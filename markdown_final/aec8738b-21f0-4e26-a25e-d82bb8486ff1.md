## Question

Best test for hernia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnostic test is best for hernia across clinical scenarios and how to choose it step-by-step. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the presentation is straightforward or occult. Then, I should verify the hernia type because inguinal, ventral/incisional, hiatal, internal, and pediatric hernias have different optimal modalities. Next, I will review the comparative accuracy of ultrasound, CT, and MRI, and I need to check operator dependence and interobserver variability. After that, I should align choices with guideline-backed algorithms and special populations like pregnancy, pediatrics, and athletes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and explicitly state the "best test" for common scenarios while noting exceptions and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: the best test is the one that answers the clinical question with the least harm and greatest impact on management, and in many hernia presentations, a careful history and physical examination remain the initial and often sufficient step, reserving imaging for uncertainty, preoperative planning, or suspected complications [^1135xHQE].

> Now, I will examine inguinal hernia because it is the most common scenario. Wait, let me verify the first-line imaging when the exam is equivocal: ultrasound is recommended as the initial test due to accessibility, safety, and good performance, with pooled sensitivity around 86–96% and specificity around 77–85% in meta-analyses, and it can reliably distinguish inguinal from femoral hernias when performed dynamically with Valsalva maneuvers [^1138Bikk] [^115NtX1G] [^115gFHqz] [^115fi1qS]. Hold on, I should double-check the caveat: ultrasound accuracy drops in obesity and in truly occult presentations without a palpable bulge, and operator dependence is nontrivial, so a negative ultrasound does not exclude hernia when clinical suspicion remains high [^115gFHqz] [^112xcnCo].

> For occult inguinal hernia with persistent groin pain and negative or inconclusive ultrasound, I need to ensure we escalate appropriately. MRI has the highest diagnostic yield in this niche, with sensitivity and specificity around 91–92% in surgical cohorts, and it outperforms CT and ultrasound for subtle posterior wall defects and small hernias; CT can be a reasonable alternative if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, but it is less sensitive for occult disease [^116UAZMN]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said CT is best across the board for occult hernia — let me correct that: MRI is generally preferred when available for occult inguinal hernia, whereas CT is better reserved for alternative pathology or when MRI is not feasible [^116UAZMN].

> Next, I should review ventral and incisional hernias. CT is the most accurate modality for diagnosis and characterization when the exam is uncertain or for preoperative planning, with sensitivity and specificity approaching 98–100% in comparative studies, and it delineates fascial defects, contents, and relationships to mesh or viscera; ultrasound can be a useful radiation-sparing alternative, and surgeon-performed dynamic abdominal sonography (DASH) performs well in experienced hands but may miss small or deep defects [^113iejFW] [^114RaLLq] [^1135XdnX]. I need to ensure I mention interobserver variability: CT interpretation for ventral hernia recurrence has only moderate agreement without standardized criteria, so clear communication of surgical questions and standardized reporting templates improve diagnostic reliability [^116cwXxz].

> For suspected strangulation or incarceration, I should confirm that contrast-enhanced CT is the imaging of choice because it rapidly detects obstruction, ischemia, and complications. In the ED, point-of-care ultrasound can triage and identify nonreducible contents or absent Doppler flow, but CT should follow when feasible to guide urgent operative planning and risk stratification [^1135xHQE] [^111d3DtM] [^117NRyP4]. Hold on, I should verify that we do not delay surgery for imaging in unstable patients — clinical judgment and timely exploration take precedence when ischemia is suspected [^1135xHQE].

> I will now examine hiatal hernia. Endoscopy and barium esophagography are traditional, but high-resolution manometry (HRM) has excellent sensitivity and specificity for sliding hiatal hernia and complements endoscopy; importantly, testing should be tailored to whether results will change management, so I need to ensure we do not over-order physiologic testing when it won't alter care [^117KHpSg] [^112wA3eD]. But wait, what if the question is reflux phenotype or surgical planning? In that case, HRM and endoscopy together provide the most complete picture for antireflux strategy [^117KHpSg].

> For internal hernia, especially after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, I should double-check CT performance. CT is widely used but has variable sensitivity and specificity; nonetheless, it remains the pragmatic first-line test in the acute setting, with recognition of signs like the whirlpool sign and clustered, dilated loops; diagnostic laparoscopy is often needed when imaging is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains high [^112aP9pK] [^115u6wHa]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — CT can be falsely negative, so persistent symptoms with high suspicion warrant operative exploration rather than repeated imaging delays [^112aP9pK].

> In pediatrics, I need to check the role of ultrasound. For inguinal hernia and contralateral patent processus vaginalis, ultrasound has high diagnostic accuracy and is preferred over radiation-containing modalities. For epigastric versus umbilical hernias, ultrasound helps differentiate anatomy and guide counseling, though routine ultrasound is not necessary when the diagnosis is clear on exam [^114WLcLn] [^114UQzjc] [^111fkMUE]. Let me reconsider the caveat: variability in sonographic criteria for CPPV can overestimate metachronous hernia risk, so results must be interpreted in clinical context and with awareness of heterogeneity across studies [^114UQzjc].

> In pregnancy, I should confirm that ultrasound is first-line for groin swelling to distinguish hernia from round ligament varicosities, and CT is generally avoided unless absolutely necessary. If cross-sectional imaging is essential, MRI without gadolinium is preferred, balancing maternal-fetal safety with diagnostic needs [^113jgKdN] [^115u6wHa]. Wait, I need to ensure we also counsel that many groin swellings in pregnancy resolve postpartum, supporting expectant management when feasible [^113jgKdN].

> For athletes with inguinal-related groin pain and no palpable hernia, I should verify that MRI is the modality of choice to evaluate posterior inguinal wall disruption and concurrent musculoskeletal pathologies. Ultrasound can screen for hernia but has lower sensitivity for occult defects in this population, and integrating clinical and MRI findings improves diagnostic confidence [^112bFhrK]. Hold on, I should emphasize that many cases reflect multifactorial pain generators rather than a discrete hernia, which is why MRI's comprehensive soft-tissue assessment is particularly valuable here [^112bFhrK].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. Start with history and physical examination; if the diagnosis is clear, no imaging is needed. If the exam is equivocal, choose ultrasound first for inguinal hernia, CT for ventral/incisional hernia or suspected complications, and MRI for occult inguinal hernia or athletic groin pain. In emergencies with suspected strangulation, proceed to contrast-enhanced CT without delay, using ultrasound only as a rapid bedside adjunct. Always correlate imaging with clinical suspicion, and if the first test is negative but suspicion remains high, escalate modality rather than repeating the same study [^1135xHQE] [^117FMeqv] [^116EASse].

> So, what is the "best test"? I should state this clearly and then qualify it. For inguinal hernia with equivocal exam, ultrasound is the best initial test. For occult inguinal hernia with negative ultrasound, MRI is the best definitive test. For ventral or incisional hernia, especially when planning surgery or evaluating complications, CT is the best test. For suspected strangulation or incarceration, contrast-enhanced CT is the best emergent test. For hiatal hernia when physiologic assessment will change management, high-resolution manometry is the best physiologic test. For pediatric inguinal hernia and CPPV, ultrasound is the best test. For athletic groin pain without a palpable hernia, MRI is the best test. I need to ensure I reiterate that the best test is context-dependent and that clinical judgment governs escalation when imaging and exam diverge [^1138Bikk] [^116UAZMN] [^113iejFW] [^1135xHQE] [^117KHpSg] [^114WLcLn] [^112bFhrK].

---

The best test for hernia diagnosis is **clinical examination** for most cases, with **ultrasound** as the first-line imaging when the exam is inconclusive or in special populations (e.g. pediatrics, pregnancy, athletes) [^1138Bikk] [^115BLbep]. For complex, recurrent, or preoperative planning, **CT** is preferred for its comprehensive anatomic detail and detection of complications [^115BLbep] [^113iejFW]. MRI is reserved for **occult or equivocal cases** when ultrasound is negative but suspicion remains high [^116UAZMN] [^116EASse]. Choose imaging based on clinical context, patient factors, and local expertise [^116mgPb9].

---

## Clinical examination

Clinical examination is the **initial diagnostic method** for hernias, with high sensitivity and specificity in straightforward cases [^1135xHQE]. It includes inspection, palpation, and provocative maneuvers (e.g. cough impulse, Valsalva) to identify reducible masses and characterize defects [^115VMjV4]. However, accuracy may be limited in obesity, recurrent hernias, or equivocal findings, necessitating imaging [^1135xHQE].

---

## Ultrasound

Ultrasound is the **first-line imaging** modality for hernia diagnosis, particularly for inguinal, femoral, and umbilical hernias [^notfound]. It is non-invasive, widely available, and does not involve radiation, making it suitable for repeated use and for special populations such as children and pregnant women [^113jgKdN]. Ultrasound provides real-time visualization of the hernia sac, contents, and reducibility, and can differentiate between direct and indirect inguinal hernias [^115fi1qS]. However, its accuracy is operator-dependent and may be limited in obese patients or those with extensive scar tissue [^112xcnCo].

---

## Computed tomography (CT)

CT is the **preferred imaging modality** for complex hernias, recurrent hernias, or when preoperative planning is required [^115BLbep]. It provides detailed anatomical information, including the size and location of the hernia defect, hernia contents, and relationship to surrounding structures [^112GDMPZ]. CT is particularly useful in detecting complications such as incarceration, strangulation, or bowel obstruction, and is the modality of choice in acute settings [^1135xHQE]. However, CT involves radiation exposure and may not be suitable for repeated use or for certain populations, such as pregnant women [^115u6wHa].

---

## Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI is **reserved for cases** where ultrasound and CT are inconclusive or when detailed soft tissue characterization is required [^115BLbep]. MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and is particularly useful in diagnosing occult hernias, sports hernias, and in patients with complex anatomy or prior surgical interventions [^116UAZMN]. MRI does not involve radiation exposure, making it suitable for repeated use and for special populations. However, MRI is expensive, less widely available, and may not be suitable for patients with certain implants or claustrophobia.

## Comparative summary of diagnostic modalities

| **Modality** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clinical examination | - Non-invasive <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Immediate results | - Limited accuracy in obesity, recurrent hernias, or equivocal cases | Initial diagnostic method for most hernias |
| Ultrasound | - Non-invasive <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Real-time imaging <br/> - Widely available | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited accuracy in obesity or scar tissue | - First-line imaging <br/> - Pediatrics <br/> - Pregnancy <br/> - Athletes |
| CT | - Detailed anatomical information <br/> - Detection of complications <br/> - Useful for preoperative planning | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Expensive <br/> - Not suitable for repeated use | - Complex hernias <br/> - Recurrent hernias <br/> - Acute settings <br/> - Preoperative planning |
| MRI | - Excellent soft tissue contrast <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Useful for occult hernias | - Expensive <br/> - Less widely available <br/> - Contraindications (implants, claustrophobia) | - Occult hernias <br/> - Sports hernias <br/> - Complex cases |

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**, starting with clinical examination, followed by ultrasound if the diagnosis is uncertain, and escalating to CT or MRI if necessary [^116EASse]. The choice of imaging modality should be individualized based on patient factors, clinical presentation, and local expertise [^116mgPb9].

---

## Conclusion

The best test for hernia diagnosis depends on the clinical context. Clinical examination is the **initial diagnostic method** for most hernias, while ultrasound is the **first-line imaging** modality when additional information is needed. CT is preferred for complex or recurrent hernias, and MRI is reserved for cases where ultrasound and CT are inconclusive or when detailed soft tissue characterization is required.

## References

### Is herniography useful and safe? [^116x51p9]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

117 consecutive herniograms were reviewed for patients who had symptoms suggestive of hernia but with no evidence or inconclusive findings on physical examination. The traditional approach has been to explore patients with suspected occult hernias. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of herniography in minimizing needless groin exploration and to evaluate its safety. Thirty-three herniograms were positive and showed unilateral and bilateral inguinal hernias. There were no false positive examinations and two false negative examinations. No complications were present. Patients with positive herniograms were explored, and operative findings correlated well with herniographic findings. Twenty-four patients were referred to other specialities. Follow-up in clinic and telephone interviews showed symptomatic improvement in the majority of patients. Herniography is useful in evaluating obscure groin pain and occult hernias. It is a safe procedure and more cost effective than a negative exploration or diagnostic laparoscopy.

### Localized postinflammatory hyperpigmentation with abdominal wall protrusion [^1144uz67]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most sensitive diagnostic test to help confirm the diagnosis?
A. CT abdomen and pelvis
B. Electromyography (EMG)
C. Skin biopsy
D. Herpes serology
E. MRI abdomen

Answers:
A. CT abdomen and pelvis – Incorrect. A CT scan may be done to exclude a true abdominal hernia or other intra-abdominal pathology. However, it is not necessary, and is not the most sensitive test. Our patient's imaging showed a small incidental umbilical hernia with no evidence of lateral wall defect (Fig 3).
B. Electromyography (EMG) – Correct. Postherpetic pseudohernia is a motor complication of herpes zoster resulting from ventral nerve root denervation, leading to paralysis of the ipsilateral abdominal wall musculatureEMG is a highly sensitive diagnostic modality that can detect this acute denervation, supporting the clinical diagnosis. Nerve conduction studies can also be combined with EMG to rule out other neuropathies; in cases of pseudohernia, nerve conduction studies are often normal. In this case, electrodiagnostic studies were deemed unnecessary given the close temporal correlation between rash onset and abdominal protrusion.
C. Skin biopsy – Incorrect. A biopsy would reveal patchy epidermal or dermal melanosis consistent with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and not provide additional diagnostic information. Of note, a skin biopsy may be used to aid the diagnosis of a small fiber neuropathy; however, postherpetic pseudohernia is due to motor neuropathy.
D. Herpes serology – Incorrect. Serologic testing is not reliable for diagnosing acute herpes zoster; varicella zoster virus IgM may show delayed or cross-reactive responses, and varicella zoster virus IgG only indicates past exposure.
E. MRI abdomen – Incorrect. Although MRI abdomen may show increased T2/short-tau inversion recovery signal intensity in the abdominal wall muscles suggestive of acute denervation, it is not a first line diagnostic modality.

### Diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography in predicting contralateral inguinal hernia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UQzjc]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The incidence of children developing metachronous contralateral inguinal hernia (MCIH) is 7–15%. Contralateral groin exploration during unilateral hernia repair can prevent MCIH development and subsequent second surgery and anaesthesia. Preoperative ultrasonography is a less invasive strategy and potentially able to detect contralateral patent processus vaginalis (CPPV) prior to MCIH development.

Methods

We queried MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane library to identify studies regarding children aged < 18 years diagnosed with unilateral inguinal hernia without clinical signs of contralateral hernia, who underwent preoperative ultrasonography of the contralateral groin. We assessed heterogeneity and used a random-effects model to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Results

Fourteen studies (2120 patients) were included, seven (1013 patients) in the meta-analysis. In studies using surgical exploration as reference test (n = 4, 494 patients), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 88% respectively. In studies using contralateral exploration as reference test following positive and clinical follow-up after negative ultrasonographic test results (n = 3, 519 patients), pooled sensitivity was 86% and specificity 98%. The AUC (0.984) shows high diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography for detecting CPPV, although diagnostic ultrasonographic criteria largely differ and large heterogeneity exists. Reported inguinal canal diameters in children with CPPV were 2.70 ± 1.17 mm, 6.8 ± 1.3 mm and 9.0 ± 1.9 mm.

Conclusion

Diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography to detect CPPV seems promising, though may result in an overestimation of MCIH prevalence, since CPPV does not invariably lead to MCIH. Unequivocal ultrasonographic criteria are mandatory for proper diagnosis of CPPV and subsequent prediction of MCIH.

Key Points

- Diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography for detection of CPPV in children with unilateral inguinal hernia is high.

- Preoperative ultrasonographic evaluation of the contralateral groin assumedly results in an overestimation of MCIH prevalence.

- Unequivocal ultrasonographic criteria are mandatory for proper diagnosis of CPPV and risk factor identification is needed to predict whether CPPV develops into clinically apparent MCIH.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^116Mzma8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Management of extraesophageal reflux symptoms advises: Best Practice Advice 7: Lack of response to aggressive acid suppressive therapy combined with normal pH testing off therapy or impedance-pH testing on therapy significantly reduces the likelihood that reflux is a contributing etiology in presenting extraesophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 8: Surgical fundoplication is discouraged in those with extra esophageal reflux symptoms unresponsive to aggressive PPI therapy. Best Practice Advice 9: Fundoplication should only be considered in those with a mechanical defect (e.g., hiatal hernia), moderate to severe reflux at baseline off PPI therapy who have continued reflux despite PPI therapy and have failed more conservative non-GI treatments.

### Diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography in predicting contralateral inguinal hernia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1154Nans]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol

A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement on all literature regarding preoperative ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool for contralateral inguinal hernia in children. The protocol was registered (PROSPERO 2017, CRD42017058269).

Literature search

We queried EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane library databases and reference lists of eligible articles for the selection of studies. The search strategy was conducted in December 2016 (Appendix 1) and updated in November 2017.

Eligibility criteria

Articles were considered eligible irrespective of language or publication date and status. Inclusion criteria were (a) children under 18 years old diagnosed with unilateral inguinal hernia who had (b) no clinical signs of contralateral hernia and (c) underwent preoperative ultrasonography of the contralateral groin prior to surgical hernia repair. Patients diagnosed with (a) bilateral inguinal hernia or (b) inguinal hernia associated with non-descendent testis were excluded from data analysis.

Study selection and methodological quality assessment

Two reviewers independently performed the screening and selection of studies based on title and abstract, and full text for final selection. The full text of articles was retrieved by contacting the authors if it was not available via our library and attempts were made to translate articles that were not reported in English. The most complete study was included if the same data was repeatedly reported. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to independently assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Inconsistencies were solved by second joint review of the literature or by consulting a third independent review author.

Data extraction and analysis

Appendix 2 comprises data that was systematically extracted from the studies included in this systematic review by the two reviewers and recorded in a data collection form. Missing data were calculated if possible and unpublished data or further details were retrieved by contacting study author(s).

Surgery, i.e. contralateral exploration, and clinical follow-up were used as the reference standard following positive index test results. Negative index test results were followed by surgery, clinical follow-up or no reference test. Studies that performed contralateral exploration in all patients, regardless of the index test results, are referred to as 'complete cases'. Studies that solely performed contralateral exploration following positive index test results are referred to as 'incomplete cases'.

### The accuracy of ultrasound in the diagnosis of clinically occult groin hernias in adults [^116y65jT]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

This prospective study examined the accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosing occult groin hernias in adults. The study included 52 consecutive patients reviewed in the surgical out-patient clinic with a history suggestive of groin hernia but with a normal or inconclusive clinical examination. Each patient underwent a preliminary ultrasound examination by an experienced consultant radiologist who was aware that the patient had a history suggestive of a hernia but was blinded to the side of the symptoms. The patient then proceeded to herniography, and some patients also had surgical exploration. The results of the ultrasound were assessed in relation to the herniography, and the patients who proceeded to surgical exploration had further correlation with surgery. Ultrasound had a sensitivity of 29% and specificity of 90% compared with the herniography. Correlation with surgical findings showed ultrasound to have a sensitivity of 33% and a specificity of 100%. The sensitivity of ultrasound in detecting clinically occult hernias in a non-acute presentation is poor, and patients with normal ultrasound should be considered for further investigation.

### Abstracts of ESPR 2013, the European society of paediatric radiology 50th annual meeting and 36th postgraduate course. June 3–7 2013. budapest, Hungary [^1118U2H5]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is one of the best known malformations requiring surgical repair in newborns and young infants. Two main types are posterolateral, Bochdalek hernia accounting for the majority (90%) and about 80% being left sided, and anterior Morgagni hernia which is more common on the right side. Depending on the location and size of the hernia abdominal organs move into the chest cavity compressing and displacing normal structures. Since this compression is already present in fetal life normal genesis of both ipsi- and contralateral lung is altered. The degree of consequent lung hypoplasia is the major determinant of postnatal prognosis. Clinical signs of severe respiratory distress are present from birth in severe cases, while mild cases may manifest later. Prenatal ultrasound has variable performance, it can detect about 60% of the cases by the 24th gestational week. Prenatal MRI enables better differentiation of abdominal structures herniated in the chest. The severity of pulmonary hypoplasia is most reliably assessed by lung volume measurement which is currently most accurately measured on MRI images. After birth conventional radiography of the chest and abdomen shows partial opacification of a hemithorax with contralateral shift of the mediastinum with displaced NG tube. Later when the GI tract is air-filled bowel loops or stomach are identified in the chest instead of the normal intraabdominal location. CT or postnatal MRI is seldom performed in CDH, mainly in cases where differential diagnostic information is needed.

Imaging the small Airways in Children: why, when and how?

Catherine M. Owens

GOSH and University College, London UK

Why and When?

Diseases affecting the small airways in children can be difficult to detect when using traditional diagnostic tests. Indeed widespread airway involvement is usually present before we are able to demonstrate either clinical symptomatology, abnormalities on basic pulmonary function testing, or abnormal plain chest radiographs. Bronchiolar obstruction may be detected indirectly, by computed tomography (CT), manifest as regional under-ventilation and air trapping. This in turn will result in the body's homeostatic mechanisms then causing reduced pulmonary arterial perfusion to these nonfunctional (area of obstructive over inflated) airways. On CT this is manifest as oligaemia and more hyper lucent lung contributing to the 'mosaic attenuation' within the lung parenchyma.

### 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^117NRyP4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to evaluation for bowel strangulation, WSES 2017 guidelines recommend to assess for systemic inflammatory response syndrome, obtain contrast-enhanced CT, serum lactate, creatinine phosphokinase, and D-dimer to assess for bowel strangulation.

### Ultrasonography in diagnosing clinically occult groin hernia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115gFHqz]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide an updated systematic review on the performance of ultrasonography (US) in diagnosing clinically occult groin hernia.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE and Embase. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed. Accuracy data of US in detecting clinically occult groin hernia were extracted. Positive predictive value (PPV) was pooled with a random effects model. For studies investigating the performance of US in hernia type classification (inguinal vs femoral), correctly classified proportion was assessed.

Results

Sixteen studies were included. In the two studies without verification bias, sensitivities were 29.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 15.1–47.5%] and 90.9% (95% CI, 70.8–98.9%); specificities were 90.0% (95% CI, 80.5–95.9%) and 90.6% (95% CI, 83.0–95.6%). Verification bias or a variation of it (i.e. study limited to only subjects with definitive proof of disease status) was present in all other studies. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) were not pooled. PPV ranged from 58.8 to 100%. Pooled PPV, based on data from ten studies with low risk of bias and no applicability concerns with respect to patient selection, was 85.6% (95% CI, 76.5–92.7%). Proportion of correctly classified hernias, based on data from four studies, ranged between 94.4% and 99.1%.

Conclusions

Sensitivity, specificity and NPV of US in detecting clinically occult groin hernia cannot reliably be determined based on current evidence. Further studies are necessary. Accuracy may strongly depend on the examiner's skills. PPV is high. Inguinal and femoral hernias can reliably be differentiated by US.

Key Points

- Sensitivity, specificity and NPV of ultrasound in detecting clinically occult groin hernia cannot reliably be determined based on current evidence.
- Accuracy may strongly depend on the examiner's skills.
- PPV of US in detection of clinically occult groin hernia is high [pooled PPV of 85.6% (95% confidence interval, 76.5–92.7%)].
- US has very high performance in correctly differentiating between clinically occult inguinal and femoral hernia (correctness of 94.4–99.1%).

### Update of the international herniaSurge guidelines for groin hernia management [^113GAjJq]. BJS Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to terminology, HSG 2023 guidelines recommend to use the following terminology for groin hernias:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Acutely irreducible hernia|- A hernia in which the contents cannot be reduced on physical examination but were previously reducible before the acute onset of symptoms|
|Chronically irreducible hernia|- A long-standing hernia in which the contents cannot be reduced on physical examination and is not associated with sudden onset of new symptoms|
|Strangulated hernia|- A hernia with strangulated content which can only be described as such after the diagnosis is confirmed by preoperative imaging or intraoperative findings.|

### Use of computed tomography in diagnosing ventral hernia recurrence: a blinded, prospective, multispecialty evaluation [^116cwXxz]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Physical examination misses up to one-third of ventral hernia recurrences seen on radiologic imaging. However, tests such as computed tomographic (CT) imaging are subject to interpretation and require validation of interobserver reliability.

Objective

To determine the interobserver reliability of CT scans for detecting a ventral hernia recurrence among surgeons and radiologists. We hypothesized there would be significant disagreement in the diagnosis of a ventral hernia recurrence among different observers. Our secondary aim was to determine reasons for disagreement in the interpretation of CT scans.

Design, Setting, and Participants

One hundred patients who underwent ventral hernia repair from 2010–2011 at an academic health care center with a postoperative CT scan were randomly selected from a larger cohort. This study was conducted from July 2014 to March 2015. Prospective assessment of the presence or absence of a recurrent ventral hernia on CT scans was compared among 9 blinded reviewers and the radiology report. Five reviewers (consensus group) met to discuss all CT scans with disagreement. The discussion was assessed for keywords and key concepts. The remaining 4 reviewers (validation group) read the consensus group recommendations and reassessed the CT scans. Pre- and post-review κ were calculated; the post-review assessments were compared with clinical examination findings.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Interobserver reliability in determining hernia recurrence radiographically.

Results

Of 100 CT scans, there was disagreement among all 9 reviewers and the radiology report on the presence/absence of a ventral hernia in 73 cases (κ = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.35–0.54; P < .001). Following discussion among the consensus group, there remained disagreement in 10 cases (κ = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83–0.95; P < .001). Among the validation group, the κ value had a slight improvement from 0.21 (95% CI, 0.12–0.33) to 0.34 (95% CI, 0.23–0.46) (P < .001) after reviewing the consensus group proposals. There was disagreement between clinical examination and the consensus group assessment of CT scans on the presence/absence of a ventral hernia in 25 cases. The concepts most frequently discussed were the absence of an accepted definition for a radiographic ventral hernia and differentiating pseudorecurrence from recurrence.

Conclusions and Relevance

Owing to the high interobserver variability, CT scan was not associated with reliable diagnosing in ventral hernia recurrence. Consensus guidelines and improved communication between surgeon and radiologist may decrease interobserver variability.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of radiology in the diagnosis of occult inguinal hernia [^113j2uSs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Inguinal hernias are a common cause of groin pain. Most hernias are detectable by clinical examination and many patients proceed to hernia repair on the basis of history and examination findings alone. However, a significant proportion of patients with symptoms suggestive of groin hernia are found to have a normal clinical examination. Several radiological techniques have been developed to solve the dilemma posed by occult inguinal hernias. No systematic review or meta-analysis has addressed this common clinical problem.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken of relevant articles in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane database. Studies were assessed using the QUADAS tool. Statistical analysis was undertaken.

Results

We have shown in this meta-analysis that ultrasound has a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 77% in occult inguinal hernias. Computed tomography has a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 65%. Herniography has a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 83%.

Conclusions

Based on this systematic review, herniography should be considered as the initial investigation for occult inguinal hernia where available. In centers where this is not available, ultrasound of the groin should be used with good clinical judgment. When there is still diagnostic uncertainty, further investigation with magnetic resonance imaging should be considered to exclude alternative pathology.

### Point-of care ultrasound in stratifying clinically evolving inguinal and femoral hernias [^111d3DtM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is an optimal imaging modality for the risk stratification of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with inguinal and femoral hernias, allowing for better evaluation of clinical presentations and guiding appropriate treatment. The lack of ultrasound classification for inguinal and femoral hernias has led to inconsistent use and often underuse of POCUS in this patient population. Several groin hernia classifications are available, but most are complex and often targeted toward surgical management.

Objectives

The objective of this study is to review the use of POCUS in the diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias, providing a synopsis of critical ultrasound findings in determining signs of incarceration, strangulation, and small bowel obstruction, and suggesting a simple and educative sonographic classification for inguinal or femoral hernias.

Discussion

POCUS can reliably confirm the presence of groin hernias and can uniquely identify specific ultrasound findings predictive of complications, such as aperistaltic nonreducible bowel loops, free fluid in the hernia sac, and lack of color doppler in the entrapped mesentery and bowel walls. POCUS can also aid in determining the presence of small bowel obstruction by detecting dilated loops of bowel > 25 mm adjacent and proximal to the hernia site.

Conclusions

In the ED, POCUS can confirm the presence of a hernia sac and identify and predict surgical emergencies, such as bowel incarceration or strangulation, which are the most important elements in the management of patients presenting with possible inguinal or femoral hernias.

### Watchful waiting versus totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair for occult inguinal hernia and pain (EFFECT trial)-a multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^113GNuQk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Groin pain in adults is a frequent complaint encountered in surgical practice and is often associated with inguinal hernias. However, the diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with groin pain in the absence of clinical signs of an inguinal hernia can be challenging. Current international guidelines advise further investigation in these patients using ultrasonography and, if inconclusive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When additional imaging reveals an inguinal hernia that is not detectable by physical examination, this is referred to as occult. To date, no standardized therapeutic guidelines have been established for occult inguinal hernias accompanied by groin pain. In clinical practice, this diagnosis often results in surgical treatment; however, there is a lack of evidence to support this decision.

Few studies have reported the prevalence of occult inguinal hernias without any related symptoms. One study observed a prevalence of 16% for occult inguinal hernias when groin ultrasonography was conducted in 100 healthy males. Although contralateral exploration during unilateral laparoendoscopic inguinal hernia repair remains controversial, the HerniaSurge Group International Guidelines for Groin Hernia Management report that the prevelance of occult inguinal hernias ranges from 5 to 58% during this procedure. However, the prevelance of occult inguinal hernias and associated groin pain remains unknown.

It is important to recognize that an occult inguinal hernia may not be the true origin of inguinal pain and could merely represent an incidental finding alongside an alternative diagnosis. First, the accuracy of ultrasound is reduced if no palpable hernia is present. Second, given the positive predictive value (PPV) of 70% for ultrasound in detecting occult inguinal hernias, there is a high chance of negative groin exploration, indicating that radiologic findings may not always be accurate. Therefore, it is likely that in some cases, complaints persist or even increase after surgical management. Conversely, delaying treatment could lead to prolonged suffering.

At present, knowledge regarding the optimal treatment strategy for patients with groin pain and diagnosis of an occult inguinal hernia is insufficient and may result in unnecessary surgical interventions and inadequate patient counseling. To answer this question, a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT), the EFFECT trial, was conducted to compare pain levels and quality of life (QoL) between a watchful waiting (WW) approach and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair in this specific patient population. The trial hypothesizes that WW is non-inferior to TEP repair for patients with inguinal pain and an occult inguinal hernia.

### Clinical examination for athletes with inguinal-related groin pain: interexaminer reliability and prevalence of positive tests [^115X8vPE]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Groin pain in the inguinal region without an inguinal hernia is a common diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in sports medicine. Unclear aetiology and heterogenous terminology, such as sports(man)'s hernia, Gilmore's groin and incipient hernia, cause confusion. Two consensus meetings, the Doha agreement meeting (involving groin pain experts from multiple disciplines)and the British Hernia Society's meeting (involving primarily general surgeons), addressed the terminology and proposed the terms inguinal-related groin painand inguinal disruption, respectively. A recent e-survey found that the term inguinal-related groin pain is most often used by clinicians, and this term is used in our study.

Classifying inguinal-related groin pain is done using history and clinical examination findings. The main symptom is activity-related pain in the inguinal canal region and also recognisable pain on palpation of the inguinal canal. It is more likely when symptoms are aggravated by resisted abdominal testing, during Valsalva, coughing or sneezing. Despite the importance of clinical examination in classifying inguinal-related groin pain, the reliability of these physical tests is unknown. It is also unknown how often athletes with inguinal-related groin pain report recognisable injury pain during each specific clinical examination test. For example, the Doha agreement classification states that inguinal-related groin pain is more likely when symptoms are aggravated with resisted abdominal testing, but this has never been quantified.

The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the interexaminer reliability of abdominal palpation and resistance tests for classifying inguinal-related groin pain in athletes with longstanding groin pain. The secondary aim was to identify the prevalence of positive clinical tests in athletes with inguinal-related groin pain.

Data extraction and quality assessment

The quality assessment was conducted independently by two methodologists (A.L. and S.S.). RCTs were assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials, Review Manager 5.4. The quality assessment of studies with different designs was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. A third methodologist (M.K.) assisted with conflicting decisions.

Data from included studies were extracted independently by two methodologists (A.L. and S.S.). This included study details (author name, year, and follow-up) and population characteristics (age, sex, BMI, and other available patient characteristics). The extracted data obtained for interventions, comparisons, and outcomes correspond to the specific KQ.

Data synthesis and analysis

Quantitative data were pooled in statistical meta-analyses using Cochrane Review Manager 5.4, where possible. Where statistical pooling was not possible, synthesis without meta-analyses was performed. When the direct scientific evidence was missing for some outcomes, expert evidence was extracted in alignment with the GRADE framework, using expert evidence forms for each content expert within the guidelines panel.

Pooled ORs (for dichotomous data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95 per cent confidence intervals (c.i.) were calculated. For one KQ (KQ2), diagnostic accuracy and overall accuracy by summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) was calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed for every result where possible based on the number of included studies and differences in the risk of bias or indirectness.

Random- or fixed-effects meta-analyses were used to obtain methodologically sound results for pooling according to the number of included studies and the size of the included body of evidence. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochrane chi-squared and I² tests. Cochrane chi-squared value P < 0.100 and I² statistics greater than or equal to 50 per cent show important heterogeneity.

Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Cul-de-sac hernias on MRD should be described by measuring their extent below the pubococcygeal line (PCL) in centimeters (Degree of consensus: 73%). In women, also specify the lowest point of the hernia sac in relation to the vagina ("top of vagina", "middle of vagina", or "on pelvic floor") (Degree of consensus: 79%). Additional grading as low/moderate/high grade may not be clinically relevant (Degree of consensus: 70%), and the MRD reports should not grade these as mild, moderate, or severe. Experts agreed that the best radiological description should include both extension below the PCL and relationship to the vaginal apex; in cases of incomplete or inadequate defecation, the report should state whether hernia contents appear to obstruct the rectum, and incomplete rectal emptying or inadequate defecatory effort on MRD may decrease sensitivity for detection. Regardless of other dysfunctions, it is important to always report the presence of any associated dysfunction of the levator muscles that would need treatment with biofeedback therapy before surgical intervention for the cul-de-sac hernia.

### Internal herniation incidence after RYGB and the predictive ability of a CT scan as a diagnostic tool [^111yfaT9]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Computer Tomography Scan and Diagnosis of Internal Herniation

Group A, non-closed group who underwent a CT scan, consisted of 16 patients. In this group, the sensitivity of the CT scan was 80% and specificity was 0%. The positive predictive value of the CT scan in this group was 92%, and the negative predictive value was 0%.

Thus, with the high sensitivity, you can assume that a patient is really not sick with a negative test result and no treatment is possible and the patient can go home. When the sensitivity decreases, the number of false negatives will increase. The risk is that people who are sick will be sent home. Whereby, the positive predictive value indicates the after-chance of the presence of disease in people with a positive test result. Since we are interested in the fact of starting a treatment yes or no, statistical wise, we need to look at the specificity results.

Group B was the non-closed group who was re-operated without a performance of a CT scan (N = 46). In this group, an IH was visible during re-operation in 58.7% of the cases, and in 41.3%, it was not.

Group C was the closed group in whom a CT scan was performed (N = 36). In group C, the sensitivity of the CT scan was 64.7% and specificity of 89.5%, and a positive predictive value of 84% and a negative predictive value of 74%. Thus, with a high specificity, you can assume that a patient is really ill with a positive test result and you can start the treatment.

Group D was the closed group without CT scan (N = 35). In group D, where only a re-operation was done, an IH was visible in 34.3% of the patients, and in 65.7%, it was not.

Follow-up

In group A, 81.3% of patients were symptom-free after re-operation; this was 76.1% in group B, 61.1% in group C, and 60.0% in group D. Thus, a total of 42 patients had IH surgery but still suffered from abdominal pains afterwards.

### Diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography in predicting contralateral inguinal hernia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115kdVkK]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this review, we aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography of the contralateral groin to detect CPPV and its potential value to predict MCIH in children with unilateral inguinal hernia.

Seven studies were included in this meta-analysis. They were subdivided into two groups: 'complete' and 'incomplete' cases. Studies referred to as complete cases reported both the positive and negative index test results of contralateral exploration and showed high pooled sensitivity (93%) and moderate pooled specificity (88%). Incomplete cases reported only the positive index test results of contralateral exploration and the negative index test results of the findings of clinical follow-up, and show lower pooled sensitivity (86%) though higher pooled specificity (98%). AUC implies that diagnostic performance of preoperative ultrasonography is very good at detecting CPPV in complete (0.984) and incomplete cases (0.996). These results indicate that preoperative ultrasonography is less likely to result in a high number of false negatives in the complete cases. In the incomplete cases, the false positive rate (FPR) is low (2.1%) compared to the FPR of complete cases (11.5%). Negative preoperative ultrasonographic test results yield positive perioperative findings during contralateral exploration more often compared to the amount of clinically apparent hernias that actually develop postoperatively. These results suggest that patency of the contralateral PV is much more often detected during contralateral exploration than an MCIH actually develops during follow-up.

### Rotator cuff disease: diagnostic tests… [^1151HG98]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Which physical examination tests are best for diagnosing rotator cuff disease in patients with shoulder pain. Evidence-Based Answer A positive lag sign with external rotation is the best test for full-thickness tears of the infraspinatus and supraspinatus. A positive lag sign with internal rotation is best for assessing full-thickness tears of the subscapularis. Five strength tests used weakness as the response criterion for a positive result. A positive external rotation lag test was the most accurate strength test for identifying full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. In this test, the elbow is flexed to 90 degrees, and the shoulder is externally rotated as far as possible.

If the patient is unable to maintain that position, it is considered a positive result. A positive internal rotation lag test was the best for detecting full-thickness tears of the subscapularis. The internal rotation lag test was the most accurate of the strength tests when negative. For full-thickness tears, with weakness as the response criterion, the Jobe test, and full-can test were best for evaluating the supraspinatus. Resisted lateral rotation was best for evaluating the infraspinatus.

The lift-off test was relevant for evaluation of subscapularis tears when using the lag sign as the response criterion. Copyright Family Physicians Inquiries Network. Used with permission.

### Comparative effectiveness of dynamic abdominal sonography for hernia vs computed tomography in the diagnosis of incisional hernia [^1135XdnX]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis and characterization of incisional hernia are often established by CT, which incurs radiation exposure and substantial cost in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to determine the comparative effectiveness of surgeon-performed Dynamic Abdominal Sonography for Hernia (DASH) vs CT for incisional hernia evaluation.

Study Design

Patients with previous abdominal operations and recent CT imaging were enrolled prospectively; patients with stomas, fistula, or soft tissue infection were excluded. In the clinic setting, DASH was performed with prerequisite training of the American College of Surgeons Ultrasound for Surgeons Basic Course. Clinical evidence of hernia, results of DASH examination, and radiologist documentation of incisional hernia were compared with the gold standard of surgeon-interpreted CT. Testing characteristics of sensitivity and specificity were compared and predictive values were calculated. Inter-rater reliability was performed by comparing DASH results in a subgroup of patients with 3 different evaluators.

Results

There were 181 patients enrolled, with a mean age of 54 years, and 68% were women. In patients in whom hernias were identified, the mean hernia size was 44.6 cm² (range 0.2 to 468.3 cm²). The DASH examination showed high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (88%). Hernia prevalence was 55% in this population, resulting in positive and negative predictive values of 91% and 97%, respectively. Four patients had clinically detectable hernias that were not seen on CT but were discovered with DASH. Inter-rater reliability for DASH was high, with an observed intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.79.

Conclusions

The DASH examination is an accurate alternative to CT scan for diagnosing abdominal wall hernias, with additional benefits of no radiation exposure and instant bedside interpretation. The use of DASH to detect hernia recurrence can greatly facilitate long-term follow-up of hernia patients.

CT versus ultrasound

A total of two cross-sectional studies, directly compared ultrasound and CT imaging for incisional hernia diagnosis; 40 and 181 patients were included respectively. In the larger study, by Beck et al. ultrasound was found to have a sensitivity of 0.98 (95 per cent c.i. 0.93 to 1.0) and a specificity of 0.88 (95 per cent c.i. 0.79 to 0.94) when compared with CT. den Hartog et al. showed ultrasound having a sensitivity of 0.71 (95 per cent c.i. 0.49 to 0.87) and a specificity of 1.0 (95 per cent c.i. 0.79 to 1.0).

Using all the data analysed for Recommendation A, an SROC plot was produced to show the relative diagnostic accuracy for different imaging modalities (shown in Fig. 11). The only reference standard available with 100 per cent sensitivity and specificity is intraoperative diagnosis. Based on the existing evidence, tests, and comparisons available, the SROC plot shows that the most accurate investigation is CT. The second most accurate is ultrasound, which has good accuracy. The least accurate way of diagnosing an incisional hernia is physical examination. Interestingly, none of the published studies looked at the accuracy of MRI, which could be used as an alternative to CT.

Inguinal canal can have diverse range of pathologies due to its complex anatomy and multiple different contents in the males and females. Imaging plays a dominant role in the appropriate diagnosis and management as inguinal pathologies have fairly similar clinical presentation with pain and swelling. Various pathologies in the inguinal region include congenital, infectious/inflammatory, vascular, neoplastic and iatrogenic. This paper gives an overview of the role of various modalities like Ultrasound, CT and MRI in the evaluation of inguinal pathologies.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^111fkMUE]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

At the opposite site of the spectrum, there are those patients with small fascial defects: due to the difficulty of palpating them, it has been advised to regularly mark the site of the hernia preoperatively, as it may be difficult to identify it in the supine and relaxed patient. We have been able to establish this association using correlation analyses and indeed found that small fascial defects are much less likely to be found during clinical examination. The palpable fascial defect is not a prerequisite to make the diagnosis: the diagnosis is mainly established by the presence of a (para)median swelling in physical examination. The aspect of the palpable fascial defect is relevant because the swelling will often disappear in the operating room, but this can be addressed by preoperative marking of the localization of the swelling before induction of anesthesia. Consequently, the use of ultrasound in pediatric epigastric hernia has been debated: some considered it to be exceptional, as the clinical examination will almost always establish the diagnosis, while others assumed ultrasound to be useful to establish the diagnosis because in the majority of cases, the fascial defect was not detected without ultrasound. Ultrasound has been a valuable tool in the evaluation of abdominal wall hernias for decades, and due to its high sensitivity and specificity, it may be advantageous when the clinical examination is equivocal. The most relevant among these is the differentiation between umbilical hernias and supraumbilical hernias: ideally, epigastric hernia could easily be discerned from umbilical hernias due to a distance to the navel as exemplified by Tinawi and Stringeror due to a characteristic U shape of the umbilicus being pushed downward by the epigastric hernia as shown by Shastri and Gilmer. If the clinical examination alone could not allow differentiation between these two types of hernia, ultrasound would most likely do so. This differentiation in equivocal cases is also of clinical relevance, as the management differs: while epigastric hernias are usually scheduled for elective repair once diagnosed, watchful waiting for spontaneous closure for asymptomatic umbilical hernia until the age of 4 years has been recommended by a systematic review. In addition, in umbilical hernias, the defect size is associated with the odds of spontaneous closure, with larger defects being less likely to close spontaneously, so the information gained by ultrasound could even be of relevance for counseling the patient's family if an umbilical and not an epigastric hernia is diagnosed. However, ultrasound should not be part of the routine care for epigastric hernia, as it is recommended to refer patients to secondary pediatric surgical care anyway if an epigastric hernia is suspected.

Diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography in complete cases

A total of 494 children from four different studies were included as complete cases (Table 4). The diagnostic sensitivity ranged from 78% (at a specificity of 20%) to 100% (at a specificity of 92%). The pooled sensitivity was 93% (95% CI 88–96%; χ² = 11.97, p < 0.01; I² = 74.9%) and the pooled specificity was 88% (95% CI 84–92%; χ² = 14.04, p < 0.01; I² = 78.6%) (Fig. 3 a). Significant heterogeneity exists in the estimated sensitivity (I² = 74.9%, p < 0.01) and specificity (I² = 78.6%, p < 0.01) between studies. The AUC of the SROC was 0.984 (Fig. 4 a).

### Internal herniation incidence after RYGB and the predictive ability of a CT scan as a diagnostic tool [^112aP9pK]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The internal herniation (IH) is a well-known late complication of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Since the introduction of this complication in a case report in 1999 by Serra et al. numerous publications have been dedicated to IH incidence, prevention, and diagnostics. Despite these publications, the clinical diagnosis of an IH remains challenging. Moreover, there is still no consensus on standardized closing of mesenteric defects (MD) and the use of a computer tomography (CT) scan for the diagnosis of the IH.

In daily practice, the CT scan is widely used as a diagnostic tool for IH. Most previous trials validating the CT scan for detecting IH show a large variety in sensitivity and specificity, and have low power due to too few inclusions or algorithm for detecting IH from a CT scan. Thus, the value of the CT scan in IH diagnostics is unclear. Furthermore, it is also uncertain whether the sensitivity and specificity of the CT scan are different when mesenteric defects were closed or left open.

Only three studies with a large population and assumable enough power have shown results towards a better understanding of the effect of the CT scan on detecting IH. Since 2018, two large trials in 1475 bariatric patients showed that the CT scan had a specificity of 87.1% and a high negative predictive factor of 96.8%. Also, a study found in 40.2% of the time an IH on the CT scan, and at the same time, the study could in 61.1% objectify this finding during surgery.

However, up to date, there is still discussion as to whether closing the MD leads to a lower incidence of IH and what the role of a CT scan is in the diagnostic algorithm. Our clinic changed its policy in 2013 from leaving MD open to standardly closing the mesenteric defects. This gives us the opportunity to study the incidence of IH in patients with and without closed MD. In addition, we can assess whether the accuracy of a CT scan is different in patients with and without closed MD.

### Peritoneography (herniography) for detecting occult inguinal hernia in patients with inguinodynia [^113oKE5k]. Annals of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the usefulness of peritoneography in patients referred with inguinal pain (inguinodynia) and clinically absent inguinal hernia on physical examination.

Summary Background Data

In patients with chronic groin pain, peritoneography is a seldom-used yet available technique that can detect an occult inguinal hernia. The value of peritoneography in the diagnosis of occult inguinal hernia has been previously shown.

Methods

During a 60-month period, 80 consecutive patients with complaints of persistent inguinal pain (inguinodynia) without evidence of hernia on clinical examination were referred for outpatient evaluation by peritoneography. Twenty-nine patients had prior inguinal surgery in the region of their current pain. Peritoneography was performed using a midline or paraumbilical approach. Radiographs were obtained with patients in prone and prone oblique positions with the head elevated 20 degrees to 25 degrees, both with and without provocative maneuvers. All available records were retrospectively reviewed for radiographic findings and outcome.

Results

Of the 80 patients undergoing peritoneography, 36 (45%) were diagnosed radiographically to have inguinal hernias that were not detectable clinically. Twenty-seven of these patients subsequently underwent inguinal exploration, and a hernia was confirmed in 24 (89%). Of the patients having prior inguinal surgery in the region of their pain, 12/29 (41%) were diagnosed by peritoneography with a hernia. Two complications (2.5%), both colon perforations that did not require significant intervention, occurred as a result of peritoneography.

Conclusions

Peritoneography is highly reliable for detecting clinically occult inguinal hernia and has a low complication rate. Its usefulness is shown in a prospective consecutive series for detection of occult hernias in patients with chronic inguinal pain. The authors conclude that peritoneography is a safe and useful diagnostic test in the setting of persistent inguinal pain and a negative clinical examination.

American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) Practice Parameter — indications for scrotal ultrasound include but are not limited to the following: evaluation of scrotal pain, including but not limited to testicular trauma, ischemia/torsion, postsurgical pain, and infectious or inflammatory scrotal disease; evaluation of a palpable inguinal, intrascrotal, or testicular mass; evaluation of scrotal asymmetry, swelling, or enlargement; evaluation of potential intrascrotal hernia; and detection/evaluation of varicoceles. The document is intended to provide the medical ultrasound community with recommendations for the performance and recording of high-quality ultrasound examinations, reflects what the AIUM considers the appropriate criteria for this type of ultrasound examination but is not intended to establish a legal standard of care, and notes that examinations performed in this specialty area are expected to follow the parameter with recognition that deviations may occur depending on the clinical situation.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic (TAPP) and endoscopic (TEP) treatment of inguinal hernia [International Endohernia Society (IEHS)] [^113ZT1Fa]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

In TAPP, three trocars are usually placed at the umbilical level (optic and two working ports); all working ports are inserted under direct vision. The parietal, intraabdominal, and retroperitoneal vascular injuries are preventable with good anatomical orientation and cautious pressure-controlled trocar insertion.

The optimal trocar positioning respects the rules of triangulation to facilitate and improve the workflow ergonomics. Consider the proximity of bony structures as potential inhibitors of instrumentation freedom.

Assessment of defect, contralateral site, exploration of abdominal cavity

Is clinical examination of hernias efficient enough?

What is the role of TAPP and other techniques in reliable assessment?

Statements

Recommendations

The accuracy of a clinical groin examination is limited. The incidence of occult contralateral hernia found at the time of unilateral hernia repair using TAPP or TEP is up to 25% [23, 24].

For definitive proof of the presence of a hernia, the sensitivity of ultrasound is clearly higher than a mere physical examination. The final and definitive classification of hernias can only be made intraoperatively; at best, the results of an ultrasound examination can help to orientate the surgeon. The TAPP enables rapid assessment [24]. In conventional hernia surgery or with the total extraperitoneal (TEP) method, this kind of evaluation is impossible or at least problematic.

In case of a missing hernia sac, most cord lipomas can be visualized when external pressure is applied over the groin. When no hernia is found in patients with strong hernia suspicion (positive clinical examination, positive ultrasound finding), the preperitoneal exploration is still indicated to rule out other pathologies of inguinal canal or preperitoneal lipomas in the femoral canal.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^117AxgYu]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

C. Diagnosis — Guideline 4 states that while most ventral hernias are easily diagnosed based on clinical exam, a preoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound may be considered for select patients with suspected ventral hernias to confirm the diagnosis or to aid the surgeon with preoperative planning (Moderate quality, strong recommendation). Diagnosis is typically made during the history and physical examination, but imaging can detect occult or recurrent hernias and assist planning: in a retrospective review of 146 consecutive LVHR's, 48% of patients had occult defects not detected on preoperative physical exam; in one study, recurrence diagnosis after mesh repair was correct 88% on physical exam versus 98% on CT; and dynamic abdominal sonography for ventral hernia diagnosis demonstrated sensitivity 98% and specificity 88%, with PPV 91% and NPV 97%, identifying hernias in a few more patients than CT. Preoperative CT is also helpful in defining abdominal wall anatomy in non-midline hernias and identifying posterior abdominal wall defects, and it accurately assesses relationships to adjacent structures and defect size to support surgical planning.

### UK guidelines on oesophageal dilatation in clinical practice [^117E9zMc]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Patient preparation

Oesophageal dilatation is best undertaken as a planned procedure in patients who have been appropriately investigated, prepared and consented. An assessment of the patient's nutritional status and referral to a dietician should also be considered.

Predilatation investigations

(a) Should all strictures be biopsied before dilatation?
Obtain biopsy specimens from all strictures for histological analysis to exclude malignancy and eosinophilic oesophagitis (GRADE of evidence: moderate; strength of recommendation: strong).

Obtaining a definitive diagnosis before dilatation is desirable, because this will influence the overall management and estimation of perforation risk. Oesophageal biopsy samples can be safely obtained immediately before oesophageal dilatation; however, if the stricture is tight or when the endoscopic features suggest malignancy, the results of biopsies are best awaited.
Repeat biopsy after cross-sectional imaging (CT or with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in cases where biopsies are negative, but clinical or endoscopic features are atypical or suspicious for malignancy (GRADE of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: strong).

EUS may be a more sensitive test than CT, but passage of the EUS probe is often not successful in the case of a stricture.
Obtain oesophageal biopsy specimens in young patients with dysphagia or history of food impaction to exclude eosinophilic esophagitis (GRADE of evidence: moderate; strength of recommendation: strong).

(b) Are there any other recommended tests?
Perform barium swallow in patients with suspected complex strictures (such as post-radiation therapy or history of caustic injury) in order to establish the location, length, diameter and number of strictures (GRADE of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: strong).

Barium swallow is also useful to evaluate the presence of associated pathology such as an oesophageal diverticulum or a hiatus hernia. This information will aid selection of the dilating technique, estimation of the number of sessions required and counselling the patient about the expected risks.

### Abdominal wall hernias: imaging features, complications, and diagnostic pitfalls at multi-detector row CT [^112GDMPZ]. Radiographics (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall hernias are a common imaging finding in the abdomen and may be complicated by strangulation, incarceration, or trauma. Because of the risk of developing complications, most abdominal wall hernias are surgically repaired, even if asymptomatic. However, post-surgical complications are also common and include hernia recurrence, infected and noninfected fluid collections, and complications related to prosthetic material. Multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) with its multiplanar capabilities is particularly useful for the evaluation of unrepaired and surgically repaired abdominal wall hernias. Multi-detector row CT provides exquisite anatomic detail of the abdominal wall, thereby allowing accurate identification of wall hernias and their contents, differentiation of hernias from other abdominal masses (tumors, hematomas, abscesses), and detection of pre- or postoperative complications. These findings improve the communication of imaging results to clinicians and help optimize treatment planning. Knowledge of multi-detector row CT findings in unrepaired and surgically repaired abdominal wall hernias and their complications is essential for making the correct diagnosis and may help guide clinical management.

### Watchful waiting versus totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair for occult inguinal hernia and pain (EFFECT trial)-a multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^117VREyE]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The role of additional imaging in the workup of occult inguinal hernias is questionable given that our study observed a PPV of 85% for detecting occult inguinal hernias by ultrasound. Preoperative ultrasound findings may have demonstrated true abdominal wall defects or weaknesses, sliding lipomas, or false-positive findings representing normal anatomic variation of the inguinal canal. As a result, unnecessary surgeries were still performed, with six patients (15%) undergoing negative explorations. A possible explanation for the reduced accuracy of ultrasound is that it is susceptible to subjectivity and heavily relies on operator skills. For example, during the Valsalva maneuver, some fatty tissue may slide into the inguinal ring or minor bulging of the abdominal wall could potentially be interpreted as an inguinal hernia. Insights from a recent study suggest that addressing ultrasound variability could benefit from a standardized protocol, as the optimal approach for diagnosing occult inguinal hernias is unknown. A recent Delphi-based consensus highlighted key recommendations for diagnosing occult inguinal hernias, such as the use of dynamic ultrasound and that reports should include hernia contents and defect size. Providing the radiologist with clinical details, especially symptoms and surgical history, can also improve diagnostic accuracy. When ultrasound was analyzed in conjunction with clinical judgment, Light et al. reported a PPV of 73%, which was comparable to the 85% observed in our study.

The WW strategy for occult inguinal hernias is essentially the same as the approach used for delayed surgery. This is exemplified by the 12-year follow-up of the INCA trial, which concluded that over the long term, three-quarters of WW-assigned patients crossed over to surgery, and this occurred more frequently and significantly earlier in patients with mildly symptomatic hernias than in those with asymptomatic hernias. WW has proven effective in patients aged ≥ 50 years, because the risk of incarceration is low and surgery for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic inguinal hernias may lead to chronic postoperative inguinal pain (CPIP). Identifying which patients may benefit from surgical repair while under WW may help guide clinical decision-making in this population. If the pain resolved over time and no clinically detectable inguinal hernia was observed, it was most likely caused by another condition. Pain unresponsive to conservative management may serve as a reason for crossover to TEP repair, provided that alternative diagnoses are unlikely.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^114ZsUHR]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation (NASS) define how study quality informs recommendation wording and strength. Levels of evidence range from Level I (high quality randomized controlled trial) to Level V (expert consensus), and levels are assigned to studies prior to developing recommendations; recommendations are then graded based on the level of evidence. Grades of Recommendation pair evidence tiers with language: A uses Level I studies with consistent findings and the recommendation wording "is recommended"; B uses Level II or III studies with consistent findings and the wording "suggest"; C uses Level IV or V studies and indicates a test or intervention "may be considered" or "is an option"; I denotes insufficient or conflicting evidence and states that "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against". The guideline notes that significant shortcomings in study execution can downgrade a study's potential level of evidence.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^116d55Tq]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with a FP ultrasound result undergo potentially unnecessary surgery. This results in unnecessary costs, potential complications and is unlikely to solve the symptoms of the patient. Postoperative complications occur in approximately 15–28% of operated inguinal hernia patients.

Aim

The primary aim of this pilot study was to investigate to what extent the diagnosis inguinal hernia on preoperative ultrasound corresponded to the perioperative findings during inguinal hernia surgery. In addition, we aimed to identify factors that may contribute to FP preoperative ultrasounds.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^114ttJtW]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — diagnostic imaging selection and accuracy: In patients with history and physical examination findings consistent with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy, CT scan, myelography and/or CT myelography are recommended as appropriate tests to confirm the presence of lumbar disc herniation (Grade of Recommendation: A). In a prospective comparative study, MRI was the most accurate test with 76.5% accuracy, CT myelography was 76%, CT was 73.6% and myelography was 71.4%, with CT myelography having the lowest false negative rate at 27.2% and MRI the lowest false positive rate at 13.5%; CT myelography had the greatest sensitivity (72.8%) and MRI the greatest specificity (86.5%). In a prospective comparison of CT versus myelography in 185 consecutive surgically confirmed cases, the CT true positive rate was 92% versus 87% for myelography, the false negative rate 8% versus 13%, the true negative rate 78% versus 89%, and the false positive rate 22% versus 11%, providing Level I diagnostic evidence that CT and myelography show comparable rates of diagnosis. In a retrospective series, MRI accurately predicted 98/102 disc levels (96%), while myelography accuracy was 81% and post-myelogram CT scan 57%; when myelography and CT scan were combined, accuracy was 84%. The authors concluded that MRI is a clinically superior diagnostic test and that it should be the diagnostic study of choice when available; this study provides Level I diagnostic evidence that MRI provides the most sensitivity and specificity when compared to myelography or CT myelography.

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management [^111VmaKa]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.

### Diagnostic utility of multidetector CT scan in penetrating diaphragmatic injuries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111kbENW]. Emergency Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis expand upon previous studies in examining the diagnostic effectiveness of MDCT in the detection of traumatic diaphragmatic injuries caused by penetrating trauma. The primary objective was to gather comprehensive data on different measures of diagnostic accuracy associated with MDCT as an imaging modality in this context.

Diaphragmatic injuries caused by penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma may initially be small and without symptoms. However, if not diagnosed and treated promptly, these injuries can expand over time, leading to the herniation of abdominal organs into the chest cavity and the development of symptoms. Delayed treatment of such herniation is associated with increased complexity, mortality, and morbidity risks. Injuries to the left hemidiaphragm are considered more significant because of the greater likelihood of organ herniation and strangulation, although they are relatively easier to detect compared to right-sided injuries that may be obscured by the liver. The identification of diaphragmatic injuries can be challenging, particularly in cases of gunshot or stab wounds that cause small lacerations. However, techniques like identifying associated injuries or using tractography have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^116JY33o]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

In 136 cases (77.7%), there was a (visible) swelling and/or a positive Valsalva maneuver during physical examination by the surgeon. The median time between the preoperative ultrasound and day of surgery was 63 (IQR 42–81) days. The most frequently used surgery technique was a laparoscopic procedure (n = 161), whereas the minority of patients underwent an open procedure (n = 14). Most (19.9%) patients had a hernia size on ultrasound between 1.0 and 1.4 cm (1.37 ± 0.92), however in 37.5% of the reports the hernia size was not described. Two patients (12.5%) with a FP result developed a postoperative complication (1 wound infection, 1 disproportional inguinal pain).

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^113sx8bZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inguinal hernia surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide. According to the national guidelines published in 2020, approximately 27,000 inguinal hernia surgeries are performed annually in the Netherlands (national guideline, 2020), of which 500 to 800 surgeries are performed in our hospital. In 95% of patients with suspected inguinal hernia, the general practitioner (GP) or surgeon can diagnose the inguinal hernia based on the clinical presentation and physical examination. When the physical examination is inconclusive, ultrasonography is indicated according to both the international and Dutch inguinal hernia guidelines. Typical findings of a hernia on ultrasound consist of a hernial sac containing adipose or intestinal tissue or protrusion of a herniating sac when the Valsalva maneuver is performed.

Several studies compared the role of ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of inguinal hernias. In a recent systematic review (2020), Piga et al. aimed to determine which diagnostic modality is the most accurate in diagnosing inguinal hernia. They concluded that ultrasound has the highest sensitivity and specificity compared to CT and/or MRI. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for diagnosing inguinal hernias were 56–100% and 0–100%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of CT scans ranged from 48 to 98% and 25 to 100%, respectively, and of MRI from 85 to 95% and 90 to 100%, respectively. In spite of the broader range in sensitivity and specificity observed, on average ultrasonography performed the best.

In a systematic review by Kwee et al. the positive predictive value (PPV) of ultrasonography for inguinal hernias was evaluated. In the 16 studies included, the PPV ranged from 58.8 to 100%. A pooled PPV of 86.4% (CI 95% [78.9–92.4]) was reported. These findings showed that PPVs are inconsistent and vary significantly between studies. Thus, additional research is warranted. Moreover, it is currently unclear which factors are associated with false positive (FP) ultrasound findings, although operator experience has already been linked to ultrasound accuracy.

A prior clinical diagnosis of hernia may explain part of the FP diagnoses, especially when there is no evident clinical sign like palpable sac or swelling. In case of inguinal pain without swelling, diagnosing hernia may be very difficult even for a trained surgeon, GP and ultrasound technician.

### Underlying genetic etiologies of congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^111N7iZ4]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is often detectable prenatally. Advances in genetic testing have made it possible to obtain a molecular diagnosis in many fetuses with CDH. Here, we review the aneuploidies, copy number variants (CNVs), and single genes that have been clearly associated with CDH. We suggest that array-based CNV analysis, with or without a chromosome analysis, is the optimal test for identifying chromosomal abnormalities and CNVs in fetuses with CDH. To identify causative sequence variants, whole exome sequencing (WES) is the most comprehensive strategy currently available. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) with CNV analysis has the potential to become the most efficient and effective means of identifying an underlying diagnosis but is not yet routinely available for prenatal diagnosis. We describe how to overcome and address the diagnostic and clinical uncertainty that may remain after genetic testing, and review how a molecular diagnosis may impact recurrence risk estimations, mortality rates, and the availability and outcomes of fetal therapy. We conclude that after the prenatal detection of CDH, patients should be counseled about the possible genetic causes of the CDH, and the genetic testing modalities available to them, in accordance with generally accepted guidelines for pretest counseling in the prenatal setting.

### The role of imaging in the pre-and postoperative evaluation of inguinal hernia [^114xhq3Z]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Inguinal hernia repair is the most frequently performed surgical procedure. Imaging has a fundamental role in initial assessment and postoperative evaluation of inguinal hernias. Clinical implications of radiology in the preoperative setting include diagnosis of occult/complicated hernias and enhancement of diagnostic certainty. Postoperatively, imaging may assist the detection and characterization of complications. Familiarity with the normal appearance of the postoperative groin area and surgical techniques is required to avoid misinterpretation. This pictorial essay provides an overview of the expected postoperative imaging findings and highlights the role of imaging in the pre- and postoperative evaluation of inguinal hernias, with emphasis on ultrasonography.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^116xcjhc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for low back pain (LBP) — imaging and other diagnostic testing: Lumbar spine x-rays are not recommended in patients with LBP without red flags for serious spinal pathology within the first 4 to 6 weeks, and among patients with evidence of radiculopathy, imaging in the acute setting is also not recommended; however, an imaging study may be appropriate when limitations from consistent symptoms have persisted for 1 month or more or when potentially serious pathology or progressive neurologic deficit(s) are concerns. Pretest probability and test characteristics are critical, as lumbosacral spine MRIs are more likely to be "abnormal" by age 40 in normal individuals and herniated discs are not infrequently found in asymptomatic teenagers and young adults; at present, no single imaging modality shows a clear overall advantage, though MRI is superior for soft tissues including intervertebral disc herniations. In the absence of moderate- to high-quality studies, additional diagnostic tests for LBP and spinal conditions are Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), Low Confidence.

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management… [^115VMjV4]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Symptoms and Physical Findings The diagnosis of an inguinal hernia is usually made through history and physical examination findings. Although data are limited, in one report, the sensitivity and specificity of the physical examination were 75% and 96%, respectively.
8. Hernias may be easily diagnosed with an adequate physical examination. The physical examination should begin by carefully inspecting the femoral and inguinal areas for bulges while the patient is standing. Then, the patient should be asked to strain down while the physician observes for bulges. This may be accomplished by using the right hand to examine the patient's right side and the left hand to examine the patient's left side. The physician invaginates the loose skin of the scrotum with the index finger on the ipsilateral side of the patient, starting at a point low enough on the scrotum to reach as far as the internal inguinal ring.

9 The diagnosis of an inguinal hernia is confirmed if an "impulse" or bulge is felt. It is more challenging to diagnose a hernia in female patients. Direct palpation with an open hand over the groin area might detect the impulse of a hernia during a Valsalva maneuver. However, further workup with diagnostic testing or referral to a surgeon is often indicated. Rarely, diagnostic laparoscopy is necessary. Imaging Although imaging is rarely needed to diagnose a hernia, it may be useful in certain clinical situations. 8 The clinical use of ultrasonography has shown promise in these situations. 11, 12 The sensitivity of ultrasonography for the detection of groin hernias is greater than 90%, and the specificity is 82% to 86%. 8, 13. Use of higher resolution axial computed tomography in the diagnosis of inguinal hernia is being investigated.

14 Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in differentiating inguinal and femoral hernias with a high sensitivity and specificity. 8 The use of magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in the diagnosis of athletic pubalgia or sports hernias, which may occur at any age with potentially more than one cause. The physician may consider magnetic resonance imaging in the workup of patients with activity-related groin pain when no inguinal hernia can be identified on physical examination. 15.

### Diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography in predicting contralateral inguinal hernia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117DZQTi]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The incidence of children developing metachronous contralateral inguinal hernia (MCIH) is 7–15%. Contralateral groin exploration during unilateral hernia repair can prevent MCIH development and subsequent second surgery and anaesthesia. Preoperative ultrasonography is a less invasive strategy and potentially able to detect contralateral patent processus vaginalis (CPPV) prior to MCIH development.

Methods

We queried MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane library to identify studies regarding children aged < 18 years diagnosed with unilateral inguinal hernia without clinical signs of contralateral hernia, who underwent preoperative ultrasonography of the contralateral groin. We assessed heterogeneity and used a random-effects model to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Results

Fourteen studies (2120 patients) were included, seven (1013 patients) in the meta-analysis. In studies using surgical exploration as reference test (n = 4, 494 patients), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 88% respectively. In studies using contralateral exploration as reference test following positive and clinical follow-up after negative ultrasonographic test results (n = 3, 519 patients), pooled sensitivity was 86% and specificity 98%. The AUC (0.984) shows high diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography for detecting CPPV, although diagnostic ultrasonographic criteria largely differ and large heterogeneity exists. Reported inguinal canal diameters in children with CPPV were 2.70 ± 1.17 mm, 6.8 ± 1.3 mm and 9.0 ± 1.9 mm.

Conclusion

Diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography to detect CPPV seems promising, though may result in an overestimation of MCIH prevalence, since CPPV does not invariably lead to MCIH. Unequivocal ultrasonographic criteria are mandatory for proper diagnosis of CPPV and subsequent prediction of MCIH.

Key Points

- Diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography for detection of CPPV in children with unilateral inguinal hernia is high.
- Preoperative ultrasonographic evaluation of the contralateral groin assumedly results in an overestimation of MCIH prevalence.
- Unequivocal ultrasonographic criteria are mandatory for proper diagnosis of CPPV and risk factor identification is needed to predict whether CPPV develops into clinically apparent MCIH.

### Athletic groin pain (part 1): a prospective anatomical diagnosis of 382 patients – clinical findings, MRI findings and patient-reported outcome measures at baseline [^112bFhrK]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this largest cohort of patients with athletic groin pain combining clinical and MRI diagnostics — we made the diagnosis of PA injury in 63% of the series. This diagnosis should be considered more often by clinicians working in this area — failure to do so underestimates the role of lower abdominal musculature in the genesis of athletic groin pain.

The adductor SQ was sensitive for athletic groin pain, but not specific for adductor, PA or iliopsoas pathology. The specificity and post-test probability of diagnosis were improved by combination of clinical (palpation) and radiological findings in series.

The improved post-test diagnostic probabilities seen following the incorporation of MRI in the diagnostic process highlights the benefits of immediate correlation between clinical examination and MRI by the sports physician. Surgery for presumed inguinal pathology dominates the literature yet we failed to identify a hernia, clinically or radiologically, despite MRI findings of a variety of concomitant abnormalities in any subject. Nearly two-thirds of patients (63.6%) demonstrated pain and abnormality in multiple anatomical structures. This implies that at any point in time a number of structures may be 'pathological' resulting in pain. As a result we argue that focusing on injury mechanism may be more productive rather than attempting to isolate individual pathological structures. If our approach proves correct, addressing biomechanical abnormalities will prove a novel treatment approach.

What are the findings?

The most common diagnosis was that of pubic aponeurosis injury.
MRIs commonly revealed several areas of abnormal signal, — raising the possibility of several sources of pain in the one patient.
A combination of clinical findings and MRI improved post-test diagnostic probability.
Despite the prevalence of abnormal hip signal on MRI, relatively few patients met the criteria for surgical intervention.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?

Future work should be directed at understanding the underpinning biomechanical loads in change of direction and the development of femoroacetabular impingement and pubic bone oedema.
Reliance on clinical tests alone to make the diagnosis has the potential for inaccuracy and MRI support may improve diagnostic likelihood ratios.
This paper outlines an integrated physical examination and radiological review for accurate diagnosis of athletic groin pain. It highlights the presentation of multiple concurrent pathologies (a combined clinical radiological diagnosis) and lack of sensitivity of individual physical diagnostic tests.
Diagnostic and rehabilitation strategies aimed at and designed toward treating single pathological anatomical entities are likely to be limited.

Single incision laparoscopic surgery versus conventional laparoscopic surgery

A total of 32 RCTs were identified that compared incisional hernia (port site hernia) after SILS versus conventional laparoscopic surgery. The overall certainty of evidence was low. Pooled analysis revealed a risk of developing an incisional hernia of 1.5 per cent (27/1861 patients) with SILS versus 0.5 per cent (11/2156 patients) with conventional laparoscopic surgery (OR 1.92 (95 per cent c.i. 0.94 to 3.91)); see the forest plot and risk-of-bias assessment in Fig. 6.

SILS, single incision laparoscopic surgery; CLS, conventional laparoscopic surgery.

Surgical site infection

It is well documented that SSI impairs wound healing. A total of nine studies assessed the impact of SSI as a risk factor for developing an incisional hernia. Pooled analysis suggested a risk of incisional hernia of 19.4 per cent (76/391 patients) after having an SSI compared with 6.9 per cent (315/4542 patients) with no SSI (OR 3.38 (95 per cent c.i. 2.18 to 5.23)); see the forest plot and risk-of-bias assessment in Fig. 7.

Forest plot: surgical site infection as a risk factor for incisional hernia

SSI, surgical site infection.

There was no evidence for any other independent risk factors from the literature.

Key Question 2: (a) Do all patients with an incisional hernia require imaging? and (b) What is the best modality?

Recommendation A: For patients with a suspected incisional hernia where clinical examination has not given a definitive diagnosis, medical imaging to establish the diagnosis is suggested; from the evidence CT is the most sensitive investigation.

However, if the cost and radiation exposure are a concern then ultrasonography or MRI with Valsalva is suggested (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).

Good Practice Statement B: For patients with an incisional hernia (where surgery is being considered), the guidelines panel recommends using CT or MRI for preoperative planning.

Medical imaging is frequently used before surgery to characterize incisional hernias. Medical imaging may also play an important role in diagnosis where the presence of a hernia is not obvious on clinical examination.

### Minimally invasive versus open parastomal hernia repair: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis [^113BnsUy]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings reinforce the benefits of laparoscopic techniques, including shorter hospital stays, reduced operative times, decreased mortality, and fewer complications, supporting the shift toward minimally invasive surgery to improve patient outcomes. However, whether robotic‐assisted repair consistently outperforms laparoscopic methods remains controversial. A broader analysis is needed to assess case‐specific factors, particularly when operative times and costs are considered.

Robotic surgery generally costs 20%–30% more than laparoscopic repair due to increased operating room time and robotic equipment costs. Some studies argue that robotic repairs might reduce long‐term expenses by lowering complication rates, but evidence of this potential saving is mixed. This cost differential is particularly relevant for routine cases where laparoscopic surgery achieves similar outcomes at lower costs, making it the more economical option for many institutions.

Importantly, although laparoscopic approaches offer superior short‐term outcomes, our analysis confirms that recurrence rates — a key long‐term parameter — do not significantly differ between laparoscopic and open repair. What probably matters more in the long‐term setting is the heterogeneity of surgical techniques, patient selection, and variability in follow‐up durations, which may dilute the measurable impact of the surgical approach itself.

As previously discussed, the choice between open and minimally invasive techniques does not appear to significantly influence hernia recurrence rates. However, laparoscopic repair was associated with a significantly lower reoperation rate (Risk ratio = 0.43), which may reflect improved intraoperative visualization and mesh positioning, resulting in more durable repairs and better management of postoperative complications. This suggests that, although recurrence may occur at similar rates, its clinical consequences may be mitigated more effectively with minimally invasive approaches. In line with this interpretation, Fry et al. found that disease characteristics influence recurrence rates more than the surgical technique itself.

Accurate detection of recurrence remains essential for evaluating long‐term outcomes. Although both CT and MRI are widely used for postoperative imaging, a recent meta‐analysis concluded that CT is superior to MRI in detecting hernia recurrence, particularly in identifying acute complications. In contrast, MRI is more effective for mesh visualization and soft‐tissue assessment. These findings underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate imaging modality based on clinical context to optimize postoperative monitoring and care, especially for patients with parastomal hernia.

### The PINCH-phone: a new screenings method for recurrent incisional hernias [^115SHqsC]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The aim of this study was to study the sensitivity and specificity of the PINCH-Phone. The required sample size was calculated based on recurrence percentages reported in the literature, and estimated to be 15%. We aimed to calculate the specificity, but especially the sensitivity with a certain reliability, and we therefore needed a minimum of 30 patients with a recurrence. The sample size accordingly is 30/15 × 100 = 200 participants. Considering the risk of drop out, we invited 220 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the PINCH-Phone as a diagnostic tool were calculated by comparing its outcomes with the outcomes of the golden standard for detecting clinical recurrences, clinical examination.

The 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For all statistical procedures, a probability value (p value) < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Analysis of data was performed in SPSS version 2.0.

### Imaging… [^113jgKdN]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Watchful waiting is also commonly used in pregnant patients because groin swelling can be caused by self-limited round ligament varicosities. 23 Color flow Doppler imaging can be used to distinguish between a true hernia and round ligament varicosities. In a 2017 cohort study of 20, 714 pregnant patients, only 25 had inguinal hernias and none underwent elective or emergency hernia repair during pregnancy. In 10 patients, the groin bulge disappeared spontaneously after delivery. 24 For reducible inguinal hernias in pregnant patients, it seems safe and cost-effective to wait until after delivery to attempt repair. SURGICAL MANAGEMENT The choice of surgical technique for repairing an inguinal hernia depends on factors such as anesthesia accessibility, the surgeon's preference and training, patient preference, cost, availability of mesh, and other logistics.

Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Surgical interventions can be categorized as open anterior repair, open posterior repair, tension-free mesh repair, and laparoscopic repair. Although nonmesh techniques have fallen out of favor in the United States, they are still acceptable internationally. Mesh techniques are strongly recommended because of lower recurrence rates compared with nonmesh techniques. 19 If mesh is unavailable, a 2009 European guideline suggests that an open anterior nonmesh technique is most favorable. 19, 25. The use of laparoscopic techniques has been shown to be superior to tension-free mesh repair for postoperative pain outcomes. 19 Common laparoscopic techniques include the total extraperitoneal approach and transabdominal preperitoneal approach.

In both of these approaches, mesh is placed in the preperitoneal space, but access starts at different anatomic points. Laparoscopic repair of groin hernias is preferred over open repair because of better recovery outcomes. 26–29 Guidelines specifically recommend laparoscopic approaches in women to decrease the risk of chronic pain and avoid missing femoral hernias. Laparoscopic approaches can also be used in patients with previous hernias that were repaired with an open approach to avoid significant scar tissue. 19 A Cochrane review comparing open and laparoscopic repair found that laparoscopic repair took longer and was associated with a higher rate of vascular, colonic, or bladder injury; however, overall, laparoscopic surgery was associated with shorter recovery, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates. 29.

### Imaging complex ventral hernias, their surgical repair, and their complications [^113Eogeg]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Patients with CVH are referred increasingly for cross-sectional imaging and this review has attempted to familiarise radiologists with the pertinent surgical questions and the methods and procedures that are used in these patients. The hope is that radiologists will be better able to provide an informed report in this group of patients. Presently, imaging is most often deployed to determine preoperative hernia morphology and to identify and treat complications. However, it is likely that in the near future imaging will be requested to provide prognostic information regarding the type and extent of surgery needed to treat the hernia, and to predict the risk of its recurrence.

### Adult abdominal hernias [^115BLbep]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Educational Objectives and Key Points. 1. Given that abdominal hernias are a frequent imaging finding, radiologists not only are required to interpret the appearances of abdominal hernias but also should be comfortable with identifying associated complications and postrepair findings. 2. CT is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of a known adult abdominal hernia in both elective and acute circumstances because of rapid acquisition, capability of multiplanar reconstruction, good spatial resolution, and anatomic depiction with excellent sensitivity for most complications. 3. Ultrasound is useful for adult groin assessment and is the imaging modality of choice for pediatric abdominal wall hernia assessment, whereas MRI is beneficial when there is reasonable concern that a patient's symptoms could be attributable to a hernia or a musculoskeletal source. 4. Fluoroscopic herniography is a sensitive radiologic investigation for patients with groin pain in whom a hernia is suspected but in whom a hernia cannot be identified at physical examination. 5. The diagnosis of an internal hernia not only is a challenging clinical diagnosis but also can be difficult to diagnose with imaging: Closed-loop small-bowel obstruction and abnormally located bowel loops relative to normally located small bowel or colon should prompt assessment for an internal hernia.

### The AIUM practice parameter for the performance of an ultrasound examination of the abdomen and / or retroperitoneum [^115fi1qS]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Abdominal wall — When there are signs or symptoms referable to the abdominal wall, an ultrasound examination may be performed to evaluate for hernia, masses, fluid collections, or other abnormalities, and the examination should include images of the abdominal wall in the location of symptoms or signs and often necessitates scanning with a high-frequency, high-resolution transducer. The relationship of any identified mass to the peritoneum should be demonstrated, any defect in the peritoneum and abdominal wall musculature should be documented, and the presence or absence of bowel, fluid, organs, or other tissues contained within any abdominal wall defect should be noted. Valsalva maneuvers in supine and upright positioning may be helpful in hernia detection and determining reducibility, the inferior epigastric vessels are an important anatomic landmark in hernia characterization, and Doppler examination may be useful to evaluate for vascular flow in an abdominal mass; cine clip images can be useful to further define abdominal wall hernias.

### ACG clinical guidelines: clinical use of esophageal physiologic testing [^117KHpSg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Hiatal hernia detection with high-resolution manometry (HRM) — HRM provides morphological details of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ), and by comparing the relative locations of the intrinsic lower esophageal sphincter and the crural diaphragm, the presence of a hiatus hernia can be identified. Against an endoscopic gold standard, CM had 28% sensitivity, 97% specificity, and 82% positive predictive value in identifying a sliding hiatal hernia. In a study of 92 obese subjects evaluated before bariatric surgery, the sensitivity of endoscopy for detection of sliding hiatus hernia was ≤ 40% despite high specificity (≥ 94%) compared with barium radiography. Another study comparing HRM, endoscopy, and barium radiography in 90 patients demonstrated a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 95% with HRM. Finally, in a prospective study of 100 consecutive patients, 53 of which had a hiatus hernia proven on surgical measurement during laparoscopy, preoperative HRM had a sensitivity of 94.3% and specificity of 91.5% compared with endoscopy (96.2%, 74.5%) or barium radiography (69.8%, 97.9%). Key concept 10 states that HRM complements endoscopy and barium esophagography in improving the diagnostic yield of identifying hiatal hernia.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^115cbvpf]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Although our study is the first to include both laparoscopic and open epigastric hernia repairs, it cannot be seen as a comparative study. A relevant portion of the laparoscopic hernia repairs were conducted in patients with specific circumstances, such as multiple epigastric hernias, concomitant repair of an incisional hernia or other simultaneous operations. Therefore, the number of comparable cases is just too small to derive a reliable result in the comparison of both techniques. Nevertheless, having both techniques within one cohort indicates that laparoscopy might indeed be beneficial if there are multiple defectsor concomitant procedures to be undertaken, while we generally favored the open approach if a single epigastric hernia was to be repaired.

In addition to the retrospective nature of our study, a further limitation is that we cannot provide the direly neededlong-term data on the spontaneous course of an epigastric hernia and the risk of recurrence following epigastric hernia repair, particularly in children with larger fascial defect sizes. Another limitation of our study is a portion of missing clinical data in several patients, which is common in all reports of pediatric epigastric herniasand thus not specifically caused by poor documentation in our centers. Administrative data might be helpful in covering these issues, although the currently available reports did not assess recurrencesor did explicitly exclude them by their study design. Another limitation is that the use of ultrasound was different between the two study centers, which is likely to have introduced additional bias besides the one that is caused by the treating pediatric surgeon deciding whether an ultrasound should be conducted or not.

To date, our study represents the largest cohort of epigastric hernias in children, increasing the available information in the literature by more than 50%. In addition, due to the routine use of ultrasound in one of the two study sites and infrequently in the other study site, our study was able to provide further insight into the role of ultrasound in pediatric epigastric hernias. Its use might be beneficial in patients in whom an epigastric hernia cannot be diagnosed clinically or if a preoperative marking of the level of the hernia was impossible, as preceding research demonstrated that point-of-care ultrasound in the operating room will reliably detect the fascial defect. However, outside this limited range of indications, ultrasound for pediatric epigastric hernia is not a necessity for diagnosis or management and would put an undue burden on radiology departments if ordered routinely. Consequently, the treating pediatric surgeon, who will see the child because a referral to secondary care is recommended, should decide whether an ultrasound examination of an epigastric hernia is necessary.

### Diagnostic evaluation of low back pain with emphasis on imaging [^112Hz4d5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of clinical information and imaging for patients with low back pain in primary care settings.

Data Source

MEDLINE search (January 1966 to September 2001) for articles and reviews relevant to the accuracy of the clinical and radiographic examination of patients with low back pain.

Study Selection

The authors reviewed abstracts and selected articles for review on the basis of a combined judgment. Data on the clinical examination were based primarily on recent systematic reviews; data on imaging tests were based primarily on original articles.

Data Extraction

Diagnostic results were extracted by one or the other author. Quality of methods was evaluated informally. Major potential biases were identified, but neither quantitative data extraction nor scoring was done.

Data Synthesis

Formal meta-analysis was not used because the diagnostic hardware and software, gold standards, and patient selection methods were heterogeneous and the number of studies was small. Sensitivity for cancer was highest for magnetic resonance imaging (0.83 to 0.93) and radionuclide scanning (0.74 to 0.98); specificity was highest for magnetic resonance imaging (0.9 to 0.97) and radiography (0.95 to 0.99). Magnetic resonance imaging was the most sensitive (0.96) and specific (0.92) test for infection. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging for herniated discs were slightly higher than those for computed tomography but very similar for the diagnosis of spinal stenosis.

Conclusions

The data suggest a diagnostic strategy similar to the 1994 Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines. For adults younger than 50 years of age with no signs or symptoms of systemic disease, symptomatic therapy without imaging is appropriate. For patients 50 years of age and older or those whose findings suggest systemic disease, plain radiography and simple laboratory tests can almost completely rule out underlying systemic diseases. Advanced imaging should be reserved for patients who are considering surgery or those in whom systemic disease is strongly suspected.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^112SWyBd]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Our finding that some of the preoperative ultrasounds are FP for inguinal hernia in need of surgery, indicates the importance of detailed requests by GP's and surgeons for ultrasound examinations. The request should at least contain the indication of the ultrasound examination, BMI of the patient, symptoms and findings of the physical examination. In this way, the radiologist has more insight in the patient's history and factors that could potentially affect the accuracy of the ultrasound. Ideally, radiology reports should contain the following items by using a standard template: position of the patient during the ultrasound examination, use of Valsalva maneuver (positive or negative), mass and size of the inguinal hernia, epigastric veins (identified or not identified), the contents of the hernia sac, reducibility and possible limitations of the examination due to scanning conditions. A more detailed radiology report is especially important in case of an inconclusive ultrasound examination.

When the anamnesis and physical examination are inconclusive and the ultrasound positive but factors associated with FP ultrasound results such as BMI are present, the surgeon may consider using additional diagnostic imaging like an MRI or CT scan as recommended by current guidelines. For an accurate physical and/or ultrasound examination, it is important to examine the patient both in a standing and supine position, considering that the hernia in some cases can only be seen in a certain position or only with the Valsalva maneuver.

An MRI or CT scan with and without Valsalva maneuver is not operator dependent and may provide more certainty about the diagnosis. In their systematic review, Piga et al. reported that MRI showed promising results and seems to be a better alternative than CT. However, it is important to note that not enough patients could be included in their study to draw strong conclusions.

### Role of imaging in the diagnosis of occult hernias [^116UAZMN]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Occult hernias are symptomatic but not palpable on physical examination. This is more commonly seen with inguinal hernias. Early diagnosis and treatment of occult hernias are essential in relieving symptoms and improving patients' quality of life.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of imaging-ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) — in the diagnosis of occult inguinal hernia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective medical records review of surgical patients with groin and pelvic pain, 2008–2013, was conducted in a single-surgeon hernia specialty practice. Thirty-six patients met the following inclusion criteria: (1) examination findings suggestive of but not necessarily diagnostic for inguinal hernia; (2) imaging of the groin and/or pelvis with US, CT, and MRI; and (3) an operation to address the groin or pelvic pain. Fifty-nine groins were included.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of US, CT, and MRI for detection of occult inguinal hernia.

Results

The number, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each modality were, respectively: US (9, 0.33, 0, 1.00, and 0), CT (39, 0.54, 0.25, 0.86, and 0.06), and MRI (34, 0.91, 0.92, 0.95, and 0.85). Among multiply imaged groins in which CT examination missed a diagnosis of hernia, MRI correctly detected an occult hernia in 10 of 11 cases (91%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Ultrasonography and CT cannot reliably exclude occult groin abnormalities. Patients with clinical suspicion of inguinal hernia should undergo MRI as the definitive radiologic examination.

Physical examination versus intraoperative findings

A total of two studies, were included that directly assessed the accuracy of physical examination against intraoperative findings. The first study, of 50 patients, reported a sensitivity of 0.75 (95 per cent c.i. 0.35 to 0.97) and a specificity of 0.9 (95 per cent c.i. 0.77 to 0.97). The second study, a smaller study by Holihan et al. reported a sensitivity of 0.79 (95 per cent c.i. 0.49 to 0.95) and specificity of 0.75 (95 per cent c.i. 0.19 to 0.99).

CT versus intraoperative findings

A total of three cross-sectional studies, assessed the accuracy of CT compared with intraoperative findings; two small studies of only 12–18 patients and one larger study of 50 patients were included. The largest of the three studies described a sensitivity for CT of 1.0 (95 per cent c.i. 0.63 to 1.0) and a specificity of 0.98 (95 per cent c.i. 0.87 to 1.0).

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^112xcnCo]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, we found a PPV of preoperative ultrasound to predict an inguinal hernia in need of surgery of 90.9%; in other words 9.1% of patients underwent surgery without having an inguinal hernia. This finding is in line with previously reported PPVs. We also identified factors that are associated with a FP ultrasound when an inguinal hernia is suspected, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been done before in this setting.

Awareness of these factors may influence the diagnostic approach by considering alternative imaging modalities such as CT or MRI.

Although the PPV of preoperative ultrasound to diagnose inguinal hernia was investigated before, only some of these studies used surgery as golden standard. By using surgery as golden standard, a reliable PPV could be established in this retrospective study.

A higher BMI was identified as a potential predictor for FP results (p = 0.043). Ultrasound is difficult to perform in obese patients due to the increased distance to the target tissue. It is more difficult to distinguish fatty tissue from material of a hernia. Moreover, the increased depth of the inguinal canal complicates identification. Compared to MRI and CT, ultrasound is the modality that is most constrained by obesity.

Related literature

Accuracy of ultrasonography is in general known to be dependent on the experience of the technician. This has however not yet been determined for inguinal hernias. We could not find a significant difference between the experience of the examiners in the FP and TP ultrasound group.

A few studies compared the accuracy of ultrasound technicians to radiologists. No studies were found specifically for ultrasound examination of the groin. Dawkins et al. found an interpretation discrepancy rate of abdominal ultrasounds of 15.5% with radiologists more likely to correctly assess the ultrasounds. However, this difference was not statistically significant. A systematic review by Kwee et al. registered whether the ultrasound was interpreted by a radiologist or a technician; similar results emerged from these studies.

In our hospital, the ultrasound technicians work under the strict supervision of radiologists. At the slightest doubt, the radiologist was present during the ultrasound examination. We can therefore safely assume that this had no influence on FP results.

In the past, peritoneography was the first imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of inguinal/femoral hernia. Current guidelines do not recommend this, given that significant abnormalities like a preperitoneal lipoma cannot be seen. Nowadays an MRI or CT scan is recommended when the anamnesis, physical examination and ultrasound are inconclusive.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hernia [^116mgPb9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominopelvic hernias are common clinical entities composed of a wide variety of congenital, traumatic, and iatrogenic etiologies. Any weakness in the body wall may result in hernia of cavity contents with concomitant risks of morbidity and mortality. Presentations may be specific, palpable body wall mass/bulge, or vague, nonspecific pain through bowel obstruction. This document focuses on initial imaging of the adult population with signs of symptoms prompting suspicion of abdominopelvic hernia. Imaging of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate defects is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Often CT and ultrasound are the first-line modalities to quickly evaluate the abdomen and pelvis, providing for accurate diagnoses and management of patients. MRI protocols may be useful as first-line imaging studies, especially in patients with orthopedic instrumentation. Although often performed, abdominal radiographs and fluorographic procedures may provide indirect evidence of hernias but are usually not indicated for initial diagnosis of hernia. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Operative management of acute abdomen after bariatric surgery in the emergency setting: the OBA guidelines [^115u6wHa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The radiation exposure of a CT scan is a major concern and the risks and benefits should be evaluated. The absolute risks of fetal effects, are small at doses of 100 mGy and negligible at doses of less than 50 mGy. CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis rarely exceed 25 mGy. Because the dose from a single-acquisition CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis poses a small risk to fetal health, CT may be appropriate depending on the clinical situation. However, an attempt should be made to perform this test with the lowest dose possible. The risks associated with radiation exposure of the conceptus during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy are reduced and also should be considered.

In pregnant LRYGB patients, the evaluation of the CT scan by a radiologist experienced in bariatric surgical procedures and by a bariatric surgeon is advised to improve the diagnostic accuracy in detecting IH. Signs on CT that suggest an IH depend on the location. Clustering and crowding of dilated small-bowel loops and congestion may be seen in most of the cases.

The most distinct radiological finding in patients with IH is the "whirlpool sign" that is the swirled appearance of the mesenteric vessels. When the herniated bowel passes through the transverse mesocolon defect, it is located behind the stomach remnant and may produce a mass effect on its posterior wall. If the herniated bowel passes through the jejuno-jejunostomy defect, it is pressed against the abdominal wall, causing central displacement of the colon, with no overlying omental fat. In cases of a Petersen-type hernia, the radiologic diagnosis can be difficult and the only clue may be engorgement and crowding of the mesenteric vessels and evidence of small-bowel obstruction.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^116D8nb2]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — diagnosis and imaging emphasizes core test accuracy concepts and appropriate use of imaging relative to clinical assessment. With tests that have a high sensitivity, a negative test effectively rules out the disease, and with tests that have a high specificity, a positive test effectively rules in the disease; additionally, the performance of a test depends on positive and negative predictive value, which depends directly on the prevalence of disease in the tested population. One of the purposes of a history and physical examination is to increase the prevalence of disease in patients seen for advanced diagnostic imaging/testing or offered surgery, and the review attempted to identify those symptoms or findings which have a high likelihood ratio for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. Cross-sectional imaging exams have a low intrinsic specificity with significant pathologic findings in asymptomatic populations, so results of any cross-sectional examination need to be closely correlated with the clinical examination. Direct visualization of intrinsic neurologic processes and neural impingement is noted as important in determining the etiology of radicular symptoms. Although the gold standard in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation is surgery, when assessing the validity of subjective complaints or physical examination findings, use of cross-sectional imaging as a gold standard may be considered an acceptable substitute, though the validity of surgery as a gold standard can be questioned as findings at surgery can be subjective. Additional sufficiently-powered observational studies of history/physical examination findings and diagnostic tests are needed to determine their value in influencing treatment assignment and outcome in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.

INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.
The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on multiple factors. Patients with a reducible hernia, improvement in symptoms, no evidence of complications, and an otherwise normal physical examination should be referred for outpatient surgical follow-up to discuss elective hernia repair. Patients with concern for abdominal wall hernia complications, including strangulation, intestinal obstruction, hernia incarceration, unrelieved severe pain, overlying skin changes, or evidence of systemic illness, should be seen by an acute care surgeon. Ideally, surgical evaluation should precede imaging in patients with nonreducible hernias and worrisome findings on physical examination.
Patients with an incarcerated hernia and concern for strangulation or presence of peritonitis require prompt surgical intervention, as increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention is associated with an increased need for bowel resection. Signs of bowel incarceration causing obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation), in addition to severe pain at the hernia site, are suggestive of strangulation. Systemic signs of strangulation may include hypotension and tachycardia, with elevations in serum lactate (> 2.0 mmol/L) and white blood cell often (although not definitively) found on initial laboratory evaluation. Physical examination may also show erythema or bruising/discoloration of the skin overlying the hernia. When these findings are present, or the patient is otherwise deemed at risk for strangulation within the hernia, an emergent exploration should be undertaken, with assessment of the viability of involved bowel, reduction of the hernia, and definitive hernia repair if practical. In many cases, imaging is not required and may lead to unnecessary delay. Similar to other EGS procedures, patients requiring acute urgent operation for hernia complications are at increased risk of complication compared with their elective counterparts.
In circumstances of diagnostic uncertainty or a difficult-to-interpret examination (as can be found in obesity), imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for high-risk imaging features associated with strangulation. While ultrasound can be used to help with the initial diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography scan is preferred. Even when the diagnosis of hernia is confidently made on physical examination, computed tomography imaging can provide useful clinical information on the fascial defect size and hernia contents to evaluate for signs of intestinal obstruction or ischemia. In the absence of a high index of suspicion for strangulation, attempts should be made to reduce an incarcerated abdominal wall hernia unless it is known that the patient has had a chronically nonreducible incarcerated hernia. Acute hernia incarceration that is not reducible should prompt urgent operative intervention to reduce the hernia, evaluate for the viability of the incarcerated bowel, and repair the hernia defect.
Acutely incarcerated hernias that are reducible but have high-risk features (Table 1) on imaging or physical examination should favor urgent repair (defined as nonemergent but performed during the index admission). These features are related to the patient's presentation and imaging findings. Clinical high-risk features include persistent abdominal pain after reduction or persistent nausea/vomiting. Radiographic findings associated with a higher risk for hernia complications should be considered when determining the need for urgent surgery in patients without clear signs of strangulation. Beyond the typical signs of bowel ischemia (e.g. pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air), the presence of fluid within the hernia sac, a transition point of the bowel at the neck of the hernia, bowel thickening within the hernia, and inflammatory stranding in the tissue along the hernia are considered high-risk features.
While repair of a hernia on initial presentation may be ideal, patient factors or local capacity may not permit this to be reasonably performed in all settings. Patient-specific factors should be considered, including age, frailty, American Society of Anesthesia score, and preadmission anticoagulant use, as each of these variables is associated with an increased risk of complications. – Some patients with hernias that exhibit a higher risk of recurrence may be discharged but with a defined plan to repair it in the short term to minimize patients' loss of follow-up. Variables associated with a higher risk of recurrence include clinical factors and radiographic features of the hernia (Table 2). Acute onset and escalation of symptoms should be considered potential reasons to hasten repair. The need for conscious sedation to achieve a successful visceral reduction marks patients as higher risk, and they should undergo expedited repair (when performed within 4 weeks, reincarceration rates of ~2% have been reported). High-risk anatomical features include certain types of hernias with femoral and Spigelian hernias exhibiting a higher incarceration rate and need for emergent repair; therefore, these should be addressed promptly. Women with groin hernia have a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery compared with men, especially if a femoral hernia is present. The size of the fascial defect is an unreliable predictor of the need for urgent repair, but primary hernia defects between 3 and 4 cm are at higher overall risk of incarceration compared with smaller or larger defects (with a rate of 10%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–5.74; p < 0.0001). Specific measurements comparing the width of a fascial defect and the height of the hernia sack can also be used to estimate an increased risk with a "mushrooming hernia", one with a narrow neck as compared with height creating an acute angle with the abdominal wall being associated with a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–20.00). Similarly, a study by James et al.identified the ratio of hernia size to fascial defect (neck) as a potential aid in surgical decision-making, finding that a hernia-to-neck ratio > 2.5 predicted the need for emergent repair. Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal wall hernia symptoms who do not have an indication for urgent surgery are at high risk of being lost to follow-up. A prior multicenter study of patients with an ED visit for hernia-related symptoms showed that over 50% did not follow up in the outpatient clinic, with 20% returning to the ED with additional hernia-related complaints. Considering socioeconomic factors and health care disparities to determine the need for operative intervention at the index admission will address low clinic follow-up rates and prevent future ED resource utilization. When immediate repair is not required, an effort should be made to ensure follow-up and initiate planning for definitive repair before the patient is discharged from the ED or the inpatient setting. The ability to follow-up in the outpatient clinic and access to elective, outpatient surgery should also be considered.
Nonurgent repair or repair after patient optimization prior to surgery can be pursued for symptomatic hernias without high-risk features. These patients can likely be safely discharged from the ED with elective outpatient follow-up. If modifiable patient risk factors are identified at the time of hernia diagnosis (such as smoking, need for weight loss, or control of diabetes), these should be addressed before surgery. If the hernia is deemed complex, its eventual repair should be scheduled when patient optimization has been achieved and performed by a surgeon experienced in complex abdominal wall reconstruction techniques. Prediction of the need for component separation can be a subjective determination or made in various ways using data from cross-sectional imaging comparing aspects of the hernia to the remaining abdominal wall. Watchful waiting and outpatient follow-up may be considered for asymptomatic ventral, inguinal, and umbilical hernias found incidentally on imaging. While these have a reasonably high rate of requiring an eventual repair, it is likely safe to monitor these hernias after the patient has received counseling on monitoring the hernia for symptoms in the future.

### Hip and groin injuries in athletes [^117Pw8Lm]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Although athletic injuries about the hip and groin occur less commonly than injuries in the extremities, they can result in extensive rehabilitation time. Thus, an accurate diagnosis and well-organized treatment plan are critical. Because loads of up to eight times body weight have been demonstrated in the hip joint during jogging, presumably even greater loads can occur during vigorous athletic competition. The available imaging modalities are effective diagnostic tools when selected on the basis of a thorough history and physical examination. Considerable controversy exists as to the cause and optimal treatment of groin pain in athletes, or the so-called "sports hernia". There has also been significant recent attention focused on intraarticular lesions that may be amenable to hip arthroscopy. This article briefly reviews several common hip and groin conditions affecting athletic patients and highlights some newer topics.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^111kaPs4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to outline the recent developments in the field of extraesophageal reflux disease and provide clinically relevant recommendations. The recommendations outlined in this review are based on expert opinion and on relevant publications from PubMed and EMbase. The Clinical Practice Updates Committee of the American Gastroenterological Association proposes the following recommendations: Best Practice Advice 1: The role of a gastroenterologist in patients referred for evaluation of suspected extra esophageal symptom is to assess for gastroesophageal etiologies that could contribute to the presenting symptoms. Best Practice Advice 2: Non-GI evaluations by ENT, pulmonary and/or allergy are essential and often should be performed initially in most patients as the cause of the extraesophageal symptom is commonly multifactorial or not esophageal in origin. Best Practice Advice 3: Empiric therapy with aggressive acid suppression for 6–8 weeks with special focus on response of the extraesophageal symptoms can help in assessing association between reflux and extraesophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 4: No single testing methodology exists to definitively identify reflux as the etiology for the suspected extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 5: Constellation of patient presentation, diagnostic test results and response to therapy should be employed in the determination of reflux as a possible etiology in extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 6: Testing may need to be off or on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy depending on patients' presenting demographics and symptoms in assessing the likelihood of abnormal gastroesophageal reflux. A. On therapy testing may be considered in those with high probability of baseline reflux (those with previous esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus or abnormal pH). B. Off therapy testing may be considered in those with low probability of baseline reflux with the goal of identifying moderate to severe reflux at baseline. Best Practice Advice 7: Lack of response to aggressive acid suppressive therapy combined with normal pH testing off therapy or impedance-pH testing on therapy significantly reduces the likelihood that reflux is a contributing etiology in presenting extraesophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 8: Surgical fundoplication is discouraged in those with extra esophageal reflux symptoms unresponsive to aggressive PPI therapy. Best Practice Advice 9: Fundoplication should only be considered in those with a mechanical defect (e.g., hiatal hernia), moderate to severe reflux at baseline off PPI therapy who have continued reflux despite PPI therapy and have failed more conservative non-GI treatments.

### Inguinal hernias: room for a better understanding [^116NM2tr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernias are a common problem but often present with diagnostic dilemmas, in part as a result of the complex anatomy of the region. A simplified analogy is put forward in the hope of increasing the understanding of the anatomy and some guidance given in an endeavor to differentiate direct and indirect hernias, with significance to their possible complication rates.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^114FujPo]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations and future research

In case of a visible or palpable swelling, there is no need to perform an ultrasound unless the physical examination is inconclusive. In our population, 136 of the 175 patients (77.7%) presented with a visible swelling and/or a positive Valsalva maneuver, which may have resulted in a slight overestimation of the PPV. Therefore, we also calculated the PPV of ultrasounds separately for the group without a (visible) swelling. The PPV was not significantly lower in the group without swelling than the group with a (visible) swelling (84.6% vs 90.9%, p = 0.102).

However, the GP or the surgeon only requested ultrasounds in case there was insufficient certainty after physical examination to make a diagnosis. The fact that the diagnosis had indeed been uncertain, can also be deduced from the finding that there were also FP outcomes (almost 10%) in the group that was considered clinically positive.

We suspected a potential relationship between previous inguinal surgery and FP results due to changed anatomy or adhesions. However, no significant difference between the two groups in changed anatomy or adhesions was found. It is important to note that no FP ultrasounds were found in the previously operated patients. Thus, it may be important in future studies to distinguish between a group with and without previous surgery.

Unfortunately, it was not possible to assess sensitivity and specificity of preoperative ultrasound since patients with a negative ultrasound were not included in our study because they often do not undergo surgery.

Due to the relatively small cohort size and a variety of surgical procedures, it was not possible to establish a model that could predict the odds on a FP ultrasound. For each parameter that can be evaluated in a prediction model, approximately 10–15 patients with FP results should be included.

### Computed tomography in ventral hernia diagnosis: have we improved? A quality improvement initiative [^11367yrJ]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies suggest that agreement between readers of computed tomography (CT) scans for the diagnosis of a ventral hernia (VH) is poor (32% agreement, κ = 0.21). Recommendations were developed by surgeons and radiologists after determining common reasons for disagreement among CT reviewers; however, the long-term effect of adoption of these recommendations has not been assessed. The aim of this quality improvement (QI) project was to determine whether the incorporation of recommendations developed by surgeons and radiologists improves agreement among reviewers of CT scans in diagnosing a VH.

Methods

A prospective cohort of patients, with a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis in the past 1 y, attending a surgery clinic at a single institution was enrolled. Enrolled subjects underwent a standardized physical examination by a trained hernia surgeon to determine the likelihood of a clinical VH (no, indeterminate, or yes). The QI intervention was the distribution and implementation of previously described recommendations. After a year of intervention, independent radiologists assessed patients' CT scans for the presence or absence of a VH. Percent agreement and kappa were calculated to determine interobserver reliability. In-person discussion on scans with disagreement was held, and the results were used as a "gold standard" to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for CT scan diagnosis of a VH.

Results

A total of 79 patients were included in the study. After QI intervention, seven radiologists agreed on 43% of the scans, and κ was 0.50 (P < 0.001). Agreement was highest among patients with a high clinical likelihood of a VH and lowest among patients with an indeterminate clinical likelihood. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.369 and 0.833, respectively.

Conclusions

After the implementation of recommendations, there is improved agreement among radiologists reading CT scans for the diagnosis of a VH. However, there is substantial room for improvement, and CT scans for the diagnosis of VH is not ready for widespread use.

### Internal herniation incidence after RYGB and the predictive ability of a CT scan as a diagnostic tool [^116sq9MV]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The incidence of IH can be significantly reduced by closing the mesenteric defects. The diagnostic accuracy of a CT scan in supporting the choice of treatment is not useful in a patient with open MD. However, when a patient with closed MD is suspected of IH, a CT scan can be predictive for the diagnosis of an IH.

After the correction of an internal herniation, three out of ten patients still have postoperative complaints. This suggests that, in addition to an IH, there are other causes for abdominal pain after RYGB.

### Sports hernias: a systematic literature review [^112DLqXc]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

This review summarises the existing knowledge about pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, conservative treatment, surgery and post-surgical rehabilitation of sports hernias. Sports hernias occur more often in men, usually during athletic activities that involve cutting, pivoting, kicking and sharp turns, such as those that occur during soccer, ice hockey or football. Sports hernias generally present an insidious onset, but with focused questioning a specific inciting incident may be identified. The likely causative factor is posterior inguinal wall weakening from excessive or high repetition shear forces applied through the pelvic attachments of poorly balanced hip adductor and abdominal muscle activation. There is currently no consensus as to what specifically constitutes this diagnosis. As it can be difficult to make a definitive diagnosis based on conventional physical examination, other methods, such as MRI and diagnostic ultrasonography are often used, primarily to exclude other conditions. Surgery seems to be more effective than conservative treatment, and laparoscopic techniques generally enable a quicker recovery time than open repair. However, in addition to better descriptions of surgical anatomy and procedures and conservative and post-surgical rehabilitation, well-designed research studies are needed, which include more detailed serial patient outcome measurements in addition to basing success solely on return to sports activity timing. Only with this information will we better understand sports hernia pathogenesis, verify superior surgical approaches, develop evidence-based screening and prevention strategies, and more effectively direct both conservative and post-surgical rehabilitation.

### Meta-analysis of sonography in the diagnosis of inguinal hernias [^115NtX1G]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Groin hernias are common conditions, and there is a need for accurate imaging when the clinical diagnosis is not clear. A meta-analysis was undertaken to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of sonography in the diagnosis of inguinal hernias. After review of literature searches, 9 original articles were included. Data were pooled and statistically analyzed. In the studies included, sensitivity ranged from 92.7% to 100%; specificity ranged from 22.2% to 100%; the positive predictive value ranged from 83.3 to 100%; and the negative predictive value ranged from 40 to 100%. Sonography has overall sensitivity of 96.6%, specificity of 84.8%, and a positive predictive value of 92.6%. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, sonography offers value as an initial imaging modality. It has advantages over other radiologic methods, as it is inexpensive and has minimal complications. When the clinical diagnosis of an inguinal hernia is uncertain, sonographic findings should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical judgment, as its diagnostic accuracy is reduced in the absence of any clinically palpable hernia.

### Diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography in predicting contralateral inguinal hernia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1172Sm16]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

One of the difficulties interpreting our study results is that the diagnostic ultrasonographic criteria to detect CPPV differ among the included studies (Table 2). First, some studies differentiate between CPPV and contralateral inguinal hernia, while others consider CPPV as potential hernia sac and include them in the category 'contralateral hernia'. Thus, unlike others, Erez et al. used the hypoechoic width at the middle of the inguinal canal as the point of reference, instead of e.g. the maximum diameter or width of the inguinal canal at the internal ring. A CPPV or contralateral hernia is further considered as the patency of the PV, as the presence of fluid, bowel loops or omentum in an open PV, or as the diameter of the internal ring exceeds a certain value (e.g. ≥ 4 or 4.5 mm). This shows the necessity of establishing more adequate homogeneous ultrasonographic criteria to accurately detect CPPV. The results should be interpreted with caution because of high heterogeneity. Most studies included in our meta-analysis (n = 7) only explored the contralateral groin if preoperative ultrasonography yielded positive test results. This indicates a higher probability of the presence of CPPV during surgery, which could lead to an overestimation of the index test results. False negative rates of ultrasonography (FNR) for CPPV and FNR regarding the occurrence of MCIH might also be imprecise, since only four studies surgically explored all contralateral groins irrespective of the preoperative ultrasonographic test results and only four studies have reported postoperative outcomes among patients who were not explored (Tables 1 and 2). The use of different cut-off values to detect CPPV in the included studies might cause threshold effects to occur, also leading to heterogeneity of the results. Unfortunately, this meta-analysis did not provide enough data to explore the effects of differences in study characteristics on the estimates of the diagnostic test accuracy.

In conclusion, preoperative ultrasonography of the contralateral groin to detect CPPV seems promising, but may result in an overestimation of MCIH prevalence. More adequate, unequivocal ultrasonographic criteria are mandatory for proper diagnosis of CPPV and careful consideration should be given to what the appropriate reference standard is to establish accurate diagnosis of MCIH. Finally, risk factors need to be identified that can predict whether a CPPV actually develops into a clinically relevant MCIH or not.

### Effectiveness of sonography in detecting clinically occult femoral hernias [^114zsZLj]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of sonography for femoral hernia diagnosis in patients with suspected hernias that were not evident on clinical examination.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed for 39 consecutive patients with 40 clinically suspected but occult femoral hernias and subsequent positive sonographic findings for femoral hernias. Clinical records for all patients were reviewed for surgical outcomes and clinical follow-up. Surgical findings of a femoral hernia sac or widened femoral canal requiring repair, with symptomatic relief after the procedure, were considered positive for a femoral hernia.

Results

Among the 40 femoral hernias examined by sonography, 33 of 40 groins underwent surgical exploration, with 32 true-positive findings and 1 false-positive finding on sonography. The false-positive case was an inguinal hernia at surgery. The accuracy of sonography was 96.9% for those with surgical correlations. The remaining 7 patients did not undergo surgery but had clinical follow-up.

Conclusions

This study confirms high diagnostic accuracy of sonography for nonpalpable femoral hernias in symptomatic groins compared to surgical findings.
