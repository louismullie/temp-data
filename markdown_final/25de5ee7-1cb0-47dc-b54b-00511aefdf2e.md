## Question

differential for hyperflexibility in larger joints

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the differential diagnosis of hyperflexibility in larger joints (joint hypermobility) and a practical evaluation framework. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical finding and choosing validated assessments. Then, I should differentiate asymptomatic from symptomatic hypermobility to set the depth of workup. Next, I will organize etiologies into heritable connective tissue disorders, myopathies, skeletal dysplasias, chromosomal syndromes, and acquired causes. After that, I'll extract key differentiating features and outline a practical evaluation pathway, including red flags, investigations, and when to pursue genetics or cardiology. Finally, I should integrate management principles and risks, including sports injury and multisystem comorbidities, to contextualize prognosis and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm terminology and measurement because words like "hypermobility", "hyperlaxity", and "hyperflexibility" are often conflated; clinically, we evaluate generalized joint hypermobility using the Beighton score and can supplement screening with the validated five-part questionnaire, and while I initially recalled a threshold of 4/9 for adults, wait, let me verify the current cutoffs — right, contemporary criteria generally use age-adjusted thresholds with ≥ 6/9 for prepubertal children, ≥ 5/9 for pubertal to age 50, and ≥ 4/9 for those over 50, so I should correct my earlier mental note and apply ≥ 5/9 for most adults rather than 4/9, with the five-part questionnaire helping borderline cases [^113xCqDk] [^113xCqDk] [^113SLtb3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — before building a wide differential, I need to separate asymptomatic generalized joint hypermobility, which can be a normal variant and decreases with age, from symptomatic hypermobility that includes pain, instability, dislocations, fatigue, or multisystem features, because the latter warrants evaluation for hypermobile EDS or other heritable disorders and is frequently overlooked or mislabeled as nonspecific chronic pain syndromes in practice [^113SLtb3] [^115gKGDQ] [^1138usCi].

> I will now organize etiologies, starting with heritable disorders of connective tissue: hypermobile EDS is the most common symptomatic phenotype and is diagnosed clinically under the 2017 framework, while classical and vascular EDS have defined collagen gene mutations and more prominent skin scarring or vascular fragility respectively; Marfan syndrome (FBN1) and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (TGFBR pathway) can present with joint laxity but are distinguished by systemic features and aortic disease risk; osteogenesis imperfecta and Stickler syndrome also belong here with their characteristic bone fragility and ocular/craniofacial findings respectively, so I need to ensure I screen for syndromic clues beyond the joints to guide targeted testing [^113dCzsV] [^115HE8L6] [^115w9qN4] [^112Ukga5].

> Next, I should review neuromuscular causes where muscle weakness permits passive hypermobility: Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy (COL6-related) can show distal hyperlaxity with proximal weakness and contractures, and RYR1-related central core/multi-minicore diseases may present with hypotonia and laxity; this pattern of weakness with hypermobility should pivot my exam toward detailed motor testing and possibly creatine kinase, EMG, or gene panels directed by phenotype [^113Hwn7p].

> Let me consider skeletal dysplasias and chromosomal syndromes: spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity is prototypic for severe generalized laxity with short stature and deformity; cleidocranial dysplasia may have clavicular hypoplasia and milder laxity; Down syndrome commonly features ligamentous laxity and atlantoaxial instability risk, so cervical precautions are crucial if neurologic symptoms or surgery are contemplated; recognizing these categories depends on growth pattern, dysmorphology, and radiographic skeletal survey findings [^115HE8L6] [^1112LSDk].

> I should double-check acquired contributors too: pregnancy-related hormonal changes, particularly relaxin, can increase laxity and transiently accentuate hypermobility or unmask an underlying predisposition; high-level flexibility training in dancers and gymnasts can cause regional hypermobility without systemic stigmata; and rarely, medications such as cysteamine bitartrate DR have been implicated, so a thorough exposure and training history is essential [^112EbKH3] [^115HE8L6].

> Now, I will extract discriminating features to narrow the list: in hEDS, think generalized hypermobility with soft/velvety skin, easy bruising, chronic pain, and autonomic or GI comorbidities without a known gene; classical EDS adds marked skin hyperextensibility with atrophic scars; vascular EDS suggests translucent skin, easy bruising, and early arterial or organ rupture; Marfan points to marfanoid habitus and ocular/ectopia lentis with aortic root dilation; Loeys-Dietz includes hypertelorism, bifid uvula, arterial tortuosity, and aggressive aortic aneurysms; osteogenesis imperfecta features blue sclerae and fracture propensity; Stickler includes high myopia/retinal detachment and midface hypoplasia; neuromuscular disorders add fixed or progressive weakness and contractures, which should recalibrate my workup toward neuromuscular testing rather than primarily connective tissue pathways [^113dCzsV] [^115w9qN4] [^115bRsPn] [^114XwgHn].

> Let me first confirm the pragmatic evaluation steps: start with Beighton scoring and the five-part questionnaire, then a detailed history for pain patterns, instability events, dislocations, fatigue, dysautonomia, GI dysmotility, hernias, and family history, followed by a targeted exam for skin extensibility and scarring, marfanoid features, ocular findings, craniofacial anomalies, and neuromuscular weakness; basic labs are usually low yield unless inflammatory or neuromuscular disease is suspected, and genetic testing is targeted when phenotypic clues suggest classical or vascular EDS, Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, OI, or Stickler, while hEDS remains a clinical diagnosis under 2017 criteria, with echocardiography indicated when syndromic aortopathy is in the differential [^113xCqDk] [^113dCzsV] [^113SLtb3].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that escalate urgency: features suggestive of vascular EDS or Loeys-Dietz, such as spontaneous arterial events, organ rupture, rapidly progressive aortic enlargement, or family history of early vascular catastrophe, mandate expedited genetics and cardiology; recurrent fractures with minimal trauma point toward OI; significant proximal weakness, respiratory involvement, or early contractures favor a myopathy and warrant neuromuscular referral; cervical symptoms or planned anesthesia in Down syndrome necessitate consideration of atlantoaxial instability and appropriate imaging precautions [^113dCzsV] [^115bRsPn].

> Next, I should review common comorbidities in symptomatic hypermobility because they shape management: patients with hEDS/HSD frequently report anxiety, orthostatic intolerance or POTS, functional GI disorders, pelvic and bladder dysfunction, and chronic pain and fatigue, and although many with hEDS do not have true small bowel dysmotility, overlap with visceral hypersensitivity is common; pediatric cohorts show increased rates of eosinophilic esophagitis and celiac disease compared with the general population, which is clinically relevant if there are upper GI symptoms or atopy [^113dCzsV] [^111fMXEd] [^116S9H7i].

> I will now examine musculoskeletal risk and sport implications because this influences counseling: generalized joint hypermobility is associated with higher odds of second ACL injury after reconstruction and return to sport, so I need to incorporate GJH into reinjury risk planning and possibly graft choice and neuromuscular training intensity; hypermobility also correlates with patellar instability and imaging nuances such as altered elbow congruence depending on joint position, which can prevent misinterpretation of pathology if MRI is performed in extension and pronation; systematic reviews suggest mixed associations with primary lower limb injury, so risk appears more pronounced for reinjury and specific instability patterns [^114mGryt] [^117TDhTH] [^113ugwVk] [^113Y4zuM] [^113dCzsV] [^115swbLE].

> But wait, what about management once the differential is framed — let me reconsider the core principles: for hEDS/HSD, first-line care is early multidisciplinary, emphasizing education, graded physical and occupational therapy focused on proprioception and periarticular muscle strengthening, activity modification to avoid end-range loading, and adjuncts like bracing or orthoses for regional instability; psychological support and self-management strategies improve adherence and outcomes; in pregnancy, targeted exercise such as Pilates can help counter laxity by enhancing neuromuscular control; procedural planning may require caution with regional anesthesia due to variable bleeding diathesis and reports of local anesthetic resistance in some EDS patients, so shared planning with anesthesia is prudent [^114bNyif] [^112iRnvV] [^113Gb7MY] [^116vW5mU] [^111ZYnZx].

> I need to ensure follow-up and systems-level issues are addressed because care fragmentation is common: patients benefit from coordinated primary care with informed recognition, stratified referrals to genetics, cardiology, ophthalmology, physiotherapy, and pain services, and attention to barriers such as stigma and inconsistent clinician awareness; this longitudinal approach mitigates diagnostic delay and optimizes functional outcomes [^116R6Xy1] [^117LJk4G].

> In summary, the differential for hyperflexibility of larger joints spans normal variants, hEDS/HSD, other EDS subtypes, Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes, OI and Stickler, neuromuscular disorders with secondary laxity, skeletal dysplasias, chromosomal syndromes, and acquired states such as pregnancy or sports-specific training; a structured pathway anchored on Beighton scoring, targeted syndromic screening, red-flag recognition, and judicious testing reliably separates benign from pathologic hypermobility, while multidisciplinary, exercise-centered management addresses the substantial symptom burden in those with symptomatic hypermobility [^113xCqDk] [^113dCzsV].

The differential diagnosis for large-joint hypermobility includes **heritable connective tissue disorders** (notably hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^113dCzsV], Marfan syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta [^115bRsPn]), **hypermobility spectrum disorders** [^113SLtb3], and **neuromuscular conditions** such as congenital myopathies [^113Hwn7p] and muscular dystrophies [^115HE8L6]. Other causes include **endocrine states** (pregnancy [^112EbKH3], hyperthyroidism), **acquired ligamentous laxity** from repetitive microtrauma or overuse [^115swbLE], and idiopathic or familial hypermobility. Evaluation should use the **Beighton score** [^114WLgT4] and a validated five-part questionnaire [^113xCqDk], with targeted genetic testing [^113SLtb3] and imaging [^115zRnoB] to distinguish among these entities.

---

## Heritable connective tissue disorders (HDCTs)

HDCTs are a **major cause of generalized joint hypermobility** and often present with systemic features:

- **Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS)**: Generalized hypermobility, chronic pain, frequent dislocations, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility; diagnosis is clinical, as no definitive genetic test exists [^113SLtb3] [^113dCzsV].

- **Classical EDS**: Marked skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, and generalized hypermobility [^113dCzsV].

- **Vascular EDS**: Less prominent hypermobility, but significant vascular fragility and risk of arterial rupture [^113dCzsV].

- **Marfan syndrome**: Tall stature, arachnodactyly, lens dislocation [^112Ukga5], aortic root dilation, and generalized hypermobility [^115bRsPn].

- **Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)**: Bone fragility, blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and generalized hypermobility [^115bRsPn].

- **Loeys-Dietz syndrome**: Generalized hypermobility, arterial aneurysms, craniofacial anomalies, and skeletal abnormalities [^115w9qN4].

- **Stickler syndrome**: Midface hypoplasia, cleft palate, myopia, retinal detachment [^114XwgHn], hearing loss, and generalized hypermobility [^115bRsPn].

---

## Hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSDs)

HSDs are diagnosed when **generalized hypermobility** is accompanied by musculoskeletal symptoms but criteria for hEDS or other HDCTs are not met [^113SLtb3]. Subtypes include generalized, peripheral, localized, and historical forms and often involve chronic pain, fatigue, and functional impairment [^116R6Xy1].

---

## Neuromuscular disorders

Several neuromuscular conditions feature joint hypermobility due to muscle weakness or connective tissue abnormalities [^115HE8L6]. These include **congenital myopathies** such as Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, Bethlem myopathy, and central core disease, which often present with hypermobility, muscle weakness, and contractures [^113Hwn7p], and **muscular dystrophies** such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, which can include hypermobility from muscle weakness and connective tissue involvement [^113Hwn7p]. **Peripheral neuropathies**, notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, may also cause hypermobility secondary to muscle weakness and ligamentous laxity [^115HE8L6].

---

## Endocrine and metabolic conditions

Hormonal and metabolic states can increase ligamentous laxity and hypermobility — most notably **pregnancy** [^112EbKH3], in which elevated relaxin and estrogen increase laxity, and **hyperthyroidism**, where excess thyroid hormone may have similar effects. Connective tissue metabolic disorders such as homocystinuria and mucopolysaccharidoses may also present with hypermobility [^115bRsPn].

---

## Acquired ligamentous laxity

Repetitive microtrauma, overuse, or injury can cause **acquired ligamentous laxity and hypermobility**. Chronic overuse or **repetitive microtrauma** (e.g. gymnastics, dance) may lead to ligamentous laxity, while **traumatic injuries** (e.g. ACL tears, shoulder dislocations) can result in chronic instability and hypermobility.

---

## Idiopathic or familial hypermobility

Some individuals have **generalized hypermobility** without identifiable underlying pathology — often familial and benign — but it may still cause chronic pain and functional impairment [^1138usCi].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach is **essential** and should include:

- **Clinical assessment**: Beighton score [^114WLgT4] and validated five-part questionnaire [^113xCqDk].

- **Family history**: Identify hereditary patterns [^113SLtb3] and systemic features [^113dCzsV].

- **Genetic testing**: Targeted testing for suspected HDCTs (e.g. Marfan, OI, Stickler) [^112Ukga5].

- **Imaging**: MRI or ultrasound for joint instability, ligamentous laxity, or associated abnormalities [^115zRnoB].

- **Multidisciplinary evaluation**: Involve genetics, rheumatology, orthopedics, and physical therapy [^114bNyif].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause** and may include:

- **Physical therapy**: Core treatment for hEDS/HSD, emphasizing strength, proprioception, and joint stability [^112iRnvV] [^114bNyif].

- **Orthotics and bracing**: For joint instability and injury prevention [^114bNyif].

- **Pain management**: Multimodal approaches, including medications and cognitive behavioral therapy [^116R6Xy1].

- **Surgical intervention**: Reserved for severe instability or recurrent dislocations [^112iRnvV].

- **Patient education**: Activity modification and injury prevention [^114bNyif].

---

Large-joint hypermobility spans HDCTs, HSDs, neuromuscular, endocrine, metabolic, acquired, and idiopathic causes. A structured evaluation — using the **Beighton score**, family history, genetic testing, and imaging — guides diagnosis and management.

### Joint hypermobility as a distinctive feature in the differential diagnosis of myopathies [^113Hwn7p]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital and adult-onset inherited myopathies represent a wide spectrum of syndromes, with classification based on clinical features, as well as biochemical and genetic defects. Joint hypermobility is a distinctive clinical feature that has often been underrecognized. Thus, we present an overview of myopathies associated with joint hypermobility, including Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, Bethlem myopathy, congenital muscular dystrophy with joint hyperlaxity, multi-minicore disease, central core disease, and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2E with joint hyperlaxity and contractures.

- **Inherited disorders of connective tissue**: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome are characterized by both muscular features and joint hypermobility.

Furthermore, we will briefly discuss the extent and pattern of joint hypermobility in these myopathies and connective tissue disorders. Two grading scales are commonly used to score the severity of joint hypermobility. We conclude by focusing on the various molecules involved in these disorders and their role and interactions in muscle and tendon. This review aims to further elucidate the pathophysiology of combined hypermobility and myopathy. Hopefully, it will contribute to enhanced recognition of joint hypermobility and aid in differential diagnosis.

### The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113dCzsV]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Ehlers-Danlos syndrome:

- **Definition**: EDS is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by hyperextensible skin, hypermobile joints, and tissue fragility.

- **Pathophysiology**: EDS results from defects in collagen synthesis or structure, leading to weakened connective tissues. Mutations in genes such as COL5A1, COL5A2, COL3A1, COL1A1, and COL1A2 are implicated in different subtypes, affecting the primary structure and later processing of type I, III, and V collagens.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of EDS is believed to be underestimated, ranging from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 400,000, depending on the subtype.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for EDS include a family history of the disorder, as it may be inherited in some cases depending on the subtype. It may also be associated with other genetic disorders or rheumatological diseases.

- **Disease course**: The syndrome is classified into several subtypes based on clinical presentation and genetic mutations, with the most common being the hypermobile, classical, and vascular types. Common features include joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, easy bruising, and Marfanoid habitus. The vascular type is particularly severe, with risks of arterial rupture, organ rupture, and early mortality. Other complications can include chronic pain, joint dislocations, and early-onset osteoarthritis. Associated systemic findings include anxiety disorders, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction.

### Generalised joint hypermobility and excess knee hyperextension are associated with an increased risk for second ACL injury, but not primary ACL injury, in female football players: A 5-year follow-up [^113ugwVk]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the association between generalised joint hypermobility, knee hyperextension, knee laxity, and static standing alignment with the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in a cohort of female football players with an ACL-reconstructed (ACLR) knee and in knee-healthy controls.

We prospectively followed 117 female football players with ACLR (age, mean ± standard deviation, 20 ± 2 years; average 19 ± 9 months after ACLR) and 119 knee-healthy players (age, 19 ± 3 years) for 5 years. At baseline, all players were assessed for generalised joint hypermobility (Beighton score), knee extension range of motion, knee laxity (KT-1000, Lachman and pivot shift tests), and static standing alignment (visual assessment graded as varus, valgus, or neutral). Log-binomial regression with risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for new ACL injury were calculated. Point biserial and Spearman's rank correlations were used for correlation analysis of baseline anatomical variables.

During the 5-year follow-up, 43 ACLR players sustained a second ACL injury (30 re-ruptures and 13 contralateral ruptures) and 11 knee-healthy players had an index ACL injury. ACLR players with Beighton score ≥ 5 (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.04–2.70; p = 0.035) and knee hyperextension > 5° in the non-ACL-reconstructed knee (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.02–2.73; p = 0.042) had a higher risk of a second ACL injury; knee laxity and static standing alignment were not associated with a second ACL injury (n.s.). No significant associations were seen between baseline variables and incidence of primary ACL injury.

### Effectiveness of a prenatal pilates program on ligamentous laxity and joint hypermobility in pregnant women: A dual-center randomized controlled trial [^112EbKH3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy induces profound anatomical, hormonal, and biomechanical adaptations essential for fetal development and maternal health. However, these physiological changes increase demands on the maternal musculoskeletal system, often leading to discomfort, decreased overall body mobility, and a heightened risk of musculoskeletal injuries, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy.

Relaxin is one of the normal physiological adaptations of pregnancy, softening and loosening the pelvic ligaments to prepare for childbirth. Rising during the first trimester, peaking at 12 weeks, and plateauing by 17 weeks, relaxin also contributes to cardiovascular changes such as vasodilation and increased blood volume. In some women, however, its systemic effects on connective tissues may become excessive, leading to ligamentous laxity and joint hypermobility that can impair joint stability and neuromuscular control. Such changes may manifest as low back pain and knee instability.

### Understanding the issues of hypermobility spectrum disorders and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in primary care: a qualitative integrative review [^117LJk4G]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

Hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSDs) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) are disorders characterized by joint laxity, pain, and fatigue, causing multi-system complications and significant burden. Primary care is essential in supporting HSD/hEDS patients, and understanding challenges in this setting is key.

This integrative review aims to understand and analyze issues that exist in primary care for clinicians and HSD/hEDS patients. Embase, Medline, Health Management Information Consortium, Social Policy & Practice, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases were searched in October 2024, and qualitative or mixed-method studies were included. Thematic analysis and critical appraisal were performed on eight studies.

Three themes were identified as common issues for patients and clinicians:

- **Structural barriers**: Uncoordinated services and inadequate training.
- **Societal barriers**: Stigma was identified as a common issue.
- **Consultation barriers to care**: These barriers existed at multiple levels.

Few published studies explored the direct experiences of patients and clinicians in primary care, and data varied in quality. Future qualitative studies could explore primary care physicians' knowledge and attitudes towards HSD/hEDS in this setting to inform the organization of appropriate services and education strategies. This could contribute to knowledge and bias reduction, improving patient outcomes in practice.

### A novel in vivo skin extensibility test for joint hypermobility [^116bF2SA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The stress-strain curve derived from stretching skin is not linear but follows a J-shaped curve. Initially, there is a generous yield followed by a steep linear phase, where considerable additional force is required to achieve modest increases in deformation. The former represents the taking up of slack due to the alignment of dermal collagen bundles in the line of force, while the gradient of the latter represents Young's modulus for skin. Skin hyperextensibility in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is limited to the initial phase of taking up slack. Skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility (JHM) are part of the Revised 1998 Brighton diagnostic criteria for the benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS), considered by many to be akin to EDS-hypermobility type. JHM may be screened for using the Beighton Score or a 5-point questionnaire. Our aim was to validate a novel method of measuring skin extensibility based on these observations, in addition to revalidating the 5-point questionnaire.

- **Methods**: 250 volunteers (131 female), median age 39 years (range 18–89 years), without BJHS, had their joint mobility evaluated using the Beighton Score compared to the 5-point questionnaire. A Beighton score ≥ 4/9 was considered to represent JHM. Skin extensibility was determined by placing 2 dots on the dorsum of the right hand between the second and third metacarpals, approximately 10 mm apart, and measuring the distance using an electronic caliper. Perpendicular to the metacarpals, a force was applied until the skin was fully taut and the increment was measured.

### Joint hypermobility syndrome: Recognizing a commonly overlooked cause of chronic pain [^1164nfMY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Joint hypermobility syndrome, also known as benign hypermobility syndrome, is a connective tissue disease characterized by joint instability, chronic pain, and minor skin changes. It shares many clinical features with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type, to the extent that many authorities consider them part of the same disease process. Approximately 3% of the general population is believed to have joint hypermobility syndrome. Despite this high prevalence, the condition is largely overlooked by primary care physicians and specialists due to a lack of awareness, the heterogeneity of clinical presentations, and a reliance on physical examination for diagnosis. This oversight leads to delayed or missed opportunities for diagnosis and inappropriate interventions that frustrate both providers and patients.

We review the literature regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis of joint hypermobility syndrome and advocate for primary care physicians to consider it in the differential diagnosis of patients with chronic pain.

### The effects of joint hypermobility on pain and functional biomechanics in adolescents with juvenile fibromyalgia: secondary baseline analysis from a pilot randomized controlled trial [^111k7VZF]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Joint hypermobility is a common clinical finding amongst hereditary connective tissue disorders that is observed in pediatric rheumatological settings and is often associated with chronic pain. Joint hypermobility may also contribute to deficits in physical functioning and physical activity, but previous findings have been inconsistent. It is possible that physical activity impairment in joint hypermobility may be due to chronic aberrant movement patterns subsequent to increased joint laxity.

- **Method**: As part of a larger randomized pilot trial of juvenile onset fibromyalgia (JFM), a secondary analysis was conducted to explore whether adolescents with JFM and joint hypermobility differed from non-joint hypermobility peers in terms of pain, daily functioning, and biomechanics (i.e. kinetics and kinematics) during a moderately vigorous functional task.

- **Results**: From the larger sample of adolescents with JFM (N = 36), 13 adolescents (36.1%) met criteria for joint hypermobility, and 23 did not have joint hypermobility. Those with joint hypermobility exhibited poorer overall functioning (Md = 20, Q1, Q3 [5.8, 7.6] vs. Md = 29, Q1, Q3 [5.1, 7.6]) but there were no differences in pain (Md = 6.9, Q1, Q3 [22, 33] vs. Md = 6.45, Q1, Q3 [15, 29.5]). Inspection of time-series plots suggests those with joint hypermobility exhibited decreased hip flexion and frontal plane hip moment (e.g. resistance to dynamic valgus) during the landing phase (early stance) and greater hip and knee transverse plane moments during the propulsion phase (late stance) of the drop vertical jump task.

### Joint position and general hypermobility affect elbow joint congruence on magnetic resonance imaging: A prospective cohort study [^115zRnoB]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the study, significant differences in elbow joint congruence were found between participants in the normal and hypermobile groups in all positions except extension and pronation. Because the effect of hypermobility on joint congruence may be eliminated on MRI in extension and pronation, it can be assumed that a false-positive diagnosis of PLRI could be avoided if MRI is performed routinely in these positions.

- **Limitations**: Some limitations should be considered when interpreting the study's results. The threshold value of 5 for the Beighton score was potentially too low to extrapolate the results to patients with severe hypermobility. However, since significant differences were already found at low levels of hypermobility, it may be assumed that this effect is amplified in participants with a greater degree of general laxity. Furthermore, transferability of the results to everyday clinical practice is limited because the interrater reliability was only moderate. Some of the differences were as small as 0.1 mm, and the joint surface was not imaged as accurately as would have been possible using CT. Moreover, it is not known how axial loading of the joint or muscle strength and tension affect joint congruence and whether this would conceal signs of hypermobility.

### Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorders [^115gKGDQ]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorders are the most common symptomatic joint hypermobility conditions seen in clinical practice. The 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes replaced previous terms for symptomatic joint hypermobility with hypermobile EDS and introduced the term hypermobility spectrum disorders for patients not meeting diagnostic criteria for hypermobile EDS. Both are diagnosed by applying the 2017 diagnostic criteria, which also excludes other less common conditions presenting with joint hypermobility, such as other forms of EDS and heritable connective tissue disorders. Hypermobile EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but it does not have a known genetic mutation to help with diagnosis. Clinical features of hypermobile EDS include joint hypermobility, skin findings, and joint pains or redislocations. Hypermobile EDS and, less commonly, hypermobility spectrum disorders may also be associated with several extra-articular symptoms, including anxiety disorders, chronic pain, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction. The central goals of therapy are managing symptoms, preventing joint injury, and educating patients about their condition. Based on limited evidence, patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders may benefit from physical and occupational therapy, psychological support, and self-management. Primary care physicians play a key role not only in initial recognition and diagnosis but also in patient education.

### Exercise beliefs and behaviours of individuals with Joint Hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome - hypermobility type [^113Gb7MY]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Low credibility.

To explore the exercise beliefs and behaviours of individuals with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - hypermobility type and to delve into their experiences with physiotherapy, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted. This survey gathered both quantitative and qualitative data from adult members of the Hypermobility Syndromes Association and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Support UK. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to analyze the data, while qualitative responses were examined thematically.

A total of 946 questionnaires were returned and analyzed. The results indicated that participants who received exercise advice from a physiotherapist were 1.75 times more likely to report engaging in high volumes of weekly exercise (odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.30–2.36, p < 0.001) compared to those who did not receive such advice. Additionally, participants who believed exercise was crucial for long-term management were 2.76 times more likely to report high exercise volumes than those who did not share this belief (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.38–5.50, p = 0.004). The analysis revealed three key themes regarding physiotherapy experiences: physiotherapist as a partner, communication - knowledge, experience and safety.

Common barriers to exercise identified in this study were pain, fatigue, and fear. The survey found that advice from a physiotherapist and positive beliefs about the benefits of exercise significantly influenced the exercise behaviours reported by individuals with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - hypermobility type. Exercise remains a cornerstone of treatment for those with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - hypermobility type, highlighting its importance in effective rehabilitation strategies.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^111fMXEd]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) with its gastrointestinal associations is difficult to classify, as most patients with EDS do not have dysmotility of the small bowel, merely visceral hypersensitivity. Symptoms may mimic dysmotility (neuropathy), and the presence of EDS can contribute to dysmotility, usually if postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) or other associated factors like opiates are present. According to the 2017 classification, patients previously diagnosed with joint hypermobility syndrome and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome hypermobility type were reclassified as hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) if they met the strict criteria, or hypermobile spectrum disorders (HSD) if they had many but not all of the characteristics of hEDS. Patients with hEDS and HSD represent a third of patients referred to a tertiary neurogastroenterology clinic, and these patients tend to be young, female, with a poorer quality of life. hEDS/HSD is associated with a range of gut disorders, including acid reflux, abdominal pain (especially pain after eating or when any food arrives in the gut, even from an enteral feed), and constipation. There is often autonomic dysregulation, particularly PoTS, chronic urinary retention due to a failure of the urethral sphincter to relax (Fowler's syndrome), and hypoglycemia. Mast cell activation disorder is increasingly reported, most commonly in those with PoTS. An increasing number of patients with joint hypermobility are being identified.

### The differential diagnosis of children with joint hypermobility: a review of the literature [^116EtMQH]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

In total, 3629 papers were identified, of which 63 were duplicates and 236 related to instability following joint replacement surgery, leaving 3330 papers. Of these, 1534 papers focused on laxity of a specific joint, with the majority related to the shoulder, ankle, spine, knee, and TMJ as illustrated in Table 5. Most of these papers describe joint laxity resulting from soft tissue injury rather than inherited joint laxity.

The totals do not add up to 3330 as 200 papers discussed both instability of a single joint and either Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or joint hypermobility syndrome.

There were 1666 papers relating to the diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and a further 330 to joint hypermobility syndrome(s). The two articles that focus on the validity of diagnostic criteria are both written by Remvig and represent comprehensive reviews of the literature on the diagnostic tests for identifying generalized joint hypermobility and the criteria for diagnosing Benign Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (BJHS).

- **Definitions of hypermobility, hyperlaxity, hyperextensibility**: The words "hypermobility", "hyperlaxity", and "hyperextensibility" are used interchangeably by some authors and have not been clearly defined. The word "hypermobility" is most commonly used to describe excessive movement in the normal plane of movement, most frequently hyperextension, and "laxity" is used to describe excessive movement in an abnormal plane of movement, e.g. inferior subluxation.

### Features that exacerbate fatigue severity in joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome - hypermobility type [^115qsHA3]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, severity, and impact of fatigue on individuals with joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS)/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome - hypermobility type (EDS-HT) and establish potential determinants of fatigue severity in this population. Questionnaires on symptoms and signs related to fatigue, quality of life, mental health, physical activity participation, and sleep quality were completed by people with JHS/EDS-HT recruited through two social media sites. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of fatigue in this population.

Significant fatigue was reported by 79.5% of the 117 participants. Multiple regression analysis identified five predictors of fatigue severity, four being potentially modifiable, accounting for 52.3% of the variance in reported fatigue scores. Predictors of fatigue severity were as follows: the self-perceived extent of joint hypermobility, orthostatic dizziness related to heat and exercise, levels of participation in personal relationships and community, levels of physical activity, and dissatisfaction with the diagnostic process and management options provided for their condition.

Fatigue is a significant symptom associated with JHS/EDS-HT. Assessment of individuals with this condition should include measures of fatigue severity to enable targeted management of potentially modifiable factors associated with fatigue severity. Fatigue is a significant symptom reported by individuals affected by joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome - hypermobility type.

### The differential diagnosis of children with joint hypermobility: A review of the literature [^115hzogf]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

In this study, we aimed to identify and review publications relating to the diagnosis of joint hypermobility and instability. We developed an evidence-based approach to diagnosing children presenting with joint hypermobility and related symptoms.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline for papers with an emphasis on the diagnosis of joint hypermobility, including heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCT).

- **Results**: A total of 3330 papers were identified. Of these, 1534 pertained to the instability of a particular joint, 1666 related to the diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, and 330 related to joint hypermobility.

There are inconsistencies in the literature regarding joint hypermobility and its relationship and overlap with milder forms of HDCT. No reliable method exists for differentiating between joint hypermobility syndrome, familial articular hypermobility, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hypermobile type), suggesting these three disorders may represent different manifestations of the same spectrum of disorders. We describe our approach to children presenting with joint hypermobility and the published evidence and expert opinions on which this is based.

- **Conclusion**: Identifying the underlying genetic cause of joint hypermobility in a child, as well as recognizing hypermobile children who exhibit symptoms such as pain and fatigue, can be valuable. Such children might benefit from multidisciplinary rehabilitation management.

Every effort should be made to diagnose the underlying disorder responsible for joint hypermobility, which may only become apparent over time. We recommend using the term "joint hypermobility" consistently in these contexts.

### Generalized joint laxity and contralateral patellar hypermobility in unilateral recurrent patellar dislocators [^113Y4zuM]. Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the relation between generalized joint laxity and patellar hypermobility in individuals with unilateral recurrent patellar dislocations.

- **Type of study**: This was a case series.

- **Methods**: A total of 82 patients (23 male and 59 female) with unilateral recurrent patellar dislocation were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. The modified Carter and Wilkinson criteria for generalized joint laxity and the lateral patellar hypermobility test were used for assessment.

- **Results**: Generalized joint laxity (score of 4 or 5) was present in 20 patients (24%) with recurrent patellar dislocation and in 8 subjects (10%) of the control group. The mean total score was 2.5 (SD, 1.4) in the recurrent patellar dislocators and 1.7 (SD, 1.3) in the control group. The incidence of generalized joint laxity (P = 0.013) and the mean total score (P = 0.00004) were statistically significant between the two groups. A hypermobile patella was present in 42 patients (51%) and in 5 subjects (6%) of the control group, showing a large statistically significant difference (P < .00001).

- **Conclusions**: Although both a hypermobile patella and generalized joint laxity were significant between the recurrent dislocators and the control group, a hypermobile patella was more significant than generalized joint laxity as a predisposing factor for patellar dislocation.

- **Level of evidence**: Level IV, prognostic case series.

### Wrist stabilising exercise versus hand orthotic intervention for persons with hypermobility - A randomised clinical trial [^115HDyRP]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). High credibility.

Everyday life is affected by the function of the hand. Hand function includes the ability and skill to perform a single task but is also based on coordination and grip. Hypermobility spectrum disorders are conditions that can cause the joint to move outside the normal range expected for a specific joint but also include skin fragility and elasticity, joint instability, and/or weakness in muscles, ligaments, and connective tissue. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders characterized by musculoskeletal, skin, and vascular manifestations and consists of 13 different variants, with hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome clearly dominating (80–90%).

Symptoms often start at a young age. The prevalence varies and is found in approximately 10–20% of the world's population. From a gender perspective, hypermobility is more common in women (70–80%) than in men and decreases with age. In the present study, hypermobility spectrum disorders and hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are considered synonymous and are hereafter referred to as hypermobility spectrum disorders/hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. A laxity of the ligaments, for example in the wrists and fingers, can contribute to weakness and joint instability, which increases the risk of injuries in connection with occupation. Sustained loading in the end position also increases the risk of injury and can lead to pain, paraesthesia, or sub-/dislocation in the hand. Proprioception has the task of sensing the position of the joint, with what speed and precision the hand needs to move.

### Outcome measures for assessing change over time in studies of symptomatic children with hypermobility: A systematic review [^113chgKG]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Children with generalised joint hypermobility (GJH) and associated symptoms have been described in the literature under multiple diagnostic labels that have evolved over time. Generalised joint hypermobility (GJH) refers to abnormally high ranges of movement across multiple joints, with approximately one-fifth of children with GJH experiencing symptoms. Current diagnostic labels for children with GJH and associated symptoms include Generalised Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (G-HSD) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS), which further incorporates an extended phenotype including skin involvement, tissue fragility, or a marfanoid body habitus. These conditions were previously referred to as Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) or EDS-Hypermobile type, with experts historically reporting a lack of clinical distinction between the two. The term "children with GJH and associated symptoms" will be used throughout this review to refer to any of the now or previously used terminologies for this condition.

Children with GJH and associated symptoms report chronic pain, fatigue, and functional difficulties that negatively impact their quality of life. Chronic joint pain is often exacerbated following physical activity, with lower limb pain being the most commonly described location. Joint instability episodes and frequent soft tissue injuries have also been noted. Functional difficulties reported include motor development challenges, muscle torque deficits, and poor proprioception, resulting in a negative influence on school and/or social activities.

### The role of benign joint hypermobility in the pain experience in juvenile fibromyalgia: An observational study [^115oGVDi]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The findings of this study strengthen prior reports of joint hypermobility being commonly observed among clinical populations of adolescent juvenile fibromyalgia patients. Additionally, we found that hypermobility is associated with heightened pain sensitivity. Suggestions for future research include identifying the genetic link(s) attributable to these associated conditions, conducting continued physiological assessments to better understand the mechanisms of pain in both hypermobility and juvenile fibromyalgia, and evaluating targeted exercise programs for this population. A greater understanding of the various aspects of pain in juvenile fibromyalgia is needed to further enrich the multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of this complex syndrome.

### Generalized joint hypermobility and risk of lower limb joint injury during sport: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^115BxA4G]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Generalized joint hypermobility is a highly prevalent condition commonly associated with joint injuries. The literature has conflicting reports of the risk of joint injury in hypermobile sporting participants compared with their non-hypermobile peers. Systematic reviews have not been conclusive and no meta-analysis has been performed.

The purpose of this review was to determine whether individuals with generalized joint hypermobility have an increased risk of lower limb joint injury when undertaking sporting activities.

- **Study design**: Systematic review with meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: Studies were identified through a search without language restrictions of PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and SportDiscus databases from the earliest date through February 2009 with subsequent hand searching of reference lists. Inclusion criteria for studies were determined before searching, and all included studies underwent methodological quality assessment by two independent reviewers. Meta-analyses for joint injury of the lower limb, knee, and ankle were performed using a random effects model. The difference in injury proportions between hypermobility categories was tested with the z statistic.

- **Results**: Of 4841 identified studies, 18 met all inclusion criteria with methodological quality ranging from 1 of 6 to 5 of 6. A variety of tests of hypermobility and varied cutoff points to define the presence of generalized joint hypermobility were used, so the authors determined a standardized cutoff to indicate generalized joint hypermobility.

### Hypermobility among adolescents and the association with spinal deformities: A large cross-sectional study [^113USsd7]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The assessment of hypermobility was robust, involving a two-pronged approach. The initial screening was conducted through a self-reported medical questionnaire, which highlighted hypermobility and associated clinical manifestations such as joint pain and recurrent sprains. This was substantiated with a subsequent physical evaluation using the Beighton scoring system. Only scores of 5/9 or higher were considered indicative of hypermobility. It is essential to note that inherent hypermobility conditions, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, were consciously excluded from the evaluation based on the recruits' medical records.

The statistical analyses focused on discerning potential associations between spinal deformities and hypermobility. Logistic regression was used, with data modeled as binary and multinomial sets. The logistic regression results were elucidated using odds ratios, their respective 95% confidence intervals, and P values. All analytical procedures were executed using SPSS software, version 19.0.

### Association between excessive joint laxity and a wider Hill-Sachs lesion in anterior shoulder instability [^113NH3PZ]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Excessive general joint laxity, a negative prognostic factor in joint instability, has not been studied to determine its relationship with bipolar bone loss in anterior shoulder instability.

- **Purpose/hypothesis**: This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of bipolar bone defects in the presence of excessive joint laxity and the clinical outcomes based on the on-track/off-track theory. We hypothesized that (1) patients with excessive joint laxity might have less significant bipolar bone defects compared with those without excessive joint laxity and (2) no significant difference would be found in the clinical outcomes, including recurrence rate.

- **Study design**: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

- **Methods**: This study included 81 patients who had undergone arthroscopic Bankart repair, with (group L; n = 33) or without (group N; n = 48) excessive joint laxity. The presence of excessive joint laxity was defined as a score of ≥ 4 using Beighton and Horan criteria preoperatively. Bipolar bone lesions were assessed using preoperative 3-dimensional computed tomography. Additional remplissage was performed for cases with off-track or positive engagement test in borderline on-track lesions. The functional outcomes at the 2-year follow-up were assessed using the recurrence rate, Subjective Shoulder Value, Rowe score, University of California, Los Angeles shoulder score, active range of motion, and the sports/recreation activity level.

- **Results**: No significant difference was found in the glenoid bone defect between groups (14.1%, group L; 14.4%, group N).

### Editorial commentary: Hip joint laxity, microinstability, or instability require precise definition: No matter what you call it, it is here to stay [^113NHVMA]. Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Hip instability has gained recognition as an important cause of hip pathology. Causes include incongruency of the articular surfaces due to dysplasia and/or impingement, joint capsule pathology, labral pathology, ligamentum teres tears, ligamentous laxity, muscular imbalance, and tendon tears. Lacking clearly defined symptoms and tests has hindered identification and treatment of this condition. Furthermore, the relevant literature uses different terms such as hyperlaxity and microinstability to describe this patient population, conveying different messages. However, the different terms convey different messages. Joint hyperlaxity or hypermobility has sometimes been used in reference to the hip; however, these usually refer to a genetic ligamentous and capsular condition affecting collagen structure, such as in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. More common, and often interchangeable, terms are instability and microinstability.

As the authors state in the present study, 'instability' has the advantage of conveying the significant impact the condition has on a patient's life. On the other hand, 'microinstability' may more accurately reflect the vague clinical presentation that we often encounter in the average hip patient with instability. Most patients do not complain of symptoms commonly seen in other joints with "instability", such as giving way, subluxation, and redislocations. In the hip, the symptoms are generally less tangible, and hence, the term "microinstability" may be more appropriate.

### High prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders in a large cohort of patients with joint hypermobility [^114RB5Y4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) are characterized by generalized joint hypermobility and musculoskeletal symptoms, as well as skin and soft tissue involvement. The diagnosis is largely based on clinical criteria, as there is no genetic test or biological marker to confirm it. Generalized joint hypermobility is screened using a 9-point Beighton score, which considers the flexibility of the spine/hips, paired knees, elbows, fifth metacarpophalangeal joint, thumb, and wrists. A score of 5 or greater for adults and 6 or greater for prepubertal children and adolescents is suggestive of hypermobility. Definitive diagnosis requires fulfilling criteria that include Beighton scores and other features such as joint pain, dislocations, and soft tissue lesions, as well as overlap features of connective tissue disorders (Supporting Information Digital Content 1).

The 2017 International Consensus Statement states that hEDS and JHS share similar features and are part of a continuum of hypermobility spectrum disorders. We have used the term hEDS/JHS to describe our cohort. The gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in hEDS/JHS patients can have functional and organic manifestations. Adult patients with JHS have significantly increased GI symptoms such as dyspepsia, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and conditions such as abdominal hernia, diaphragmatic hernia, and rectal prolapse.

We describe the GI symptoms and related evaluation in a large cohort of children and young adults with these syndromes.

Among other possible causes, joint hypermobility can result from various conditions and syndromes:

- **Genetic syndromes and disorders**: Down's syndrome, Marfan syndrome, xylosylprotein 4-beta-galactosyltransferase deficiency, Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, EFEMP2-related cutis laxa, osteogenesis imperfecta, cleidocranial dysplasia, achondroplasia, Melnick-Needles osteodysplasty, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
- **Musculoskeletal conditions**: Bethlem myopathy, ligament laxity
- **Other medical conditions**: Galactosamine-6-sulfatase deficiency, Caffey disease

Additionally, joint hypermobility can be induced by medications such as cysteamine bitartrate DR.

### Musculoskeletal ultrasound assessment in pediatric knee hypermobility: a case control study [^115pR4vb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The frequency of knee synovial effusion by musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) in healthy children has been reported to range from 60% to 80%, depending on the age group. In a German population of healthy children, the frequency of suprapatellar synovial effusions on MSUS in participants aged 13 to 18 years was between 60% and 70%. This percentage is slightly higher than the percentage of control participants with synovial effusion in any space (suprapatellar, medial, lateral) in our study. Our case group participants with synovial effusion exhibited a 64% frequency, similar to the frequency of asymptomatic effusions in the German cohort. This similarity highlights that positive findings on MSUS do not necessarily correlate with underlying pathology.

However, we investigated the medial and lateral parapatellar spaces in addition to the suprapatellar space, which enhances our study's sensitivity for detecting any effusion. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the number of knees with higher synovial effusion/hypertrophy quantitative scores between the groups. It is likely that many participants in the H + P case group have physiologic fluid on MSUS rather than abnormal or pathologic fluid correlating with their pain symptoms. Three knees in the NP group received the highest quantitative score for synovial effusion/hypertrophy, indicating that the degree of positive findings was not sufficient to differentiate the knees. The scoring tool, which was developed for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, may not be applicable for differentiating findings among this population.

### The differential diagnosis of children with joint hypermobility: a review of the literature [^115UnVpn]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

In this study, we aimed to identify and review publications relating to the diagnosis of joint hypermobility and instability and develop an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis of children presenting with joint hypermobility and related symptoms.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline for papers with an emphasis on the diagnosis of joint hypermobility, including Heritable Disorders of Connective Tissue (HDCT).

- **Results**: A total of 3330 papers were identified: 1534 pertained to instability of a particular joint; 1666 related to the diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, and 330 related to joint hypermobility. There are inconsistencies in the literature on joint hypermobility and how it relates to and overlaps with milder forms of HDCT. There is no reliable method of differentiating between Joint Hypermobility Syndrome, familial articular hypermobility, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hypermobile type), suggesting these three disorders may be different manifestations of the same spectrum of disorders. We describe our approach to children presenting with joint hypermobility and the published evidence and expert opinion on which this is based.

- **Conclusion**: There is value in identifying both the underlying genetic cause of joint hypermobility in an individual child and those hypermobile children who have symptoms such as pain and fatigue and might benefit from multidisciplinary rehabilitation management. Every effort should be made to diagnose the underlying disorder responsible for joint hypermobility, which may only become apparent over time.

### Generalised joint hypermobility leads to increased odds of sustaining a second ACL injury within 12 months of return to sport after ACL reconstruction [^117TDhTH]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

It is hypothesized that generalised joint hypermobility (GJH), caused by alterations in collagen fibers important to the structure of connective tissue, may exacerbate the forces exerted on intra-articular knee ligaments during the tibiofemoral rotatory and valgus moments typically associated with ACL injury. Image-based analysis demonstrates a weak association between quantitative pivot shift and increased rotatory knee laxity in patients with GJH. As demonstrated in the study and previous literature, GJH magnifies the risk of a second ACL injury and should be factored into the aggregated risk assessment of patients who aim to return to high-intensity sports following primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). In contrast, previous studies did not report statistically significant differences in the incidence of contralateral ACL injury after primary ACL-R in patients with GJH. In the present study, GJH magnified the odds of contralateral second ACL injury, which may indicate the need for further studies with larger patient populations to clarify contralateral ACL injury incidence after ACL-R in relation to GJH.

Patients with GJH may consequently benefit from individualized ACL-R, involving careful consideration of multiple factors to combat the incidence of graft failure and reinjury. The majority of ACL-Rs in patients with and without GJH were performed with hamstring tendon autograft (68.0% and 79.4%, respectively). While the study does not demonstrate differences in graft choice and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) between the two patient groups, a higher ACL reinjury rate in patients with GJH suggests that more robust graft options may be advantageous.

### The differential diagnosis of children with joint hypermobility: a review of the literature [^115swbLE]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

There is a spectrum of generalised joint hypermobility in children, and the phenomenon is almost certainly polygenic in origin with environmental influences, especially participation in sports and flexibility training. Younger children are more flexible, but this resolves with increasing age in normal children. It is a clinical challenge to distinguish young children with significant hypermobility who are unlikely to improve from those who are in the normal spectrum of hypermobility and will improve with time. Clinical follow-up over several years is currently the only way of answering this question for an individual child.

The criteria for a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hypermobile type) are illustrated in Table 2 but are non-specific. For a diagnosis to be made, an individual needs to have one of the major criteria of a Beighton score of ≥ 4/9 or "skin involvement (hyperextensibility and/or smooth, velvety skin)". Beighton et al. describe testing of skin hyperextensibility at a neutral site, such as the volar aspect of the forearm, where "the skin is pulled up until resistance is felt". However, they do not describe a reproducible measurement that can be taken during this test, nor what might be considered normal or abnormal. Minor criteria, which are "of lesser diagnostic specificity", include joint dislocation, chronic joint/limb pain, and a positive family history. The presence of one or more minor criteria is "suggestive" of the diagnosis.

### Modest association of joint hypermobility with disabling and limiting musculoskeletal pain: results from a large-scale general population-based survey [^1138usCi]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

To determine the population prevalence of joint hypermobility (JH) and to test the hypothesis that JH would be associated with reporting musculoskeletal pain, a cross-sectional population survey was conducted in Aberdeen and Cheshire. A total of 45,949 questionnaires assessing JH and the presence, distribution, duration, and severity of musculoskeletal pain were mailed. Based on their pain reports, participants were classified as having chronic widespread pain (CWP), some pain, or no pain. Multinomial logistic regression tested the relationship between JH and pain status, with associations adjusted for age, sex, and other putative confounders. Participants with no pain served as the referent category.

A total of 12,853 participants (28.0%) returned a questionnaire with complete data. Of these, 2,354 participants (18.3%) were classified as hypermobile. Among the participants, 2,094 (16.3%) had CWP, 5,801 (45.1%) had some pain, and 4,958 (38.6%) reported no pain. JH participants were significantly more likely to report CWP than non-JH participants (18.5% versus 15.8%; P < 0.001). After adjusting for age and sex, hypermobile participants were 40% more likely to report the most severe CWP (relative risk ratio [RRR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.1–1.7; P < 0.001). Further adjustments for employment status, smoking, alcohol, and physical activity showed that JH remained significantly associated with the most severe CWP (RRR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3–2.1; P < 0.001) and some pain (RRR 1.3, 95% CI 1.02–1.6; P = 0.03).

### Viscoelastic properties and flexibility of the human muscle-tendon unit in benign joint hypermobility syndrome [^113oUgNZ]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the passive energy absorption of the hamstring muscle-tendon unit in nine women with benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) and nine age and sex-matched controls.

- **Methods**: Resistance to stretch was measured as knee flexion moment (N·m) with an isokinetic dynamometer during passive knee extension. The angle that induced a stretch sensation without pain was defined as the maximal stretch angle. Force, angle, angular velocity (0.09 rad/s), and electromyographic activity were simultaneously and continuously recorded during the stretch. The hamstring cross-sectional area was obtained with magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Results**: Forearm skin extensibility was greater for individuals with BJHS (3.6 ± 0.5 cm) compared to controls (1.3 ± 0.2 cm) (p < 0.01). The Beighton score was also higher for BJHS participants (6.6 ± 0.8) versus controls (0.4 ± 0.2) (p < 0.001). Maximal stretch angle was significantly greater in the BJHS group (1.35 ± 0.07 rad) compared to controls (0.98 ± 0.05 rad) (p < 0.001), with a corresponding peak moment that was higher for BJHS (1.3 ± 0.4 Nm/cm²) against controls (0.6 ± 0.1 Nm/cm²) (p < 0.01). While passive energy absorption for a given mutual angle was similar between both groups, at maximal stretch angle, the total area-normalized energy was higher for BJHS (0.36 ± 0.04 J/cm²) compared to controls (0.18 ± 0.28 J/cm²) (p < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: The lack of difference in passive energy absorption for a specific mutual stretch angle suggests that passive properties of the muscle-tendon unit in BJHS are similar to those of controls. However, the greater maximal stretch angle and corresponding peak moment indicate notable differences.

### High prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders in a large cohort of patients with joint hypermobility [^116S9H7i]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

The presence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in hEDS/JHS patients is being increasingly recognized, and a number of disorders of the GI tract, including but not limited to inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, eosinophilic GI disease, complex abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and constipation, have been reported in children and adults with joint hypermobility.

Our study demonstrated an increased prevalence of eosinophilic disorders and celiac disease in our cohort of pediatric hEDS/JHS patients. The overall prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is currently estimated at 1 in 1000; however, in our cohort (differing from the general population as they had symptoms prompting referral to GI), 21% of patients had EoE, and 4% had eosinophilic colitis. This higher prevalence of EoE in our hEDS/JHS cohort is similar to previous work by Abonia et al, which demonstrated that patients with connective tissue disorders resembling Marfan syndrome, hypermobile EDS, or JHS with other atopic diseases had a higher prevalence of EoE (RR: 8.1; CI: 5.1–12.9) compared to the general population.

### Generalized joint hypermobility in childhood is a possible risk for the development of joint pain in adolescence: a cohort study [^116dUCEt]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Selection of a limited number of control subjects was based on a desire to achieve an equal number of exposure contrasts, knowing that it could have caused systematic selection bias. However, since selection criteria were based on exposure (GJH) and not outcome status (joint pain), this is unlikely to have biased this association.

Measurement of outcome status conducted by medical history from the clinical examination was more likely to be confounded by recall bias than the exposure status. But since the outcome (pain in more than 4 joints for more than 3 months) is a relatively "hard" outcome, it is not likely to have biased this association.

Another weakness of this study was the lack of a full baseline dataset on potential confounders. Although we did investigate and adjust for potential confounders, there may have been residual confounding not accounted for because we had no information about the following factors: injuries at baseline, family history of rheumatic diseases, or socioeconomic status.

- **Strengths of this study**: Having clinical examinations performed at both baseline and follow-up strengthens the validity of the exposure and outcome since the exposure is measured objectively and is therefore free of recall bias, and the outcome is a relatively hard endpoint. The examiners performing the clinical tests were the same as in the baseline studies. Each examiner tested a random number of children at baseline and at follow-up, meaning that they did not test the same child at both test rounds. It is therefore assumed that the examiners were blinded.

### Hypermobility among adolescents and the association with spinal deformities: A large cross-sectional study [^1144Z2f1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

This investigation delved deep into the intricate relationship between hypermobility and spinal deformities (SD). While SD, including adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and Scheuermann's kyphosis (SK), are among the most common spinal abnormalities observed in adolescents, our study's foundational question revolved around the possible linkage of hypermobility to these deformities.

Our data showcased a marked association between hypermobility and SD. The odds ratios indicated a progressive association that peaked at moderate deformities, suggesting that hypermobility, more than merely an interesting clinical observation, might play a crucial role in developing or exacerbating SD.

The pathogenesis of SD remains contentious, and our findings add another layer of complexity. The robust association between hypermobility and SD, especially the pronounced association with moderate and severe deformities, aligns with the potential biomechanical implications hypermobility may have. As the introduction hinted, hypermobility might increase mechanical loads on the spine, potentially leading to earlier degenerative changes through excessive load-bearing. The markedly higher risk of moderate and severe deformities among patients with hypermobility underscores this hypothesis.

The vast difference in prevalence between hypermobility (0.01%) and SD (10.5%) is noteworthy. Although only a fraction of the study population exhibited hypermobility, their increased risk of developing SD, especially of moderate and severe grades, is crucial for clinical considerations.

### Effectiveness of a prenatal pilates program on ligamentous laxity and joint hypermobility in pregnant women: a dual-center randomized controlled trial [^116vW5mU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

Pilates exercises may serve as a safe and effective intervention for maintaining ligament flexibility and regulating joint hypermobility during pregnancy, potentially reducing activity limitations related to pelvic girdle pain. Rather than directly altering ligament collagen structure, Pilates may help preserve joint stability by strengthening periarticular muscles, enhancing proprioception, and optimizing neuromuscular control, thereby offsetting the laxity-inducing effects of pregnancy-related hormonal changes such as elevated relaxin. This randomized controlled study's findings suggest that Pilates can moderate pregnancy-induced increases in ligamentous laxity and joint hypermobility while mitigating associated risks of pain and injury through improved biomechanical stabilization and neuromuscular control.

Integrating structured prenatal Pilates programs into routine antenatal care may enhance maternal musculoskeletal health and quality of life, ultimately contributing to safer and more comfortable pregnancies. Future research should explore the effects of Pilates on postpartum recovery and compare it with other exercise modalities to optimize maternal musculoskeletal outcomes. These findings could encourage healthcare providers to integrate Pilates into antenatal care to support maternal physical and psychological well-being. Large-scale, multicenter trials across diverse populations are essential to strengthen the evidence base for integrating Pilates into routine antenatal care.

### Musculoskeletal ultrasound assessment in pediatric knee hypermobility: A case control study [^114v3s4R]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal pain is a common symptom in children and adolescents, becoming more prevalent as age increases. It is a frequent reason for evaluation both in primary and specialty care. Joint hypermobility is a risk factor for musculoskeletal pain in adolescents, particularly in certain joints such as the knee. The prevalence of joint hypermobility varies in different populations but can affect over 30% of children and adolescents. The pathophysiology of joint hypermobility contributing to joint pain is unclear but may be related to excess movement leading to stress and micro-trauma. Given the chronicity of the pain and the common delay in diagnosis of joint hypermobility, children are often referred to pediatric rheumatology and other subspecialists for evaluation of joint pain.

Musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) use is increasing within pediatric medicine, particularly within pediatric rheumatology. MSUS is shown to be more sensitive than physical examination in detecting active synovitis and subclinical arthritis. Additionally, MSUS can reveal findings of tendon abnormalities and enthesitis. At the time of writing, the majority of MSUS literature focuses on findings in healthy children and those with inflammatory arthritis, particularly juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Few studies exist regarding tendon measurements or elastography on ultrasound imaging in populations with joint hypermobility. However, these studies include mostly adult participants and report minimal MSUS views of the joints.

It is important to describe the MSUS findings in joint hypermobility.

### Hypermobility among adolescents and the association with spinal deformities: A large cross-sectional study [^112HtVzm]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Our findings forge a bridge connecting hypermobility to spinal deformities, emphasizing the need to consider hypermobility as a potential risk factor. However, the pathophysiological basis requires elucidation. Considering our findings and limitations, we advocate for prospective studies to delve deeper into this connection and possibly guide targeted interventions in the future.

### The effects of joint hypermobility on pain and functional biomechanics in adolescents with juvenile fibromyalgia: Secondary baseline analysis from a pilot randomized controlled trial [^117VQd96]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to better understand how joint hypermobility may affect functioning in a sample of adolescents with JFM, given the high degree of clinical overlap. We performed a secondary analysis of data collected as part of a pilot randomized clinical trial to explore whether adolescents with JFM and joint hypermobility differed from non-joint hypermobility peers in terms of pain, daily functioning, and biomechanics. Given the added mechanical stress of joint laxity, it was hypothesized that youth with chronic pain and joint hypermobility would demonstrate higher levels of pain intensity and greater functional deficits across landing biomechanics compared to those with chronic pain but without joint hypermobility. This study has the potential to advance our understanding of potential sub-groups of patients with widespread musculoskeletal pain, such as those with joint hypermobility, and the potential clinical implications of this co-occurring condition.

### The differential diagnosis of children with joint hypermobility: A review of the literature [^115587bS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Medline was searched using a strategy designed by a medical librarian to identify papers on the diagnosis of ligamentous laxity, hypermobility, hypermobility syndromes, and related HDCTs. Duplicates were excluded, and titles were hand-searched. Papers that focused on joint stability following joint replacement surgery were excluded, leaving a total of 3,330 papers. The titles of papers that focused on a single joint were checked to determine which joints were most frequently the focus of published works but were not further analyzed.

The conclusions of this literature analysis were compared with the experience of the Connective Tissue Dysplasia (CTD) Clinic, a multidisciplinary clinic established in 1987 at the Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia, to coordinate the care of patient groups with HDCT.

### Loeys-Dietz syndrome [^115w9qN4]. Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology (2021). High credibility.

The disease Loeys-Dietz syndrome is associated with a variety of clinical features, including joint hypermobility and a skin that is translucent with a velvety texture. Patients often present with long fingers and lax joints. Aortic aneurysm, camptodactyly, and Chiari malformation are also noted.

Additional features include pectus carinatum, criss-cross pulmonary arteries, and strabismus. There are clinical findings such as aortic dissection and club foot. The syndrome may accompany congenital heart disease, patent ductus arteriosus, and genetic abnormalities like kyphosis, bicuspid aortic valve, and atrial septal defect.

Skeletal deformities such as scoliosis and pectus excavatum are common, and the condition follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

### Are diagnostic criteria for general joint hypermobility and benign joint hypermobility syndrome based on reproducible and valid tests? A review of the literature [^114WLgT4]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

In this review, we focus on knowledge of the reliability of tests and diagnostic criteria for generalized joint hypermobility (GJH) and benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS).

- **Methods**: Currently, the British Society of Rheumatology recommends the Beighton scoring system. With this approach, GJH is judged present when 4 or more of 9 tests are positive. Curiously, only one inter/intrarater reproducibility study is available and it uses a cutoff level of 6, rather than the Beighton-recommended 4 positive tests.

- **Results**: Using a 6 cut level, intra- and interobserver kappa scores were 0.75 and 0.78, respectively. Beighton scoring recommendations have been correlated with a global joint mobility index as well as with 2 other scoring systems, the Carter and Wilkinson, and the Rotès-Quérol. All illustrate high conValidity with one another. For the recently proposed Brighton criteria diagnosing BJHS, no reproducibility studies exist. In the latter, the recommendations reflect high nosographic sensitivity and specificity while predictive values for positive test scores are poor.

- **Conclusion**: In general, the reproducibility of the various tests seems to be good, especially when performed by experienced rheumatologists.

### Deconstructing and reconstructing joint hypermobility on an evo-devo perspective [^1177bTig]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Joint hypermobility is a common characteristic in humans. Its non-casual association with various musculoskeletal complaints is known and currently defined as "the spectrum", which includes hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD). hEDS is recognized by a set of descriptive criteria, while HSD serves as the background diagnosis for individuals not fulfilling these criteria. Little is known about the aetiopathogenesis of the spectrum. It may be interpreted as a complex trait according to the integration model. The spectrum is common in the general population, affects morphology, presents extreme clinical variability, and is characterized by a marked sex bias without a clear Mendelian or hormonal explanation.

Joint hypermobility and the other hEDS systemic criteria are intended as qualitative derivatives of continuous traits of normal morphological variability. The need for a minimum set of criteria for hEDS diagnosis implies a tendency for these underlying continuous traits to co-vary. In evolutionary biology, such co-variation (i.e. integration) is driven by multiple forces, including genetic, developmental, functional, and environmental/acquired interactors. Understanding the aetiopathogenesis of the spectrum may be resolved by a deeper understanding of phenotypic variability, which overlays normal morphological variability.

### Hypermobility among adolescents and the association with spinal deformities: A large cross-sectional study [^113fXiNY]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Both spinal deformity and musculoskeletal hypermobility are characteristics found in inherited conditions like Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and specific variants of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, all of which have notable mutations in connective tissue genes. This coexistence hints at a potential shared causal mechanism between hypermobility and idiopathic scoliosis, where excessive flexibility and rotation of an evolving spine might play a role in the emergence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, the debate surrounding the association between hypermobility and spinal deformity (SD) in adolescents remains inconclusive. There exists a paucity of literature that delves deep into this possible connection. Some argue that hypermobility's excessive range of motion might predispose individuals to abnormal spinal movements, potentially leading to deformities. Meanwhile, others posit that the biological mechanisms linked with hypermobility might be a driving factor in the onset or exacerbation of SD, such as in Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan syndromes.

Given the gaps in the literature and the potential implications of establishing a link between SD and hypermobility, our study aims to shed light on this issue. We aimed to quantify the prevalence of hypermobility in adolescents and assess its potential association with adolescent SD, including mainly idiopathic scoliosis and Scheuermann's kyphosis (SK). Such insights will contribute to the broader understanding of these conditions and may guide future preventive and therapeutic strategies.

### Peripheral nerve blocks in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type: a report of 2 cases [^111ZYnZx]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is an inherited disorder of collagen production that results in multiorgan dysfunction. Patients with hypermobility type display skin hyperextensibility and joint laxity, which can result in chronic joint instability, dislocation, peripheral neuropathy, and severe musculoskeletal pain. A bleeding diathesis can be found in all subtypes of varying severity despite a normal coagulation profile. There have also been reports of resistance to local anesthetics in these patients.

Several sources advise against the use of regional anesthesia in these patients citing the two previous features. There have been reports of successful neuraxial anesthesia, but few concerning peripheral nerve blocks, none of which describe nerves of the lower extremity. This report describes two cases of successful peripheral regional anesthesia in the lower extremity.

- **Case 1**: A 16-year-old adolescent girl with hypermobility type presented for osteochondral grafting of tibiotalar joint lesions. She underwent a popliteal sciatic (with continuous catheter) and femoral nerve block under ultrasound guidance. She proceeded to surgery and tolerated the procedure under regional block and intravenous sedation. She did not require any analgesics for the following 15 hours.

- **Case 2**: An 18-year-old woman with hypermobility type presented for medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction for chronic patella instability. She underwent a saphenous nerve block above the knee with analgesia in the distribution of the saphenous nerve lasting for approximately 18 hours. There were no complications.

### Detecting genetic modifiers of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity in the Caucasian Afrikaner community [^1112LSDk]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity (SEMDJL) is an autosomal-recessive skeletal dysplasia. A relatively large number of patients with SEMDJL have been identified in the Caucasian Afrikaans-speaking community in South Africa. We used a combination of Genome-Wide Human Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Array 6.0 data and whole exomic data to potentially dissect genetic modifiers associated with SEMDJL in Caucasian Afrikaans-speaking patients. Leveraging the family-based association signal in prioritizing candidate mutations, we identified two potential modifier genes, COL1A2 and MATN1, and replicated a previously identified mutation in KIF22. Importantly, our findings of genetic modifier genes and previously identified mutations are layered on the same sub-network implicated in syndromes characterized by skeletal abnormalities and intellectual disability, bone, and connective tissue fragility. This study has potentially provided crucial insights in identifying the indirect modifying mutation(s) linked to the true causal mutation associated with SEMDJL. It is a critical lesson that one may use constructively, especially as the pace of exomic sequencing of rare disorders continues apace.

### Diagnosis and management of hypermobility spectrum disorders in primary care [^116R6Xy1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSDs) encompass an array of connective tissue disorders characterized by joint instability and chronic pain. Fatigue and other systemic symptoms that affect daily functioning may occur as well. Accurate data on the incidence and prevalence of HSDs is hampered by the lack of awareness of these conditions and the wide heterogeneity of their clinical presentation. Identifying which type of HSD is present is important in guiding appropriate care.

In particular, making the diagnosis of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is important, as individuals with hEDS may be at risk for more significant multisystem involvement. Diagnostic criteria for hEDS include measures of joint hypermobility, skin and other connective tissue findings, and lack of evidence of a different type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Beyond accurate diagnosis, HSDs pose many challenges for primary care providers, as ongoing patient education, patient empowerment, and coordination of a multidisciplinary treatment team are integral to proper care.

This article describes the incidence and prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of HSDs, including clinical cases exemplifying how joint hypermobility might present within a primary care setting.

### Generalised joint hypermobility leads to increased odds of sustaining a second ACL injury within 12 months of return to sport after ACL reconstruction [^114mGryt]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The key strength of the study design is the prospective assessment of second ACL injury risk in patients with generalised joint hypermobility (GJH) and without GJH within a 12-month time period of return to sport (RTS) after ACL reconstruction (ACL-R). The assessment of 12-month ACL reinjury risk is further complemented by the evaluation of survival without reinjury, allowing for long-term assessment of the effect of GJH on second ACL injury risk. While injury-free survival should be interpreted with caution due to limited data availability since the nascence of the registry, the data presented herein strongly suggest that patients with GJH are more susceptible to a second ipsilateral and contralateral ACL injury after primary ACL-R compared with patients without GJH.

The most important limitations of the study are the size of the GJH population, the scarcity of information with regards to surgical variables and concomitant intra-articular injuries, and incomplete patient-reported outcome (PRO) data. The limited size of the study cohort is a consequence of the application of strict inclusion criteria and the relatively short lifetime of Project ACL. It is important to acknowledge that a large number of otherwise eligible patients (n = 1307) were excluded due to missing Beighton scores, as the variable was introduced only recently. The Beighton score is recorded by a single investigator, and incorrect measurements cannot, therefore, be ruled out, despite substantial to near-perfect inter-rater and intra-rater reliability reported in the literature. Additionally, measurement of GJH with the Beighton score may be affected by limited joint motion due to…

### Practical management strategies for benign hypermobility syndromes [^112iRnvV]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with symptomatic hypermobility syndrome, such as hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (hEDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD), commonly present to rheumatologists with joint pain and functional disability. Providers often face challenges with diagnosis due to a lack of knowledge regarding the range of associated manifestations and the available therapeutic modalities. This review discusses recent updates on diagnostic measures and treatment options for rheumatologists to better assist patients dealing with hEDS/HSD.

- **Recent findings**: This article describes newer diagnostic measures and the assessment of hEDS/HSD manifestations. It provides evidence supporting physical therapy and occupational therapy, as well as recent updates on assistive devices, compressive garments, orthoses, and surgical interventions. Due to patient heterogeneity, specific guidance about the amount and type of therapies required to produce a beneficial effect is lacking. Treatment should be individualized, with many studies focusing on regional joint complaints rather than a whole-body approach.

- **Summary**: Physical therapy and occupational therapy remain the cornerstone of treatment.

### Molecular genetic and clinical review of Ehlers-Danlos type VIIA: Implications for management by the plastic surgeon in a multidisciplinary setting [^1123NYJP]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

A syndrome now known as Ehlers-Danlos, comprising laxity and fragility of the skin associated with hypermobility of the large joints, was published in 1892 by Tschernogobow. Ehlers-Danlos type VIIA is an extremely rare form of the syndrome. While the UK-based Ehlers-Danlos Support Group recommends that the surgical management of patients with Ehlers-Danlos VIIA should be carried out in conjunction with a plastic surgeon, there is nothing in the plastic surgery literature regarding this syndrome. The management of patients suffering from Ehlers-Danlos VIIA is highly complex, as a result of the breadth of genetic and phenotypic presentations, and resulting complications. We present a review of the literature regarding this syndrome and, in particular, the surgical problems that may be encountered. A case report outlining our experience of successfully managing this condition is also presented.

### Priority musculoskeletal health research questions for people with generalized joint hypermobility: An international delphi study [^112REzZQ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore and prioritize research questions regarding musculoskeletal health concerns in people with generalized joint hypermobility. Participants prioritized a broad range of questions across seven categories adapted from PICO. These findings provide an important foundation for funders and research groups to drive research agendas that consider different stakeholder perspectives. The number of priority questions and their breadth across the categories also allow for a strong staged research program to be adopted, with many of the questions interlinked across the translational medicine and implementation science landscape from etiology to service delivery.

The highest overall ranked question was, "How can we prevent disability, pain, and poor quality of life associated with the musculoskeletal comorbidities of symptomatic generalized joint hypermobility?" The question was in the prevention category. There is currently insufficient evidence regarding preventive measures for people with generalized joint hypermobility. Although there is some evidence to support a wide range of treatment options for musculoskeletal symptoms including pain, feelings of instability, and joint injuries in adults and children, there remains a lack of high-quality evidence that supports high-value and sustainable management and prevention of symptomatic generalized joint hypermobility. This view is supported by a qualitative study reporting parents feeling conflicted about whether physical activity should be promoted or avoided for the musculoskeletal health of their children.

### Understanding the psychosocial impact of joint hypermobility syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type: A qualitative interview study [^114B8hJc]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

Little attention has been paid to psychosocial factors in Joint Hypermobility Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hypermobility type). This study sought to identify the psychosocial impact by examining participants' lived experiences and identifying characteristics of effective coping.

Adults with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (Hypermobility Type) were invited to discuss their own lived experiences and the impact of the condition. All participants met recognized criteria for clinically significant joint hypermobility and had a self-confirmed diagnosis. The transcripts were coded and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.

Seventeen participants (14 women, 3 men) were purposively selected to broadly represent different genders, ages, and ethnicities. Analysis identified five key themes: healthcare limitations, a lack of awareness of Joint Hypermobility and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (Hypermobility Type) among healthcare professionals, a restricted life, social stigma, fear of the unknown, and ways of coping.

The results highlight the significant psychosocial impact on participants' lives. Coping approaches identified included acceptance, building social networks, learning about joint hypermobility, and adapting activities. Physiotherapists supported regular exercise. Further research should consider potential interventions to improve information provision, address psychological support, and increase awareness of hypermobility among healthcare professionals.

### The differential diagnosis of children with joint hypermobility: a review of the literature [^112Ukga5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Distinguishing between Ehlers-Danlos (hypermobile type) and Marfan syndrome and related disorders: Marfan syndrome is well described, and the available algorithm for diagnosis is based on clinical features. The reliability and validity of the Ghent criteria have not been established. Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which codes fibrillin — a structural protein present in microfibrils and a key component of connective tissue.

In a recent cohort study of patients with a laboratory-confirmed FBN1 mutation, 600 out of 956 (63%) had "ligamentous laxity", which was the third most common major skeletal feature after arachnodactyly and high-arched palate. Clinically, it has been observed that some hypermobile patients with a "Marfan-like" habitus do not meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. It is wise to be cognizant of the fact that the phenotype will evolve with time and that finding an FBN1 mutation in a child with major skeletal features would support a diagnosis.

For example, a child with pes planus and mitral valve prolapse would meet the criteria for a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome if an FBN1 mutation was found on testing. Children who have the mutation but do not meet the Ghent criteria are described as having a type 1 fibrillinopathy. There is an increased incidence of Marfan-like habitus in some hypermobile populations, but the influence of this feature on the risk of complications of hypermobility is unclear.

Marfan syndrome can be complicated by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue, and patients with Marfan syndrome may…

### Joint hypermobility and skin elasticity: The hereditary disorders of connective tissue [^114XwgHn]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

The hereditary disorders of connective tissues (HDCTs) encompass a spectrum of conditions linked pathophysiologically by abnormalities of collagen, fibrillin, and matrix proteins. The clinical picture ranges from morbidity due to musculoskeletal, skin, ocular, and visceral pathologies to mortality from acute vascular collapse. Many of these conditions have considerable overlap in clinical features, although severity varies. Appreciating the subtle differences in presentation is vital for clinicians in determining the diagnosis. Conditions associated with severe vascular pathology are rare, although other hereditary disorders of connective tissues, such as joint hypermobility syndrome and Stickler's disease, are common and probably underrecognized. Abnormal skin elasticity, scarring, joint hypermobility, and chronic arthralgia are important clues that should prompt clinicians to search for underlying hereditary disorders of connective tissues. This article discusses the spectrum of clinical findings, management, and genetic screening of the more common hereditary disorders of connective tissues, highlighting their diagnostic criteria and differences.
