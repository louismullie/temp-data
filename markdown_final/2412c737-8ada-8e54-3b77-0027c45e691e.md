## Question

Signs of abdominal aortic rupture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the signs of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture, including how to distinguish impending from complete rupture, what imaging shows, and how to act clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why this is an emergency. Then, I should verify the classic bedside signs and their sensitivity. Next, I will examine imaging features that indicate impending versus complete rupture, especially on CT. After that, I need to check the role and limitations of ultrasound. Finally, I will integrate management implications, including permissive hypotension, transfer protocols, and thresholds for intervention, and I will double-check where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. AAA rupture carries extremely high mortality, often cited around 85–90% overall, with about half of patients dying before reaching the hospital, so recognizing signs early and acting decisively is critical to survival [^e15187a0] [^b99927ef]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify that these figures are consistent across contemporary sources, and yes, multiple high-quality reviews and guidelines align with this range, reinforcing the urgency of diagnosis and intervention [^e15187a0] [^b99927ef].

> Next, I should review the classic bedside signs and their diagnostic performance. The triad of sudden severe abdominal or back pain, hypotension or shock, and a pulsatile abdominal mass is classically taught, but I need to check how sensitive these are. A systematic review and meta-analysis found pooled sensitivities of 61.7% for abdominal pain, 53.6% for back pain, 30.9% for hypotension, and 47.1% for a pulsatile mass, indicating that no single sign is sufficiently sensitive to exclude rupture and that the absence of these findings cannot safely rule out the diagnosis [^6fcf8088]. Wait, let me verify the implication: this means diagnosis must remain high when the pretest probability is high, even if the triad is incomplete, and imaging becomes essential when the patient is stable enough to obtain it [^6fcf8088].

> I will now examine imaging features that indicate impending rupture, because catching this stage can change outcomes. On CT, intramural signs such as the hyperattenuating crescent sign (acute intramural hemorrhage), focal wall discontinuity or calcification break, rapid enlargement, and periaortic fat stranding suggest instability and impending rupture; these findings warrant urgent repair even if the patient is hemodynamically stable, as progression to free rupture can be imminent [^0dd14b26] [^9ca7686e] [^a328446d]. Hold on, I should verify whether the crescent sign alone mandates emergent surgery; a recent study suggests that an isolated crescent sign without other rupture features may correlate with rapid growth rather than imminent rupture, so I need to integrate size, growth, symptoms, and additional CT signs before deciding on timing of repair [^6d0a791d].

> Now, I should review signs of complete rupture on CT. Extraluminal contrast extravasation, large retroperitoneal hematoma, and intraperitoneal extension are definitive for rupture; contained rupture may show a draped aorta sign with the posterior wall abutting the vertebrae and a retroperitoneal hematoma confined by fascial planes, which still mandates emergent intervention but may allow brief stabilization and imaging for EVAR planning if the patient is stable [^9ca7686e] [^0dd14b26] [^1c57db5d]. Let me double-check that these CT patterns are consistently described across sources, and yes, multiple radiology reviews and case series corroborate these findings, supporting their use for triage and operative planning [^9ca7686e] [^0dd14b26].

> But wait, what if CT is not immediately available or the patient is unstable. Ultrasound can rapidly detect AAA and certain indirect signs of rupture, but I need to be clear that it cannot reliably diagnose rupture itself. Sonographic features such as AAA deformation, heterogeneous or interrupted luminal thrombus, retroperitoneal hematoma, and hemoperitoneum have been described, yet ultrasound lacks the sensitivity and specificity of CT for rupture and should not delay transfer or operative care when rupture is suspected [^e4c6f3a7] [^6fcf8088]. Hold on, I should verify the role of PoCUS in the ED; it is excellent for confirming AAA presence and guiding urgency, but negative ultrasound does not exclude rupture, so clinical suspicion should still drive emergent management [^6fcf8088].

> Next, I should review management implications tied to these signs. For unstable patients with suspected rupture, immediate operative or endovascular intervention is indicated without delay for imaging; permissive hypotension with systolic blood pressure 70–90 mmHg in conscious patients limits bleeding and improves outcomes, and protocols targeting door-to-intervention under 90 minutes improve survival [^0e100edd] [^d498f6c4] [^8056f619]. I need to ensure I include transfer considerations: direct physician-to-physician communication, image transmission, and continued permissive hypotension during transport are recommended when transferring to a center with endovascular capability [^b615e134] [^3af10b56].

> For stable patients with suspected rupture or high-risk symptoms, I should confirm that CT angiography is the appropriate test. Guidelines recommend CTA to confirm rupture and assess anatomy for EVAR candidacy, and this should proceed without delay while initiating resuscitation and blood product availability; if the patient becomes unstable, imaging must be aborted and surgery pursued emergently [^56b36411] [^7944a0af] [^d498f6c4]. Let me reconsider whether MRI has a role; MRI is generally too slow for acute rupture but may be considered in select stable scenarios or when radiation avoidance is paramount, though this is not standard for acute presentations [^notfound].

> I should also distinguish symptomatic but unruptured AAA, because this is a different risk category. Patients with new abdominal or back pain and a known or suspected AAA, without hemodynamic instability, should undergo urgent CT to exclude rupture; if rupture is excluded but symptoms persist, urgent repair within 24–48 hours is recommended due to high risk of progression, ideally with ICU monitoring and blood pressure control while optimizing comorbidities [^c24412e9] [^17c2ba31] [^7bcf40be]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even when the aneurysm is below traditional size thresholds; yes, symptomatic AAAs carry elevated rupture risk irrespective of size, justifying expedited repair [^c24412e9] [^17c2ba31].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address size thresholds and sex-specific considerations, because these influence pretest probability and thresholds for intervention. Larger aneurysm diameter correlates with higher rupture risk, and women tend to rupture at smaller diameters, so repair thresholds are lower in women; contemporary guidance supports repair at ≥ 5.5 cm in men and ≥ 5.0 cm in women, with surveillance intensified as size approaches these thresholds [^d3853b9f] [^fa1a4898] [^ced71e1d]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the female threshold was uniformly 4.5 cm; I should correct that — while some studies and reviews discuss lower thresholds in women, current ACC/AHA guidance uses 5.0 cm as the intervention threshold in women, acknowledging higher rupture risk at smaller sizes, so I should align with that standard while still individualizing based on growth, symptoms, and morphology [^d3853b9f] [^fa1a4898].

> In summary, I need to emphasize that the clinical signs of AAA rupture are variable and insensitive, so diagnosis relies on a high index of suspicion plus targeted imaging. Impending rupture may show intramural hemorrhage, focal wall discontinuity, rapid growth, or periaortic stranding on CT, whereas complete rupture shows contrast extravasation and retroperitoneal hematoma; ultrasound can confirm AAA but not rupture, and unstable patients require immediate intervention with permissive hypotension and rapid transfer when needed, while stable patients should undergo prompt CTA to guide repair strategy [^6fcf8088] [^0dd14b26] [^9ca7686e] [^d498f6c4] [^56b36411].

Abdominal aortic rupture presents with the **classic triad** of sudden severe abdominal or back pain, hypotension or shock, and a pulsatile abdominal mass [^944fa37d] [^6fcf8088]. However, this triad is present in only about half of cases, so clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion in at-risk patients [^6fcf8088]. Early recognition and **immediate imaging** (CT angiography) are critical to confirm the diagnosis and guide urgent intervention, as mortality exceeds 80% if untreated [^e15187a0] [^d23aad0e].

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms

### Classic triad

- **Severe abdominal or back pain**: Sudden, severe, tearing or ripping pain radiating to the back, flank, or groin is the most consistent symptom [^6fcf8088].
- **Hypotension or shock**: Rapid hemodynamic collapse from massive hemorrhage is common, though early or contained ruptures may be normotensive [^d498f6c4].
- **Pulsatile abdominal mass**: A palpable, expansile mass in the midline above the umbilicus may be felt, but sensitivity is limited by obesity or hypotension [^6fcf8088].

---

### Additional clinical features

- **Syncope or altered mental status**: Due to acute blood loss and hypoperfusion [^6fcf8088].
- **Nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding**: From retroperitoneal irritation or aortoenteric fistula [^1c57db5d].
- **Lower extremity ischemia**: From embolic or compressive effects on iliac arteries [^e15187a0].
- **Flank or periumbilical ecchymosis (Grey Turner's or Cullen's sign)**: Late findings from retroperitoneal hemorrhage [^notfound].

---

## Imaging signs

### Computed tomography (CT)

CT angiography is the **gold standard** for diagnosis and delineates rupture anatomy for operative planning [^d23aad0e] [^56b36411].

| **Imaging sign** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Retroperitoneal hematoma | Crescentic high-attenuation collection adjacent to the aorta [^9ca7686e] |
| Contrast extravasation | Active leakage of contrast into the retroperitoneum or peritoneum [^1c57db5d] |
| Aortic wall discontinuity | Focal gap in the calcified wall or mural thrombus [^9ca7686e] |
| Draped aorta sign | Posterior aortic wall abuts vertebrae, indicating contained rupture [^9ca7686e] |
| Hyperattenuating crescent sign | Intramural hemorrhage within the thrombus, suggesting impending rupture [^9ca7686e] |

---

### Ultrasound

Ultrasound is **rapid and noninvasive** at the bedside but cannot reliably detect rupture; it can identify the aneurysm and retroperitoneal hematoma, supporting the diagnosis when CT is unavailable [^6fcf8088] [^e4c6f3a7].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential includes other causes of acute abdominal pain and shock, such as:

- **Myocardial infarction**: Similar pain, but no pulsatile mass or retroperitoneal hematoma [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary embolism**: Sudden dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and hypoxia [^notfound].
- **Perforated viscus**: Free air and peritonitis on imaging [^notfound].
- **Pancreatitis**: Elevated lipase, characteristic CT findings [^notfound].
- **Renal colic**: Flank pain, hematuria, and ureteral stones on imaging [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Immediate recognition**: High suspicion in men > 65 with smoking history, hypertension, or known AAA presenting with sudden pain or shock [^e15187a0].
- **Rapid imaging**: CT angiography is first-line when stable; ultrasound if unstable or CT unavailable [^d23aad0e] [^6fcf8088].
- **Emergent intervention**: Open or endovascular repair is indicated immediately; permissive hypotension (SBP 70–90 mmHg) is recommended in conscious patients to limit bleeding [^0e100edd] [^d498f6c4].
- **Transfer protocols**: If local resources are inadequate, transfer to a vascular center with endovascular capability should not be delayed [^b615e134].

---

Abdominal aortic rupture is a **surgical emergency** characterized by the classic triad of pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile mass, but presentations vary and mortality is high without prompt diagnosis and intervention. Early CT angiography and rapid surgical management are essential to improve outcomes [^e15187a0] [^d23aad0e].

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as a focal dilation of the aorta of more than 50% of its expected diameter. Found in 1% of the population over the age of 50, AAAs are responsible for 1% of all deaths amongst Caucasian adults and are the tenth leading cause of death in men over the age of 55. Risk factors include age, male gender, tobacco usage, family history, hypercholesterolaemia, and hypertension. Aneurysms may progress in size as a result of gradual wall weakening, with rupture occurring at the end of the growth spectrum.

A ruptured AAA often leads to disastrous consequences, with 50% of patients dying before reaching the hospital and another 40 to 50% mortality rate for those who undergo surgery. However, surgical treatment can be slightly delayed in haemodynamically stable patients who present with an impending AAA rupture. These patients still require urgent treatment, but can also benefit from preoperative imaging that optimises surgical planning and reduces mortality rates to those comparable to elective procedures (less than 5%). It is therefore crucial to recognise imaging signs of impending and complete AAA ruptures as proper identification of these rupture signs will have important repercussions on treatment promptness and prognosis.

The purpose of this review is to identify signs of impending AAA rupture before rupture is completed. This article categorises imaging findings according to location: (1) intramural, (2) luminal, and (3) extraluminal (Table 1). Intramural signs generally indicate impending AAA rupture, whereas luminal and extraluminal signs imply complete rupture. Treatment options for AAA ruptures will also be discussed.

Table 1
Classification of signs of impending and complete aortic aneurysm rupture according to location: intramural, luminal, and extraluminal

It must be added that an aneurysm about to rupture may not reveal any imaging findings. In addition, a painful AAA, in itself, may indicate impending rupture, even in the absence of CT imaging findings, and may justify urgent repair.

Objectives

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture has a high mortality rate. Although the diagnosis of a ruptured AAA is usually straightforward, detection of impending rupture signs can be more challenging. Early diagnosis of impending AAA rupture can be lifesaving. Furthermore, differentiating between impending and complete rupture has important repercussions on patient management and prognosis. The purpose of this article is to classify and illustrate the entire spectrum of AAA rupture signs and to review current treatment options for ruptured AAAs.

Methods

Using medical illustrations supplemented with computed tomography (CT), this essay showcases the various signs of impending rupture and ruptured AAAs. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open surgical repair are also discussed as treatment options for ruptured AAAs.

Results

CT imaging findings of ruptured AAAs can be categorised according to location: intramural, luminal, and extraluminal. Intramural signs generally indicate impending AAA rupture, whereas luminal and extraluminal signs imply complete rupture. EVAR has emerged as an alternative and possibly less morbid method to treat ruptured AAAs.

Conclusions

AAA rupture occurs at the end of a continuum of growth and wall weakening. This review describes the CT imaging findings that may help identify impending rupture prior to complete rupture.

Teaching Points

- AAA rupture occurs at the end of a continuum of growth and wall weakening.
- Intramural imaging findings indicate impending AAA rupture.
- Luminal and extraluminal imaging findings imply complete AAA rupture.
- Some imaging findings are not specific to AAA ruptures and can be seen in other pathologies.
- EVAR has emerged as an alternative and possibly less morbid method of treating ruptured AAAs.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) timing of intervention — symptomatic evaluation and rupture risk by size: For a known AAA with acute symptoms but without hemodynamic instability, "A patient with a known AAA or pulsatile mass on abdominal examination who presents without hemodynamic instability and acute onset of back or abdominal pain should undergo an immediate CT scan to determine whether rupture has occurred." In selected stable symptomatic cases, "it may be appropriate to delay intervention for several hours" and "the patient should be closely monitored in an ICU." For asymptomatic large aneurysms, "A more frequent concern is the timing for treatment of an asymptomatic, large AAA, > 5.4 cm in diameter." Size-based rupture risk estimates include "rupture risk was estimated at 10% per year for aneurysms between 5.5 and 6.9 cm in diameter but > 33% per year when aneurysms were 7 cm or larger in diameter," while more contemporary pooled data report "a rupture risk of 6.3% per year for aneurysms > 7 cm in diameter."

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as abnormal dilation of the infrarenal abdominal aortic diameter to 3.0 cm or greater. The natural history of AAA consists of progressive expansion and potential rupture. Although most AAAs are clinically silent, a pulsatile abdominal mass identified on physical examination may indicate the presence of an AAA. When an AAA is suspected, an imaging study is essential to confirm the diagnosis. This document reviews the relative appropriateness of various imaging procedures for the initial evaluation of suspected AAA. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) account for significant morbidity and mortality in adults. Because they are most often asymptomatic until rupture occurs, screening that allows early detection and management has been advocated. In this review, the authors examine evidence to support screening at-risk populations for AAAs and evaluate various screening methods.

Conclusion

AAA rupture occurs at the end of a continuum of growth and wall weakening. Although ruptured AAAs are easily diagnosed, identifying impending rupture signs can be more challenging. This review describes the CT imaging findings that may help identify impending rupture prior to complete rupture, which has important consequences on treatment and prognosis. Knowledge of alternative causes of retroperitoneal stranding and haemorrhage may also facilitate the diagnosis. EVAR has emerged as an alternative and possibly less morbid method of treating ruptured AAAs over conventional open surgical repair.

Management

AAA rupture represents a major surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention. However, an estimated 87.5% of patients admitted to the hospital with a ruptured AAA survived longer than 2 h after their admission. Furthermore, the median time interval between admission and death from AAA rupture was 10.5 h. This suggests that most patients with ruptured AAAs who reach the hospital alive are haemodynamically stable enough to undergo preoperative imaging. CT angiography permits confirmation of AAA rupture and evaluation of AAA anatomy while intravenous fluid resuscitation is initiated. Pre-interventional imaging also allows assessing the eligibility for an endovascular repair.

It has been reported that aneurysm repair can be slightly delayed in haemodynamically stable patients who present with symptomatic AAA without signs of complete rupture. Urgent treatment is still warranted in these patients, who should receive proper preoperative management and aneurysm repair within 4 to 24 h of admission. Such management optimises preoperative conditions and reduces mortality rates to those comparable to elective procedures (less than 5%). Nevertheless, in haemodynamically unstable patients with acute and complete AAA rupture, emergent and immediate treatment is mandatory.

Open surgical repair is considered the standard treatment for AAA. Surgical repair involves an extensive abdominal incision, clamping of the proximal abdominal aorta, and suturing of a graft that excludes the aneurysm (Fig. 12). Despite important advances in technology and critical care, very little or no significant reduction in mortality rates in patients with open surgical repair of ruptured AAA has been noted in over 2 decades, remaining higher than 40%.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm — timing by presentation and status: The optimal timing of AAA repair is based on clinical presentation and aneurysm status: a ruptured AAA requires emergent repair; a symptomatic, nonruptured aneurysm is best treated urgently; and an asymptomatic AAA can be treated electively after completion of preoperative assessment. Delay in the treatment of an asymptomatic, large AAA should be minimized.

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm — protocolized preoperative management and initial evaluation: Establishing a protocol or algorithm for urgent or emergent management of a patient with a ruptured AAA is essential for optimizing outcomes, and in the presence of a protocol, 30-day mortality was 18%, whereas in the absence of a protocol, 30-day mortality was 32%. An expedited evaluation consisting of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) protocol, general assessment, and vital sign check should be initially performed by the emergency physician of any patient suspected of having a ruptured AAA, and intravascular access should be established with two large-bore peripheral intravenous lines as central or arterial access is not immediately necessary. Permissive hypotension, or hypotensive hemostasis, which refers to restricting aggressive fluid resuscitation as long as the patient remains conscious and has a systolic blood pressure between 70 and 90 mm Hg, should be implemented to limit excessive hemorrhage, and laboratory or imaging studies should be obtained only to confirm the diagnosis of ruptured AAA. Other actions that may help improve outcomes are the immediate availability of blood and blood products, warming, and avoidance of elective intubation.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) — definition, epidemiology, rupture risk and intervention thresholds are summarized as follows: An aneurysm is defined as at least a 50% increase in local aortic diameter or > 30 mm absolute diameter, and abdominal aortic aneurysms are up to 4 times more common in men. In men, rupture risk per year ranges from 0.3% to 0.8%, and surveillance of AAA < 55 mm is supported; in women, the risk of rupture may be up to 4 times higher, justifying intervention at 50 mm. Growth usually occurs initially at a smaller diameter (< 42.5 mm), and in patients with high-risk AAA, earlier intervention may be reasonable. For symptomatic, unruptured AAA, urgent repair is indicated to reduce the risk of rupture, and for ruptured AAA, emergency surgical or endovascular treatment is indicated.

### Systematic review of circulating, biomechanical, and genetic markers for the prediction of abdominal aortic aneurysm growth and rupture [^4467acbf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The natural course of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a steady increase of the diameter, and eventually, if left untreated, the aneurysm might rupture. 1 In most cases of AAA, this pathophysiological process remains asymptomatic until rupture. Such an event can be prevented by surgical AAA repair. The decision to perform surgery is commonly based on 3 characteristics being the: (1) maximum AAA diameter exceeding 5.0 cm in women and 5.5 cm in men; (2) experience of symptoms; or (3) aneurysm growth rate exceeds 1 cm/year. 2, 3 The first 2 characteristics are relatively easy to identify by imaging or by questioning the patient. However, AAA growth rate can only be considered retrospectively, because a prognostic value for expansion has not yet been acknowledged.

In the current AAA management, no marker for aneurysm progression or rupture has been implemented as common practice. This might be explained by little existing evidence and lack of experience with prognostic markers. Although numerous potential markers of aneurysm growth and rupture have been examined, a systematic review with a detailed and structured evaluation of markers for AAA expansion and rupture is lacking.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify promising markers of aneurysm expansion and rupture to aid clinicians in AAA management. We searched for retro‐ and prospective observational studies in which the prognostic value of circulating bloodmarkers, biomechanical properties, and genetic variations for AAA expansion or rupture are investigated.

Aortic Aneurysm What is aortic aneurysm. An aortic aneurysm is a balloon-like bulge in the aorta, the large artery that carries blood from the heart through the chest and torso. Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture:

- The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection.
- The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture.
- Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms. What are the types of aortic aneurysm. A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age. 4 Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms.

Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following:

- Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back
- Shortness of breath
- Trouble breathing or swallowing An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms. 6 Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following:

- Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side
- Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs. Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke. Peripheral aneurysms — those found in arteries other than the aorta — can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees. These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery.

Objective

With the increasing use of cross-sectional imaging for a variety of medical and surgical conditions affecting the abdomen and pelvis, familiarity with the imaging features of aneurysm rupture — and the findings suspicious for impending or contained aneurysm rupture — is crucial for all radiologists. This pictorial essay will review the imaging findings of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms and of complicated aneurysms.

Conclusion

Prompt detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture or impending rupture is critical because emergent surgery may be required and patient survival may be at stake.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysms [^27742264]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the infrarenal aorta. AAA is a multifactorial disease, and genetic and environmental factors play a part; smoking, male sex and a positive family history are the most important risk factors, and AAA is most common in men > 65 years of age. AAA results from changes in the aortic wall structure, including thinning of the media and adventitia due to the loss of vascular smooth muscle cells and degradation of the extracellular matrix. If the mechanical stress of the blood pressure acting on the wall exceeds the wall strength, the AAA ruptures, causing life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage - the mortality for patients with ruptured AAA is 65–85%. Although AAAs of any size can rupture, the risk of rupture increases with diameter. Intact AAAs are typically asymptomatic, and in settings where screening programmes with ultrasonography are not implemented, most cases are diagnosed incidentally. Modern functional imaging techniques (PET, CT and MRI) may help to assess rupture risk. Elective repair of AAA with open surgery or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) should be considered to prevent AAA rupture, although the morbidity and mortality associated with both techniques remain non-negligible.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) symptomatic imaging — In patients with abdominal or back pain, ultrasound imaging is recommended to determine whether an AAA is present and to evaluate for other causes; if an aneurysm is detected, the patient should have CT arteriography with timed intravenous injection of contrast material, if it is not contraindicated, to exclude rupture and to facilitate operative planning. A patient presenting with a large AAA and back or abdominal pain should be referred for treatment as soon as an aneurysm is recognized, and if hemodynamic compromise is present or evolves during evaluation, further imaging studies should be abandoned as care is escalated. We recommend a CT scan to evaluate patients thought to have AAA presenting with recent-onset abdominal or back pain, particularly in the presence of a pulsatile epigastric mass or significant risk factors for AAA, with Level of recommendation 1 (Strong) and Quality of evidence B (Moderate).

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^60a21585]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treatment thresholds and indications — Most AAAs are fusiform rather than saccular, and treatment recommendations for asymptomatic fusiform AAA rest primarily on the maximum transverse diameter as measured on ultrasound, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging. Conventional arteriography can easily underestimate the true diameter by not accounting for luminal thrombus. There is general agreement that small aneurysms, < 4.0 cm in maximum diameter, are at low risk of rupture and should be monitored, whereas an aneurysm > 5.4 cm in diameter should be repaired in an otherwise healthy patient. Elective repair is also recommended for patients who present with a saccular aneurysm, and when an unrecognized AAA first presents symptomatically with abdominal or back pain or rupture, prompt treatment is recommended.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^ce21366e]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms cause 1.3% of all deaths among men aged 65–85 years in developed countries. These aneurysms are typically asymptomatic until the catastrophic event of rupture. Repair of large or symptomatic aneurysms by open surgery or endovascular repair is recommended, whereas repair of small abdominal aortic aneurysms does not provide a significant benefit. Abdominal aortic aneurysm is linked to the degradation of the elastic media of the atheromatous aorta. An inflammatory cell infiltrate, neovascularisation, and production and activation of various proteases and cytokines contribute to the development of this disorder, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this Seminar, we aim to provide an updated review of the pathophysiology, current and new diagnostic procedures, assessment, and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm to provide family practitioners with a working knowledge of this disorder.

Intramural signs

Increased aneurysm size

Aneurysm size is the most important predictive factor for AAA rupture. Following Laplace's law, wall tension increases with vessel radius. Accordingly, rupture risk increases with size, with a 3–15% risk per year for those with a 5–6 cm aneurysm, 10–20% for 6–7 cm aneurysms, 20–40% for 7–8 cm aneurysms, and 30–50% for those with a diameter greater than 8 cm. Rupture risk was shown to be substantially higher with larger AAAs, as reported in a series of patients refusing or unfit for elective repair.

Rapid enlargement rate

The AAA growth rate is correlated to its diameter and to the risk of rupture. When smaller than 4 cm, aneurysms grow at a slower rate of 1.0–1.5 mm per year, whereas AAAs of more than 4 cm tend to have a greater growth rate of 3 mm per year. With every 5 mm increase in diameter, there is a 0.5 mm per year increase in growth rate and a doubling of rupture risk. Active smokers are also at higher risks of having rapidly enlarging AAAs. When the aneurysm growth rate exceeds 1 cm per year, the increased rupture risk justifies elective AAA repair (Fig. 1).

### Chemokine receptor 2 is a theranostic biomarker for abdominal aortic aneurysms [^f47e198c]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) represent a potentially life-threatening condition as they typically remain asymptomatic until they subsequently rupture. AAAs are more prevalent in men, but they rupture more often in women for unknown reasons. Clinically, the unpredictable rupture leads to a high morbidity and mortality rate and substantial health care costs. Currently, the mechanism for AAA expansion and rupture is largely unknown. Clinical screening and surveillance protocols for AAAs continue to be significantly limited as they are almost entirely based on anatomic diameter measurements that do not account for the complex molecular processes occurring within AAA tissue. Additionally, there remains no effective medical therapies that can impede AAA expansion and the risk of rupture. Invasive surgical management continues to be the only option for individuals who meet the traditional size criteria for AAA repair or who develop AAA-related symptoms. However, this leaves patients in prolonged anticipation of either an impending need for a future repair, or a risk of rapid progressing to rupture, which can be life-threatening.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^e7dac430]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a pathologic condition with progressive abdominal aortic dilatation of 3.0 cm or more that predisposes the abdominal aorta to rupture. Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic until they rupture, although some are detected when an imaging study is performed for other reasons. The risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm include hypertension, coronary artery disease, tobacco use, male sex, a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, age older than 65 years, and peripheral artery disease. Abdominal ultrasonography is the preferred modality to screen for abdominal aortic aneurysm because of its cost-effectiveness and lack of exposure to ionizing radiation. Abdominal aortic aneurysm can be managed medically or surgically, depending on the patient's symptoms and the size and growth rate of the aneurysm. Medical management is appropriate for asymptomatic patients and smaller aneurysms and includes tobacco cessation and therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction. Surgical management, which includes open and endovascular aneurysm repair, is indicated when the aneurysm diameter is 5.5 cm or larger in men and 5.0 cm or larger in women. Surveillance of abdominal aortic aneurysm depends on the size and growth rate of the aneurysm. The most serious complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm is rupture, which requires emergent surgical intervention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men with a history of smoking who are 65 to 75 years of age should undergo one-time abdominal aortic aneurysm screening with ultrasonography.

### Management of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^e15187a0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on abdominal aortic aneurysm:

- **Definition**: An AAA is a structural disease of the abdominal aorta characterized by a pathological, localized dilatation of > 30 mm or > 50% of the original aortic size.
- **Pathophysiology**: Multiple environmental factors (including smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and collagen diseases) and genetic factors can induce and accelerate degeneration of the layers of the aortic wall. An inflammatory response in the aortic vessel wall leads to destruction of elastin and collagen in the media and adventitia, loss of smooth muscle cells, thinning of the media, and neovascularization.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the overall prevalence of AAA is estimated at 2,200 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: The majority of AAAs are asymptomatic and are detected as an incidental finding on diagnostic imaging performed for other purposes. AAAs can also present with abdominal pain or complications such as thrombosis, embolization and rupture.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall mortality associated with ruptured AAA is approximately 85–90%.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^944fa37d]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm refers to abdominal aortic dilation of 3.0 cm or greater. The main risk factors are age older than 65 years, male sex, and smoking history. Other risk factors include a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. Diagnosis may be made by physical examination, an incidental finding on imaging, or ultrasonography. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released updated recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in 2014. Men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking should undergo one-time screening with ultrasonography based on evidence that screening will improve abdominal aortic aneurysm-related mortality in this population. Men in this age group without a history of smoking may benefit if they have other risk factors (e.g., family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease). There is inconclusive evidence to recommend screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in women 65 to 75 years of age with a smoking history. Women without a smoking history should not undergo screening because the harms likely outweigh the benefits. Persons who have a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo regular surveillance or operative intervention depending on aneurysm size. Surgical intervention by open or endovascular repair is the primary option and is typically reserved for aneurysms 5.5 cm in diameter or greater. There are limited options for medical treatment beyond risk factor modification. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency presenting with hypotension, shooting abdominal or back pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. It is associated with high prehospitalization mortality. Emergent surgical intervention is indicated for a rupture but has a high operative mortality rate.

### Surgery for small asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms [^a2435ac1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal ballooning of the major abdominal artery. Some AAAs present as emergencies and require surgery; others remain asymptomatic. Treatment of asymptomatic AAAs depends on many factors, but the size of the aneurysm is important, as risk of rupture increases with aneurysm size. Large asymptomatic AAAs (greater than 5.5 cm in diameter) are usually repaired surgically; very small AAAs (less than 4.0 cm diameter) are monitored with ultrasonography. Debate continues over the roles of early repair versus surveillance with repair on subsequent enlargement in people with asymptomatic AAAs of 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm diameter. This is the fourth update of the review first published in 1999.

Objectives

To compare mortality and costs, as well as quality of life and aneurysm rupture as secondary outcomes, following early surgical repair versus routine ultrasound surveillance in people with asymptomatic AAAs between 4.0 cm and 5.5 cm in diameter.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two other databases, and two trials registers to 10 July 2019. We handsearched conference proceedings and checked reference lists of relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials where people with asymptomatic AAAs of 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm were randomly allocated to early repair or imaging-based surveillance at least every six months. Outcomes had to include mortality or survival.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data, which were cross-checked by other team members. Outcomes were mortality, costs, quality of life, and aneurysm rupture. For mortality, we estimated risk ratios (RR) (endovascular aneurysm repair only), hazard ratios (HR) (open repair only), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on Mantel-Haenszel Chi 2 statistics at one and six years (open repair only) following randomisation.

Main Results

We found no new studies for this update. Four trials with 3314 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two trials compared early open repair with surveillance and two trials compared early endovascular repair (EVAR) with surveillance. We used GRADE to access the certainty of the evidence for mortality and cost, which ranged from high to low. We downgraded the certainty in the evidence from high to moderate and low due to risk of bias concerns and imprecision (some outcomes were only reported by one study). All four trials showed an early survival benefit in the surveillance group (due to 30-day operative mortality with repair) but no evidence of differences in long-term survival. One study compared early open repair with surveillance with an adjusted HR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.02, mean follow-up 10 years; HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.54, mean follow-up 4.9 years). Pooled analysis of participant-level data from the two trials comparing early open repair with surveillance (maximum follow-up seven to eight years) showed no evidence of a difference in survival (propensity score-adjusted HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.18; 2226 participants; high-certainty evidence). This lack of treatment effect did not vary to three years by AAA diameter (P = 0.39), participant age (P = 0.61), or for women (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.11). Two studies compared EVAR with surveillance and there was no evidence of a survival benefit for early EVAR at 12 months (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.73 to 5.06; 846 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported costs. The mean UK health service costs per participant over the first 18 months after randomisation were higher in the open repair surgery than the surveillance group (GBP 4978 in the repair group versus GBP 3914 in the surveillance group; mean difference (MD) GBP 1064, 95% CI 796 to 1332; 1090 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a similar difference after 12 years. The mean USA hospital costs for participants at six months after randomisation were higher in the EVAR group than in the surveillance group (USD 33,471 with repair versus USD 5520 with surveillance; MD USD 27,951, 95% CI 25,156 to 30,746; 614 participants; low-certainty evidence). After four years, there was no evidence of a difference in total medical costs between groups (USD 48,669 with repair versus USD 46,112 with surveillance; MD USD 2557, 95% CI -8043 to 13,156; 614 participants; low-certainty evidence). All studies reported quality of life but used different assessment measurements and results were conflicting. All four studies reported aneurysm rupture. There were very few ruptures reported in the trials of EVAR versus surveillance up to three years. In the trials of open surgery versus surveillance, there were ruptures to at least six years and there were more ruptures in the surveillance group, but most of these ruptures occurred in aneurysms that had exceeded the threshold for surgical repair.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence of an advantage to early repair for small AAA (4.0 cm to 5.5 cm), regardless of whether open repair or EVAR is used and, at least for open repair, regardless of patient age and AAA diameter. Thus, neither early open nor early EVAR of small AAAs is supported by currently available evidence. Long-term data from the two trials investigating EVAR are not available, so, we can only draw firm conclusions regarding outcomes after the first few years for open repair. Research regarding the risks related to and management of small AAAs in ethnic minorities and women is urgently needed, as data regarding these populations are lacking.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysms revisited: MDCT with multiplanar reconstructions for identifying indicators of instability in the pre-and postoperative patient [^a328446d]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is commonly a fatal event. Multidetector computed tomographic (CT) signs of frank aortic rupture are usually readily apparent and widely understood. However, diagnosing an impending aortic rupture on the basis of imaging findings can prove more difficult. CT is the primary modality used for serial imaging in patients with aortic aneurysm and may show findings indicative of aortic instability. Therefore, it is critical that radiologists be familiar with the CT findings of aortic instability to avert the potential complications of hemorrhage, end organ or limb ischemia, and death. Various preoperative CT indicators have been previously described in both research investigations and review articles. A large baseline aneurysm size and a rapid increase in size over time are associated with a higher risk for rupture. The importance of obtaining accurate measurements with multiplanar reconstructions and the role of new semiautomated tools for obtaining accurate, reproducible measurements are discussed. Additional CT findings that reflect aortic aneurysm instability include luminal expansion with lysis of thrombus, intramural hemorrhage (ie, the crescent sign), periaortic hemorrhage, a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, and contained rupture (ie, the draped aorta sign). After open or endovascular aneurysm repair, CT is routinely used to monitor for graft complications. In this setting, radiologists should understand that the presence of an endoluminal stent or surgical graft does not preclude aortic rupture. Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Key points
- An aortic aneurysm is a dangerous balloon-like bulge in the aorta, the large artery that carries blood from the heart through the chest and torso. What it is Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture:

- The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection.
- The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture.
- Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms. 1
- A history of smoking accounts for about 75% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms. 2
- The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 65 to 75 years old who have ever smoked should get an ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms, even if they have no symptoms.
3. **Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following**:
- Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back.
- Shortness of breath.
- Trouble breathing or swallowing. Abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people. 5 Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis, but infection or injury can also cause them. 6 Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following:

- Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side.
- Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs. Other types Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke. Peripheral aneurysms — those found in arteries other than the aorta — can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees.

These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery.

### Accuracy of presenting symptoms, physical examination, and imaging for diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: systematic review and meta-analysis [^6fcf8088]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is a life-threatening condition, and rapid diagnosis is necessary to facilitate early surgical intervention. We sought to evaluate the accuracy of presenting symptoms, physical examination signs, computed tomography with angiography (CTA), and point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) for diagnosis of rAAA.

Methods

We searched six databases from inception through April 2021. We included studies investigating the accuracy of any of the above tests for diagnosis of rAAA. The primary reference standard used in all studies was intraoperative diagnosis or death from rAAA. Because PoCUS cannot detect rupture, we secondarily assessed its accuracy for the diagnosis of AAA, using the reference standard of intraoperative or CTA diagnosis. We used GRADE to assess certainty in estimates.

Results

We included 20 studies (2,077 patients), with 11 of these evaluating signs and symptoms, seven evaluating CTA, and five evaluating PoCUS. Pooled sensitivities of abdominal pain, back pain, and syncope for rAAA were 61.7%, 53.6%, and 27.8%, respectively (low certainty). Pooled sensitivity of hypotension and pulsatile abdominal mass were 30.9% and 47.1%, respectively (low certainty). CTA had a sensitivity of 91.4% and specificity of 93.6% for diagnosis of rAAA (moderate certainty). In our secondary analysis, PoCUS had a sensitivity of 97.8% and specificity of 97.0% for diagnosing AAA in patients suspected of having rAAA (moderate certainty).

Conclusions

Classic clinical symptoms associated with rAAA have poor sensitivity, and their absence does not rule out the condition. CTA has reasonable accuracy, but misses some cases of rAAA. PoCUS is a valuable tool that can help guide the need for urgent transfer to a vascular center in patients suspected of having rAAA.

With the ten WHO criteria for a screening program to be started, screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm is analyzed. Most of the criteria are fulfilled concerning the 65-year old male population, whereas concerning females we need more knowledge. Still the aneurysmal diameter is the most important factor to select patients for treatment meaning that many aneurysms are treated where rupture should never have occurred. Research projects giving more information on pathophysiological processes behind expansion and rupture should have priority.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease affects up to 5% of men aged between 65 and 74 years in Western Europe and may pass undetected until a patient presents with rupture. The mortality rate of ruptured AAA is over 80%, with a minority of patients surviving long enough to undergo emergency repair. The risks associated with elective AAA repair are also significant, with a 30-day mortality rate of up to 5% for elective endovascular or open repair. Decision-making at an individual patient level is therefore paramount to ensure the best clinical outcome, particularly as AAA shares risk factors for, and typically coexists with, atherosclerotic disease processes that confer substantial perioperative risk.

When planning management of a patient with an AAA, the risks of elective surgery must be weighed against the risk of rupture without intervention. Various risk prediction models have been developed to help evaluate perioperative and postoperative risk. While these scores may help evaluate risk when operative intervention is being considered, the prediction of aneurysm expansion and rupture risk in patients under surveillance remains challenging. Current knowledge of AAA progression is largely based on the tenet that rupture rate rises with increasing aneurysm diameter. However, up to one in five ruptured AAAs occur in small aneurysms (< 5.5 cm), while many patients have far larger aneurysms that never rupture and a substantial proportion of patients die of non-AAA-related causes while under surveillance. We would therefore suggest that prediction of disease progression using simple measures and thresholds, such as aneurysm diameter, is too simplistic.

### Risk factors for rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm… [^414006d0]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm has high morbidity and mortality rates. Many patients die before reaching the operating room. Surgeons often electively repair abdominal aortic aneurysms that measure 4 to 5. 5 cm in diameter even though the long-term survival benefit of early elective surgery is uncertain. The decision is made more difficult because of uncertainty about the rupture risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms of different sizes. Abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter is probably a determinant of rupture, but measurements are poorly reproducible. The rupture rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms that measure less than 5 cm in diameter vary widely, from zero to 1 percent per year to as high as 6 percent per year. Among the 1, 090 randomized patients, 25 abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures occurred. In the 1, 167 nonrandomized patients, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture occurred in 78 patients.

Of the 103 ruptures, 26 patients died without ever reaching the hospital, 53 patients died in the hospital without undergoing surgery, 13 patients died within 30 days of surgery and 11 patients died more than 30 days following surgery. Factors significantly and independently associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture included initial aneurysm diameter, female gender, higher mean blood pressure reading and current smoker as measured by baseline plasma cotinine level. Although women typically have smaller abdominal aortic aneurysm measurements than men, a surprising finding of this study was a rate of aneurysm rupture three times higher in women than in men.

The authors conclude that patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm who are at marginal fitness levels, refuse surgery or are awaiting surgery should maintain adequate control of blood pressure and receive counseling and support to stop smoking. Although small abdominal aortic aneurysms do rupture, the risk of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm that measures smaller than 5 cm in diameter is notably low; the risk of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms that measure 5 to 5. 9 cm is also low but escalates sharply for abdominal aortic aneurysms that measure 6 cm or more in diameter. Different thresholds for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair should apply to women than to men because of the greater tendency for smaller aneurysms to rupture.

### Spectrum of CT findings in rupture and impending rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^9ca7686e]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Prompt diagnosis of rupture and impending rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms is imperative. The computed tomographic (CT) findings of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms are often straightforward. Most ruptures are manifested as a retroperitoneal hematoma accompanied by an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Periaortic blood may extend into the perirenal space, the pararenal space, or both. Intraperitoneal extravasation may be an immediate or a delayed finding. Discontinuity of the aortic wall or a focal gap in otherwise continuous circumferential wall calcifications may point to the location of a rupture. There usually is a delay of several hours between the initial intramural hemorrhage and frank extravasation into the periaortic soft tissues. Contained or impending ruptures are more difficult to identify. A small amount of periaortic blood may be confused with the duodenum, perianeurysmal fibrosis, or adenopathy. Imaging features suggestive of instability or impending rupture include increased aneurysm size, a low thrombus-to-lumen ratio, and hemorrhage into a mural thrombus. A peripheral crescent-shaped area of hyperattenuation within an abdominal aortic aneurysm represents an acute intramural hemorrhage and is another CT sign of impending rupture. Draping of the posterior aspect of an aneurysmal aorta over the vertebrae is associated with a contained rupture.

The proper management of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), namely those under the threshold of 5.5 cm in diameter, has been under investigation for years. Risk of rupture for this group of AAAs is higher than the general population, although it remains low enough not to require a repair. However, specific factors have been associated with increased expansion or rupture rate, and these factors could identify potential candidates for earlier intervention. This review aims to collect and present all available data on the development and progress of small AAAs. Moreover, recommendations on proper management are discussed as well.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAbdominal aortic aneurysm follow-up (without repair) [^033cc4d8]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as aneurysmal dilation of the abdominal aorta to 3 cm or greater. A high degree of morbidity and mortality is associated with AAA rupture, and imaging surveillance plays an essential role in mitigating the risk of rupture. Aneurysm size and growth rate are factors associated with the risk of rupture, thus surveillance imaging studies must be accurate and reproducible to characterize aneurysm size. Ultrasound, CT angiography, and MR angiography provide an accurate and reproducible assessment of size, while radiographs and aortography provide limited evaluation. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Ruptured aortic aneurysm

Diagnosis of aneurysms depends on measurement of the vascular diameter. The normal aortic diameter is dependent on location and age. For the ascending aortic diameter, the upper limit of the normal aorta is 35 mm at the age of 20; in an 80-year-old patient the upper limit is close to 45 mm. In the abdominal aorta, aneurysms are defined by a diameter > 30 mm, regardless of the age of the patient. Aneurysms occur in isolation in the thoracic or abdominal aorta or can present as thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms. The size of the aneurysm defines the rupture risk with a clear correlation between aneurysm diameter and the risk of rupture. For AAA the annual rupture risk is 1–11% for aneurysms between 50 and 59 mm, 10–22% for aneurysms sized from 60 to 69 mm and peak with rupture rates of 30–33% for aneurysms larger than 70 mm.

There are definitive signs of impending rupture (an aneurysm size increase especially with a rapid enlargement rate, focal wall discontinuity, hyper-attenuating crescent sign, thrombus fissuration, draped aorta sign or periaortic stranding); unfortunately these signs are often not highly specific (Fig. 8) but detection of these findings advocates urgent treatment.

Diagnosis is primarily clinical, including Age > 50 with abdominal or back pain AND hypotension or a known AAA with compatible symptoms; radiologic confirmation (ultrasound or computed tomography [CT]) is only required when an alternative diagnosis is more likely on clinical grounds. Immediate management includes intravenous access with two large bore peripheral intravenous lines (IVs) with central and/or arterial lines not immediately necessary, permissive hypotension with a target systolic pressure 70–90 mmHg, and lab work or x‑rays should only be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of rAAA. If appropriate vascular services cannot be provided, consideration of transfer to a regional center is indicated and the patient should be discussed with a receiving vascular surgeon; a contraindication for transfer is patients suffering from ongoing cardiac arrest. For rapid transfer, include physician-to-physician phone handoff, transfer of any obtained images with the patient, and in‑transit vital sign monitoring with permissive hypotension. Subsequent pathways proceed to Emergent Evaluation by Receiving Vascular Surgery Team or Emergent In-house Vascular Surgery Evaluation, culminating in Intervention by Vascular Surgery Team.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for small abdominal aortic aneurysms [^889ee92a]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) affect 5% of the population in developed countries and are characterized by progressive aortic dilatation with an unpredictable time course. This condition is more common in men than in women, and in smokers than in nonsmokers. If left untreated, AAA can result in aortic rupture and death. Pathologically, aortic extracellular matrix degradation, inflammation, and neovascularization are hallmarks of AAA. Diagnosis of AAA and subsequent surveillance utilize established aortic imaging methods, such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI. More-speculative diagnostic approaches include molecular and cellular imaging methods that interrogate the underlying pathological processes at work within the aneurysm. In this Review, we explore the current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the management of AAA. We also describe the diagnostic potential of new imaging techniques and therapeutic potential of new treatments for the management of small AAA.

### Assessing the potential risk of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^b14c4d10]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) involve complex interplays between inflammatory and biomechanical factors that can be elucidated with anatomical and functional imaging. Although AAA size has been well-established in the literature to correlate with risk of rupture (and subsequent need for vascular intervention), there are other less-well-known characteristics about AAAs that also contribute to higher risk of rupture. This review focuses on biomechanical, radiological, and epidemiological characteristics of AAAs that are associated with higher rupture risk. For clinicians, knowing and considering a wide variety of risk factors in addition to AAA size is important to initiate early and proper intervention for AAA repair. Although there is no official quantitative risk score of AAA rupture risk that takes other non-size-related variables into account, if clinicians are aware of these other parameters, it is hoped that intervention can be appropriately performed for higher-risk AAAs that have not met the size-threshold for elective repair.

### Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm [^c25d6d57]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are found in up to 6% of men and 1.7% of women over the age of 65 years and are usually asymptomatic. The natural history of aortic aneurysms is continued dilation leading to rupture, which is associated with an overall 80% mortality. Of the patients with ruptured aneurysms that undergo intervention, half will not survive their hospitalization. Reduction in aneurysm mortality is therefore achieved by prophylactic repair during the asymptomatic period. On a population-based level, this is supported by abdominal aortic aneurysm screening programs. Approximately 60% of abdominal aortic aneurysms are confined to the infrarenal portion of the aorta and are amenable to repair with off-the-shelf endovascular devices. Endovascular techniques have now replaced open surgery as the primary modality for aneurysm repair.

### Aortic wall inflammation predicts abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion, rupture, and need for surgical repair [^bda7d432]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Abdominal aortic aneurysms have a prevalence of 5% in 65- to 74-year-old men and, when ruptured, are associated with a mortality of ≤ 90%. At a population level, ruptured aortic aneurysms are a major cause of death, being the 13th most common cause of death and accounting for > 150 000 deaths in 2013. Preemptive elective open surgical or endovascular repair can be life-saving and is considered when the abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter is > 55 mm, is rapidly expanding (≥ 10 mm/year), or causes symptoms. –

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually associated with no symptoms and are often identified incidentally or as part of an ultrasound-based screening program. Population screening has been established in some countries and is associated with a halving of the mortality associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms. However, continued surveillance of aneurysms is challenging because of the nonlinearity and unpredictability of expansion rates, although the best current predictor of aneurysm expansion and rupture is the baseline aneurysm diameter. Furthermore, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying aneurysm expansion remain uncertain, and the role of cellular inflammation and macrophage infiltration has been debated. Last, ≤ 20% of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms are < 55 mm in diameter, and 40% of patients with aneurysm diameters between 70 and 100 mm do not experience aneurysm rupture. Therefore, an unmet clinical need exists to identify more reliable methods of identifying those patients at risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion and rupture, and techniques that assess both the structure and biology of aneurysms hold considerable promise.

Ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO) constitute a class of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent taken up by tissue-resident macrophages and can be used to identify cellular inflammation within tissues, including abdominal aortic aneurysms. In a small pilot study of 29 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, we have previously demonstrated that USPIO enhancement on MRI is associated with macrophage infiltration of the abdominal aortic aneurysm wall and more rapid rates of abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion. We therefore aimed to validate these preliminary findings in a larger multicenter cohort of patients and determine whether USPIO-enhanced MRI could predict the rate of abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion and subsequent rates of rupture or surgical repair.

### Unstable abdominal aortic aneurysms: a review of MDCT imaging features [^9c0eddfa]. Emergency Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are commonly encountered during abdominal CT imaging, and size-based parameters for surgical or endovascular repair are well established. Aneurysms greater than 5 cm in diameter are recognized as representing an increased rupture risk and meriting intervention. Increasingly, additional interest has been generated in recognizing imaging features which may herald instability and portend a higher chance for potentially catastrophic rupture. This article will review and illustrate such signs, including hyperattenuation of mural thrombus, rapid expansion, low thrombus to lumen ratio, intimal calcification disruption, posterior mural draping, and saccular outpouching. Other features of complicated abdominal aneurysms including perianeurysmal inflammation, aortocaval and aortoenteric fistula formation will also be addressed. Heightened awareness of these features and their prognostic implications, as well as timely communication with the clinical service, is critical for the interpreting radiologist.

AAA treatment thresholds and rupture risk: Treatment of AAA depends on aneurysm size, the risk of rupture, and the risk of operative mortality, and larger size is associated with increased rupture risk. The annual risk for rupture is "nearly 0%" for AAAs 3.0 to 3.9 cm, "1%" for 4.0 to 4.9 cm, and "11%" for 5.0 to 5.9 cm. Surgical repair is standard for "an AAA of 5.5 cm or larger in diameter or an AAA larger than 4.0 cm in diameter that has rapidly increased in size (defined as an increase of 1.0 cm in diameter over a 1-year period)." Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the most common elective approach, and "in the United States, 80% of intact AAA repairs and 52% of ruptured AAA repairs are performed using EVAR." The majority of screen-detected AAAs (≥ 90%) are between 3.0 and 5.5 cm in diameter.

### Current state of experimental imaging modalities for risk assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^9f6d399f]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a major cause of death in developed countries. Patients often lack clinical symptoms, most acute AAA patients do not survive rupture, and subsequent surgical repair has a significant postoperative mortality. Diagnostics for AAAs are currently centered on aneurysm diameter, but recent studies claim this method to be insufficiently accurate. More accurate diagnostic criteria need to be indentified to minimize the amount of unnecessary interventions and to provide earlier diagnosis of rupture-prone AAAs.

Methods

A literature study using the MEDLINE database followed by manual cross-referencing provided original studies concerning AAA diagnostics.

Results

The currently validated imaging modalities such as ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging allow AAA research to develop in several directions. Some studies investigate whether clinically visible entities like thrombus, calcification, and vascular anatomy could be implemented directly into clinical practice through use of ultrasound or computed tomography. Experimental studies on intravascular ultrasound, positron emission tomography-computed tomography, ultrasound particle image velocimetry and superparamagnetic particles in magnetic resonance imaging propose new methodologies to benefit AAA research. Other studies focus on available technology toward inflammation, metabolism, and the effects of hemodynamics on vascular integrity.

Conclusions

Contradictory outcomes, low availability of experimental imaging modalities, and an often small population size hamper research in this field. Introducing new techniques and biomarkers in current or experimental modalities may prove to be the next step in the development of new diagnostic criteria for the risk assessment of AAA rupture. Until then, the AAA diameter remains the gold standard as a clinical risk factor.

The emergency physician should consider using US to search for an AAA in any patient presenting with abdominal or back pain or with shock of unknown etiology.

### Aortic emergencies-diagnosis and treatment: a pictorial review [^1c57db5d]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Imaging signs of completed rupture are contrast extravasation, retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal haematoma (Fig. 10), aorto-enteric or aorto-caval fistulae. AAA rupture can present as a contained rupture or free rupture. Patients with contained rupture should be managed with permissive hypotension to prevent a free rupture and keep the patient stable until treatment. A free rupture can occur into the peritoneal cavity or retroperitoneal rupture with tissue tamponade reducing blood loss.

Clinical management consists of screening [especially in males (previous smokers) over 65 years], with yearly ultrasound surveillance for sizes of 30–45 mm, referral to vascular centres with CTA for aneurysms > 45 mm and shorter follow-up times. Treatment is advocated when the rupture risk exceeds the risk of treatment. Currently, invasive treatment is recommended for infrarenal aortic aneurysm sizes > 55 mm or upon a diameter progression of > 0.5 cm/year. In AAA, EVAR needs a suitable anatomy with infrarenal neck length > 10 mm and neck diameters < 32 mm, an appropriate diameter of access vessels (usually > 6 mm) and absence of severe kinking in access vessels or in the infrarenal neck (< 60°) for most of the available stent graft types. In the ascending aorta including the aortic arch, descending aorta and thoraco-abdominal aneurysms, the cutoff for treatment is a diameter of more than 6 cm.

Symptomatic AAA is difficult to identify, detect and manage. The presenting symptoms are after non-specific abdominal pain, back pain or embolic events. When an AAA is demonstrated on imaging (regardless of size) and all other causes of abdominal pain or back pain have been ruled out (nephrolithiasis, diverticulitis, disk disease, etc.), this AAA can be considered symptomatic. Symptomatic aneurysms are thought to have a higher rupture risk than asymptomatic aneurysms; urgent surgical or endovascular repair is advocated.

The role of EVAR for the treatment of ruptured AAA (Fig. 9) is not completely clear. Approximately 50% of all patients with ruptured infrarenal aortic aneurysms are suitable for EVAR. EVAR was considered to have short- and long-time survival advantages over open surgery, but this was not confirmed in a large randomised trial.

### Rupture rates of small abdominal aortic aneurysms: a systematic review of the literature [^da5a3f4c]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Small aneurysms of the abdominal aorta (3.0–5.5 cm in diameter) often are managed by regular surveillance, rather than surgery, because the risk of surgery is considered to outweigh the risk of aneurysm rupture. The risk of small aneurysm rupture is considered to be low. The purpose of this review is to summarise the reported estimates of small aneurysm rupture rates.

Methods and Findings

We conducted a systematic review of the literature published before 2010 and identified 54 potentially eligible reports. Detailed review of these studies showed that both ascertainment of rupture, patient follow-up and causes of death were poorly reported: diagnostic criteria for rupture were never reported. There were only 14 studies from which rupture rates (as ruptures per 100 person-years) were available. These 14 published studies included 9779 patients (89% male) over the time period 1976–2006 but only 7 of these studies provided rupture rates specifically for the diameter range 3.0–5.5 cm, which ranged from 0 to 1.61 ruptures per 100 person-years.

Conclusions

Rupture rates of small abdominal aortic aneurysms would appear to be low, but most studies have been poorly reported and did not have clear ascertainment and diagnostic criteria for aneurysm rupture.

Computed tomography (CT) is useful in the detection and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Rupture risk can be assessed by accurately measuring diameter, tortuosity, thrombus extent, and wall stress. CT can aid in accurately determining anatomic variants as well as AAA etiology. Evaluation for surgical intervention is made by close examination of AAA morphology and specific anatomic features.

### Scannographic study of risk factors of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture [^37ef575a]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Current decision about when to operate abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is based only on the maximum aneurysm diameter (MAD). However, small aneurysms still rupture and we can observe very large AAA without any symptom. A simple morphologic analysis could be a tool to assess the risk of rupture. The main objective of this study was to assess the relevance of ratios between MAD and healthy aorta on computed tomography (CT) as a risk factor of AAA rupture. The secondary objective was to evaluate CT signs as risk factors of AAA rupture.

Methods

Retrospective observational bicentric study comparing CT scans of a ruptured AAA group and a control group treated electively was conducted. Appariement 1:1 based on MAD was applied. Ratios between healthy aorta diameters at several levels, celiac trunk (CTR), superior mesenteric artery (SMA), highest renal artery (RA), and the MAD were calculated. The presence of blebs, crescent signs, ruptures of calcifications of the aneurysm sack, and draped aorta were notified.

Results

From 2010 to 2016, 38 ruptured AAA and 38 controls were included. Ratios were superior in the rupture group, respectively: MAD/CTR [2.77 (± 0.5) versus 2.58 (± 0.4) P < 0.095], MAD/SMA [2.92 (± 0.7) versus 2.74 (± 0.5) P < 0.194], and MAD/RA [3.02 (± 0.70) versus 2.76 (± 0.5) P < 0.054] but not significatively. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated optimal threshold to detect rupture at 2.8 for the ratio MAD/CTR (area under the curve (AUC) 0.593, sensitivity 47.4%, specificity 78.9%), at 3.3 for the ratio MAD/SMA (AUC 0.564, sensitivity 31.6%, specificity 92.1%), and at 3.3 for the ratio MAD/RA (AUC 0.591, sensitivity 31.6%, specificity 94.7%). Bivariate analysis for rupture risk factor showed significance for the three ratios (MAD/CTR > 2.8 [OR = 11 (1.42; 85.20) P < 0.0217], MAD/SMA > 3.3 [OR = 10 (1.28; 78.12) P < 0.0281], and MAD/RA > 3.3 [OR = 11.00 (1.42; 85.20) P < 0.0217]). One scannographic sign was more present in the rupture group: crescent sign 36.8% versus 5.3%, P = 0.0007, as well in bivariate analysis [OR = 7 (1.59; 30.80) P < 0.0326].

Conclusions

In our experience, specific ratios when they exceed calculated threshold, seem to be more prone to rupture. We could consider that these measures, easy to apply in clinical practice, would be complementary keys for rupture risk individual assessment.

### Involvement of B cells, immunoglobulins, and syk in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^d0c210ba]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common aortic disease in older individuals (over 70 years old). 1 AAA is caused by the local weakening of aortic walls. Although patients with AAA seldom show clinical symptoms or signs for years, the AAA diameter slowly expands and leads to the catastrophic events of aortic rupture and sudden death. Currently, no therapy is available to halt the expansion of AAA. Thus, the only therapeutic option is watchful observation and, before rupture, replacing the diseased aorta with an artificial graft, either through open surgery or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with a self‐expandable stent‐graft. 2 Although EVAR is less invasive than open repair, long‐term aortic complications or stent‐graft–associated complications occur more commonly in EVAR, possibly due to the fragility of the aortic wall. 3, 4 To develop strategies for slowing AAA expansion and to provide better clinical outcomes with EVAR, it is essential to understand the pathogenesis of AAA. 5

Current abdominal aortic aneurysm management and need for medical management to limit growth and rupture

Current management

Randomized controlled trials suggest that early elective open surgical repair (OSR) or EVAR of asymptomatic 40–55 mm AAA does not reduce mortality. One trial suggested that EVAR did not significantly reduce mortality in people with large AAA unfit for OSR although this evidence maybe outdated due to advances in EVAR. One trial found that EVAR and OSR had similar 30-day mortality for ruptured AAA. Quality of life was better in the EVAR group, and 3-year mortality was lower after EVAR in participants with proven rupture. The risk of small aneurysm rupture is higher, and outcome of surgery is worse in women compared with men. Based on this evidence, current European Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend monitoring of small AAA (< 55 mm in men; < 50 mm in women) through imaging surveillance, elective surgical repair of large aneurysms in fit patients, and EVAR of ruptured AAA, if morphologically suitable. The intervention threshold for women is not evidence-based and remains a research priority.

Small abdominal aortic aneurysm and large abdominal aortic aneurysm that do not undergo surgical repair

The risk of rupture of small AAA in men is < 1%/year. The 3-year rupture rate of unrepaired 50–54 mm AAA in women was 3.4% in a recent study. Most small AAA grow in size over time, with the UK small aneurysm trial finding that 70% of 40–55 mm AAA grew to 55 mm within 5 years. Large aneurysms have a higher risk of rupture (estimated as 2.2%, 6.0%, and 18.4% over 3 years for 55–60 mm, 61–70 mm, and > 70 mm AAA, respectively). Rupture rate of large AAA is significantly greater in women than men, with a recent study reporting women with unrepaired 61–70 mm AAA had a 3-year incidence of rupture of 12.8% compared with 4.5% in men. There is no evidence that the growth rate of small AAA has changed over time. Thus, medical treatments that can slow AAA growth and reduce the risk of small aneurysm rupture are needed. The remainder of this review summarizes previous research performed to test and develop medical therapy to limit AAA growth and rupture.

### Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: categorization of sonographic findings and report of 3 new signs [^e4c6f3a7]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to categorize the sonographic findings seen in patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and to describe 3 previously undescribed sonographic findings.

Methods

From January 1997 to December 2003, we evaluated 388 consecutive patients with an AAA (transverse aortic diameter > 30 mm). Among these patients, 29 had surgical or computed tomographic demonstration of aneurysm rupture. The remaining 359 were asymptomatic and had no evidence of AAA rupture at follow-up.

Results

Findings recognized among 29 positive cases included AAA deformation (n = 12), luminal thrombus inhomogeneity (n = 20), clear interruption of a luminal thrombus (n = 5), retroperitoneal hematoma (n = 22), and hemoperitoneum (n = 11). In addition, 3 previously unreported findings were noted: an intraluminal floating thrombus layer (n = 8), a parietal hypoechoic focus due to aneurysm wall interruption (n = 3), and a para-aortic hypoechoic area adjacent to the bleeding side (n = 4). Aside from AAA deformation and thrombus heterogeneity, no other signs were recognized among subjects with a nonruptured aneurysm.

Conclusions

In the past, sonography has been used mainly to rapidly confirm aneurysm presence in the clinical setting of a patient with a suspected rupture. Instead, this retrospective series shows how this imaging technique can frequently identify several direct and indirect signs of aneurysm rupture itself. Moreover, 3 new indicators of AAA rupture have been observed.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysms in women [^63c88c0c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has long been recognized as a condition predominantly affecting males, with sex-associated differences described for almost every aspect of the disease from pathophysiology and epidemiology to morbidity and mortality. Women are generally spared from AAA formation by the immunomodulating effects of estrogen, but once they develop, the natural history of AAAs in women appears to be more aggressive, with more rapid expansion, a higher tendency to rupture at smaller diameters, and higher mortality following rupture. However, simply repairing AAAs at smaller diameters in women is a debatable solution, as even elective endovascular AAA repair is fraught with higher morbidity and mortality in women compared to men. The goal of this review is to summarize what is currently known about the effect of gender on AAA presentation, treatment, and outcomes. Additionally, we aim to review current controversies over screening recommendations and threshold for repair in women.

### Vascular abdominal emergencies [^7b3849d0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with nonspecific abdominal pain can have any one of many disease processes. The physical examination may not reveal clear abnormalities, making the diagnosis more difficult. Vascular abdominal emergencies are not common but, when present, may be catastrophic, with significant morbidity and, frequently, mortality. Most of the conditions are time sensitive, leaving the integrity of organ blood flow at risk. Thromboembolic disease leads to ischemia and eventual infarction of the intra-abdominal organs. Aneurismal dilation of the aorta with rupture leads to rapid hypovolemic shock and death if not diagnosed. A high index of suspicion is critical to the successful diagnosis.

What it is Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture:

- The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection.
- The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture.
- Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms. Types Thoracic aortic aneurysm A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age. 4 Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms. Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following:

- Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back.
- Shortness of breath.
- Trouble breathing or swallowing.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people. 5 Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis, but infection or injury can also cause them. 6 Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following:

- Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side.
- Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs. Other types Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke. Peripheral aneurysms — those found in arteries other than the aorta — can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees.

These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery.

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management recommendations include timing, protocols, resuscitation strategy, referral, and repair modality. We suggest a door-to-intervention time of < 90 minutes, based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. An established protocol for the management of ruptured AAA is essential for optimal outcomes. We recommend implementing hypotensive hemostasis with restriction of fluid resuscitation in the conscious patient. We suggest that patients with ruptured AAA who require transfer for repair be referred to a facility with an established rupture protocol and suitable endovascular resources. If it is anatomically feasible, we recommend EVAR over open repair for treatment of a ruptured AAA.

### The acute abdominal aorta [^9cf16d75]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Acute disorders of the abdominal aorta are potentially lethal conditions that require prompt evaluation and treatment. Computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging method for evaluating these conditions because of its availability and speed. Volumetric CT acquisition with multiplanar reconstruction and three-dimensional analysis is now the standard technique for evaluating the aorta. MR imaging may be useful for select applications in stable patients in whom rupture has been excluded. Imaging is indispensable for diagnosis and treatment planning, because management has shifted toward endoluminal repair. Acute abdominal aortic conditions most commonly are complications of aneurysms and atherosclerosis.

### The hyperattenuating crescent sign is not necessarily a sign of impending aortic aneurysm rupture [^6d0a791d]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The "crescent sign" is a hyperattenuating crescent-shaped region on CT within the mural thrombus or wall of an aortic aneurysm. Although it has previously been associated with aneurysm instability or impending rupture, the literature is largely based on retrospective analyses of urgently repaired aneurysms. We strove to more rigorously assess the association between an isolated "crescent sign" and risk of impending aortic rupture.

Methods

Patients were identified by querying a single health system PACS database for radiology reports noting a crescent sign. Adult patients with a CT demonstrating a descending thoracic, thoracoabdominal, or abdominal aortic aneurysm and "crescent sign" between 2004 and 2019 were included, with exclusion of those showing definitive signs of aortic rupture on imaging.

Results

A total of 82 patients were identified. Aneurysm size was 7.1 ± 2.0 cm. Thirty patients had emergent or urgent repairs during their index admission (37%), 19 had elective repairs at a later date (23%), and 33 patients had no intervention due to either patient choice or prohibitive medical comorbidities (40%). Patients without intervention had a median follow up of 275 days before death or loss to follow up. In patients undergoing elective intervention, 6,968 patient-days elapsed between presentation and repair, with zero episodes of acute rupture (median 105 days). Patients undergoing elective repair had smaller aneurysms compared to those who underwent emergent/urgent repair (6.2 ± 1.3 vs. 7.7 ± 2.1 cm, P = 0.008). No surgical candidate with an aneurysm smaller than 8 cm ruptured. There were 31 patients with previous axial imaging within 2 years prior to presentation with a "crescent sign", with mean aneurysm growth rate of 0.85 ± 0.62 cm per 6 months [median 0.65, range 0–2.6]. Those with aneurysms sized below 5.5 cm displayed decreased aneurysm growth compared to patients with aneurysm's sized 5.5–6.5 cm or patients with aneurysms greater than 6.5 cm (0.12 vs. 0.64 vs. 1.16 cm per 6 months, P = 0.002).

Conclusions

The finding of an isolated radiographic "crescent sign" without other signs of definitive aortic rupture (i.e., hemothorax, aortic wall disruption, retroperitoneal bleeding) is not necessarily an indicator of impending aortic rupture, but may be found in the setting of rapid aneurysm growth. Many factors, including other associated radiographic findings, aneurysm size and growth rate, and patient symptomatology, should guide aneurysm management in these patients. We found that patients with minimal symptoms, aneurysm sizes below 6.5 cm, and no further imaging findings of aneurysm instability, such as periaortic fat stranding, can be successfully managed with elective intervention after optimization of comorbid factors with no evidence of adverse outcomes.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysms in women [^f2edfc06]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms have an incidence that is approximately four to six times higher in men than in women. However, the incidence in women also rises with older age, although starting later in life than in men. There are also sex differences in the risk of rupture and in outcomes after endovascular and open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Various explanations have been proposed. Women historically have been under-represented in clinical trials to evaluate the differences between the sexes. We present a review of current recommendations and recent literature to help identify some of these differences.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture risk by size and evidence base — Historically, the risk of rupture was reported to be 0.5% to 5% for aneurysms ≤ 5 cm in maximum diameter, 3% to 15% for aneurysms 5 cm to 6.9 cm, and ≥ 30% for aneurysms ≥ 8 cm; multiple trials that are now > 2 decades old evaluating early repair for AAAs measuring 4.0 cm to 5.4 cm found no survival benefit but an increased risk of subsequent reintervention; accordingly, a threshold of ≥ 5.5 cm is acceptable for men with infrarenal AAA, women had higher rates of aneurysm rupture and aneurysm-related deaths than men with a mean maximum aneurysm diameter at rupture of 5.0 cm in women and 6.0 cm in men, and in women ASI (aneurysm diameter [cm]/BSA [m2]) has been shown to be more predictive of rupture risk than maximum diameter.

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm — transfer decision-making and intra-transfer management: With the increasing use of endovascular methods to treat patients presenting with a ruptured AAA, vital resources, including advanced imaging, trained staff, and robust endovascular inventory, must be available; in cases in which transfer is not necessary, the vascular team should be notified as soon as a ruptured AAA is suspected, but it may be prudent, however, to transfer a patient to a higher level facility when such resources are unavailable. Patients with good functional status and without severe comorbidity should be transferred without delay, and the urge to offer endovascular repair to patients anatomically unsuitable for such repair should be strongly resisted. Direct physician-to-physician phone handoff is necessary for all patients being transferred; it is imperative that relevant imaging be transmitted, preferably by an electronic method, and patients should receive intravenous nitroglycerin, esmolol, sodium nitroprusside, and pain medication, as needed, to avoid hypertension and to minimize the risk of uncontained rupture. Permissive hypotension is appropriate with limited resuscitation and should be maintained during transfer, and blood products are preferred to treat hypotension, but transfer should not be delayed if blood products are not readily available.

Differential diagnosis

Some of the previously mentioned signs are not entirely specific to impending or complete AAA rupture and can be seen in other pathologies.

Intra- and extraluminal gas seen with aortoenteric fistulas can also be found in infected (mycotic) aneurysms. Such aneurysms often have a more saccular shape and irregular walls that are devoid of calcifications. Occasionally, signs of primary infection sites such as vertebral osteomyelitis, pyelonephritis, or retroperitoneal abscesses may provide clues to the proper diagnosis. Clinically, these patients do not present with gastrointestinal bleeding.

Periaortic stranding can also be seen in inflammatory aneurysms, associated with autoimmune diseases (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis) and retroperitoneal fibrosis. In such cases, the aortic wall is thickened from long standing inflammation. This thickening is outside the intimal calcifications, may enhance with intravenous contrast injection, and frequently has more defined margins than periaortic haematomas. Periaortic fibrosis can extend to adjacent organs, such as the small bowel and ureters. Malignancy, drug toxicity, retroperitroneal injury, and infection are also associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis and need to be included in the differential diagnosis of periaortic fibrosis.

Retroperitoneal haematoma can be the result of haemorrhage secondary to anticoagulation. Such haematomas are often restricted to the posterior pararenal compartment, typically intramuscular within the psoas muscle, or at a distance from the abdominal aorta. A "haematocrit effect" may also be seen as a blood-fluid level. Rarely, haematomas secondary to other vascular injuries in the retroperitoneum, such as rupture of smaller lumbar, renal capsular, or inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries or pseudoaneurysms, can mimic AAA rupture. Analysing the images for other such vascular anomalies, relating the arterial vascular anomalies to the anatomical site of the haematoma, and correlating these to the clinical and previous surgical history can help distinguish AAA rupture from other arterial branch ruptures.

### Does a normal screening ultrasound of the abdominal aorta reduce the likelihood of rupture in emergency department patients? [^d961fb2c]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development is a multifactorial process that is more prevalent among people ≥ 65years of age. Major risk factors are obesity, male sex, history of smoking (at least 100 cigarettes in a person's lifetime), and history of AAA in a first-degree relative. The United States Preventative Task Force has recommended a one-time ultrasound screening for men aged 65-75years. Based on studies, negative results on a single ultrasound examination around the age of 65years appear to virtually exclude the risk for future AAA rupture or death. While ultrasonography (US) is the confirmatory study of choice, computed tomography (CT) can also be used in the diagnosis of AAA. The goal of this study is to determine if AAA rupture can reliably be excluded in individuals with abdominal pain who have had a normal caliber aorta on CT or US after the age of 65years.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective study (approved by institutional review board) of emergency department (ED) patients in an urban academic center was performed. Subjects were included if they met the following criteria: age ≥ 65years; an initial CT or US as an ED patient, inpatient, or outpatient for any indication, which identified an abdominal aorta < 3cm; and a second CT or US during an ED visit. The incidence of ruptured AAA on the second CT or US with a history of normal aortic caliber was identified.

Results

During the study period, 606 subjects were enrolled. Demographic data are listed in Table 1. Three subjects (0.5%) exhibited an abnormal-sized aorta on ED evaluation. None of these three subjects had an AAA intervention. The average size of the abnormal aorta in these three subjects was 3.3cm (S.D. 0.17).

Conclusion

Based on these results, it appears that AAA and rupture may reliably be excluded in ED patients with abdominal pain who have previously had a normal caliber aorta on CT or US after the age of 65years. A prospective, multicenter study would help validate these findings.
