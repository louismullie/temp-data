## Question

Is empagliflozin an appropriate treatment for acute kidney injury?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether empagliflozin is an appropriate treatment for acute kidney injury (AKI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical distinction between treating established AKI versus preventing future AKI or CKD progression. Then, I should verify mechanistic considerations and potential risks if started during AKI. Next, I will check the regulatory label for safety warnings, followed by guideline positions on SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness. After that, I need to examine the clinical trial evidence for AKI treatment versus prevention. Finally, I will weigh risks and benefits, consider special scenarios, and formulate a clear recommendation with next steps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: the question is about using empagliflozin to treat active AKI, not about long-term prevention of AKI or CKD progression, and that distinction is critical because the highest-quality evidence for empagliflozin is in chronic CKD and cardio-renal risk reduction, not in reversing established AKI, and meta-analytic data showing fewer AKI events reflect prevention among chronic users rather than treatment of ongoing AKI [^112kjQJi] [^113pUDCB] [^117AeSck].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic implications of initiating empagliflozin during AKI: SGLT2 inhibition produces osmotic diuresis and can precipitate intravascular volume depletion, which risks worsening pre-renal azotemia or tipping into intrinsic kidney injury if volume is already compromised in AKI, and it also causes an expected early dip in eGFR related to reduced intraglomerular pressure, a hemodynamic change that could confound assessment of renal trajectory during an acute insult; both issues argue against starting it in active AKI where immediate hemodynamic stabilization is the priority [^114GKRu7] [^114Jfkh7] [^112kfe8r].

> I need to check the regulatory stance next: the FDA labeling for empagliflozin (and combination products) highlights postmarketing reports of AKI, emphasizes increased risk in patients with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², the elderly, or those on loop diuretics, and instructs clinicians to assess and correct volume status before initiation and to monitor renal function after starting therapy, all of which underscore caution and do not support initiating therapy during an active AKI episode [^114GKRu7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm guideline recommendations during acute illness: KDIGO 2024 advises withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical illness when ketosis risk is higher, and the UK Kidney Association 2023 explicitly recommends temporarily withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness, which by extension includes most AKI presentations; initially I thought this implied a formal contraindication to initiation, but more precisely, guidelines direct temporary withholding rather than absolute contraindication, still signaling that starting in active AKI is inappropriate [^112SxcxZ] [^115nTXzm].

> Next, I should review what the trials actually show about AKI: meta-analyses of cardiovascular and kidney outcome trials report fewer AKI events with SGLT2 inhibitors, but these reflect incident AKI prevention in chronic users, not treatment of established AKI, and acute-setting trials such as EMPULSE (initiated in acute heart failure) and EMPACT-MI (post–myocardial infarction) suggest early initiation can be safe and reduce HF events in selected hospitalized populations, yet these studies did not test empagliflozin as a therapy to reverse ongoing AKI and often excluded or minimized those with severe acute kidney dysfunction, so they cannot be extrapolated to treating AKI itself [^111ohiNz] [^114xGfzL] [^117V8BKX] [^116dTxPJ].

> I will now examine the risk–benefit balance during active AKI: there is no evidence of efficacy for AKI reversal with empagliflozin, while potential harms include volume depletion in already tenuous hemodynamics and an initial eGFR dip that can obscure early recovery or be misinterpreted as deterioration; by contrast, the proven kidney benefits in CKD emerge over weeks to months through hemodynamic and structural remodeling and are not designed for the acute phase of kidney injury when the priorities are perfusion optimization and removal of nephrotoxins [^114GKRu7] [^113pUDCB] [^114Jfkh7].

> But wait, what if the AKI occurs in a cardiorenal syndrome context or around contrast administration or surgery; let me consider special scenarios: even in acute decompensated heart failure, guidance supports holding SGLT2 inhibitors until hemodynamic stability is achieved, and perioperative/critical illness guidance similarly supports temporary withholding; for contrast-associated AKI, best-practice recommendations emphasize volume expansion with isotonic fluids rather than SGLT2 initiation, and there is no evidence base to support empagliflozin for prophylaxis or treatment in these settings [^112SxcxZ] [^114DRcpn] [^114DRcpn].

> I should double-check the labeled indications to avoid scope creep: empagliflozin is indicated for CKD progression risk reduction, heart failure, and glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, but not for treatment of AKI, which aligns with the absence of therapeutic AKI data and with guidance to withhold during acute illness [^115yzbag] [^116EW1mJ].

> Finalizing the recommendation, I need to ensure the management pathway is clear: empagliflozin should not be initiated to treat AKI and should be withheld during AKI episodes while focusing on standard AKI care such as restoring effective arterial blood volume, stopping nephrotoxins, and treating the precipitating cause; once renal function stabilizes and volume status is optimized, reassessing and (re)initiating empagliflozin for its proven chronic kidney and cardiovascular benefits is reasonable under guideline-directed care with appropriate monitoring [^115nTXzm] [^112SxcxZ] [^112kjQJi] [^117AeSck].

Empagliflozin is not indicated for treating or preventing acute kidney injury (AKI) [^115yzbag] and should be withheld during acute illness or AKI [^112SxcxZ] because of the risk of volume depletion [^114GKRu7] and a transient eGFR decline [^113pUDCB]. While SGLT2 inhibitors reduce AKI risk in chronic kidney disease and heart failure populations [^117AeSck] [^114xGfzL], there is no evidence to support initiation during AKI [^115nTXzm]. If AKI occurs, stop empagliflozin [^114GKRu7], correct volume status, and monitor renal function; restart only after recovery and stabilization [^115nTXzm].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms relevant to AKI

Empagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the proximal tubule, reducing glucose and sodium reabsorption and thereby increasing natriuresis and osmotic diuresis [^112kfe8r]. This can cause intravascular volume depletion [^114GKRu7] and a transient eGFR decline [^113pUDCB], especially in patients with impaired renal function, older adults, or those on loop diuretics. These hemodynamic effects are typically reversible on discontinuation [^112kfe8r].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding AKI risk

### Clinical trials and observational studies

- **EMPA-KIDNEY trial**: In CKD patients (with or without diabetes), empagliflozin reduced kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death [^112kjQJi], with a small, reversible initial eGFR dip [^113pUDCB] and no excess serious renal adverse events.

- **EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial**: In T2DM with cardiovascular disease, empagliflozin reduced incident or worsening nephropathy [^116BsyB6] and slowed eGFR decline, with a transient initial eGFR dip that stabilized over time [^112MVzQg].

- **Meta-analyses**: SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a lower AKI risk versus placebo or other glucose-lowering drugs [^111ohiNz] (HR ~0.66–0.76) [^114xGfzL].

---

### Post-marketing surveillance

Post-marketing surveillance has prompted FDA warnings [^114GKRu7] regarding AKI with empagliflozin, sometimes requiring hospitalization or dialysis, with risk higher in patients with impaired renal function, older adults, or those on loop diuretics [^116EW1mJ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not recommend empagliflozin for AKI treatment or prevention [^115yzbag]; they emphasize withholding during acute illness or AKI and careful monitoring. Specific guidance includes KDIGO 2024, which recommends withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical illness due to ketosis risk [^112SxcxZ], and the UK Kidney Association 2023, which advises temporarily stopping SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness while interpreting early eGFR declines cautiously as expected drug effects [^115nTXzm].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations

Empagliflozin is not recommended for AKI treatment or prevention in any clinical scenario [^115yzbag]. It is, however, beneficial in CKD and heart failure populations for reducing kidney disease progression [^112kjQJi] and cardiovascular events [^112kfe8r], with a favorable AKI safety profile in these settings [^117AeSck].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

When using empagliflozin in patients at risk of AKI, clinicians should:

- **Assess volume status**: Correct volume depletion before initiation [^114GKRu7].

- **Monitor renal function**: Check renal function after initiation and during therapy, especially in high-risk patients [^114GKRu7].

- **Withhold during acute illness**: Temporarily stop during acute illness, surgery, or critical illness [^115nTXzm] [^112SxcxZ].

- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Watch for volume depletion, hypotension, and urinary tract infections [^114GKRu7].

### Acute kidney injury with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors: A meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials [^111ohiNz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Three multicenter, large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cardiovascular outcomes with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have each shown substantial reductions in rates of hospitalization for heart failure and progression of chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes. However, safety concerns remain for this ostensibly paradigm-shifting drug class. In particular, the US Food and Drug Administration has highlighted the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), a condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. To investigate this further, we conducted a meta-analysis of the three trials to compare the frequency of AKI adverse event reports between participants treated with placebo and those who had received an SGLT2 inhibitor.

Rather than an increase, we noted a consistent and robust reduction in the likelihood of AKI among those participants who had been randomized to receive an SGLT2 inhibitor (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.54–0.80). We further noted that the reports of AKI were similar in frequency to those of kidney disease progression. The caveats of the non-adjudicated reporting of AKI in the trials notwithstanding, these data suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors may protect vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes from AKI and that prospective studies to evaluate this additional aspect of kidney protection are warranted.

### Synjardy [^114GKRu7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Volume depletion**: Empagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating Synjardy or Synjardy XR in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. In patients with volume depletion, correct this condition before initiating Synjardy or Synjardy XR. Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion and renal function after initiating therapy.

- **Urosepsis and pyelonephritis**: There have been reports of serious urinary tract infections, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving empagliflozin. Treatment with empagliflozin increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Hypoglycemia**: Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. In adult patients, the risk of hypoglycemia may be increased when Synjardy or Synjardy XR is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g. sulfonylurea) or insulin.

### Network meta-analysis of novel glucose-lowering drugs on risk of acute kidney injury [^114xGfzL]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Little is known about the comparative effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). This study aimed to compare the effects of these three novel classes of glucose-lowering drugs on AKI risk in patients with or without type 2 diabetes through a network meta-analysis of event-driven cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: We systematically searched electronic databases up to September 2020 and included 20 event-driven cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials (18 trials included patients with type 2 diabetes only, and two trials included patients with or without type 2 diabetes). A network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach was performed to compare the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1RAs, or SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of AKI and estimate the probability for each intervention as the safest one. The primary analysis included 18 trials with type 2 diabetes only, and a secondary analysis included 20 trials.

- **Results**: In the 18 trials with a total of 2,051 AKI events (range: 1–300) among 156,690 patients with type 2 diabetes only, our network meta-analysis showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a lower risk of AKI compared with placebo (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.88), whereas both DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs had neutral effects on the risk of AKI. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors were significantly associated with a lower risk in AKI than both GLP-1RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors.

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: A prespecified secondary analysis from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^114Jfkh7]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Our analyses show that in this cohort of patients with CKD at risk of progression, allocation to empagliflozin causes a small dip in kidney function of approximately 2 mL/min/1.73 m² (or 6%) and then halves the subsequent rate of long-term loss of kidney function. This overall result complements the 29% (95% CI 19–38%) reduction in risk of kidney disease progression when assessed with the categorical composite outcome of end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decrease from baseline in eGFR of at least 40% or to less than 10 mL/min/1.73 m², or death from kidney failure.

The beneficial effects of empagliflozin on the progression of CKD varied by diabetes status and eGFR, but most prominently by albuminuria, where relative benefits may in fact be larger among participants with lower albuminuria. These findings are consistent with observations in other trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD, although these trials focused on patients with diabetes and/or with significant levels of albuminuria. The broad range of patients included in the large EMPA-KIDNEY trial has allowed this to be explored in a more diverse population than those included in other large trials of SGLT2 inhibition in CKD. In particular, EMPA-KIDNEY included participants with eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m² and with uACR < 200 mg/g who were excluded from these previous trials and consequently their analysis of eGFR slopes.

### Effects of empagliflozin on quality of life and healthcare use and costs in chronic kidney disease: a health economic analysis of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^111GBVir]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but there is no randomized evidence of their effects on health-related quality of life (QoL) and healthcare use. We explored the effects of empagliflozin on health-related QoL, healthcare use, and UK healthcare costs in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial.

- **Methods**: EMPA-KIDNEY, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, was conducted at 241 centers in eight countries (Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the UK, and the United States). It included participants aged 18 years or older with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or with an eGFR of 45 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) of ≥ 200 mg/g at screening. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg once daily or matching placebo. We estimated the effect of empagliflozin (£1.31/day) on exploratory outcomes of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), UK costs (2023 £) of hospital admissions (a pre-specified secondary outcome), concomitant medications, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD; a pre-specified tertiary outcome) management over 2 years on study treatment (median active-trial follow-up) and on ESKD costs over 2 further years off study treatment (median post-trial follow-up) using shared parameter models analyzing outcomes together with time to death or negative binomial models. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03594110.

- **Findings**: Between May 15, 2019, and April [further details omitted].

### Secondary analysis of the EMPACT-MI trial reveals cardiovascular-kidney efficacy and safety of empagliflozin after acute myocardial infarction [^116dTxPJ]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

In EMPACT-MI (Study to Evaluate the Effect of Empagliflozin on Hospitalization for Heart Failure and Mortality in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction), the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced heart failure (HF) events among patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and an increased risk for HF, although without improvement in all-cause mortality. Patients with acute MI have a high burden of kidney dysfunction, with about 40% having chronic kidney disease (CKD) and high rates of acute decompensated HF.

Data regarding the cardiovascular-kidney efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with acute MI with variable kidney function are limited. DAPA-MI (Dapagliflozin Effects on Cardiometabolic Outcomes in Patients With an Acute Heart Attack) was the only other clinical trial to evaluate SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with acute MI, but it had limited enrollment of patients with kidney dysfunction, few HF events, and did not assess kidney outcomes. Studies of patients with HF have shown the benefit and safety of initiating SGLT2 inhibitors early, among many patients at index hospital admission, but have not assessed the safety in patients with acute MI. It is especially important to understand this safety profile among patients with acute MI because these individuals have high risk for acute kidney injuries (AKIs), substantial risk for volume depletion or hypotension, and regular exposure to kidney stressors, such as contrast for imaging or cardiac catheterization or kidney-function-altering medications.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^117NHFcY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Slowing chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and avoiding end-stage kidney disease (ESKD, i.e. the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation) is highly desirable, given the associated adverse effects on quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and high economic costs. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was established to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition with empagliflozin in a broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression. Findings from the active part of this trial and other large trials provided compelling evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors substantially slowed kidney disease progression and reduced cardiovascular risk. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and acute kidney injury in patients with CKD and other high-risk conditions, including diabetes and heart failure.

Post-trial follow-up tests how benefits evolve once participants stop the study drug, as it is possible that additional cardiorenal benefits or harms could emerge after its discontinuation. Our trial was relatively short, as it was stopped early for efficacy following a median of two years of follow-up. Consequently, there were a lower number of primary outcomes in participants who progressed more slowly, and a low number of ESKD and fatal outcomes. Post-trial follow-up provides particular value through prospectively collecting more ESKD outcomes, as these outcomes take longer to accrue than surrogates of progression, such as percentage declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We now report the effects.

### Empagliflozin and progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes [^116BsyB6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes confers an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal events. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. We wanted to determine the long-term renal effects of empagliflozin, an analysis that was a prespecified component of the secondary microvascular outcome of that trial.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area to receive either empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo once daily. Prespecified renal outcomes included incident or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of the serum creatinine level, initiation of renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal disease) and incident albuminuria.

- **Results**: Incident or worsening nephropathy occurred in 525 of 4124 patients (12.7%) in the empagliflozin group and in 388 of 2061 (18.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.70; P < 0.001). Doubling of the serum creatinine level occurred in 70 of 4645 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin group and in 60 of 2323 (2.6%) in the placebo group, a significant relative risk reduction of 44%. Renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 13 of 4687 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin group and in 14 of 2333 patients (0.6%) in the placebo group, representing a 55% reduction in the empagliflozin group.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113fj2jE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Empagliflozin exerted positive cardiorenal effects in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial; this study reports active trial plus post-trial data. In this trial, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 20- < 45 or 45- < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of ≥ 200 mg/g received either empagliflozin 10 mg daily or a matching placebo for a median of two years. Subsequently, surviving participants who consented were observed post-trial for two additional years. No study drug was issued in the post-trial period, but local doctors could prescribe SGLT2 inhibitors. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death assessed from the start of the active trial to the end of the post-trial period.

Of the 6609 randomized participants, 4891 (74%) entered the post-trial period, during which SGLT2 inhibitor use was similar between the groups (empagliflozin group 43% vs. placebo 40%). Over the entirety of follow-up, from study initiation to the end of post-trial observation, a primary outcome occurred in 865 of 3304 participants (26.2%) in the empagliflozin group and in 1001 of 3305 participants (30.3%) in the placebo group (HR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.72–0.87). There was a 13% (0.87, 0.76–0.99) reduction in the risk of the primary outcome during the post-trial period in the empagliflozin group. Compared with placebo, original allocation to empagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney disease progression (23.5% vs. 27.1%), the composite of death or end-stage kidney disease (16.9% vs. 19.6%), and cardiovascular death (3.8% vs. 4.9%). There was no effect on non-cardiovascular death (5.3% vs. 5.3%).

### In CKD, empagliflozin reduced kidney disease progression at a median 2 y, regardless of primary kidney disease type [^11651NTm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The EMPA-KIDNEY Collaborative Group conducted a study to evaluate the impact of primary kidney disease on the effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease. Secondary analyses of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial demonstrated that empagliflozin effectively reduced the progression of kidney disease over a median of two years. This outcome was consistent regardless of the type of primary kidney disease.

### SPL drug information for empagliflozin [^115yzbag]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Labeled indications for Empagliflozin (also known as Jardiance) include the treatment of heart failure in adults to reduce cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalization. It is also indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in adults to reduce the decline in renal function, progression to end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure hospitalization. Additionally, it is used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 in adults with cardiovascular disease to reduce cardiovascular mortality. For adults, it supports glycemic control in diabetes mellitus type 2 and is also prescribed for diabetes mellitus type 2 in children aged 10 years and older.

### SGLT2 inhibition in chronic kidney disease: a preventive strategy against acute kidney injury at the same time [^115SB6bf]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are known to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. However, theoretical concerns still exist that SGLT2 inhibitors could increase the risk of acute kidney injury. Heerspink et al. revealed that dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of abrupt declines in kidney function during the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial. Their findings may serve to reassure clinicians prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors to patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes [^112B4tCc]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, the DC 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors with proven renal benefits, such as empagliflozin or canagliflozin, to reduce the risk of progression of nephropathy. This is advised for adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who also have clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², if glycemic targets are not achieved with existing antihyperglycemic medications.

Randomized trials of SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have consistently shown that this class of treatment reduces the risk of progression of kidney disease, measured with dichotomous outcomes, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with or without diabetes, irrespective of the underlying primary kidney disease. Secondary analyses of two previous trials of SGLT2i in CKD populations found some evidence that the effects of SGLT2i on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope varied in different types of patients. However, because the trials only recruited patients with significant albuminuria, they were limited in their ability to explore whether this effect varied according to baseline albuminuria as well as other clinical characteristics. Here, we present the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on the eGFR slope from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, which recruited a uniquely broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression, including those with minimal albuminuria, low eGFR, and both with and without diabetes.

### Short commentary on empagliflozin and its potential clinical impact [^116Kv8EB]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of drugs developed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They target the kidney by reducing renal glucose reabsorption and promoting urinary glucose excretion, which reduces hyperglycemia in individuals with T2DM. The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin has gained approval in the EU and the United States for the treatment of adults with T2DM (there is no indication for type 1 diabetes). Empagliflozin has shown a good efficacy and safety profile from clinical trials when given as monotherapy, and as an add-on therapy to other glucose-lowering agents. This short commentary reviews the key efficacy and safety data from empagliflozin phase III trials and examines the potential role this agent may have in the management of T2DM.

### Cardiac and kidney benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure across the spectrum of kidney function: Insights from EMPEROR-Reduced [^112kfe8r]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Potential mechanisms for the kidney benefits of SGLT2 inhibition include a reduction in single nephron hyperfiltration, decreased tubulointerstitial damage, suppression of hyperglycemia-induced production of reactive oxygen species and angiotensinogen, reduction of mitochondrial damage, and enhanced nutrient deprivation signaling. The latter mechanism may explain why empagliflozin increased hemoglobin and reduced the proportion of patients with anemia, irrespective of the presence or absence of CKD at baseline.

Despite an expected higher rate of adverse events in patients with CKD, there were no excess adverse events in patients receiving empagliflozin compared to patients receiving placebo, across all categories of kidney function. The initial dip in eGFR seen more commonly in empagliflozin-treated patients was not associated with an excess risk of investigator-reported acute kidney injury, regardless of the presence or absence of CKD. The rapid increase in eGFR seen when empagliflozin was withdrawn at the end of the trial indicates that the initial dip in eGFR represents a reversible functional change in intrarenal hemodynamics, which is seen in patients with and without CKD. This initial decline in eGFR did not prevent empagliflozin from exerting its long-term beneficial effects on heart failure events or on kidney function.

- **Limitations**: Several limitations should be highlighted in this study. Although this was a prespecified secondary analysis, EMPEROR-Reduced was not powered to assess the effect of empagliflozin in subgroups such as CKD, much less to assess the effects.

### Empagliflozin improves kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure [^112MVzQg]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). High credibility.

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients), empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. Post hoc, we evaluated empagliflozin on kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure (HF).

- **Methods and results**: Individuals were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or a placebo. Prespecified analyses by baseline HF status included the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy and estimated glomerular filtration rate slope analyses. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the consistency of treatment effects across subgroups. Safety evaluations included kidney-related adverse events.

At baseline, 244 (10.5%) and 462 (9.9%) patients had HF in the placebo and empagliflozin groups, respectively. Overall, the incidence of kidney outcome events was numerically higher in patients with HF than those without HF. In the HF group, empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy or cardiovascular death by 43% (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42–0.77]) and reduced progression to macroalbuminuria by 50% (hazard ratio, 0.50 [0.33–0.75]). After an initial transient decrease, the estimated glomerular filtration rate stabilized over time with empagliflozin but gradually declined with placebo. Kidney effects in patients with HF were consistent with those in the overall study population (all P values for interaction > 0.05). Across groups, the incidence rate of kidney-related adverse events per 100 patient-years was higher in patients with HF.

### Effects of empagliflozin on the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease: an exploratory analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^115bwJby]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). High credibility.

In a pooled analysis of short-term trials, short-term treatment with the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and prevalent albuminuria. In this exploratory analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, we report the short-term and long-term effects of empagliflozin on albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease according to patients' baseline albuminuria status.

- **Methods**: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 590 sites in 42 countries, we randomly assigned patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (1:1:1) to empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo in addition to standard of care until at least 691 patients experienced an adjudicated event included in the primary outcome. We conducted the randomisation with a computer-generated random-sequence and interactive voice-response and web-response system, stratified by HbA1c, BMI, region, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients, investigators, and individuals involved in analysis of trial data were masked to treatment assignment. The primary and secondary efficacy and safety endpoints of this trial have been reported previously. Here, we report urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) data for the pooled empagliflozin group versus placebo according to albuminuria status at baseline (normoalbuminuria: UACR 300 mg/g).

### Effects of empagliflozin on fluid overload, weight, and blood pressure in CKD [^11433QbH]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

EMPA-KIDNEY demonstrated the clear benefits of SGLT2 inhibition on kidney disease progression in a wide range of patients with CKD at risk of progression, including about a one-third reduction in the risk of needing to start kidney replacement therapy. This large EMPA-KIDNEY substudy benefits from its sample size, long duration, systematic measurements, and randomized double-blind design. These factors help ensure that between-group differences are unbiased and reliable.

The BCM device has some technical limitations. For example, BCM parameters are derived, not direct measurements, and are based on formulas normalized to healthy reference populations. Estimations may also be less accurate at extremes of "fluid overload", although extremes of levels were uncommon in the substudy population. Furthermore, imprecision in fat mass estimates means that the lack of statistical effect on fat mass does not exclude some effect. The BCM device also does not reliably assess subtypes of adiposity (e.g. visceral versus peripheral).

Follow-up was affected by coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions, resulting in some missed bioimpedance measurements. Additionally, the prespecified key secondary composite analysis was underpowered because of lower cardiovascular risk in the trial population than was predicted during its design. Nevertheless, this substudy collected sufficient data to provide reliable and clear results for the primary and other continuously measured outcomes.

Owing to the regions contributing to the substudy, Asian, Black, Mixed, and Other races were underrepresented, but effects on weight were not significantly impacted.

### Acute kidney injury in patients on SGLT2 inhibitors: A propensity-matched analysis [^116GQcvS]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are new medications that improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the Food and Drug Administration has issued alerts regarding an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) with canagliflozin and dapagliflozin. This study aimed to assess the real-world risk of AKI in new SGLT2 inhibitor users within two large healthcare utilization cohorts of patients with T2D.

- **Research design and methods**: Longitudinal data from the Mount Sinai chronic kidney disease registry and the Geisinger Health System cohort were utilized. The study selected SGLT2 inhibitor users and nonusers (patients with T2D without SGLT2 inhibitor prescription). AKI was determined by the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) definition. The study conducted 1:1 nearest-neighbor propensity matching and calculated unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and adjusted HRs (aHRs; accounting for covariates poorly balanced) for AKI in primary and sensitivity analyses.

- **Results**: In the Mount Sinai cohort, 377 SGLT2 inhibitor users and 377 nonusers were identified, with AKI KDIGO events occurring in 3.8% and 9.7% of cases, respectively, over a median follow-up time of 14 months. The unadjusted hazards of AKI KDIGO were 60% lower in users (HR 0.4 [95% CI 0.2–0.7]; P = 0.01), which remained unchanged post-adjustment (aHR 0.4 [95% CI 0.2–0.7]; P = 0.004). Similarly, in the Geisinger cohort, 1,207 SGLT2 inhibitor users and 1,207 nonusers were identified, with 2.2% and 4.6% having an AKI KDIGO event. AKI KDIGO unadjusted hazards were lower in users (HR 0.5 [95% CI 0…

### The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: A bench to bedside review [^1155UDvp]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Additional trials addressing the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of empagliflozin in patients with either renal or hepatic impairment have recently been reported. An open-label trial grouped 40 patients by estimated glomerular filtration rate to study the impact of renal impairment on the PK/PD profile of a single dose of empagliflozin 50 mg. In patients with renal impairment, peak plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were similar to those with normal renal function. Compared to patients with normal renal function, total plasma exposure (area under the concentration–time curve from zero to infinity) and the maximum plasma concentration (C max) were modestly increased, most likely owing to decreased renal clearance of the drug. Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment had slightly decreased urinary glucose excretion (UGE) compared with patients with normal renal function; those with severe impairment or renal failure had lower UGE. This suggests that while empagliflozin may be used without dose adjustments in patients with any degree of renal impairment, reductions in plasma glucose levels would be predicted to be less clinically meaningful for those with severe renal impairment.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, KDIGO 2020 guidelines recommend considering the addition of an SGLT-2 inhibitor to other antihyperglycemic medications. This applies to patients who are not meeting glycemic targets or those meeting glycemic targets but can safely achieve a lower target.

### Insights from CREDENCE trial indicate an acute drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate during treatment with canagliflozin with implications for clinical practice [^113p1Ukb]. Kidney International (2021). Low credibility.

Canagliflozin slows the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and induces a reversible acute drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), believed to be a hemodynamic effect. Predictors of the initial drop and its association with long-term eGFR trajectories and safety outcomes are unknown.

To assess this, we performed a post-hoc analysis of 4,289 participants in the CREDENCE trial with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, equally split into treatment and placebo groups, who had eGFR measured at both baseline and week three. The eGFR was categorized at week three as greater than a 10% decline, between 0 and 10% decline, and no decline. Long-term eGFR trajectories and safety outcomes were estimated in each category of acute eGFR change by linear mixed-effects models and Cox regression after adjustment for baseline characteristics and medication use.

Significantly more participants in the canagliflozin group (45%) compared to the placebo group (21%) experienced an acute drop in eGFR of over 10%. An over 30% drop occurred infrequently (4% of participants with canagliflozin and 2% with placebo). The odds ratio for a drop in eGFR over 10% with canagliflozin compared to placebo was significant at 3.03 (95% confidence interval 2.65, 3.47).

Following the initial drop in eGFR, multivariable adjusted long-term eGFR trajectories, as well as overall and kidney safety profiles, in those treated with canagliflozin were similar across eGFR decline categories. Thus, although acute drops in eGFR over 10% occurred in nearly half of all participants, follow-up safety profiles remained consistent across different levels of eGFR decline.

### Shifts in KDIGO CKD risk groups with empagliflozin: Kidney-protection from SGLT2 inhibition across the spectrum of risk [^113VqNFq]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2023). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a well-established risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend categorizing risk based on the likelihood of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Compared to placebo, empagliflozin decreases the likelihood of worsening (odds ratio [OR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–0.78) and increases the likelihood of improvement (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30–1.86) in KDIGO risk category.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: Which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future [^112RswSU]? Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial was designed to specifically address this evidence gap. The trial demonstrated that an SGLT2 inhibitor, canagliflozin, substantially reduced the progression of DKD (doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, or cardiovascular or kidney-related death) in participants with T2DM and severely increased albuminuria who were already receiving RAS blockade. Indeed, CREDENCE demonstrated, for the first time ever, that a single intervention reduced the need for dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease in its own right. A 2019 meta-analysis synthesizing the accumulated trial evidence provided further strong support for the role of SGLT2 inhibition for kidney protection in people with T2DM, and that the combination of RAS blockade and SGLT2 inhibition should be routinely offered to patients with T2DM who have, or are at high risk of, progressive kidney disease, with the strongest evidence for canagliflozin.

In the face of these clear and substantial benefits for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, a number of other important questions remain. Who might benefit most from treatment? How should this evidence be applied in routine practice to maximize benefits and ensure potential harms are minimized? Are there other patient groups, aside from those with T2DM, who may benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors? Finally, how should these agents be used in combination with other currently available and future treatments?

Some of these issues, including SGLT2 inhibition in people with…

### Influence of endpoint definitions on the effect of empagliflozin on major renal outcomes in the EMPEROR-Preserved trial [^116LPnFW]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

Our results indicate that the definition of a major renal outcome can influence conclusions concerning the effect of a treatment on the progression of kidney disease in patients with heart failure. In the EMPEROR-Preserved trial, we found a discordance between the effects of empagliflozin on heart failure hospitalizations and renal outcomes using the EMPEROR definition of a kidney event. However, we noted a concordance between the heart failure and renal effects of SGLT2 inhibition (overall and in prespecified subgroups) when we used a more conventional definition, which is closely aligned with observations of the effects of these drugs in large-scale trials in type 2 diabetes. Further exploration of these findings is warranted.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^1128WzLB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

The primary outcome of EMPA-KIDNEY incorporates a ≥ 40% decline in eGFR from the randomization value in the trial definition of kidney disease progression, compared with the larger ≥ 50% decline in eGFR pre-specified by DAPA-CKD and the doubling of creatinine (effectively a ≥ 57% decline in eGFR) used in CREDENCE. EMPA-KIDNEY employed such a definition as it aimed to recruit a large proportion of people with low levels of albuminuria and without diabetes mellitus (DM) who are predicted to progress more slowly than people with albuminuric diabetic CKD. Smaller percentage declines in eGFR ensure such individuals contribute to the primary outcome.

However, when testing interventions that may cause an acute initial decline in eGFR (such as SGLT-2 inhibitors), smaller percentage declines in eGFR may be a less specific surrogate of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) than larger percentage declines. The EMPA-KIDNEY data analysis plan has, therefore, pre-specified exploratory analyses of the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on a composite of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death using alternative eGFR thresholds. This approach allows for some harmonization across the three trials.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111tPVXR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, demonstrated positive cardiorenal effects in patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression. Post-trial follow-up was designed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin would evolve after the discontinuation of the trial drug.

- **Methods**: In the active trial, patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or a matching placebo and were followed for a median of 2 years. All patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Subsequently, surviving patients who consented were observed for an additional 2 years. No trial empagliflozin or placebo was administered during the post-trial period, but local practitioners could prescribe open-label SGLT2 inhibitors, including open-label empagliflozin. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death, assessed from the start of the active-trial period to the end of the post-trial period.

- **Results**: Of the 6609 patients who had undergone randomization in the active trial, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial period. During this period, the use of open-label SGLT2 inhibitors was similar in the two groups (43% in the empagliflozin group and 43% in the placebo group).

The study provides valuable insights into the long-term effects of empagliflozin in managing chronic kidney disease.

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin added to existing antidiabetes treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115gRbL1]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Optimum glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is important to minimize the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and to slow the progression of CKD. We assessed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

- **Methods**: We conducted a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial at 127 centres in 15 countries. Patients with HbA1c of 7% or greater to 10% or less were eligible for inclusion. Patients with stage 2 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min per 1.73 m²; n = 290) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. Patients with stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²; n = 374) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo for 52 weeks. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated random sequence and stratified by renal impairment, HbA1c, and background antidiabetes medication. Treatment assignment was masked from patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 measured by ANCOVA in the full analysis set.

- **Findings**: In patients with stage 2 CKD, adjusted mean treatment differences versus placebo in changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 were -0.52% (95% CI -0.72 to -0.32) for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.68% (-0.88 to -0.49) for empagliflozin 25 mg.

### Impact of diabetes on the effects of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes: collaborative meta-analysis of large placebo-controlled trials [^117AeSck]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Based on the average risk in different trial populations, we estimated that for every 1000 patients with chronic kidney disease treated for one year with an SGLT2 inhibitor, 11 first kidney disease progression events would be prevented in patients with diabetes, and 15 would be prevented in patients without diabetes. In these patients, such treatment also appeared to result in an estimated four to five fewer acute kidney injury events in patients with and without diabetes. Individual trials have shown that kidney benefits translate into important reductions in the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation, and the cardiovascular and kidney benefits appear to be cost-saving in diabetic chronic kidney disease. We found no good evidence that the kidney benefits were modified by the average level of kidney function studied in the trials. Importantly, efficacy and safety data from EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD combined include information on nearly 3000 patients with an eGFR of 20–30 mL/min per 1.73 m². A total of 489 kidney disease progression outcomes accrued in those with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² in those two trials. Although some clinical practice guidelines have started recommending use of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes at eGFRs down to 20 mL/min per 1.73 m² (based on grade B levels of evidence), many other recommendations limit initiation to those with eGFR greater than 25 mL/min per 1.73 m² or 30 mL/min per 1.73 m². As patients with decreased eGFR are at the highest absolute risk of kidney disease progression, our findings should encourage the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in appropriate patients.

### Secondary analysis of the EMPACT-MI trial reveals cardiovascular-kidney efficacy and safety of empagliflozin after acute myocardial infarction [^113mavoz]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

Data on the cardiovascular-kidney effects and safety of empagliflozin among patients with acute myocardial infarction are limited. EMPACT-MI (Study to Evaluate the Effect of Empagliflozin on Hospitalization for Heart Failure and Mortality in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction) was a double-blind, multicenter clinical trial that randomized 6,522 patients with acute myocardial infarction and risk for heart failure to empagliflozin or placebo. Here we show in this secondary analysis that the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate at baseline was 76.1 ml/min/1.73 m² (s.d. = 19.9 ml/min/1.73 m²), with longitudinal kidney function data available for 1,152 (17.7%) treated patients from select countries. By 24 months, compared with baseline, the estimated glomerular filtration rate was similar in the empagliflozin group but declined in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Empagliflozin reduced the total adverse events of heart failure or all-cause mortality irrespective of kidney function (P interaction = 0.30). Thirty-day adverse event rates were similar by treatment group and consistent across baseline kidney function. Empagliflozin had kidney-protective effects, reduced heart failure outcomes, and was safe to initiate soon after acute myocardial infarction across baseline kidney function.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^116fRnrN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The EMPA-KIDNEY trial aimed to randomize approximately 6000 people with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) to receive either empagliflozin 10 mg daily or a matching placebo. The objective was to assess empagliflozin's effect on the time to the primary composite outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death. Kidney disease progression is defined as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), renal death, a sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to less than 10 mL/min/1.73 m², or a ≥ 40% eGFR decline from randomization.

- **Key secondary aims**: Assess the effect of empagliflozin on time to hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death, occurrences of hospitalizations from any cause, and time to death from any cause. Other assessments include analyses of safety and biochemical effects.

- **Study design characteristics**: EMPA-KIDNEY's design is streamlined to minimize work for collaborating sites, collecting only essential information. The trial focuses on readily identifiable and important clinical outcomes. Data collection relies mainly on participant-reported information recorded at interviews directly into a bespoke web-based system and centrally measured serum creatinine.

### Empagliflozin and cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across KDIGO risk categories: Analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial [^112V86o4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

In the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG Outcome), empagliflozin, in addition to standard care, significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 38%, hospitalization for heart failure by 35%, and incident or worsening nephropathy by 39% compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Using EMPA-REG Outcome data, researchers assessed whether the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD classification influenced the treatment effect of empagliflozin.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Patients with type 2 diabetes, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to the standard care. Post hoc, cardiovascular and kidney outcomes and safety were analyzed using the two-dimensional KDIGO classification framework.

- **Results**: Of 6,952 patients with baseline eGFR and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio values, 47%, 29%, 15%, and 8% were classified into low, moderately increased, high, and very high KDIGO risk categories, respectively. Empagliflozin showed consistent risk reductions across KDIGO categories for cardiovascular outcomes (p-values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.26 to 0.85) and kidney outcomes (p-values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.16 to 0.60). In all KDIGO risk categories, placebo and empagliflozin had similar advantages.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the risk of acute kidney injury in older adults with type 2 diabetes [^112bvvTt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been found to have many benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, whether SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) remains unknown. We examined the association of AKI hospitalization with prior initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor compared with initiation of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) among older adults with type 2 diabetes in routine practice.

- **Study design**: Population-based cohort study.

- **Setting & participants**: Older adults aged at least 66 years with type 2 diabetes enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service and who were new users of SGLT2 inhibitor, DPP-4 inhibitor, or GLP-1RA agents in the interval from March 2013 to December 2017.

- **Exposures**: New use of an SGLT2 inhibitor versus new use of a DPP-4 inhibitor or GLP-1RA.

- **Outcome**: The primary outcome was hospitalization for AKI, defined as a discharge diagnosis of AKI in the primary or secondary position.

- **Analytical approach**: New users of SGLT2 inhibitors were matched at a 1:1 ratio to new users of DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1RAs using propensity scores in two pairwise comparisons. Cox proportional hazards regression models generated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs in propensity score-matched groups.

- **Results**: Totals of 68,130 and 71,477 new users of SGLT2 inhibitors were matched to new users of DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1RAs, respectively. Overall, the mean age of study participants was 72 years. The risk of AKI was lower in the SGLT2 inhibitor group.

The effects of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin on renal and cardiovascular disease have not been tested in a dedicated population of people with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

- **Methods**: The EMPA-KIDNEY trial is an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing whether empagliflozin 10 mg daily decreases the risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death in people with CKD. People with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) were eligible provided they had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 20 but < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or an eGFR ≥ 45 but < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR) ≥ 200 mg/g. The trial design is streamlined, as extra work for collaborating sites is kept to a minimum, and only essential information is collected.

- **Results**: Between 15 May 2019 and 16 April 2021, 6609 people from eight countries in Europe, North America, and East Asia were randomized. The mean age at randomization was 63.8 years (standard deviation [SD] 13.9); 2192 (33%) were female, and 3570 (54%) had no prior history of DM. The mean eGFR was 37.5 mL/min/1.73 m² (SD 14.8), including 5185 (78%) with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m². The median uACR was 412 mg/g (quartile 1-quartile 3: 94–1190), with a uACR < 300 mg/g in 3194 (48%). The causes of kidney disease included diabetic kidney disease [n = 2057 (31%)], glomerular disease [n = 1669 (25%)], hypertensive/renovascular disease [n = 1445 (22%)], other [n = 808 (12%)], and unknown causes [n = 630 (10%)].

- **Conclusions**: EMPA-KIDNEY will evaluate the effi…

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113pUDCB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Tertiary and exploratory outcomes**: The effect of empagliflozin on the primary outcome was generally consistent across the prespecified subgroups. In particular, the benefits were consistent in patients with or without diabetes and regardless of eGFR at randomization. There was some evidence that the proportional risk reduction may be larger in those with higher urinary ACR (Figs. 2 and S4). Results were similar in prespecified exploratory subgroup analyses of the kidney disease progression outcome (Fig. S5).

- **eGFR decline**: There was an acute drop in eGFR on commencing study treatment, followed by a slowing of the rate of annual decline. Overall, the between-group difference in total slope was 0.75 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.96) mL per minute per 1.73 m² per year. For chronic slopes (i.e. from 2 months to final follow-up), there was a between-group difference of 1.37 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.59) mL per minute per 1.73 m² per year (Figs. 3 and S6). Prespecified exploratory analyses by subgroups showed the rate of decline in the chronic slope was slower in the empagliflozin group in all the key subgroups, including patients with low urinary ACR. Between-group differences in the rate of eGFR decline were larger in the subgroups of participants with a faster rate of annual decline (i.e. patients with diabetes, higher eGFR, or higher baseline urinary ACR) (Fig. S7).

- **Other outcomes**: There were no significant effects of empagliflozin on any specific cause of death (Figure S3), major cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI 0.76–1.12), self-reported episodes of gout, or development of new-onset diabetes (Tables S5 and S6).

### Diuretics for preventing and treating acute kidney injury [^113s4tXG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-known complication of critical illnesses, significantly affecting morbidity and the risk of death. Diuretics are widely used to ameliorate excess fluid accumulation and oliguria associated with AKI. Their popularity stems from their ability to reduce the energy demands of renal tubular cells by inhibiting transporters and flushing out intratubular casts. Numerous studies have assessed the effects of diuretics in the context of AKI prevention and treatment; however, a comprehensive systematic review addressing this topic has yet to be conducted.

- **Objectives**: This review aimed to explore the benefits and harms of diuretics for both the prevention and treatment of AKI.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched up to May 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which diuretics were used to prevent or treat AKI.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data using standardised data extraction forms. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment, the standardised mean difference (SMD) was used.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^115VnKfs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

- **Key learning points**:

	- **What is already known about this subject?**
		Prevention of kidney disease progression and decreasing cardiovascular risk are unmet clinical needs among people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In people with CKD, CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trial results demonstrated that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors decrease the risk of kidney disease progression in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR) ≥ 200 mg/g. Prespecified subgroup analyses from DAPA-CKD also found such benefits extend to certain types of people with CKD and uACR ≥ 200 mg/g in the absence of DM.

	- **What this study adds?**
		EMPA-KIDNEY is a streamlined double-blind randomized trial designed to assess the effect of empagliflozin 10 mg versus matching placebo, on top of standard care, on a composite primary outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death in a CKD population. Kidney disease progression is defined as end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to < 10 mL/min/1.73 m², renal death, or a sustained decline of ≥ 40% in eGFR from randomization. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial has wide eligibility criteria and has recruited a broad range of people with CKD, including those underrepresented in reported SGLT-2 inhibitor trials. Of the 6609 randomized EMPA-KIDNEY participants, 54% had no prior history of DM at recruitment, 78% had an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², and 48% had a uACR < 300 mg/g.

	- **What impact this may have on practice or policy?**
		EMPA-KIDNEY will help extend findings from prior research and influence practice guidelines by providing evidence on the broad applicability of SGLT-2 inhibitors in various CKD populations, potentially affecting both clinical practice and healthcare policy.

### Renal effects of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure: from the EMPULSE trial [^117V8BKX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

Renal adverse events by treatment group and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories (< 45, 45 to < 60, ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m²) are examined. Renal disorders were more common in patients with a baseline eGFR of < 45 ml/min/1.73 m² compared to those with baseline eGFRs of 45 to < 60 and ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m². However, there was no significant interaction between the treatment groups and baseline eGFR (p-value for trend = 0.6620). Overall, renal disorders were reported in 17.0% of the placebo group and 11.2% of the empagliflozin group (p = 0.0528).

Acute kidney injury events were more frequently reported in patients with a baseline eGFR of < 45 ml/min/1.73 m² compared to those with baseline eGFRs of 45 to < 60 and ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m²; however, there were not enough events to fit an appropriate model. During the 90-day treatment period, acute kidney injury was reported in 7.2% of the placebo group compared to 3.8% in the empagliflozin group (p = 0.0935).

### Effects of empagliflozin on fluid overload, weight, and blood pressure in CKD [^112VGqk1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

- **Significance statement**: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce risk of kidney progression, AKI, and cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of benefit are incompletely understood. Bioimpedance spectroscopy can estimate body water and fat mass. One quarter of the EMPA-KIDNEY bioimpedance substudy CKD population had clinically significant levels of bioimpedance-derived "Fluid Overload" at recruitment. Empagliflozin induced a prompt and sustained reduction in "Fluid Overload", irrespective of sex, diabetes, and baseline N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide or eGFR. No significant effect on bioimpedance-derived fat mass was observed. The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on body water may be one of the contributing mechanisms by which they mediate effects on cardiovascular risk.

- **Background**: CKD is associated with fluid excess that can be estimated by bioimpedance spectroscopy. We aimed to assess effects of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition on bioimpedance-derived "Fluid Overload" and adiposity in a CKD population.

- **Methods**: EMPA-KIDNEY was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of empagliflozin 10 mg once daily in patients with CKD at risk of progression. In a substudy, bioimpedance measurements were added to the main trial procedures at randomization and at 2- and 18-month follow-up visits. The substudy's primary outcome was the study-average difference in absolute "Fluid Overload" (an estimate of excess extracellular water) analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures approach.

- **Results**: The 660 substudy participants were broadly representative of the 6609-participant trial.

### Empa-REG outcome: The nephrologist's point of view [^114e7uug]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have renoprotective effects, as demonstrated by the renal analyses from clinical trials including the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), CANagliflozin Treatment and Trial Analysis versus SUlphonylurea (CANTATA-SU), and the dapagliflozin renal study. The potential mechanisms responsible are likely multifactorial, and direct renovascular and hemodynamic effects are postulated to play a central role. This report reviews the renal outcomes data from key SGLT2 inhibitor clinical trials, discusses the hypotheses for SGLT2 inhibitor-associated renoprotection, and considers the main renal safety issues associated with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1154sVsb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The pre-specified primary post-trial assessment was the effect of allocation to empagliflozin during the original active trial on the time to the composite outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death occurring at any time during the entire follow-up period (i.e. the active trial and post-trial follow-up periods combined). Kidney disease progression was defined as a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline from randomization, ESKD, a sustained eGFR below 10 mL/min/1.73 m², or death from kidney failure. Confirmation of "sustained" required values on two consecutive eGFR measurements at least 30 days apart, or was assumed if it was the last eGFR value before death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of a participant's follow-up. In primary analyses, previously reported primary outcomes from the active trial period were carried over irrespective of later eGFR results collected during the post-trial period. As central samples were not collected during the post-trial follow-up period, all eGFR-based post-trial measurements were relative to the local eGFR measurement at baseline [see Supplementary Methods for more details].

- **Secondary outcomes**: The post-trial follow-up protocol pre-specified key secondary outcomes of kidney disease progression alone, and the composite of death from any cause or ESKD. The other secondary outcome was ESKD.

- **Tertiary outcomes**: These included death from any cause and, separately, death from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes (the latter being the safety outcome for post-trial follow-up), and the primary outcome assessed by key subgroups of interest.

### Influence of endpoint definitions on the effect of empagliflozin on major renal outcomes in the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^114dJUVD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

In contrast to these favorable effects of empagliflozin on heart failure outcomes in EMPEROR-Preserved, empagliflozin did not exert a favorable effect on major renal outcomes using the EMPEROR definition, which relied on a threshold of a sustained ≥ 40% decrease in eGFR and did not include the occurrence of renal death. The hazard ratio for the effect of empagliflozin on major renal events was 0.95 (95% CI 0.73–1.24). The neutral effect of empagliflozin on kidney outcomes was similarly observed across the prespecified ejection fraction subgroups of 41–49%, 50–59%, and ≥ 60%.

- **Effect of empagliflozin on major renal outcomes**: In the EMPEROR-Preserved trial, overall effects and effects within prespecified ejection fraction subgroups were assessed using different definitions for a renal event. The prespecified ejection fraction subgroups included: > 40% to < 50%, ≥ 50% to < 60%, and ≥ 60%. The effect in the overall trial is shown in red, whereas effects in the ejection fraction subgroups are in blue. The renal endpoint based on a ≥ 40% sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was prespecified in the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials. In contrast, the renal endpoint based on a ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR and including renal death was specified in the DAPA-HF trial and was used in a meta-analysis of the EMPEROR-Reduced and DAPA-HF trials. Both endpoints included patients who required chronic renal replacement therapy or who experienced a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m². There were 14 renal deaths (10 on placebo and 4 on empagliflozin).

### The current role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus management [^113cRdMz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). High credibility.

Empagliflozin demonstrated renal protection in T2DM patients, as shown in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, where empagliflozin was associated with slower renal disease progression and a lower incidence of clinically relevant renal events compared with a placebo. Additionally, compared with a placebo, empagliflozin improved uric acid levels with a lower risk of serious renal outcomes. A sub-analysis of the EMBODY trial reported that empagliflozin prevented the decline of renal function in T2DM patients with acute myocardial infarction, especially those with a baseline eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Uric acid levels reduced by about 0.9 mg/dL in the empagliflozin group (P < 0.001).

- **SGLT-2 inhibitors' efficacy**: SGLT-2 inhibitors decrease renal failure risk in multiple meta-analyses. They reduced the risk of kidney disease progression by 45% (P < 0.0001), including in some patients regardless of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The magnitude of the benefit of SGLT-2 inhibitors varies with baseline renal function.

- **SGLT-2 inhibitors vs. other treatments**: A meta-analysis including 32,949 patients showed that SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced the risk of renal events (RR = 0.68). Compared with GLP-1, SGLT-2 inhibitors were related to a lower risk of renal events (RR = 0.79). Moreover, dapagliflozin (HR = 0.62, 0.60, 0.68, and 0.63) and empagliflozin (HR = 0.64, 0.61, 0.69, and 0.64) notably decreased renal function progression compared with duraglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, and lixisenatide.

### Comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin versus other antihyperglycemics on risk of major adverse kidney events [^112XM4J8]. Diabetes Care (2020). Low credibility.

To examine the comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin and other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics on the risk of major adverse kidney events (MAKE) of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline > 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or all-cause mortality, a cohort study was conducted.

In this cohort study involving 379,033 new users of empagliflozin or other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics, predefined variables and covariates identified by a high-dimensional variable selection algorithm were used to build propensity scores. Weighted survival analyses were then applied to estimate the risk of MAKE.

Compared with other antihyperglycemics, empagliflozin use was associated with a 0.99 mL/min/1.73 m² (95% CI 0.51, 1.55) less annual reduction in eGFR, a 0.25 kg/m² (95% CI 0.16, 0.33) more annual decrease in BMI, and a reduced risk of MAKE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68 [95% CI 0.64, 0.73]). Empagliflozin showed a reduced risk of MAKE in eGFR categories of ≥ 90, ≥ 60 to < 90, ≥ 45 to < 60, and ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.60, 0.82], 0.66 [0.60, 0.73], 0.78 [0.69, 0.89], and 0.71 [0.55, 0.92], respectively). This reduced risk was also noted in participants without albuminuria, with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria (HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.57, 0.75], 0.72 [0.66, 0.79], and 0.74 [0.62, 0.88], respectively), and in participants with and without cardiovascular disease (HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.61, 0.74] and 0.76 [0.69, 0.83], respectively). This association was evident in per-protocol analyses, which required continuation of the assigned antihyperglycemic medication.

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: A prespecified secondary analysis from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^114j7Etd]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

- **Results**: Between May 2019 and April 2021, 6,609 participants were randomized and then followed for a median of 2.0 years.

- **Baseline characteristics**: Prespecified subgroups of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) included 2,282 (35%), 2,928 (44%), and 1,399 (21%) with eGFR < 30, 30–44, and ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively, along with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) < 30, 30–299, and ≥ 300 mg/g, respectively. Participants with lower eGFR were older and more likely to have diabetes, whereas uACR was highest among participants with eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m², due to the requirement for them to have a uACR ≥ 200 mg/g at screening to be eligible. Those with higher uACR were younger, less likely to have diabetes, and had a higher mean eGFR. Baseline characteristics for the expanded eGFR and uACR categories are given in Web Table 1.

### Synjardy [^116EW1mJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effectiveness of empagliflozin, a component of Synjardy and Synjardy XR, to reduce the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization has been established in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression based on an adequate and well-controlled study of empagliflozin [EMPA-KIDNEY (NCT03594110)]. This trial was designed to determine the treatment effect of empagliflozin compared to placebo in adults with CKD (with and without type 2 diabetes). The trial, which studied empagliflozin rather than Synjardy or Synjardy XR, included adults taking metformin HCl as a concomitant medication. The efficacy results of EMPA-KIDNEY are reported below.

- **Study design**: EMPA-KIDNEY was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in adults with chronic kidney disease [eGFR ≥ 20 to 45 mg of prednisone (or equivalent)] at the time of screening.

- **Primary objective**: To assess the effects of empagliflozin as an adjunct to standard-of-care therapy, including RAS-inhibitor therapy when appropriate, on time to kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death.

A total of 6,609 patients were equally randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg orally once daily or a placebo.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 update [^115nTXzm]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

- **Recommendations for implementation**: Acute kidney injury (AKI), hypovolaemia, and potassium
	- We recommend that individuals initiated on an SGLT-2 inhibitor do not routinely require an early assessment of kidney function or potassium following initiation of treatment (Grade 1C). We suggest that if an individual has a kidney function assessment within the first few weeks after the initiation of an SGLT-2 inhibitor, a decline in eGFR needs to be interpreted with caution and in the context of an expected drug effect to avoid unwarranted discontinuation of treatment (Grade 2B). We suggest that individuals on diuretics are counselled on the symptoms of hypovolaemia and advised to seek medical attention if they develop any such symptoms after starting SGLT-2 inhibition (Grade 2B). We suggest that clinicians consider an early clinical review and, if appropriate, a diuretic or antihypertensive dose reduction in individuals they consider at high risk of hypovolaemia (Grade 2C). We recommend that SGLT-2 inhibitors are temporarily withheld during acute illness (Grade 1C).

- **Rationale**:
	- SGLT-2 inhibitors have proven benefits in reducing the rate of long-term decline in kidney function in certain groups of people with CKD. The mechanism by which they provide this benefit may involve changes to intraglomerular pressure and reduction in hyperfiltration at an individual glomerulus level. This can result in a reduction in eGFR over the initial few weeks following initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors, which is relatively small, largely reversible, and should not usually be seen as an adverse effect of the treatment.

### Are the cardiovascular and kidney benefits of empagliflozin influenced by baseline glucose-lowering therapy [^112k5ukV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, when given in addition to standard care, improved cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes, and reduced mortality. Trial participants were on a variety of glucose-lowering therapies at baseline, some of which could potentially affect CV risk. This analysis investigated whether the use of background diabetes therapy affected the risk of CV death, hospitalizations for heart failure, and progression of chronic kidney disease among patients treated with empagliflozin.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10mg, or empagliflozin 25mg; glucose-lowering therapy was to remain unchanged for 12 weeks and then adjusted to achieve glycaemic control according to local guidelines. Differences in risk of cardio-renal outcomes between empagliflozin and placebo by baseline use of metformin, sulphonylurea (SU), and insulin were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model.

- **Results**: Of 7020 eligible patients, 74% were receiving metformin, 43% SU, and 48% insulin at baseline (each alone or in combination); the most common regimens were metformin plus SU (20%) and metformin plus insulin (20%). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of CV death irrespective of the use of: metformin [with: hazard ratio (HR) 0.71 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.54–0.94); without: 0.46 (0.32–0.68); P interaction = 0.07]; SU [with: HR 0.64 (0.44–0.92); without: 0.61 (0.46–0.81); P interaction = 0.85]; or insulin [with: HR 0.63 (0.46–0.85); without: 0.61.

### Influence of endpoint definitions on the effect of empagliflozin on major renal outcomes in the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^11589313]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

Large-scale trials have evaluated the effects of treatments on major renal outcomes, but the definition of a renal event has varied from trial to trial. In defining a renal event, trialists included patients who needed renal replacement therapy or whose estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) declined to less than 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m². They also included patients who experienced large and sustained decreases in eGFR from baseline. Different trials have designated different threshold values for a critical change in eGFR, with some trials designating a sustained ≥ 40% decline and others specifying a sustained ≥ 50% decrease. Still others have required a sustained doubling of serum creatinine, which corresponds to a ≥ 57% decline in eGFR.

Two large-scale trials have evaluated the effect of sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. They reported a favorable effect of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on heart failure hospitalizations, but the two trials prespecified different definitions of a major renal event. Both trials included patients who required renal replacement therapy or who experienced a sustained decrease in eGFR to less than 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m². However, the EMPEROR‐Reduced trial also included patients with a sustained ≥ 40% decrease in eGFR, whereas the DAPA‐HF investigators specified a sustained ≥ 50% decrease in eGFR and also included the occurrence of renal death. The definition used by the DAPA‐HF trial was used in a meta-analysis of the two trials.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^113ocXwX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

The EMPA-KIDNEY trial is assessing the efficacy and safety of adding empagliflozin 10 mg to the standard of care in 6609 people with CKD using a streamlined design. Its pre-screening process was relatively novel for renal trials and had multiple benefits. Advantages included a semiquantitative assessment of feasibility at each prospective site, which provided early confirmation that recruitment of 6000 participants from only eight countries was possible and decreased the likelihood of screening failures. The trial's simple eligibility criteria are intended to maximize its generalizability and led to randomization of a wide range of people with CKD at risk of progression. At recruitment, slightly more than half of participants did not have DM, about three-quarters had an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², and about half had levels of albuminuria < 300 mg/g.

The wide range of people with CKD randomized into EMPA-KIDNEY included groups excluded from or under-represented in other SGLT-2 inhibitor trials with a primary focus on kidney disease progression. For example, only 31% (2057/6609) of EMPA-KIDNEY participants have a local investigator-ascribed primary renal diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease, compared with 58% (2510/4304) in DAPA-CKD and all of the 4401 CREDENCE participants. The DAPA-CKD results on non-diabetic kidney disease are based on 128 primary outcomes in 1398 participants. The larger number of people without DM in EMPA-KIDNEY will provide valuable additional information on the effects of empagliflozin on cardiorenal outcomes in people without diabetes.
