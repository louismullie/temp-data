## Question

Shiny scaly skin on shin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing shiny, scaly skin on the shins. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the morphologic descriptors and what they imply pathologically. Then, I should build a prioritized differential diagnosis by likelihood and danger. Next, I will outline the bedside diagnostic approach, including history, exam, and targeted tests. After that, I will define when to biopsy and what to request histologically. Finally, I will map evidence-based management strategies by diagnosis and close with red flags and follow-up, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the morphologic clues embedded in "shiny" and "scaly" on the shins. Shiny often reflects epidermal thinning, edema, or mucin deposition altering light reflection, while scaly implies hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis; together on the anterior shins, this pattern pushes me toward chronic inflammatory or infiltrative processes rather than purely infectious etiologies, though I should not jump to conclusions without correlating distribution, chronology, and systemic context [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should prioritize the differential by prevalence and severity. The most likely considerations on the shins include lichen planus and its hypertrophic variants, pretibial myxedema, stasis dermatitis with lichenification, psoriasis, and nummular eczema, with actinic keratosis less common on the shins but still plausible if there is significant sun damage; less likely but important are sarcoidosis, mycobacterial infections such as Mycobacterium marinum, and neoplastic mimics like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, so I need to keep these in mind if the course is atypical or refractory [^4232c309] [^e2e400a5] [^50216cd3] [^bf95ba0e] [^e49b706f] [^a28d55b5] [^6fb712b8] [^78338d87] [^84301d14].

> Wait, let me verify the key discriminators for lichen planus on the shins. Hypertrophic lichen planus often presents as pruritic, violaceous, flat-topped papules or plaques with adherent scale on the distal extremities, and dermoscopy may show Wickham striae; histology classically shows compact hyperkeratosis, wedge-shaped hypergranulosis, and a lichenoid interface dermatitis, and I should remember that lesions can koebnerize after trauma, which explains persistence or worsening with destructive therapies [^4232c309] [^74d7a412] [^8264a807].

> I will now examine pretibial myxedema as a leading cause of shin shininess. It presents as firm, nonpitting, boggy plaques on the anterior shins, often with a peau d'orange or cobblestone surface, and may be associated with Graves' orbitopathy; histology shows abundant dermal mucin separating collagen bundles, and management relies on topical or intralesional corticosteroids plus compression, with case-based evidence supporting intralesional triamcinolone with or without hyaluronidase to reduce volume and improve appearance [^e2e400a5] [^f6fb3900] [^4e7f4114].

> Let me consider stasis dermatitis and its lichenified end-stage, because shin location plus edema and hyperpigmentation fit. Chronic venous insufficiency leads to edema, hemosiderin deposition, and lichen simplex chronicus from repeated scratching; the skin becomes thickened, hyperpigmented, and sometimes verrucous, and compression therapy is foundational to break the cycle, with topical corticosteroids for flares and emollients for barrier repair [^50216cd3] [^cef8e16f].

> But wait, what if the scale is silvery and the plaques are well-demarcated. Psoriasis on the shins is common and can be chronic; clinically, plaques are erythematous with silvery scale and may be pruritic or asymptomatic, and pathophysiology reflects T-cell–mediated cytokine signaling with keratinocyte hyperproliferation; I should confirm with exam and, if needed, histology showing acanthosis, parakeratosis, and dilated dermal papillae, and I must remember that psoriasis on the shins can be stubborn and may require escalation beyond topical therapy in moderate disease [^bf95ba0e] [^01d0740c].

> Next, I should review nummular eczema, especially if the lesions are coin-shaped and intensely pruritic. Nummular dermatitis favors the shins and dorsal hands, presenting as round, scaly plaques that can ooze and crust when acute; it is a spongiotic dermatitis on histology and often flares with xerosis or irritants, so barrier repair and anti-inflammatory therapy are key, and I should double-check for superinfection if there is crusting or malodor [^e49b706f] [^6b17d270].

> I need to ensure I do not miss actinic keratosis on the shins, although it is less typical than on the dorsal hands or head. AKs are rough, scaly papules or plaques on sun-damaged skin and can progress to keratinocyte carcinoma; if suspected, I should confirm with exam and consider biopsy for atypical or thickened lesions, and management should follow guideline-based options such as cryotherapy, topical 5-FU, imiquimod, or photodynamic therapy, with sun protection emphasized for prevention [^a28d55b5] [^e9c74917] [^1fd97c55].

> Hold on, I should verify the red flags that warrant earlier biopsy or systemic workup. Atypical morphology, rapid progression, ulceration, treatment resistance, or systemic symptoms push me to consider sarcoidosis, mycobacterial infection, or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma; sarcoidosis can show ichthyosiform or annular plaques on the shins with noncaseating granulomas, M. marinum follows water exposure and can cause indolent noduloulcerative lesions, and CTCL may mimic inflammatory dermatoses but persists or evolves with adnexotropism or atypical lymphocytes on histology [^6fb712b8] [^78338d87] [^84301d14].

> Let me first confirm the bedside diagnostic approach. I should take a careful history of duration, pruritus, trauma, water exposure, travel, medications, and endocrine symptoms; on exam, I will characterize morphology, distribution, and look for Wickham striae, mucosal involvement, edema, hemosiderin deposition, and nail changes; targeted tests include KOH for tinea, RPR for syphilis if morphology suggests it, and thyroid function tests if pretibial myxedema is suspected, reserving biopsy for uncertain, atypical, or refractory cases [^57b64ad2] [^6b17d270] [^e436c437].

> I should double-check the biopsy strategy and histology requests. If I biopsy, I need to request adequate depth to capture dermal features, and ask for H&E plus special stains as indicated: colloidal iron for mucin in pretibial myxedema, AFB stains if infection is suspected, and PAS or GMS if fungal disease is on the table; for suspected lichen planus, I should confirm interface change and hypergranulosis, and for psoriasis, I should look for acanthosis and parakeratosis, while remembering that hypertrophic LP can mimic SCC and may require deeper sections to exclude malignancy [^e2e400a5] [^4861303d] [^0917cc43].

> Next, I should review management by diagnosis, and I need to ensure I align with evidence. For hypertrophic lichen planus, intralesional or high-potency topical corticosteroids are first-line and can be repeated at intervals, with attention to avoiding trauma that triggers koebnerization; for pretibial myxedema, intralesional triamcinolone with or without hyaluronidase plus compression and leg elevation are reasonable, recognizing that multiple sessions are often needed; for stasis dermatitis, compression is essential with topical corticosteroids for flares and emollients for barrier repair; for psoriasis, escalate from topical corticosteroids to vitamin D analogs, and consider phototherapy or systemic options for refractory disease; for nummular eczema, mid- to high-potency topical corticosteroids with aggressive emollients are standard; for actinic keratosis, use cryotherapy or topical field therapies with sun protection counseling [^4232c309] [^e2e400a5] [^50216cd3] [^01d0740c] [^e9c74917].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include urea 40% broadly for scaly shins, but I should verify indications and tolerability. Urea is excellent for hyperkeratotic or xerotic skin and can soften scale, but it may sting on fissured or inflamed skin, so I should reserve it for intact, scaly areas and avoid erosions; alternatively, for mild scaly xerosis, ammonium lactate 12% or lactic acid 12% can be used on intact skin, and for barrier repair, fragrance-free emollients in jars or tubs are preferred on the limbs, with greasy formulations generally better tolerated on the legs than on the face [^77ed0fe2] [^fd32b2cf] [^ad87cf38].

> I should confirm follow-up cadence and safety monitoring. Reassess in 2 to 4 weeks to gauge response and adherence, sooner if symptoms worsen or atypical features emerge; monitor for skin atrophy with prolonged topical steroids, and if using calcineurin inhibitors, counsel on infection risk and sun avoidance; for suspected or confirmed pretibial myxedema, coordinate endocrine evaluation and management of thyroid dysfunction to optimize cutaneous outcomes [^fbc30d7f] [^e436c437].

> In summary, shiny, scaly shins most often reflect hypertrophic lichen planus, pretibial myxedema, stasis dermatitis with lichenification, psoriasis, or nummular eczema, with actinic keratosis and less common entities like sarcoidosis or M. marinum in the differential; a focused history and exam, selective labs, and judicious biopsy with appropriate stains usually clarify the diagnosis, and evidence-based topical, intralesional, compression, and phototherapeutic strategies tailored to the specific condition yield the best results, so I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely and remain open to evolving findings over time [^4232c309] [^e2e400a5] [^08c60d0e] [^bf95ba0e] [^e49b706f] [^a28d55b5].

Shiny, scaly skin on the shins most often reflects **lichen planus** or **pretibial myxedema**, with lichen simplex chronicus, psoriasis, and stasis dermatitis as key differentials [^4232c309] [^e2e400a5] [^cef8e16f] [^bf95ba0e] [^08c60d0e]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by **dermoscopy** (Wickham striae for lichen planus) [^74d7a412] and biopsy when uncertain [^4861303d]. Management is cause-specific: topical or intralesional corticosteroids for lichen planus [^4232c309], compression and topical corticosteroids for stasis dermatitis [^08c60d0e], and topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors for psoriasis [^notfound]; pretibial myxedema requires intralesional corticosteroids and compression [^e2e400a5]. Persistent, atypical, or refractory lesions warrant biopsy to exclude malignancy or infiltrative disease [^4861303d].

## Diagnostic approach

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history (onset, duration, pruritus, trauma, systemic symptoms) and examination (morphology, distribution, associated features) [^57b64ad2].

- **Dermoscopy**: Wickham striae support lichen planus [^74d7a412].

- **Biopsy**: Indicated for uncertain diagnosis, atypical features, or refractory lesions; request histopathology and special stains (e.g. mucin, AFB) as indicated [^4861303d].

---

## Management strategies

- **Lichen planus**: Topical or intralesional corticosteroids; calcineurin inhibitors for refractory cases [^4232c309].

- **Pretibial myxedema**: Intralesional corticosteroids, compression, and management of thyroid dysfunction [^e2e400a5].

- **Lichen simplex chronicus**: Topical corticosteroids, emollients, and behavioral modification to stop scratching [^cef8e16f].

- **Psoriasis**: Topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, calcineurin inhibitors, or phototherapy [^notfound].

- **Stasis dermatitis**: Compression therapy, leg elevation, and topical corticosteroids [^08c60d0e].

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications include **secondary infection** (bacterial or fungal), chronic lichenification, and psychological distress from pruritus and cosmetic concerns [^38f2b9c4]. Persistent or atypical lesions may indicate malignancy (e.g. cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) and require biopsy [^6b17d270].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by diagnosis: lichen planus and psoriasis are chronic with relapses; pretibial myxedema often persists despite therapy; lichen simplex chronicus improves with behavioral change; stasis dermatitis progresses unless compression is used [^4232c309] [^e2e400a5] [^cef8e16f] [^08c60d0e].

---

Shiny, scaly shin skin most often reflects lichen planus or pretibial myxedema, with lichen simplex chronicus, psoriasis, and stasis dermatitis as key differentials. Accurate diagnosis guides **targeted therapy**, and biopsy is warranted for atypical or refractory cases.

A 58-year old African-American woman presented with a 3-year history of scaly plaques on her legs. Prior treatment consisted of triamcinolone cream and compression stockings. Examination found thin, red-brown rhomboidal plaques with adherent scale on anterior legs bilaterally (Fig 1) and no other skin involvement. Review of systems was positive for chronic dyspnea on exertion. Tuberculin test was negative. A punch biopsy found numerous deep dermal noncaseating granulomas composed of epithelioid cells and giant cells surrounded by a pauci-cellular cuff of lymphocytes (Fig 2). Fite and periodic acid–Schiff stains were negative, and foreign body was not seen on birefringence.

### Angioinvasivepresenting with violaceous papules and plaques in the setting of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^0917cc43]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

One week after our initial evaluation, the patient developed 2 similar-appearing scaly red-purple papules with dusky borders on the right elbow (Fig 2) and right dorsal hand (Fig 3) while the shin lesion persisted.

Thin dusky papule with violaceous rim and fine scale on the right elbow.

Fig 3
Thin scaly erythematous papule with violaceous rim on the right dorsal hand.

She was also diagnosed with acute sinusitis, but while blood cultures were no longer growing Pseudomonas, new bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus ensued. Given the presence of new lesions and the persistence of her shin lesion despite treatment for her Pseudomonas bacteremia, concern for an alternative etiology for the skin findings was redoubled, and, in this setting, the patient consented to punch biopsies of the shin lesion. Histopathologic examination was consistent with infectious fungal vasculopathy and staining with both Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS) revealed easily identifiable clusters of hyphal and spore forms, the former of which exhibited septations with acute-angle branching (Fig 4). Gram stain was negative for bacterial superinfection.

Periodic acid-Schiff stain (B) and Grocott's Methenamine Silver stain (C) reveal multifocal clusters of hyphal septated forms with variable, acute-angle branches and spores.

Shortly thereafter, she was diagnosed with invasive fungal sinusitis. Culture of the shin lesion grew A.alternata and she was initially diagnosed with A.alternata invasive fungal sinusitis with systemic dissemination; however, sinus biopsy revealed fungal hyphae to be morphologically consistent with Aspergillus.

The patient was started on amphotericin B and isavuconazonium, chosen based on combination of sensitivity data and interaction potential with her chemotherapy. She underwent multiple rounds of sinus debridement. At the time of discharge, her clinical status had improved and her neutropenia had reversed; however, her infection had not yet resolved, with recommendation to continue antimicrobial treatment and likely further outpatient sinus debridement.

### Seizures of unknown etiology associated with brittle hair: a diagnostic challenge [^5835aeac]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 6-week-old Hispanic infant who had been admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit due to a 3-week history of seizures (the etiology of which had not been identified) was referred to our service for evaluation of his sparse, brittle hair. The patient was the first-born child of nonconsanguineous parents; he had been delivered at term, weighing 6 pounds, with a head circumference of 13.2 inches; there had been no prenatal or neonatal complications (including bony abnormalities) before his visit to the emergency department. The patient's mother had brought the 3-week-old newborn to the ED when she noticed that he was making repetitive, involuntary movements; additionally, it was ascertained that the newborn had also been suffering from poor oral intake and failure to thrive. His involuntary movements were myoclonic and focal in nature, initially affecting his extremities but eventually progressing to generalized involvement. The mother mentioned that the texture of his hair had changed since his birth. The family history was unremarkable except for the mother (and a first-degree maternal cousin) having adult-onset epilepsy. The mother had no history of pili torti (PT) or hypopigmentation.

A physical examination revealed an infant of fair complexion, with chubby cheeks, micrognathia, and a depressed nasal bridge. His scalp hair was short, sparse, dull, brittle, and light-colored; it had a kinky appearance and an irregular texture (Fig 1). His eyebrows and eyelashes were similarly affected. Broken hair shafts were noted in both the occipital and temporal areas, along with yellowish scaly patches solely in the occipital region. In addition, the infant had shiny, lax, doughy skin on the backs of both hands (Fig 1). No other associated mucocutaneous findings were identified. A neurologic examination was remarkable for generalized hypotonia, head lag, and brisk reflexes.

### Semi-firm lesions on the flanks and extensor surfaces [^64789a4a]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 1: Based on this patient's history and exam findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Cutaneous lymphoma
B. Sarcoidosis
C. Keloid scars
D. Leprosy
E. Leishmaniasis

Answers:
A. Cutaneous lymphoma – Incorrect. Cutaneous lymphoma can be considered clinically with various clinical presentations, including nodules as seen in this patient. However, the histology of lymphoma would demonstrate large aggregates of atypical lymphocytes rather than granulomatous inflammation with primarily histiocytes. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining would be negative in lymphoma.
B. Sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Sarcoidosis can present in the skin in up to 30% of patients, and occurs most frequently on the face, upper back, extremities, and sites of prior injuries. On histology, sarcoidosis is characterized by naked granulomas and AFB stain would be negative.
C. Keloid scar – Incorrect. Extensive body surface area involvement despite no known prior trauma and the presence of a scaly border make keloids less likely. On histology, keloid scars have bundles of collagen and are not typically organized into granulomas. Again, AFB staining would be negative.
D. Leprosy – Correct. Leprosy remains endemic in the coastal southeastern United States and Hawaii. This patient's findings suggest histoid leprosy, a rare subtype of multibacillary (> 5 skin lesions) lepromatous leprosy that presents with soft, shiny, flesh-colored to yellow-red dermal and subcutaneous papules to nodules favoring the extremities, buttocks, and lower back. Histoid leprosy can arise de nov o but is associated with resistance to dapsone monotherapy in the treatment of leprosy. Lesions constitute a reservoir of Mycobacterium leprae and are extremely contagious. As demonstrated, biopsy of a lesion demonstrates granulomatous inflammation with positive AFB staining of organisms.
E. Leishmaniasis – Incorrect. The clinical presentation of keloidal plaques may be seen in diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis but that is typically seen in immunocompromised patients. Histology of leishmaniasis may resemble that of lepromatous leprosy on hematoxylin-eosin stain. However, in the early stages of leishmaniasis, amastigotes are typically visible within the histiocytes and AFB staining would be negative.

### Pityriasis rubra pilaris potentially triggered by messenger RNA-1273 COVID vaccine [^ef96242d]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case

A 75-year-old, otherwise healthy man presented to his dermatologist with scalp redness and flaking that had begun several days after his first Moderna vaccination. Seborrheic dermatitis was diagnosed, and ketoconazole 2% shampoo was prescribed. He received his second Moderna vaccination 4 weeks after the first. Eight days later, he returned to his dermatologist with erythematous patches and plaques on his neck. He denied previous skin issues and any new or chronic medications. He had no family history of PRP.

Based on the timing relative to the skin complaints, the eruption was attributed to the Moderna vaccine. Topical corticosteroids were prescribed. Over the following weeks, the rash progressed in a cephalocaudal pattern, involving the neck, trunk, and proximal extremities. Initial skin biopsies were interpreted as favoring a drug-induced or vaccine-induced reaction. A prednisone taper was prescribed but was discontinued by the patient after 5 days due to minimal improvement and worsening of the rash. Wet wraps over triamcinolone 0.1% ointment offered mild symptomatic improvement. He was referred to our clinic for further evaluation and management.

On presentation, he reported chills without fever and mild itching. He denied joint pain and muscle weakness. Examination showed thin, salmon-colored papules and plaques, with minimal desquamation, on the proximal upper extremities and trunk, confluent over the upper trunk and neck. Well-demarcated areas of unaffected skin (islands of sparing) were appreciated on the torso (Fig 1, A). The bilateral palms had a slightly shiny appearance (Fig 1, B). His muscle strength was normal. His creatine phosphokinase and aldolase levels were normal. HIV testing was negative.

### Lichen planus verrucosa: a challenging clinical and histologic subset of hypertrophic lichen planus [^4232c309]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 75-year-old woman presented with intermittently pruritic pink scaly plaques on the bilateral shins for almost 2 years. She had been diagnosed by dermatologists with guttate psoriasis, verruca vulgaris, irritated seborrheic keratoses, LP-like keratoses, and concern for nonmelanoma skin cancer. Multiple biopsies were reported either descriptively or as verruca vulgaris. Lesion persistence despite treatment of psoriasis (with triamcinolone 0.1% ointment) and warts (with topical salicylic acid or fluorouracil and cryotherapy) prompted 7 biopsies over the preceding year, some of which demonstrated classic features of verruca vulgaris (Fig 1), whereas others were less specific. Importantly, empiric treatment of verruca vulgaris was not only ineffective but led to the formation of ulcers. The ulcers healed with wound care; however, primary scaly plaques persisted. Immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction studies for human papillomavirus were performed on 2 biopsies; all were negative. One of the pathology reports suggested a differential diagnosis of hypertrophic LP. Additional history-taking revealed that the patient had been diagnosed with LP by a dentist several decades prior, and physical examination revealed oromucosal reticulate white patches (Fig 2). A clinical-pathologic diagnosis of hypertrophic LP with verrucous features was thus confirmed. Furthermore, previous exacerbation of lesions with local destructive treatments was retrospectively concerning for koebnerization phenomenon, which is known to be associated with LP. Intralesional triamcinolone 5 mg/mL injections administered at 2-month intervals for 2 total treatments and topical clobetasol 0.05% ointment application twice daily ultimately led to resolution of the lesions. At a recent clinic visit, physical examination of our patient's legs revealed predominantly residual postinflammatory hyperpigmentation of the shins and scarring, with minimal focal areas of asymptomatic papular erythema (Fig 3).

### Atopic dermatitis: an overview… [^f746d036]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by pruritic, erythematous, and scaly skin lesions often localized to the flexural surfaces of the body. Pathophysiology A genetic defect in the filaggrin protein is thought to cause atopic dermatitis by disrupting the epidermis. This disruption, in turn, results in contact between immune cells in the dermis and antigens from the external environment leading to intense itching, scratching, and inflammation. 6 Scratching can then lead to further disruption and inflammation of the epidermal skin barrier; this has been described as the itchscratch cycle.
2. Clinical Presentation and Differential Diagnosis Atopic dermatitis can present in three clinical phases. Acute atopic dermatitis presents with a vesicular, weeping, crusting eruption. Subacute atopic dermatitis presents with dry, scaly, erythematous papules and plaques.

Chronic atopic dermatitis demonstrates lichenification from repeated scratching. A more subtle presentation of atopic dermatitis that commonly occurs in children is pityriasis alba, which is characterized by hypopigmented, poorly demarcated plaques with fine scale. Eczematous skin enables a localized herpes outbreak to spread over the skin and create a painful papulovesicular rash. Other complications of atopic dermatitis include scars from picking and scratching, chronic postinflammatory skin changes, and skin atrophy from long-term treatment with topical corticosteroids. TOPICAL CALCINEURIN INHIBITORS Topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus, are immunomodulators and are considered second-line therapy.

12 They generally are reserved for short-term or intermittent long-term therapy in persons with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, especially when there is concern that ongoing use of topical corticosteroids is causing adverse effects, such as atrophy. 15 Because these agents do not lead to skin atrophy, they are particularly useful for areas of thinner skin on the face, neck, and skin folds. Another benefit is that they do not demonstrate tachyphylaxis, even after prolonged treatment. 33.

### Hyperkeratotic plaques resembling an oyster shell [^1b8c7e1c]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

History

A 34-year-old man with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) presented with 2 years of pruritic, slowly growing lesions after discontinuation of all antiviral medications. On examination, he had a cobblestoned, dark brown plaque on the perioral cutaneous and mucosal lip (Fig 1) and 2 large annular brown plaques with heaped-up mounds of scale and violaceous rims on the right shin and posterior thigh (Fig 2) with a smaller similar lesion on the scrotum. A skin biopsy of the perioral and right thigh plaques found a lichenoid infiltrate with numerous plasma cells (Fig 3). An immunostain is shown in Fig 4.

Question 1: What is the diagnosis?
A. Psoriasis
B. Majocchi granuloma
C. Rupioid syphilis
D. Hypertrophic lichen planus
E. Lobomycosis

Answers:
A. Psoriasis – Incorrect. Although psoriasis can have a rupioid morphology, the presence of spirochetes on immunostains supported an infectious diagnosis.
B. Majocchi granuloma – Incorrect. Majocchi granuloma is a deep folliculitis caused by a cutaneous dermatophyte infection. Skin scraping in this case had no growth in dermatophyte test media, and tissue cultures were negative for bacteria, fungus, and atypical mycobacteria.
C. Rupioid syphilis – Correct. This patient's rapid plasma reagin was reactive with a titer of 1:512, and his Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay was positive. Rupioid syphilis is characterized by well-demarcated hyperkeratotic scaly plaques with a thick, adherent crust that resembles the back of an oyster shell.
D. Hypertrophic lichen planus – Incorrect. The presence of spirochetes on immunostains supported an infectious diagnosis.
E. Lobomycosis – Incorrect. Lobomycosis is a chronic fungal infection presenting with keloidal-like plaques. Round yeast-like structures were not seen on histology.

### Flaky paint dermatosis in kwashiorkor [^e86d71db]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

A 3-month-old infant was presented with a 4-week history of scaly lesions on face, trunk, and limbs. The infant's mother indicated that the infant had a history of diarrhea for 6 weeks and failure to gain weight. On physical examination, the infant was irritable, dehydrated, and exhibited generalized edema; her weight for age was in the 64 th percentile. Cutaneous examination revealed dry, desquamative, hyperpigmented, patchy, and macular lesions on the face, trunk, and bilateral upper and lower limbs (Figure 1). The scalp hair was dry and brittle. Laboratory parameters showed hypoalbuminemia (1.5 g/dL), hypokalemia (2.1 mEq/L), and normal serum zinc levels. The clinical condition was characteristic of kwashiorkor with "flaky paint dermatosis". The infant was admitted to the hospital and managed with total parenteral nutrition, topical emollients, and multivitamin supplements. The child improved clinically within 2 weeks. The mother was advised to continue exclusive breastfeeding.

Figure 1.
Widespread, dry, desquamative lesions characteristic of flaky paint dermatosis. This figure appears in color at www.ajtmh.org.

Kwashiorkor, a form of severe protein-energy malnutrition, is common in areas of famine and restricted food supply that affects older infants and young children. Clinically, it is characterized by normal weight for age, irritability, anorexia, edema, distended abdomen, hepatomegaly, and dermatosis. The cutaneous and hair manifestations are attributable to low methionine levels that impair sulphation of the keratin.

Skin manifestations of kwashiorkor progress over the course of days from dryness and atrophy to generalized hyperkeratosis and hyperpigmentation. The fragile skin peels off in an irregular manner to reveal underlying hypopigmentation ("flaky paint" or "peeling paint" dermatosis), particularly over the buttocks and limbs. The most common skin finding is the shiny, varnished-looking nature of hyperpigmentation. The hair is usually sparse, dry, and brittle, with a reddish yellow hue. The alternate bands of normal and pale hair (flag sign) reflect periods of good and poor nutrition. The nail plate changes and exhibits thinning, fissuring, ridging, or prominent koilonychia.

### Hypertrophic lichen planus mimicking squamous cell carcinoma: the importance of clinicopathologic correlation [^4861303d]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

HLP should be considered in the presence of several key clinical and histologic features (Table I). HLP should be on the differential diagnosis for any thick, scaly, pruritic, hyperkeratotic plaque on the distal extremities, particularly the shins, and in the presence of multiple lesions, especially in a patient with no history of sun damage or predisposing factors for multiple SCCs. Wickham striae and evidence of typical LP on examination of the oral mucosa, nails, and skin elsewhere further support the diagnosis of HLP. A deep biopsy section should be obtained if HLP is suspected; superficial biopsy specimens may not include a sufficient portion of the dermis to differentiate between HLP and SCC. Histologic features suggestive of HLP include hyperorthokeratosis, wedge-shaped hypergranulosis, and psoriasiform hyperplasia of the epidermis; lichenoid interface dermatitis with eosinophils; presence of typical features of PEH; and absence of cytologic atypia, marked solar elastosis, deep extension beyond the superficial dermis, and lymphovascular or perineural invasion. Elastic staining to visualize the presence or absence of perforating elastic fibers may assist in distinguishing between SCC and HLP; perforating elastic fibers are rarely present in HLP but may be seen in SCC.

This case highlights the challenge of differentiating HLP and SCC. Awareness of the distinguishing features of HLP is essential for clinicians to provide timely and appropriate treatment to their patients.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^6b17d270]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

Several conditions may mimic PR and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Below is a list of common differentials with brief descriptions of why they need to be ruled out:
Secondary syphilis: Often presents with a generalized rash, including on palms and soles, which can resemble PR but usually lacks a herald patch and has a different distribution, and lymphadenopathy is almost always found in secondary syphilis but usually never in PR. A rapid plasma reagin test is essential to rule out this condition.
Tinea corporis: Fungal infections can present with annular, scaly lesions that may mimic PR. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can confirm the diagnosis by revealing fungal elements.
Erythema multiforme: This condition can present with targetoid lesions and mucosal involvement, which is not typical of PR. A detailed history and clinical examination help distinguish between the two, as erythema multiforme is often related to herpes simplex infection.
Guttate psoriasis: Characterized by small, rain-drop pattern, scaly papules, guttate psoriasis may resemble PR but often has a history of sore throat and psoriasis, scales are thicker and silvery-white, and it lacks the typical herald patch.
Pityriasis lichenoides chronica: Chronic, scaly, red–brown papules that may resemble PR, but lesions persist longer, the herald patch is lacking, and papules are in different stages of evolution, one or more of them showing a darker center and have a more varied appearance. Histopathology is often needed for differentiation.
Pityriasis alba: Hypopigmented, scaly patches usually seen in children with a history of eczema. The absence of a herald patch and the chronic nature of the condition help differentiate it from PR.
Lichen planus: Pruritic, purple, polygonal papules often involving the wrists, lumbar spinal region, glans penis, and oral mucosa. The chronicity and distribution help differentiate it from PR.
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus: Erythematous, annular, or polycyclic lesions that may mimic PR but often have photosensitivity and systemic symptoms, and histology shows epidermal atrophy and basal layer degeneration.
Nummular eczema: Coin-shaped, scaly patches that may resemble PR. The chronic, relapsing nature, intense pruritus, and shin and dorsal hand localizations, rarely found in PR, are key differentiators.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Early stages may resemble PR, as the initial patch does not respond to topical steroids mimicking PR. However, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma typically has a chronic course and does not respond to standard PR treatments. Multiple serial biopsies are essential for diagnosis.
Kaposi sarcoma: Can present with red, purple, or brown plaques and nodules. Unlike PR, Kaposi sarcoma is associated with immunosuppression and has a more progressive course.

### Noninvasive imaging tools in the diagnosis and treatment of skin cancers [^fe9e4c2e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Basal Cell Carcinomas

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common nonmelanocytic skin cancer (NMSC) worldwide. The management of BCC relies on several factors: tumor size and site, definition of the margins, histologic subtype and features of aggression, failure of a previous treatment, and immunosuppression status. Dermoscopy might be helpful in this scenario for distinguishing between the nodular, infiltrative, or superficial BCC lesion subtypes. Nonpigmented nodular lesions are the most common subtype and are most frequently located on the head and neck. Clinically, these lesions present as pearly, shiny papules or nodules with telangiectasias (Fig. 2 a). By dermoscopy, several thick arborizing telangiectasias branching over the lesion are observed (Fig. 2 e, f). In addition, friability may generate ulceration of the lesion. Both clinical and dermoscopic aspects together are highly indicative of nodular BCC (Fig. 2 b, g). Superficial nonpigmented BCC lesions are clinically defined by friable, scaly, and flat erythematous plaques (Fig. 2 c). Further dermoscopic examination usually shows short and superfine telangiectasias or linear vessels over a reddish background with multiple microerosions that also occur due to friability (Fig. 2 h). Finally, infiltrative BCC lesions present as indurated plaques or depressions with ill-defined borders and atrophy (Fig. 2 d). By dermoscopy, fine and scattered telangiectasias branching over the lesion are observed over a white fibrosis-induced background (Fig. 2 i).

### Guidelines of care for the management of actinic keratosis [^17edb3b1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Actinic keratoses (AK) are rough scaly patches that arise on chronically ultraviolet-exposed skin and can progress to keratinocyte carcinoma.

Objective

This analysis examined the literature related to the management of AK to provide evidence-based recommendations for treatment. Grading, histologic classification, natural history, risk of progression, and dermatologic surveillance of AKs are also discussed.

Methods

A multidisciplinary Work Group conducted a systematic review to address 5 clinical questions on the management of AKs and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading clinical recommendations. Graded recommendations were voted on to achieve consensus.

Results

Analysis of the evidence resulted in 18 recommendations.

Limitations

This analysis is based on the best available evidence at the time it was conducted. The pragmatic decision to limit the literature review to English language randomized trials may have excluded data published in other languages or limited identification of relevant long-term follow-up data.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations are made for using ultraviolet protection, topical imiquimod, topical 5-fluorouracil, and cryosurgery. Conditional recommendations are made for the use of photodynamic therapy and diclofenac for the treatment of AK, both individually and as part of combination therapy regimens.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^40fa9e08]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis Preferred Practice Pattern Table 1 — molluscum contagiosum conjunctivitis presents with typically unilateral mild to severe follicular reaction and punctate epithelial keratitis, and may have corneal pannus especially if long-standing, with distinctive eyelid lesions described as single or multiple shiny, dome-shaped umbilicated lesion(s) of the eyelid skin or margin. Predisposing factors include predominance in older children and young adults and an immunocompromised state (e.g. HIV) that may predispose to multiple and/or large periocular lesions, and it is associated with chronic follicular conjunctivitis. Natural history notes that chronic conjunctivitis is associated with eyelid lesions that can spontaneously resolve or persist for months to years. Potential sequelae include conjunctival scarring, epithelial keratitis, pannus; less commonly, subepithelial infiltrates/haze/scar, occlusion of the puncta, and follicular conjunctivitis.

### Lichen planus eruption following annual influenza vaccination [^8264a807]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 58-year-old Caucasian man with no significant past medical history presented to dermatology with recent onset of a pruritic rash on his trunk and extremities. The patient denied new medications, products, or recent changes in health. Of note, he did receive an intramuscular influenza vaccine (Afluria Quadrivalent 2020–2021, Seqirus) 14 days prior to his skin eruption. He had received the influenza vaccine in the years before; however, this was the first time he experienced an adverse reaction following injection. On examination, the rash consisted of scattered multiple red scaly papules and plaques on the back and flexor area of the forearms (Fig 1, A and B). There was no nail involvement or mucosal change. He had no erythema or rash at the injection site. Polarized dermoscopy of the lesions revealed features of vessels as red dots and thick shiny white intersecting lines (Fig 2). The shiny white structures were annular, pearly-white areas with a pink background coloration consistent with Wickham striae. A skin biopsy revealed compact hyperkeratosis, wedge-shaped hypergranulosis, and a diffuse lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis associated with basilar vacuolar alteration consistent with LP (Fig 3). The absence of parakeratosis and the lack of eosinophils in the lichenoid infiltrate prohibited establishing the diagnosis of an LP-like drug eruption. The patient was treated with a medium-potency topical corticosteroid for several weeks, and his rash continued to fade. Clinicopathologic correlation led to a diagnosis of LP, which was likely secondary to influenza vaccination.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^ad87cf38]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

Skin care and xerosis management — patients are advised to avoid extreme temperatures and direct sun exposure, and "should refrain from using alcohol-containing lotions or skin products that may dehydrate skin". For mild or moderate xerosis, treatment "consists of thick moisturizing creams without fragrances or potential irritants", with occlusive, emollient creams "generally packaged in a jar or tub rather than a lotion that can be pumped or poured"; specific options "include urea, colloidal oatmeal, and petroleum-based creams". For scaly xerosis, "ammonium lactate or lactic acid creams can be utilized". Greasy creams "may be used on the limbs" but are "cautioned on the face and chest, along with extremely hairy sites, due to risk for folliculitis secondary to occlusion". For more severe xerosis "topical steroid creams may be necessary", while "Topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide gels are not recommended due to their drying effect".

Fig 3
Hyperkeratosis with mild papillomatosis and acanthosis. (Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnification: ×10.)

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis
B. Erythrasma
C. Tinea corporis and cruris
D. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV)
E. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK)

Answers:
A. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis – Incorrect. This autosomal dominant condition is characterized by episodic/seasonal circinate, erythematous plaques with scaling, and centrifugal peeling. It predominantly involves palms and soles and may extend up the extremities. It rarely involves the trunk and face. Blisters occasionally occur in the center of new plaques.
B. Erythrasma – Incorrect. Erythrasma is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum overgrowth in the stratum corneum. Well-defined scaly plaques involve intertriginous sites of the trunk and toes. Coral red fluorescence on Wood's lamp examination is classic and was negative in this patient's case.
C. Tinea corporis and cruris – Incorrect. Tinea corporis and cruris are dermatophyte infections of the trunk, extremities, and groin, respectively. Classic lesions have advancing, scaly border and central clearing. Hyphae are seen on histopathology and potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH prep).
D. EKV – Correct. EKV, an autosomal dominant disorder, presents with transient erythematous patches and stable hyperkeratosis. Individual erythematous lesions persist for minutes to hours, although they may last for days. Simultaneously or over time hyperkeratosis evolves. Sharply demarcated, yellow-brown to pink-brown plaques with figurate borders progressively develop on the limbs, buttocks, and trunk in nearly symmetrical distribution. Histopathology shows orthokeratosis, basket-weave hyperkeratosis, moderate-to-severe acanthosis with prominent granular layer, papillomatosis, and dilated elongated capillaries with minimal perivascular inflammation in the papillary dermis.
E. PSEK – Incorrect. PSEK begins during infancy or early childhood with fixed, sharply demarcated polycyclic hyperkeratotic plaques on erythematous base with fine scale or a rough, verrucous surface. They are symmetrically distributed on extremities, buttocks, face, and occasionally the trunk. Transient erythema and relative sparing of the face differentiate EKV from PSEK.

### Late-onset pretibial recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa [^b8ea6700]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pretibial epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare form of localized dystrophic EB, characterized by recurrent blistering and scarring plaques occurring predominantly in the pretibial area. In most cases, nail dystrophy, especially of the toenails, is also present. Often there are no clinical abnormalities at birth, and the disorder may only appear after several years. We report a patient who developed symptoms in his fifth decade. Genetic testing identified compound heterozygosity for two pathogenic mutations in the COL7A1 gene. This case highlights a rare variant of mechanobullous disease, and stresses the importance of molecular screening in establishing a correct diagnosis. Precisely why the disorder specifically localizes to the shins or why it may only become apparent in later life is not known.

### Pityriasis rubra pilaris as a systemic disease [^52849b80]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare inflammatory skin disorder of unknown etiology, initially described in 1835. It is characterized by keratotic follicular papules, well-demarcated salmon-colored erythematous scaly plaques interspersed with distinct islands of uninvolved skin, and palmoplantar keratoderma. Is PRP a systemic disease? Skin is mainly affected in PRP. Despite its clinical heterogeneity, PRP could be associated with a variety of rheumatologic, infectious, neoplastic, and other extracutaneous manifestations. We accept the hypothesis of not only an association but also a causative relation between skin and systemic manifestations with possible common underlying pathomechanisms such as systemic immunologic processes and superantigen mimicry.

Over the course of 6 months, an 8-year-old boy presented with cutaneous lumps: a postauricular lump, a fluctuant scalp lump, a lump adjacent to his shin, and a firm chest wall lump. Although he was born in the UK, his family were from Kenya and had visited there after the symptoms started. After multiple courses of antibiotics and antifungals with no improvement, he underwent ultrasound scanning that showed erosion of bone under the lumps and computed tomographic (CT) scanning which showed tibial osteomyelitis. A biopsy of the chest wall lump showed granulomatous inflammation, and pus was extracted from the shin lump that was negative on Ziehl-Neilsen and Gram staining. A tuberculin skin test was equivocal, Quantiferon test positive and 12 days later Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from the pus. The patient was started on quadruple antituberculous therapy and his skin lumps have improved. The long term outcome of the osteomyelitis remains to be seen.

### Blaschkolinear acquired inflammatory skin eruption (blaschkitis) following COVID-19 vaccination [^94cedeb1]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 46-year-old woman with no relevant past medical history was referred to the Department of Dermatology with a 4-month history of a unilateral pruritic cutaneous eruption on the left side of the trunk. The eruption was treated with topical medium-potency corticosteroids for several weeks without improvement. Physical examination revealed multiple isolated and clustered scaly erythematous flat papules, 2 to 4 millimeters in diameter, distributed on the left side of the trunk wall, over the left side of the abdomen, flank, and upper portion of the back. The lesions were limited to these particular areas and were arranged in a linear, haphazardly blaschkoid distribution (Fig 1). Dermatoscopy revealed shiny whitish striae on the surface of some lesions. The eruption began a few days after receiving the first dose of intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2) in her left arm. The patient denied any reaction with the initial injection site or any changes in the eruption after the second dose of the vaccine that she received 3 weeks later.

Fig 1
Clinical manifestations limited to the left side of the trunk.

Skin biopsy revealed a diffuse lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis and around the hair follicles, with interface vacuolar changes, foci of spongiosis, and the presence of apoptotic keratinocytes (Fig 2), consistent with a lichenoid/lichen planus–like eruption.

Fig 2

### Scalp dysaesthesia and lichen simplex chronicus: diagnostic and therapeutic update with literature review [^cef8e16f]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathogenesis

In terms of pathogenesis, SD has been linked to an underlying psychopathological background or to chronic pain syndrome. Localized radicular neuropathy and abnormal nerve conduction have been shown to be related to SD. Cervical spine involvement, in which a hyperexcitable state may interfere with pathways descending from an inhibitory centre responsible for pain and pruritus modulation, has also been shown to be associated with SD. While both pain and itch are induced by chemical messengers (histamine, tissue proteases and prostaglandins), there is evidence indicating that a unique subpopulation of unmyelinated C nerve fibres are directly activated by pruritus‐inducing stimuli. Other potential triggers of SD are stress, hairstyle, heat and seasonality. Psychological stressmay directly affect the skin via psychoneuroimmunological reactions due to cutaneous reactivity and sympathetic activation coordinated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis plays a central role in the regulation of epidermal barrier function, cutaneous immune function and cutaneous adnexal and dermal functions, maintaining local and systemic homeostasis. Psychological stress in patients with SD may be also aggravated by disorders such as cervical spine disease (mostly a degenerative disc disease) and muscle tension due to incorrect posture, resulting in nerve compression, which is correlated with the dermatomal distribution of pruritus. Consequently, the patient's medical history, habits, social background and environmental factors should be thoroughly investigated to assist in correct diagnosis and appropriate management of this frustrating condition.

Differential diagnoses

Owing to its symptoms, SD is often misinterpreted in the early stages as seborrhoeic dermatitis or red scalp syndrome, with subsequent delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment. As SD can be intensively pruritic, it can result in subsequent development of lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), which appears as single or multiple, clearly demarcated, thickened and hyperpigmented plaques, with scaling and alopecia due to hair breakage. However, LSC mostly involves the forearms, scrotum and shins, whereas scalp localization is rare. Clinical examination usually reveals single or multiple, irregular, polycyclic or oval‐shaped, well‐demarcated, thickened and hyperpigmented plaques. Presence of scales and alopecia due to hair breakage are not uncommon. LSC is the result of chronic and repetitive scratching. Scarring is rare, but can be observed in elderly patients.

Two months later, this patient suddenly developed a low-grade fever and 2- to 4-cm tender, erythematous swollen areas on the shins. There was no scarring or atrophy.

Question 3: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythema nodosum
B. Necrobiosis lipoidica
C. Nodular vasculitis
D. Pretibial myxedema
E. Factitial disease

Answers:
A. Erythema nodosum – Correct. Of the nonspecific manifestations of sarcoidosis, erythema nodosum is the most common. It is a hypersensitivity reaction in fat septae, but the pathophysiologic basis of this condition in sarcoidosis is unknown. It manifests as tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, most often on the anterior tibia. It can be accompanied by fever, malaise, and polyarthralgia.
B. Necrobiosis lipoidica – Incorrect. This condition is associated with diabetes mellitus and presents with atrophy, which was not seen in this patient.
C. Nodular vasculitis – Incorrect. Nodular vasculitis involves medium-sized arteries in the reticular dermis and can appear much like the nodular swellings of erythema nodosum. It is not associated with sarcoidosis.
D. Pretibial myxedema – Incorrect. Pretibial myxedema is the result of the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the dermis. It is most commonly associated with Graves disease. It is typically asymptomatic and is characterized by swelling and induration of the lower legs. It is not associated with sarcoidosis.
E. Factitial disease – Incorrect. This would be a consideration if the nodules in the tattoo were thought to be of factitial origin. Histopathology for factitial disease would be nonspecific with acute inflammation and scattered erythrocytes.

### The generalized rash: part II. diagnostic approach [^57b64ad2]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is important to begin the evaluation of generalized rash with an inclusive differential diagnosis, the possibilities must be narrowed down by taking a focused history and looking for key clinical features of the rash. Part I of this two-part article lists the common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rashes. In part II, the clinical features that help distinguish these rashes are described. These features include key elements of the history (e.g., travel, environmental exposures, personal or family history of atopy); characteristics of individual lesions, such as color, size, shape, and scale; areas of involvement and sparing, with particular attention to palms, soles, face, nails, sun-exposed areas, and extensor and flexor surfaces of extremities; pruritic or painful lesions; systemic symptoms, especially fever; and dermatologic signs, such as blanching, and the Koebner phenomenon.

### Mutations in KDSR cause recessive progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma [^caa86e56]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

The discovery of new genetic determinants of inherited skin disorders has been instrumental to the understanding of epidermal function, differentiation, and renewal. Here, we show that mutations in KDSR (3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase), encoding an enzyme in the ceramide synthesis pathway, lead to a previously undescribed recessive Mendelian disorder in the progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma spectrum. This disorder is characterized by severe lesions of thick scaly skin on the face and genitals and thickened, red, and scaly skin on the hands and feet. Although exome sequencing revealed several of the KDSR mutations, we employed genome sequencing to discover a pathogenic 346 kb inversion in multiple probands, and cDNA sequencing and a splicing assay established that two mutations, including a recurrent silent third base change, cause exon skipping. Immunohistochemistry and yeast complementation studies demonstrated that the mutations cause defects in KDSR function. Systemic isotretinoin therapy has achieved nearly complete resolution in the two probands in whom it has been applied, consistent with the effects of retinoic acid on alternative pathways for ceramide generation.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

A, Right shin showed multiple brown-to-violaceous reticulated patches and thin plaques. B, A close-up of a similar shiny plaque on the left shin showed changes suggesting atrophy and follicular prominence. C, Yellow-brown thin plaques on the left thigh. D, Violaceous-to-brown irregular patches on the right thigh.

A second skin biopsy from the right shin NLD-like lesion was obtained to reveal foci of epidermotropism by lymphocytes exhibiting moderate cytological atypia (Fig 2). Additional skin biopsy samples were obtained from patches and plaques of the bilateral medial thighs and right side of the upper abdomen, and in all cases histopathology was notable for a dermal perifollicular and perieccrine infiltrate composed of slightly enlarged lymphocytes. The lymphocytes were accentuated around hyperplastic eccrine coils and adnexotropism was noted (Fig 3). The NLD-like lesion on the right shin showed T-cell clonal expansion identified by 2 polymerase chain reaction peaks within on primary set (V1-8) that was matched to the clonal peaks observed in 2 other specimens showing STMF histology: 1 from the thigh and 1 from the abdomen. The diagnosis was consistent with STMF with some areas showing clinical and histopathologic features of NLD (Fig 3).

### A painful rash on a white woman [^8ff9b340]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^36efc081]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Chronic obesity lymphoedematous mucinosis: three cases of pretibial mucinosis in obese patients with pitting oedema [^8336962c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Pretibial mucin deposition on the shins is known as pretibial myxoedema. We report three patients with pretibial mucinosis without thyroid disease. The patients were characterized clinically by morbid obesity and bilateral lower extremity pitting oedema with gradual and painless onset, and that did not involve the feet and ankles. Vesicles, semitranslucent papules or a woody plaque were found on the shins. Histologically, patients showed characteristic features of epidermal atrophy with effacement of the rete ridge pattern, separation of collagen bundles associated with oedema with stellate to linear fibroblasts, upward-running increased capillary and small vessels with haemosiderin deposition, and mucin deposition at the superficial papillary dermis and around the vessels. We propose that the present cases of 'chronic obesity lymphoedematous mucinosis' belong to the clinical entity of pretibial mucinosis.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 10 post-travel evaluation [^62fefbba]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Skin ulcers — pathogenesis and common acute causes — form when a destructive process damages or erodes the epidermis, the skin's superficial layer, and then enters the dermis, the skin's deeper, more leathery layer. The most frequent causes of acute (duration < 1 month) cutaneous ulcers are the common pyogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, which create well-demarcated, shallow ulcers with sharp "punched out" borders known as bacterial or common ecthyma. Ulcers seen in some conditions, such as the chancre of primary syphilis, are ulcerated when they first appear, whereas most skin ulcers start as an elevated lesion, typically a papule or vesicle (or perhaps a larger plaque, nodule, or bulla), with an intact surface, and as the epidermal surface breaks down, the lesion evolves into an erosion or an ulcer.

### Structural and functional differences in skin of colour [^e30537d4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The term 'skin of colour' (SOC), refers to individuals of African, Latinx, Asian, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and Indigenous descent. These individuals typically have darker skin tones compared with white individuals and they often present with unique disorders of the skin or with common disorders that have a unique appearance. Certain skin conditions commonly associated with SOC patients, in contrast to individuals with lighter skin tones, are explained by structural and functional differences between this population and the white population. Variations in functional differences between these two groups are dependent on structural differences in melanosomes, stratum corneum, epidermis and dermis. Understanding the structural distinctions between white populations and SOC populations will provide insight into common disorders in SOC patients, including hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, dry skin, scaliness, xerosis, sensitive skin and keloids. Furthermore, understanding structural and functional skin difference will encourage more research regarding aetiology of disease and therapeutic interventions.

### Cutaneousinfection in an immunocompromised patient in the setting of postthrombotic syndrome successfully treated with posaconazole [^535813a3]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Physical examination found an edematous right leg with overlying violaceous discoloration and few indurated papules scattered over the anterior aspect of the shin (Fig 1). A few of the papules were complicated by hemorrhagic crust and scale. The affected area was extremely tender to palpation. Polymerase chain reaction study results were negative for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 and varicella zoster virus. Punch biopsy of an indurated papule on the right lower leg showed suppurative granulomatous dermatitis without any organisms observed on periodic acid–Schiff, acid-fast bacilli, or gram stains. He presented urgently 3 days later after he reported progression of his skin problem with new tender lesions and worsening pain. Repeated punch biopsies (for hematoxylin-eosin staining and tissue culture) were performed and he was admitted to the hospital for pain control and broad-spectrum antibiotics while initial tissue culture results were pending. Approximately 72 hours after biopsies for his initial tissue cultures were performed, fungal culture showed moderate growth of mold. Paecilomyces species was confirmed 1 week later for both tissue samples. Moreover, the second skin biopsy revealed a deep fungal infection with suppurative granulomatous dermatitis surrounding fungal hyphae (Fig 2, A and B). Results of tests for histoplasmosis (urine and serum antigen), blastomyces (urine antigen and antibody), and Coccidioides (urine antibody) were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right lower extremity showed infection limited to superficial tissues, without any evidence of osteomyelitis.

EGFR inhibitor-associated xerosis — prevention and treatment recommendations include bathing techniques using bath oils or mild moisturizing soaps and bathing in tepid water; regular moisturizing creams; and avoiding extreme temperatures and direct sunlight. For mild/moderate xerosis, emollient creams packaged in a jar/tub that lack fragrances or potential irritants are recommended, while alcohol-containing lotions are not recommended, with the practical note to use more greasy creams for the limbs but caution greasy creams on the face and chest. Additional options include occlusive emollients containing urea, colloidal oatmeal, and petroleum-based creams; for scaly areas, exfoliants such as ammonium lactate 12% or lactic acid cream 12% as well as urea creams (10–40%), salicylic acid 6%, and zinc oxide (13–40%) are recommended, whereas retinoids or benzoyl peroxide are not recommended; exfoliants may sting or burn on eroded or erythematous skin and should be applied only on intact skin. For severe xerosis, medium- to high-potency steroid creams are recommended, including triamcinolone acetonide 0.025%, desonide 0.05%, fluticasone proprionate 0.05%, and alclometasone 0.05%.

### Obesity-associated lymphedematous mucinosis and stasis mucinosis [^1ec0b0a0]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous dermal mucinoses are a group of conditions characterized by abnormal deposition of mucin (hyaluronic acid and sulfated glycosaminoglycans) in the dermis. They can be classified either as localized or generalized forms and occur primarily or secondarily to systemic disorders. Obesity-associated lymphedematous mucinosis and pretibial stasis mucinosis are uncommon and relatively newly recognized disorders occurring in obese patients or in patients with venous insufficiency. Clinically, patients present with papules and nodules progressing to plaques and arising in an erythematous and edematous basis on the legs, especially the shins. Histopathologic examination indicates mucin deposition in the superficial portion of the dermis, angioplasia with an increase in small blood and/or lymphatic vessels, vertically running vessels, slight fibrosis, and no inflammation. Laboratory workup and histopathologic testing are helpful in differentiating these entities from pretibial myxedema (thyroid dermopathy), which represents the main differential diagnosis. Obesity-associated lymphedematous mucinosis and stasis mucinosis are not different entities but belong to a spectrum of mucinoses secondary to an increased body mass index, chronic lymphedema, and/or chronic venous insufficiency.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^51e87460]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis differential diagnosis and reassessment — AD should be differentiated from other red, scaly skin conditions, and it is often difficult to separate AD from seborrheic dermatitis in infancy, with overlap possible in this age group. AD usually spares the groin and axillary regions, while seborrheic dermatitis affects these areas and tends not to be pruritic. Particularly if not responding to therapy, the diagnosis of AD should be re-reviewed and other disorders considered, including more serious nutritional, metabolic, and immunologic conditions in children and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in adults. The original UK criteria cannot be applied to very young children, although revisions to include infants have since been proposed, and allergic contact dermatitis may be both an alternative diagnosis to AD and/or an exacerbator of AD in some individuals.

### Sensitization properties of acetophenone azine, a new skin sensitizer identified in textile [^2657aae8]. Contact Dermatitis (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In 2018, following complaints of skin allergies from customers using footwear or garments, ANSES (French Agency for Food Environment and Occupational Health and Safety) investigated which compounds could be responsible for these adverse effects. Acetophenone azine (CAS no. 729‐43‐1) was suspected to be involved as it was already associated to several cases of severe contact dermatitis in children and adults since 2016. Four case reports were published in 2016 and 2017 involving three boy soccer players and an adult hockey player. Acetophenone azine was measured in socks, sneakers, children's leather shoes, walking shoes, shin pads, acrylic fur at concentrations between 20 (sneakers) and 70 ppm (children's shoes). No data were available at this time on the presence of acetophenone azine in other products. In the framework of a scientific cooperation agreement with the technical centre on leather funded by ANSES (ANSES/CTC 2015‐CRD‐22), this substance was found in 14% of the footwear articles tested by France and in particular in sports equipment like shoes, socks and shin pads.

The first case with severe allergic contact dermatitis caused by acetophenone azine present in the shin pads of a 17‐year‐old hockey player was reported in the United Kingdom in 2019. Another case of acetophenone azine‐induced shin pad and sports shoe dermatitis was reported in 2020 in a North American 6‐year‐old soccer player.

Skin sensitization is an immunological process that follows two phases: the induction of sensitization followed by the elicitation of the immune response. The first phase includes a sequential set of events which are described in the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) no. 40 as shown in Figure 1 taken from Strickland et al.

FIGURE 1
Flow diagram of the pathways associated with skin sensitization

Two in vitro human cell‐based assays and one in vivo experiment are described in this AOP. The objective of this work was to perform these assays in order to confirm experimentally and better characterize the skin sensitization potential of acetophenone azine.

### Clinical study on the effects of the applied volume of moisturizer in patients with asteatosis [^30f79972]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Asteatosis, also xeroderma, is caused by decreased water content of the epidermal stratum corneum resulting from a decrease in moisture retention factors (subcorneal intercellular lipids, natural moisturizing factors, sebum, and sweat), and a decrease in the barrier function is observed in some patients. Factors that cause asteatosis are physiological factors (such as age‐related changes), habits (such as excessive body washing), pathological factors (such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, anticancer drug treatment, or dialysis therapy), and environmental factors (such as low humidity and low temperature). In patients with asteatosis, the skin becomes white, scaly, and cracked, and is often itchy. Scratching destroys the skin barrier and leads to asteatotic eczema or nummular eczema. In elderly patients, in particular, age‐related reduction of sweating and sebum secretion lead to asteatosis and asteatotic eczema, which are commonly seen in clinical practice. These conditions are accompanied by itching, which causes poor quality of life, including a reduction in daily activities, appetite loss, or sleep disorders. In addition, asteatosis also worsens other skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Thus, it is important to prevent asteatosis.

### Image-based artificial intelligence in psoriasis assessment: the beginning of a new diagnostic era? [^0132112a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Image Segmentation of Lesions

In addition to correctly identifying psoriasis on skin photographs, a critical step in performing next-level tasks such as assessing disease severity is the automated detection and delineation of individual lesions. Manual image segmentation is a tedious task for dermatologists, so researchers have focused on developing automated image segmentation algorithms. A major advantage for this feat is that psoriatic lesions are usually easy to distinguish from the surrounding unaffected skin. However, challenges arise from poor image quality, including insufficient illumination, blur, or artifacts such as camera reflections, as well as the polymorphic appearance of lesions. Previous algorithms often relied on feature engineering (e.g. feature-based Bayesian framework), lacked accuracy, or failed to segment challenging input images correctly (e.g. Markov random field combined with a support vector machine), limitations that have been partially overcome by the use of CNNs. Dash et al. developed PsLSNet, a 29-layer deep U-net-based CNN (designed for image segmentation, featuring a U-shaped architecture that effectively captures context in images and enables precise localization), which automatically extracts spatial information and was validated on 5241 images from 1026 psoriasis patients, including more challenging images. Results showed an accuracy of 94.8%, outperforming all previous approaches. In addition, two deep learning models (DLMs) based on a U-net architecture with a ResNet backbone (which enables training of very deep models with hundreds or thousands of layers) were developed and trained by Amruthalingam et al. to anatomically map and segment hand eczema lesions with high accuracy. According to the authors, this model could also be applied to psoriasis, as both conditions can present very similarly with red, scaly patches and plaques on the dorsal and palmar aspects of the hands.

At the histopathological level, CNNs are expected to provide future clinical support by automatically analyzing skin biopsy images. As a first step, a U-net-based CNN was applied by Pal et al. to successfully segment psoriasis skin biopsy images into epidermis, dermis, and non-tissue, which is a prerequisite for the development of more sophisticated models that can recognize characteristic pathological features of the disease within each skin layer. Such forms of image segmentation are not only valuable at the microscopic level, but can also be applied to macroscopic images to evaluate the presence of lesions, as well as disease extent and severity, as outlined in the following sections.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^96728fd3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Papular rashes are the most common, while urticaria is short‐lived

Photographs of rashes were shared by 2328 surveyees, and 260 photographs were randomly selected to be assessed by four experienced dermatologists, who divided them into five common categories: papular, urticarial, vasculitic body, livedo reticularis and acral lesions. We discarded 52 photographs (20%) rejected by at least one dermatologist because the image was blurred, or the area photographed was too small to evaluate, or the person could be de‐anonymized. Out of the 208 good‐quality photographs, 30 were judged as not attributable to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (e.g. acne, shingles, molluscum contagiosum, pompholyx eczema, perioral dermatitis, impetigo or tinea; 14.4%), and 18 were discarded due to a disagreement in diagnosis between dermatologists (8.7%), resulting in 160 photographs used in the subsequent analyses. Notably, when asked whether a photograph showed a COVID‐19‐related skin rash, the four dermatologists agreed 82.2% of the time, and three out of four dermatologists agreed 95.7% of the time. The three most common presentations were papular rashes (including erythematopapular and erythematovesicular types, 41.2%), urticaria (30.0%) and acral lesions (23.1%). The overall levels of agreement for acral lesions and urticaria were 96.6% and 80.9%, respectively. Papular rashes showed the lowest agreement (76.4%), possibly because some the papular rashes may be more subtle and more difficult to photograph. Examples of COVID‐19 cutaneous manifestation are shown in Figure 2 and Figures S6–S8 (see Supporting Information). A large website, created in collaboration with the British Association of Dermatologists and including 400 manually curated high‐quality photographs, is available at.

### Three types of skin-surface thermometers: a comparison of reliability, validity, and responsiveness [^cef100e9]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of a thermistor thermometer (thermistor) and two different infrared thermometers (one designed to measure tympanic temperature and one for skin temperature).

Design

Reliability and validity were evaluated by making two separate measurements from the skin at identical spots of each hand, forearm, shoulder, thigh, shin, and foot in 17 healthy subjects. Intramuscular temperature was recorded at the hand and shin sites. Test-retest reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation for each instrument. Pearson correlation assessed the relationship between the skin and intramuscular temperatures at the hand and shin sites (validity). Each instrument's ability to measure temperature change (responsiveness) was assessed by measuring skin temperatures serially from 17 limbs of ten patients with complex regional pain syndrome undergoing intravenous regional sympathetic blockade. Responsiveness index values were calculated.

Results

Reliability was strong and similar for each device (intraclass correlation: thermistor = 0.96, tympanic = 0.96, skin = 0.97), as was validity (r: thermistor = 0.90, tympanic = 0.92, skin = 0.92). Responsiveness was marginally better for the infrared skin device (responsiveness index: skin = 4.2, tympanic = 3.6, thermistor = 3.6).

Conclusions

For the purposes of clinical electrodiagnostic laboratory and other physiatry applications, the performance of the infrared thermometers is equal to or superior to that of the traditionally used thermistor. All three devices are highly reliable and valid, whereas the infrared skin device is slightly more responsive. Infrared thermometers have the advantage of being quicker to operate and more portable.

Fig 2
Pretibial myxedema. After 5 treatments (20.7 cm long × 13 cm wide × 0.3 cm deep).

Although the precise pathogenesis of PTM is unknown, it is theorized that circulating autoantibodies bind to TSH-Rs on fibroblasts, stimulating T cells to secrete cytokines that promote production of glycosaminoglycans, namely hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, resulting in excess mucin deposition within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.PTM classically presents as bilateral, asymmetric, firm, nonpitting, painless nodules and plaques that favor the anterior shins. Conventional therapy includes topical or intralesional corticosteroids and pressure therapy as first line, with oral pentoxifylline as second-line therapy. Intralesional triamcinolone alone has been shown to decrease size and improve appearance of lesions of PTM. In the above case, we propose a synergistic effect when used with hyaluronidase. Hyaluronidase is readily available commercially to enhance the dispersion and absorption of subcutaneous drugs and to correct complications related to hyaluronic acid soft tissue augmentation. Treatments are generally well tolerated, with transient burning pain, erythema, and pruritus at the injection site.

### Algorithm in the diagnosis of febrile illness using pathogen-specific rapid diagnostic tests [^3582405e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Model

A stochastic model using Monte Carlo simulation in R statistical software version 3.5.0 was applied to examine the accuracy of combinations of diagnostic tests in predicting the true cause of fever given the diagnostic performance and disease prevalence for a particular setting. The model accounts for 5 diseases for which commercial RDTs with previously described sensitivity and specificity are available.

Each simulated patient was assigned a disease by comparing disease prevalence with random number drawn from uniform probability function. This provided the pretest diagnosis or the disease assigned to a patient before being subjected to any test. The true-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative diagnoses for each patient were predicted by comparing test accuracies with the random numbers from the uniform probability function. The code to run the simulation and generate outputs is provided in the Supplementary Materials.

We applied the model for the application of tests simultaneously and sequentially in all possible algorithms.

The number of possible algorithms in sequential testing is 5! = 120
Simultaneous testing = 1

Model Output

We predicted the correct diagnosis scores for the simultaneous testing approach, and each algorithm under the sequential testing approach. We further predicted the proportion of patients correctly diagnosed for each disease as well as the predictive values for each test. The mathematical interaction between disease prevalence and diagnostic test accuracies in predicting the correct diagnosis and predictive values is provided in the Supplementary Materials.

Web-based Application

We applied the same methods to develop a web-based application using R and the web application framework R package "shiny". The web application runs 10 000 simulations of each algorithm and outputs the predicted correct diagnoses and positive predictive values (PPVs) for each of those algorithms, highlighting the test sequence for the optimally performing ones.

### Skin manifestations of running [^924aaeac]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

As the United States comes increasingly closer to being the heaviest nation on earth, many people are turning to exercise, especially running, to lose weight. Most runners, whether novice or professional, will have a skin disorder that may prompt them to seek medical attention. Although case reports and sports reviews have discussed, in a cursory fashion, the nature of these skin lesions, to our knowledge there has never been an extensive review of the literature that specifically addresses the skin diseases of runners. In this article, we present the epidemiology, origin, clinical characteristics, treatment, and prevention of skin diseases inherent to runners.

### Pretibial myxedema in a patient with HIV and hypothyroid to hyperthyroid transformation [^4e7f4114]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 41-year-old African American woman presented with a 1-year history of dark plaques on bilateral shins that expanded to involve the dorsal feet. There is no associated drainage, discharge, pruritus, or pain. On examination, hyperpigmented indurated plaques with boggy nonpitting edema were observed on the lower shins extending to the dorsal feet bilaterally (Fig 1). Exophthalmos was also noted. Her medical history included a 12-year history of hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine 100 mcg, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (4.68 uIU/mL), and free T4 (0.49 ng/dL) levels 6 months before the presentation were consistent with a hypothyroid state. The patient also had a history of HIV treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) since 2012 and was taking bictegravir 50 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir 25 mg. HIV viral load and CD4 count 1 month prior to the presentation were 98 copies/mL and 422 cells/mm³, respectively. Biopsy from the left shin showed large amounts of mucin deposition in the reticular dermis, confirmed by a colloidal iron stain (Fig 2). Diagnosis of pretibial myxedema was relayed to the patient's endocrinologist, and she was subsequently found to be in a hyperthyroid state with positive thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (421 IU/mL) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (12 IU/mL) with TSH < 0.02 uIU/mL.

### Persistent pruritic papules and plaques associated with adult-onset Still's disease: report of six cases [^9a8e1b4f]. The Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Typical skin rash, which appears and disappears along with respective rise and fall of fever, is well-known, and included as one of the major criteria of adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) (Yamaguchi's criteria). In addition, various skin lesions are occasionally observed in association with AOSD. Persistent pruritic eruptions present with some clinical features, such as urticarial erythema, flagellate erythema, erythematous, slightly scaly or crusted papules, and/or plaques on the trunk and extremities. These lesions show unique histological features such as dyskeratosis with a peculiar, distinctive distribution in the upper epidermis and cornified layers with focal hyperkeratosis. We describe herein six cases of AOSD, which presented with skin lesions of persistent pruritic papules and plaques. All six cases were female, and three of them were elderly women. The patients presented with linear erythematous streaks, scaly erythema, keratotic papules, infiltrative plaques and irregular coalesced erythemas. By contrast, histological features were characteristic, and dyskeratotic cells were found in the horny layers as well as in the upper layers of the epidermis. Persistent pruritic eruption is an important cutaneous sign for the diagnosis of AOSD.

### Common mental health disorders in adults with inflammatory skin conditions: nationwide population-based matched cohort studies in the UK [^38f2b9c4]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis are common in adulthood; up to 10% worldwide have atopic eczema and up to 2% of UK adults have psoriasis. Eczema (or atopic dermatitis) is characterised by recurrent skin lesions and intense itch and psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterised by red scaly skin plaques.

Evidence indicates that eczema and psoriasis are associated with substantial comorbidity including mental health conditions. However, most previous studies have not addressed temporality adequately and there is an absence of evidence regarding the effect of psoriasis on the risk of mental illness. High-quality longitudinal evidence is therefore necessary to better understand why and when common mental illnesses occur in people with skin conditions.

Anxiety and depression are leading disease burdens worldwide and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Evidence demonstrates that people with eczema/psoriasis are at increased risk of anxiety and depression. Plausible explanations for the association between eczema/psoriasis and anxiety/depression may include genetic risk factors, inflammation and living with a chronic disease, related lifestyle factors (drinking, smoking, reduced exercise), comorbidities linked to eczema/psoriasis, stigma due to visible skin disease, or strong medications taken to treat the skin disease. The association between eczema/psoriasis and anxiety/depression may also differ by age, sex or over time due to changing prescribing and recording habits. Many of these mechanisms have not been accounted for in previous research but are available in primary care records, such as comorbidities, steroid use and problems sleeping in people with eczema.

As both anxiety/depression and atopic eczema/psoriasis are common, a better understanding of this association and at-risk population groups could be of public health importance. Therefore, we conducted large, matched-cohort studies using routinely collected UK primary care records to better understand why and when new-onset anxiety or depression occurs in over 5 million UK adults with and without eczema/psoriasis.

### Cutaneous manifestations of endocrine disorders: a guide for dermatologists [^e436c437]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Dermatologists may commonly see skin lesions that reflect an underlying endocrine disorder. Identifying the endocrinopathy is very important, so that patients can receive corrective rather than symptomatic treatment. Skin diseases with underlying endocrine pathology include: thyrotoxicosis; hypothyroidism; Cushing syndrome; Addison disease; acromegaly; hyperandrogenism; hypopituitarism; primary hyperparathyroidism; hypoparathyroidism; pseudohypoparathyroidism and manifestations of diabetes mellitus. Thyrotoxicosis may lead to multiple cutaneous manifestations, including hair loss, pretibial myxedema, onycholysis and acropachy. In patients with hypothyroidism, there is hair loss, the skin is cold and pale, with myxedematous changes, mainly in the hands and in the periorbital region. The striking features of Cushing syndrome are centripetal obesity, moon facies, buffalo hump, supraclavicular fat pads, and abdominal striae. In Addison disease, the skin is hyperpigmented, mostly on the face, neck and back of the hands. Virtually all patients with acromegaly have acral and soft tissue overgrowth, with characteristic findings, like macrognathia and enlarged hands and feet. The skin is thickened, and facial features are coarser. Conditions leading to hyperandrogenism in females present as acne, hirsutism and signs of virilization (temporal balding, clitoromegaly). A prominent feature of hypopituitarism is a pallor of the skin with a yellowish tinge. The skin is also thinner, resulting in fine wrinkling around the eyes and mouth, making the patient look older. Primary hyperparathyroidism is rarely associated with pruritus and chronic urticaria. In hypoparathyroidism, the skin is dry, scaly and puffy. Nails become brittle and hair is coarse and sparse. Pseudohypoparathyroidism may have a special somatic phenotype known as Albright osteodystrophy. This consists of short stature, short neck, brachydactyly and subcutaneous calcifications. Some of the cutaneous manifestations of diabetes mellitus include necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, diabetic dermopathy, scleredema adultorum and acanthosis nigricans.

DLS performance on the testing dataset

We again evaluated the DLS on the testing dataset for each fold. The model achieved a mean top-1 accuracy of 0.592 (SD 0.007) and a mean top-5 accuracy of 0.821 (SD 0.133). The confusion matrix with the testing data (Fig. S3B) shows that most STI conditions, except condylomata lata and chancroid, achieved over 60.0% top-1 accuracy. Condylomata lata was often confused with genital warts, dermatosis, and herpes, while chancroid was frequently confused with chancre, herpes and genital warts. Non-STI classes, except drug reaction, naevus, phimosis and skin infections, achieved 60.0–83.0% top-1 accuracy. Shingles was frequently misclassified with the herpes virus and drug reaction was often misclassified as a non-syphilis rash. Additionally, naevus was also frequently confused with malignant pigmented lesions.
