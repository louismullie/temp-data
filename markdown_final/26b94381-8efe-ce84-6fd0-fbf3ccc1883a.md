## Question

A 18-year-old girl is brought to the hospital by her parents in extremis with rapidly progressive septic shock, with fulminant progression to respiratory distress and intubation. Progresses to refractory vasoplegia and dies in the ICU after 36 hours despite maximal care. Post-mortem blood cultures show group A streptococcus. What ONE examination maneuver was forgotten that led to the missed diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which single examination maneuver was forgotten that led to the missed diagnosis in an 18-year-old girl who died of rapidly progressive group A streptococcal septic shock. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and why it fits the fulminant course. Then, I should verify the classic source of infection in this age group and whether a focused exam would reveal it. Next, I will review guideline-based priorities for source identification and whether a specific bedside maneuver is repeatedly emphasized. Finally, I will synthesize the answer and confirm it aligns with the highest-yield, time-critical action that could have changed management and outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. The presentation of rapid-onset shock, multiorgan failure, and GAS bacteremia is classic for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, which carries high mortality and often progresses from a localized source to systemic collapse within 24–48 hours, explaining the 36-hour trajectory described [^1131gt1k] [^114LYyLq].

> Wait, let me verify the likely source in a previously healthy adolescent. In this age group, invasive GAS frequently originates from the throat, with pharyngitis serving as the portal of entry; missing a careful oropharyngeal exam is a recurring theme in missed STSS, and guidelines emphasize early identification of the anatomic source of infection to enable timely source control and targeted therapy [^112f1xpA] [^114WmUw9].

> I need to check whether any single bedside maneuver is repeatedly highlighted as the forgotten step. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign repeatedly calls for rapid identification or exclusion of a specific anatomical diagnosis requiring emergent source control, and in GAS sepsis, the oropharynx is a high-yield site to examine for erythema, exudates, tonsillar enlargement, or peritonsillar abscess that would immediately suggest the source and guide both antibiotics and the need for drainage or ENT involvement [^114WmUw9] [^113u6iB7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm that this is the most actionable, time-critical exam in this scenario. While a full head-to-toe skin exam is important, the highest-yield, repeatedly missed maneuver in adolescent GAS sepsis is the focused oropharyngeal examination for streptococcal pharyngitis or peritonsillar disease, which would have directed earlier clindamycin for toxin suppression, penicillin for organism kill, and consideration of source control if abscess was present, all of which improve outcomes in STSS [^113MEu1L] [^111RJWUV].

> Let me reconsider whether any alternative single maneuver would supersede this. Surgical exploration for necrotizing infection is the gold standard when NSTI is suspected, but that is not a universal first-line maneuver in an undifferentiated adolescent without localizing signs; by contrast, a throat exam is noninvasive, instantaneous, and directly addresses the most common source in this age group, making it the one forgotten maneuver with the greatest potential to change early management in this case [^111KxkVQ] [^113B5mU4].

> Final answer: The forgotten examination maneuver was a focused oropharyngeal examination for streptococcal pharyngitis or peritonsillar abscess, which would have identified the source of infection and enabled earlier source-targeted therapy and source control considerations in this rapidly progressive GAS toxic shock syndrome [^114WmUw9] [^113u6iB7].

---

The forgotten examination maneuver was a **throat examination** for pharyngitis or tonsillar abscess, which would have revealed the source of invasive group A streptococcus and prompted earlier antibiotics and source control. Early recognition of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is critical because progression from initial symptoms to shock and organ failure can occur within 24–48 hours, and mortality remains high despite aggressive care [^1131gt1k] [^114LYyLq]. A focused oropharyngeal exam is a **high-yield, low-cost step** that could have altered management and outcomes in this case.

---

## Clinical significance of throat examination in invasive GAS infections

- **Portal of entry**: The oropharynx is a common portal of entry for invasive GAS, and early identification of pharyngitis or tonsillar abscess can guide timely antibiotic therapy and source control [^notfound].

- **Early recognition**: STSS often follows a prodrome of pharyngitis or upper respiratory infection; recognizing this early can trigger aggressive management and improve outcomes [^114LYyLq].

- **Source control**: Identifying a tonsillar abscess or severe pharyngitis allows for early ENT involvement and drainage, which is critical in controlling the infection source [^notfound].

---

## Evidence from clinical guidelines and literature

- **SSC 2021**: Emphasizes rapid identification of the anatomical source of infection and implementation of source control as soon as possible [^114WmUw9] [^115yzGF2].

- **IDSA 2025**: Recommends using clinical scoring systems (Centor or McIsaac) to identify patients with sore throat who should be tested for GAS, especially in high-risk scenarios [^113u6iB7].

- **CDC**: Highlights the rapid progression of STSS, with hypotension and organ failure developing within 24–48 hours, underscoring the need for early recognition and intervention [^1131gt1k] [^114LYyLq].

---

## Clinical implications of missed throat examination

Missing a throat examination in a patient with rapidly progressive septic shock can delay **diagnosis and treatment**, worsening outcomes. Early recognition of GAS pharyngitis or tonsillar abscess enables prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotics (including clindamycin for toxin suppression) and source control, which are critical in managing STSS [^113MEu1L] [^111RJWUV].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The forgotten examination maneuver in this case was the **throat examination** for pharyngitis or tonsillar abscess. Early identification of the oropharyngeal source of infection could have facilitated timely antibiotic therapy and source control, potentially altering the patient's outcome. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for invasive GAS infections in young patients presenting with septic shock and ensure a thorough oropharyngeal examination is performed [^1131gt1k] [^114LYyLq].

Insights and Implications — In summary, when sepsis is definite or probable and regardless of the presence or absence of shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. In a patient with shock and possible sepsis, antimicrobials should also be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. If sepsis is possible and shock is absent, then the patient should be rapidly assessed for an infectious versus a noninfectious cause of acute illness, including obtaining a history and physical examination, testing for infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness, and treating acute conditions that can mimic sepsis. Ideally, assessment should be completed within 3 hours of presentation and antimicrobials should be administered within that time if the likelihood of infection is thought to be high.

### Sepsis and septic shock [^1132HoKV]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Early recognition of sepsis and septic shock in children relies on obtaining an attentive clinical history, accurate vital signs, and a physical examination focused on mental status, work of breathing, and circulatory status. Laboratory tests may support the diagnosis but are not reliable in isolation. The goal of septic shock management is reversal of tissue hypoperfusion. The therapeutic end point is shock reversal. Mortality is significantly better among children when managed appropriately. Every physician who cares for children must strive to have a high level of suspicion and keen clinical acumen for recognizing the rare but potentially seriously ill child.

Discussion

Group A streptococcus is one of the most frequent pathogens in humans, a normal upper respiratory tract commensal in 5–15% of normal individuals, responsible for a broad spectrum of clinical entities, the most commonly occurring illnesses being streptococcal tonsillitis, scarlet fever and more rarely, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). First described at the end of the last century, STSS (Group A streptococcal infection associated with the early onset of shock and organ failure.) carries a significant morbidity and mortality (up to 70%), is more common in adults than children and is increasingly being reported in patients who have no predisposing factors. Over the last 15 years however, there has been a significant increase in the incidence and severity of infections caused by Group A Strep, including STSS seen in children, thought to be a response to more virulent and resistant strains of the bacteria evolving. It is more likely to mimic peritonitis than appendicitis, and is therefore an essential differential to be borne in mind when confronted with a peritonitic, rapidly deteriorating previously well child following an initial upper respiratory tract infection, which has failed to improve despite simple medical management.

There are very few case reports of children with Group Strep A. presenting as Appendicitis. We have come across only 3–4 case reports in English literature from 1965. Hence we would like to re-emphasis the need to keep this medical condition on our differential diagnosis while treating appendicitis.

Case report

Miss AL, a six year old girl was seen in A&E with pyrexia, diarrhoea and vomiting, hip and shoulder pain pyrexia of two days duration. She had also complained of a sore throat and earache of four days duration. Her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis. No investigations were performed at this time and she was discharged with Diarolyte.

The patient returned four days later with persistent multi-joint pains; having now developed diffuse abdominal pain and distension and at this point a surgical opinion was sought.

The child was pyrexial and hypoxic, and clearly unwell. Ear, nose and throat examination was normal at this time as it had been one week previously. She had peritonitis localised to the right iliac fossa and an overlying cellulitis. Note was also made of an intermittent roving erythematous but non pruritic rash over her wrists and distal limbs.

The full blood count (white cell count 25.6, neutrophils 23.1 platelets 47) and C-reactive protein (248 mg/L) were consistent with fulminant sepsis.

Following an equivocal abdominal ultrasound scan the patient was taken to theatre.

Laparotomy revealed copious fibrin deposits and a congested caecum and appendix which were not felt to be due to acute appendicitis. appendicectomy was performed.

Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefuroxime, metronidazole and gentamicin) the patient deteriorated rapidly, developing disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal failure. She was kept intubated and required admission to the paediatric intensive care unit for inotropic and ventilatory support for 48 hours post operatively. Blood cultures from admission and peritoneal swabs from laparotomy grew a fully sensitive group A streptococcus at 48 hours, after which her antibiotics were rationalised and she was commenced on clindamycin. Her condition improved and she was discharged from hospital after two weeks with no post infection sequelae to date.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [^114khgei]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Perhaps more noteworthy than the emergence of Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (StrepTSS) is its persistence for a period of more than 15 years in most geographical areas and an actual increase in incidence in some regions. Early diagnosis remains a problem, and aggressive surgery often cannot be avoided. The continuing rates of mortality and morbidity indicate the need for novel approaches to diagnosis and treatment.

### Approach to the patient with recurrent infections [^112jSPSk]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Children with a history of recurrent or unusual infections present a diagnostic challenge. Differentiation between frequent infections caused by common risk factors, versus primary immune dysfunction should be based on a detailed history and physical examination and, if indicated, followed by appropriate laboratory studies. A high index of suspicion could lead to an early diagnosis and treatment of an underlying immune deficiency disease. This article presents to physicians an approach to the evaluation of children with recurrent infections. Important details from the history and physical examination, and an appropriate choice of screening laboratory test to be ordered in a given situation are discussed.

CI confidence interval, IQR interquartile range, IVF intravenous fluid, LOS length of stay, NP-MODS new or progressive –multi organ dysfunctions, OR odd ratio, RR relative risk, SS septic shock, SSC survival sepsis campaign, VSs vital signs

So where to from here then? Future sepsis interventions need to identify the patient group most likely to respond to a specific intervention. First of all, is the patient actually suffering from an infection and can we speed up time to diagnosis allowing earlier appropriate antimicrobial treatment using molecular diagnostics? Second, can we develop faster, easily accessible markers and scoring systems to reliably identify children with dysregulated immune response? Can these help us to discriminate subgroups that benefit from more/less aggressive fluid resuscitation, early inotropes, and therapeutic adjuncts such as antitoxin therapy, immune modulators and extracorporeal life support? Third, maybe one of the most important paradigm changes the Early Goal Directed study promoted, was the realization that ED and ICU represent a care continuum rather than two separate entities. Using early serial observations to discriminate responders from non-responders to the initial sepsis bundle will help to develop powerful tools to rapidly identify patients who should receive early ICU support.

In conclusion, re-shaping our approach to infection, sepsis, and sepsis severity in children is not just an academic exercise but is key to developing screening tools for early recognition and designing trials addressing the right target groups. Thanks to the creation of large international paediatric research networks, these questions can now be addressed in collaborative studies.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome presenting as septic knee arthritis in a 5-year-old child [^113hFNDh]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Group A streptococci, also known as Streptococcus pyogenes, is a common cause of infection in the pediatric population. Recently, the incidence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, a serious and often deadly manifestation of group A streptococci infection, has increased. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome often presents with complaints of musculoskeletal pain, which frequently leads to early involvement of an orthopaedic surgeon. In this case report, we present a 5-year-old child who presented with a septic arthritis of the knee, whose final diagnosis was streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. A review of the literature and the aspects of this case report emphasize the emergent nature of streptococcal joint infections and the judicious use of orthopaedic intervention in such patients.

### Early intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for group A β-haemolytic streptococcal meningitis with toxic shock syndrome [^113FPFbg]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A woman in her forties was transferred to a Sydney (Australia)-based tertiary hospital, following presentation to a regional hospital with group A Streptococcus (GAS) otomastoiditis; complicated by meningitis, venous sinus thrombosis, haemorrhagic cerebral infarction and subdural empyema. She rapidly deteriorated with profound cardiovascular collapse. Despite initiation of high dose vasoactive therapy, she remained shocked and developed multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Early intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (140g in two doses) was initiated as an adjunct to antimicrobial, surgical and supportive care for refractory streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Over the course of a twelve-day intensive care unit stay she made good progress with de-escalation of her vasoactive supportive care and reversal of her organ injuries. She was subsequently discharged to ward-based care. At her three-month follow-up appointment she had significantly reduced neurological deficit. Five months following her presentation to hospital she had returned to full-time work.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a major bacterial pathogen affecting children globally. Approximately 15% of school-age children experience a symptomatic episode of GAS culture-positive pharyngitis each year. Although the incidence of invasive GAS disease under these circumstances is low (0.5%-2%), an increasing number of invasive GAS cases have been reported over the last 2 decades. This report describes a 7-year-old boy who, after being treated for GAS pharyngitis, developed a fatal streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

### Fatal streptococcal toxic shock syndrome from an intrauterine device [^111EuNB5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The occurrence of toxic shock syndrome from an intrauterine device (IUD) is very rare.

Objectives

To raise awareness of the risk of toxic shock syndrome caused by an IUD, to educate others about when to suspect this complication, and to provide treatment recommendations.

Case Report

A 49-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department in septic shock after complaining of 5 days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination findings included a diffusely tender and rigid abdomen with free fluid on bedside sonogram. She was found, on computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis, to have an IUD with moderate ascites. The IUD was removed, and both her IUD and her blood cultures grew out group A Streptococcus. Despite aggressive medical management, which included multiple vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics, she died from group A streptococcal sepsis, with the IUD as her most likely source. Her clinical presentation and laboratory findings meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Her diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy.

Conclusion

IUDs should be considered as a possible source of infection in patients with an IUD who present with symptoms consistent with toxic shock syndrome. These patients need to be aggressively managed with early surgical intervention.

### Group a Streptococcus causing necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome after medical termination of pregnancy [^112M2hPe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Group A Streptococcus is an aerobic gram-positive bacteria known to cause cutaneous infections. Invasive infections can lead to toxic shock syndrome with multiorgan failure and mortality rates of 25–48%.

Case

A healthy, young woman developed necrotizing fasciitis, myonecrosis, and toxic shock syndrome after an elective medical termination of pregnancy. This patient had confirmed group A Streptococcus on blood cultures and underwent surgical debridement. After aggressive surgical treatment, below-the-knee amputation, and antibiotic therapy, the patient survived.

Conclusion

This case demonstrates the need for prompt recognition and treatment of necrotizing fasciitis/toxic shock syndrome.

### Uncommon cause of pelvic inflammatory disease leading to toxic shock syndrome [^116hqKS3]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 44-year-old Caucasian female with a history of endometriosis is admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe left lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. With patients' positive chandelier sign on pelvic examination, leucocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein indicated that she had pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PCR tests were negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis; however, her blood and urine cultures grew Group A streptococci (GAS) with a negative rapid Streptococcus throat swab and no known exposure to Streptococcus On further review, patient met criteria for GAS toxic shock syndrome based on diagnostic guidelines. The patient was promptly treated with intravenous antibiotics and supportive care, and she acutely recovered. This case demonstrates a rare cause of PID and an atypical aetiology of severe sepsis. It illuminates the importance of considering PID as a source of infection for undifferentiated bacteraemia.

### Clinical practice guideline update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis [^113u6iB7]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to clinical scoring systems, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using a clinical scoring system, such as Centor or McIsaac, to determine which patients with sore throat should be tested for group A streptococcus.

- strongly consider testing high-risk patients even if their clinical scores are low. High-risk patients include those with sore throat who have had household exposure to group A streptococcus, such as living or sleeping in the same indoor shared space as a person diagnosed with group A streptococcus infection, a history of previous rheumatic fever diagnosis, or symptoms or signs suggestive of complicated local or systemic group A streptococcus infection, such as peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess, scarlet fever, and/or toxic shock syndrome

- use a clinical scoring system as part of the evaluation of patients with sore throat. The principal utility of a scoring system is to identify patients with a low probability of group A streptococcus pharyngitis, in whom further evaluation by diagnostic testing is unlikely to be helpful

- given the lack of evidence favoring any particular scoring system, clinicians and patients may favor clinical scoring systems that do not include laboratory tests

- recognize that the recommendation to use a scoring system does not apply to children under 3 years of age, as group A streptococcus infection in this age group may not present with typical clinical features represented in these scoring systems.

### Necrotizing fasciitis [^11721fja]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare, rapidly progressive bacterial soft tissue infection with a high risk for morbidity and mortality. Although more common in adults, NF also affects the pediatric population. Many bacterial organisms can cause NF, but group A Streptococcus is the most common monomicrobial cause of disease. Necrotizing fasciitis remains principally a clinical diagnosis, and it is often missed early in its presentation because of the difficulty in differentiating it from more common soft tissue infections. The criterion standard for diagnosis and the mainstay of therapy are surgical debridement. Time to initiation and completion of therapy remains the most important factor in patient outcome, highlighting the importance of early recognition and intervention in this potentially devastating disease.

---

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^112JmoCK]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NSTI can rapidly progress to a life-threatening septic process, unless its evolution is curtailed by aggressive surgical debridement. Key to this is prompt diagnosis which can be straightforward in typical cases where patients present with classical features, but mimics and occult disease can confuse diagnostic accuracy. Several scoring systems which can be practicably applied in the ED, have been proposed, based on laboratory indices and cross-sectional imaging, but no test is infallible. Clinicians need to exercise a high threshold for considering the diagnosis of NSTI, use scoring systems judiciously, but fundamentally, surgical exploration remains the diagnostic gold standard.

### What's new in sepsis recognition in resource-limited settings? [^115HEnB6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

With regard to identification of the underlying type of infection, we recommend taking a structured patient history and performing a systematic head-to-toe physical examination (online supplement Table 3) to identify the underlying type of infection; thereby, consideration of local epidemiology of infectious diseases is crucial. Depending on their availability/affordability, we recommend performing additional diagnostic evaluations such as laboratory testing and/or radiographic or ultrasound imaging to identify the source of infection, as guided by the history and physical examination.

With regard to identification of the causative microbiological pathogen, we recommend, if available/affordable, obtaining microbiological cultures before antimicrobial therapy as long as this does not relevantly delay antimicrobial therapy. We recommend taking two or more sets of blood cultures and/or tissue/body secretions from the site of suspected infection. We recommend performing microscopy and Gram staining of secretions sampled from the suspected source of infection. If available/affordable, we recommend testing for antibiotic susceptibility of cultured bacteria to guide antibiotic therapy. If resources to test for antibiotic susceptibility are not routinely available, we suggest performing intermittent microbiological screening of antimicrobial susceptibility of selected pathogens to inform empirical antimicrobial strategies. We recommend using rapid diagnostic tests to diagnose malaria; alternatively, we recommend light microscopy of stained blood smears performed by experienced staff. We recommend using direct (early disease phase) or indirect (intermediate or later disease phase) laboratory methods to diagnose specific virus infections such as dengue, influenza, or ebola virus disease. All patients with an acute infection who are positive for the human immunodeficiency virus, suffer from immunosuppression of other causes (e.g. malnutrition), had previous tuberculosis infection and/or close contact with person suffering from tuberculosis should be screened for tuberculosis co-infection. We recommend light emitting diode microscopy of two sputum smears for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Whenever available/affordable, we recommend using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to diagnose tuberculosis or performing tuberculosis cultures in HIV-positive patients.

With regard to recognition of septic shock, we recommend defining septic shock as the presence of two or more clinical indicators of systemic tissue hypoperfusion independent of the presence of arterial hypotension. If available/affordable, we recommend measuring arterial lactate levels in patients with sepsis. In dengue sepsis, we recommend using a reduction in the arterial blood pressure amplitude ≤ 20 mmHg to diagnose shock. We recommend against relying solely on arterial hypotension as a diagnostic criterion for the diagnosis of septic shock, as arterial hypotension is typically a preterminal event and associated with an exceedingly high mortality in sepsis patients in resource-limited settings.

### About streptococcal toxic shock syndrome | Group A strep… [^1131gt1k]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a rare, but serious bacterial infection.
- STSS can develop very quickly into a life-threatening emergency.
- People with STSS need immediate care in a hospital and antibiotics.
- Treatment focuses on managing low blood pressure and multiple organ failure.
- Speak with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about STSS. Symptoms First symptoms of STSS often include:

- Fever and chills
- Muscle aches
- Nausea and vomiting After the first symptoms start, it usually only takes about 24 to 48 hours for low blood pressure to develop. Once this happens, STSS quickly gets much more serious:

- Hypotension
- Organ failure
- Tachycardia
- **Tachypnea Examples of organ failure signs**: Someone with kidney failure may not make urine.

Someone with liver failure may bleed or bruise a lot or their skin and eyes may turn yellow. When to seek immediate medical attention Complications STSS often results in complications from organs shutting down and the body going into shock. Complications can include needing surgery to remove infected tissue or limbs to control the infection. Even with treatment, STSS can be deadly. Out of 10 people with STSS, as many as 3 people will die from the infection. Prevention There are things people can do to protect themselves and others from group A strep infections. Keep ReadingPreventing Group A Strep Infection. Testing and diagnosis There is no single test used to diagnose STSS. Instead, healthcare providers may collect blood or other samples to test for group A strep infection. They can also order tests to see how well different organs are working.

Healthcare providers diagnose STSS when the patient has all the following:

- A group A strep infection
- Low blood pressure
- **Problems with 2 or more organs Organs that can be affected by STSS include**:
- Blood
- Kidney
- Liver
- Lung
- Skin
- Soft tissue.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in a pediatric patient with intramuscular venous malformation in the neck [^1175eMLc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is diagnosed based on signs of shock with multiorgan system involvement, a generalized erythematous macular rash, and rapidly progressive and destructive soft tissue infection.

Case Report

The patient was a 2-year-old girl with intramuscular venous malformation in the neck in which an infection occurred, developing into STSS. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Group A streptococcal infections are common in children and usually have a mild clinical presentation, but may be life threatening in severe cases. Patients with venous malformations are known to have slow-flow anomalies with venous pooling, which can result in hypoxia and possible immune cell dysfunction. Thus, clinicians should be aware of STSS when a patient with venous malformation has a rapidly progressive infection.

### Top 10 pearls for the recognition, evaluation, and management of maternal sepsis [^1145Jr2M]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

The deadliest pathogen in infectious sepsis is invasive group A streptococcus (also known as Streptococcus pyogenes). Group A streptococcus is not part of the normal microbiome of the urogenital tract. It is present in only 0.03% of individuals, so routine screening is not recommended. Group A streptococcus causes a diverse range of infections including endomyometritis, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonia, cellulitis, and pharyngitis. Patients with group A streptococcus have rapid clinical deterioration; in 75% there are less than 9 hours between the first signs of infection and septic shock, and in 50% of patients this progression occurs in less than 2 hours. Due to this rapid clinical deterioration, about 20% of women will die within 7 days of diagnosis. Although the incidence of invasive group A streptococcus has been increasing globally over the past 30 years, the incidence has remained stable in the United States at 3.48 per 100,000 persons.

Both viral and fungal pathogens can cause maternal sepsis. Pregnant women are at greater risk of viral sepsis than the general population. The most common viral pathogens associated with maternal sepsis are influenza, varicella zoster, and herpes simplex virus. Patients with sepsis from viral infections typically present with pneumonia, but may also present with hepatitis, encephalitis, coagulopathy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or septic shock. –

Several viral infections confer a high risk of mortality in pregnancy. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may result in end-organ dysfunction and mortality rate on the order of 1.3% during pregnancy. A rare but important viral pathogen is varicella zoster, which causes chickenpox, and severe infections are associated with mortality rates of 3–14% in pregnancy. The risk for varicella pneumonia increases with advancing gestational age. Disseminated herpes simplex infection, although uncommon during pregnancy, may occur with a primary mucous membrane infection during the third trimester, and carries a maternal mortality rate of approximately 50%.

### Toxic shock syndrome: the great masquerader [^116LCQaP]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome is a rare but potentially lethal toxin-mediated illness that can be caused by streptococcal and staphylococcal species. It initially presents as a febrile illness that rapidly progresses to multiorgan dysfunction, hence a high index of suspicion coupled with rapid verification of the diagnosis and aggressive treatment is required to improve the outcome of the disease. A 23-year-old man presented with high-grade fever associated with headache, retro-orbital pain, gastroenteritis and gum bleeds. Treatment was initiated keeping in mind the possibility of dengue haemorrhagic fever. However, further clinical deterioration led us to re-examine our patient, revealing an old neglected wound. Microbiological confirmation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from the wound swab and prompt institution of appropriate treatment led to a favourable outcome in a case known to be associated with serious morbidity and mortality.

We suggest that, whenever possible, antimicrobial therapy should we withheld until objective evidence of infection has been obtained.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^113A5XNJ]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Adjunctive antimicrobial therapy

In addition to broad spectrum antibiotics, we routinely administer clindamycin to patients with refractory septic shock until initial microbiological analyses have excluded toxin-producing pathogens or until stabilisation of organ dysfunction is achieved. Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis and prevents generation of super-antigens. It is an inexpensive and accessible intervention with a proven efficacy in toxic shock syndrome. Although recommended by several guidelines, clindamycin is often considered late into a patient's presentation despite maximal benefit being associated with early administration.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)

Treatment with IVIG in patients with septic shock has been proposed for several decades. There is extensive biological plausibility as to the beneficial immunological effects of IVIG in patients with toxin-mediated septic shock. However, the literature remains conflicting, with several meta-analyses failing to demonstrate improved outcomes. Although current guidelines recommend against the routine use of IVIG in septic shock, it is acknowledged that further trials are needed. Early administration is likely to offer the optimal prospect of benefit. We empirically initiate treatment with IVIG to progressively deteriorating patients with refractory septic shock secondary to suspected toxin-producing organisms such as group A streptococcus (1 g/kg on day 1, then 0.5 g/kg on days 2 and 3) or Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) Staphylococcus aureus (2 g/kg on day 1, repeated on day 3 if no improvement).

### Fulminant infection and toxic shock syndrome caused by Streptococcus pyogenes [^114Zjrd2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Two patients presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with features of toxic shock syndrome, including hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal and hepatic insufficiency and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Computed tomography (CT) scan identified the source of infection in one patient. At laparotomy, pelvic peritonitis and massive edema of the pelvic retroperitoneal tissue was found. The other patient had myonecrosis of the forearm necessitating amputation. Intra-operative cultures of tissue in each case yielded Streptococcus pyogenes, Group A. These patients were treated early with clindamycin and intensive supportive care as well as surgery, and both made a full recovery. Because of the necessity of early recognition of the varied presentation of these infections, the clinical features as well as essential interventions are emphasized. We review the pathophysiology of invasive Group A streptococcal infection to increase awareness of these uncommon but fulminant and often lethal infections.

Sepsis in pregnancy and the postpartum period

Marian Knight (Figure 4)

Sepsis is an important cause of both morbidity and mortality in pregnancy and the postpartum period; approximately one in every thousand women giving birth will develop sepsis, with half of these women progressing to severe sepsis and 3 to 4% developing septic shock. Maternal sepsis is a challenge in both low- and high-resource settings; one-quarter of women who die within the 6 weeks after pregnancy in the UK die from sepsis. Globally, an estimated 11% of maternal deaths are caused by sepsis, the vast majority occurring in developing regions.

There are several well-recognized risk factors for maternal sepsis, including the presence of pre-existing medical conditions such as anemia, febrile illness in the 2 weeks prior to diagnosis of sepsis, and, most notably, mode of delivery. Cesarean delivery and operative vaginal delivery are both associated with severe maternal sepsis. The predominant causes of maternal sepsis vary according to the timing of infection; antenatally, infections of the urinary tract make up about one-third of all cases of maternal sepsis, whereas postnatally, one-third of sepsis is due to genital tract infections. Overall, infections due to E. coli are most numerous, but infections with Group A Streptococcus are significantly associated with greater severity of sepsis. There is good evidence that pregnant women are at higher risk of complications of certain specific infections, for example, influenza, varicella zoster, and listeria.

Pregnant and postpartum women are, in general, young and fit and compensate well, even in the presence of severe infection. Infection may thus be well established before a diagnosis of sepsis is made. Early consideration of the diagnosis and, hence, early recognition is therefore perhaps even more critical in the obstetric population. This is dependent on both the measurement of vital signs in any unwell pregnant or postpartum woman, as well as acting on the findings. Although pregnancy and childbirth is a normal physiological process, normality cannot be assumed in the presence of abnormal signs or symptoms. It is important to note that symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, breathlessness, and diarrhea, may be associated with postpartum sepsis. Additionally, maternal sepsis should always be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in a postpartum woman presenting with shock. Although hemorrhage is the commonest cause of shock in a postpartum woman, possible sepsis must be investigated, particularly if blood loss is only moderate and treatment for hemorrhage appears ineffective.

### Distributive shock in the emergency department: sepsis, anaphylaxis, or capillary leak syndrome? [^114Bym59]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Distributive shock is a hyperdynamic process resulting from excessive vasodilatation. Impaired blood flow causes inadequate tissue perfusion, which can lead to end-organ damage. Although the most common etiology is septic shock, anaphylactic and other etiologies should be considered.

Case Report

We report the case of a 30-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with nonspecific symptoms and hypotension after a viral upper respiratory infection. Her physical examination revealed mild edema and rebound tenderness in the right upper and bilateral lower quadrants. She also presented with hypotension concomitant with hypoperfusion symptoms, which were manifested by the loss of consciousness in the hour after her presentation. Neither etiologic agent nor drug use history was provided at the presentation; these may have caused anaphylaxis; however, she later reported that she took a propolis extract 1 day earlier. The hypotensive state was refractory to large amount of crystalloid infusion and a series of examinations were performed to determine the shock etiology. Computed tomography images showed pneumonic infiltrates in the lower zone of the right lung, an enlarged liver, a thickened gallbladder wall, and an extensive amount of free fluid in the perihepatic and retroperitoneal areas. All radiologic changes were thought to be due to a secondary condition that triggers them, none were considered as septic focus. Capillary leak syndrome was considered in differential diagnosis and 3 days after her presentation, her hypotension improved and she was discharged in a healthy state. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Capillary leak syndrome is a variant of distributive shock. After assessing other etiologies for this condition, emergency physicians should focus on a triggering event that may have caused hypoalbuminemia and a fluid shift.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome: a case series emphasizing the urgency of recognition and tailored treatment [^11192fMk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but lethal condition associated with Streptococcus Pyogenes Group A (GAS). With rising incidence and high mortality, timely recognition and management are crucial. This case series presents two adult TSS cases caused by invasive GAS, highlighting the importance of early identification and multidisciplinary management.

Case Presentations

The first case involves a 42-year-old male who presented with fever, dizziness, and a tender, erythematous olecranon following an elbow laceration. Despite negative imaging for necrotizing fasciitis, a positive throat swab for GAS prompted immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive resuscitation. Clindamycin and intravenous immunoglobulin were administered. The patient developed TSS and acute kidney injury, requiring intensive care and hemodialysis. The second case features a previously healthy 43-year-old female presenting with systemic symptoms and a rash, without trauma history. Positive GAS blood cultures confirmed TSS, leading to similar management and subsequent renal complications requiring hemodialysis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? These cases highlight the evolving epidemiology of invasive GAS infections and the associated risk of TSS. Early identification and appropriate tailored treatment are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality, especially given the recent surge in invasive GAS. Clinical vigilance for skin changes and thorough laboratory investigations, including non-sterile site cultures, are critical. Early identification enables the use of adjunctive treatments like clindamycin and IVIG, and facilitates appropriate de-escalation of antibiotics. Prompt consultation with infectious disease, intensive care, and surgical teams is necessary to ensure optimal treatment.

### Culture negative empyema in a critically ill child: an opportunity for rapid molecular diagnostics [^113uSzdh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A previously healthy two-year-old girl was transferred to our tertiary care center from her pediatrician's office in acute respiratory distress. Her symptoms began six days before arrival with nasal congestion, sore throat, non-productive cough and fever; her oral intake and activity level had both decreased, as well. Her two siblings had recently recovered from mild upper respiratory infections, presumed to be due to a viral infection. The patient also complained to her parents of pain in the ribs and abdomen. In her pediatrician's office, point of care testing for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Group A β-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection were both negative.

Her past medical history was unremarkable. She had been a full term infant who was born by vaginal delivery without complications. She had been diagnosed with RSV infection at eight months of age, and had an uneventful recovery. Her immunizations were up-to-date, and she had no allergies. She lives with mother, father and two siblings, all of whom are non-smokers. The family has no pets, and the family history was unremarkable. In the developmental history, all milestones had been achieved in a normal sequence and time.

On exam, she was initially afebrile: axillary temperature was 36.6°C, respiratory rate and heart rate were 20 breaths/min and 138 beats per minute, respectively and blood pressure was 138/77 mmHg. Height was 36.6″ inches (63% percentile) and weight 16.3 kg (96% percentile). Pulse oximetry was 93% on room air. She was listless. Her head, ear, eyes, nose and throat exam were unremarkable. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. She was tachycardic, but the rhythm was regular, and no murmur was appreciated. Pulmonary examination was notable for diminished breath sounds on the left. Abdominal, neurological, skin and musculoskeletal exam were unremarkable.

Laboratory studies on the day of admission showed leukocytosis, anemia, and decreased albumin (Table 1). A two view chest X-ray was notable for a left lung infiltrate. Low dose screening computer tomography (CT) scan of the chest demonstrated a left upper lobe pneumonia with decreased contrast enhancement of the left upper lobe, concerning for left upper lobe ischemia, and a moderate to large left pleural effusion, but no evidence for empyema or compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe (Figure 1).

### Surviving sepsis: updated guidelines from the society of… [^111AXjoS]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

- After initial resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids, further fluid resuscitation should be based on intravascular volume status and organ perfusion from dynamic measures.
- Empiric antibiotics should be started within one hour in septic shock and within three hours without shock. Empiric coverage for MRSA, gram-negative resistance, or fungal infection is recommended if these pathogens are considered likely. Resuscitation With sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or shock, resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids is recommended within the first three hours. Failing to meet this initial resuscitation guideline delays resolution of hypotension and increases intensive care duration and mortality. Although lactate levels often will not decrease to normal, levels approaching normal suggest successful resuscitation. Normalization of capillary refill time can also demonstrate resuscitation.

If vasopressors are necessary after initial fluid resuscitation, the target mean arterial pressure is 65 mm Hg because higher targets do not improve survival. Vasopressors should be started peripherally rather than waiting for central venous access. Arterial blood pressure monitoring is essential and carries low risks of limb ischemia and bleeding. Intensive care admission should be completed within six hours because mortality increases when emergency department stays exceed that time frame. Infection Control Reducing time to administration of antimicrobials reduces mortality. For patients in septic shock, antimicrobials should be started within one hour because mortality increases with each hour of delay. In sepsis without shock, the evidence is less clear, and antimicrobials are recommended within three hours of recognition.

Adding procalcitonin to clinical evaluation for antibiotic initiation does not improve mortality, length of intensive care, or hospitalization and is not recommended. Because methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounts for one in 20 infections in critically ill patients, empiric antimicrobial therapy should cover for MRSA in patients at high risk because delays can increase mortality. Although empiric combination antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria do not improve overall mortality, combination antibiotics are recommended for patients at high risk for multidrug-resistant organisms. Similarly, empiric antifungal agents do not improve short-term mortality in critically ill patients but are recommended for patients at high risk for invasive fungal infections.

### Gram-positive toxic shock syndromes [^111RJWUV]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute, multi-system, toxin-mediated illness, often resulting in multi-organ failure. It represents the most fulminant expression of a spectrum of diseases caused by toxin-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus). The importance of Gram-positive organisms as pathogens is increasing, and TSS is likely to be underdiagnosed in patients with staphylococcal or group A streptococcal infection who present with shock. TSS results from the ability of bacterial toxins to act as superantigens, stimulating immune-cell expansion and rampant cytokine expression in a manner that bypasses normal MHC-restricted antigen processing. A repetitive cycle of cell stimulation and cytokine release results in a cytokine avalanche that causes tissue damage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and organ dysfunction. Specific therapy focuses on early identification of the illness, source control, and administration on antimicrobial agents including drugs capable of suppressing toxin production (eg, clindamycin, linezolid). Intravenous immunoglobulin has the potential to neutralise superantigen and to mitigate subsequent tissue damage.

Pediatric sepsis — definitions of antimicrobial therapy types are as follows: Empiric antimicrobial therapy is "initial antimicrobial therapy started for suspected infection in the absence of definitive microbiologic pathogen identification", and "may consist of single or multiple agents but should be broad spectrum in nature" and "should be based on local, regional, or national pathogen epidemiology and patient risk factors". Targeted/definitive antimicrobial therapy is "antimicrobial therapy targeted to specific pathogen(s), usually after microbiologic identification", and "may consist of single or multiple agents, but should not be broader than required to treat the specific pathogen(s) after microbiologic identification". Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is "an antimicrobial regimen with activity against multiple different groups of bacteria or other pathogens considered to be likely causes of the clinical presentation", and "may consist of single or multiple agents". Multiple-drug antimicrobial therapy is indicated when "more than one antimicrobial agent is needed to either 1) expand the spectrum of coverage…; 2) decrease the likelihood of resistance…; or 3) provide synergy to treat a suspected or known pathogen".

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^115yzGF2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock — source control timing and method selection — source control should be achieved as soon as possible following initial resuscitation, with smaller studies suggesting that source control within 6 to 12 hours is advantageous and studies generally showing reduced survival beyond that point; the failure to show benefit with source control implemented in less than 6 hours may be a consequence of limited numbers and heterogeneity. Prolonged efforts at medical stabilization in lieu of source control for severely ill patients, particularly those with septic shock, are generally not advised. Selection of optimal source control methods must weigh benefits and risks, pursue the least invasive option that will effectively achieve source control, consider open surgical intervention when other interventional approaches are inadequate or cannot be provided in a timely fashion, and recognize that surgical exploration may be indicated when diagnostic uncertainty persists despite radiologic evaluation or when the probability of success with percutaneous procedures is uncertain or the undesirable effects of a failed procedure are high.

Conclusions

In summary, we present a rare combination of endocarditis caused by S. pyogenes in two children with previously normal hearts admitted to the same hospital in a two-week time period, both with signs of toxic shock. Our cases show that in cases of S. pyogenes sepsis or toxic shock, consideration should be given to a concurrent diagnosis of endocarditis, even if the heart is structurally normal. When treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and supportive care in a timely manner, even severe presentations of S. pyogenes endocarditis and toxic shock can have excellent outcomes.

Key points
- Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a rapidly progressing infection involving shock and multi-organ failure.
- Diagnosing STSS can be difficult and patients are often misdiagnosed.
- Treatment focuses on addressing issues with shock and specific organs that are failing.
- Treatment includes antibiotics and frequently surgery to remove the source of infection.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with STSS. Cause STSS is a disease defined as an infection with Streptococcus pyogenes accompanied by sudden onset of shock and organ failure. S. pyogenes are also called group A Streptococcus. When the bacteria produce exotoxins and virulence factors in the deep tissues and bloodstream, it can induce a cytokine cascade. Massive cytokine cascades contribute to the development of shock or organ failure.

Strains that produce certain virulence factors and exotoxins, particularly streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins, are more likely to cause severe infections, including STSS. Keep ReadingGroup A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread Incubation period The incubation period for STSS varies depending on site of entry. Once initial symptoms occur, hypotension generally develops within 24 to 48 hours. Clinical features Initial symptoms STSS often begins with influenza-like symptoms, including:

- Chills
- Fever
- Myalgia
- Nausea
- Vomiting Disease progression These symptoms often quickly progress to sepsis with
- Hypotension
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea
- Signs and symptoms suggestive of specific organ failure Any of the following organ systems may fail:

- Blood
- Kidney
- Liver
- Lung. Treatment Hospitalization STSS requires hospitalization. Standard treatment of shock and organ failure, such as fluid resuscitation, is imperative as the first step in treatment.

Complications Known complications of shock and organ failure can occur:

- Tissue necrosis
- Loss of extremities Mortality rates Despite aggressive treatment, the mortality rate for STSS can exceed 30%. Mortality from STSS increases with age and is substantially lower in children than adults. Clin Infect Dis. 2002; 35: 950–9. Erratum in: Clin Infect Dis. 2003; 36: 243.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^114zHw6V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO₂/FiO₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

Best practice statements (BPSs) and "in our practice" statements — BPSs were developed as ungraded strong recommendations within strict conditions suggested by the GRADE Working Group and were issued when evidence could not be summarized or assessed using GRADE methodology but benefit or harm was deemed unequivocal. The panel also issued recommendations "against" an intervention based on low or very low quality of evidence when there was uncertain benefit but very likely or certain harm, including high costs. When evidence was insufficient to make a recommendation but guidance based on current practice patterns was appropriate, the panel issued "in our practice" statements, developed through a survey of panelists to ascertain their state of current practice; these statements are intended only to describe current variation in care and are not meant to be construed as recommendations. The SSC is committed to ensuring that guidelines are updated or affirmed every 4 years or sooner if breaking and relevant evidence becomes available.

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management… [^115zwJZn]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Although an increasing number of patients admitted for sepsis become well enough to be discharged from the hospital, these patients have higher rates of readmission and of death within 12 months and significantly reduced physical and cognitive function compared with matched controls.
7. 8, 9 The terminology was simplified, and sepsis and septic shock are now the only recognized terms. 8, 9 Sepsis is now defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Septic shock is defined as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality. 12 and is used in the ICU to predict in-hospital mortality. It assesses the severity of dysfunction for six organ systems in critically ill patients. The score is calculated at the time of ICU admission and then every 48 hours.

An increase in the SOFA score by at least two points from baseline indicates acute organ dysfunction with a presumptive diagnosis of sepsis and an increase in mortality rate of greater than 20%. 13, 16. After initial airway and respiratory stabilization, patients with sepsis should complete the sepsis bundle within three hours of presentation. 24–27 Vasopressor therapy is initiated if the patient is hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation. 21, 28, 29 Infection source control with early surgical consultation should be obtained for suspected infections requiring operative or other interventional treatment.

Treatment FLUID RESUSCITATION The priorities in early sepsis management are establishing vascular access and initiating fluid resuscitation. Patients with sepsis should receive an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours. 49 Fluid administration should be restricted in the latter phases of sepsis management. At 72 hours, the net fluid balance goal should be close to zero or slightly negative. Each 1-L increase in net positive balance at 72 hours is associated with increased risk of death.

Pediatric sepsis — factors guiding initial empiric antimicrobial selection: "The initial choice of empiric antimicrobials should take into account the specific clinical history (e.g., age, site of infection, concomitant disease states, comorbid conditions, indwelling devices)". "Patients with recent or current hospital exposure should receive empiric therapy that considers known infection or colonization, as well as any recent antimicrobial exposures". "Institutions or regions should identify the most appropriate first-line single-agent antimicrobial, taking into account anatomic site of infection, age, local epidemiology, and host comorbidity and risk factors", and for complex or recently hospitalized patients, selection "should also take into account concomitant underlying diseases, chronic organ failure, indwelling devices, the presence of immunosuppression or other form of immunocompromise, recent known infection or colonization with specific pathogens, and recent receipt of antimicrobials". "When available, an infectious diseases clinician should be consulted", and "Other nonbacterial pathogens that are suspected as a cause of infection should also be targeted as part of initial antimicrobial therapy on a case-by-case basis".

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by group G Streptococcus, United Kingdom [^115nW6UZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) was defined in 1993 as the isolation of group A Streptococcus (GAS) with parameters indicative of multiorgan dysfunction. STSS remains associated with high mortality rates, even with adequate antimicrobial treatment. Recently, 12 invasive infections with β-hemolytic streptococci of Lancefield group G also fulfilling the criteria of STSS have been reported (mortality rate 83%). The benefit of adjunctive intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in the treatment of STSS is difficult to prove because the limited number of cases precludes results of sufficient statistical power. Observational studies and 1 small, early terminated, randomized control trial have demonstrated improved survival among patients with GAS STSS treated with IVIg. We describe 3 patients treated in an 880-bed teaching hospital during 2009–2014; all 3 patients had illness meeting the case definition of STSS that were caused by invasive group G Streptococcus (GGS) infection. Successful treatment included IVIg, providing further support for the use of IVIg in treating STSS.

Diagnostic recognition challenges and mimics in suspected sepsis in the emergency department are emphasized, noting that no single test accurately and reliably establishes a diagnosis of sepsis and that sepsis can be difficult to recognize in the immunocompromised, the elderly, and those presenting very early in the course of illness. The report states that 20% to 40% of patients with suspected sepsis in the ED are ultimately diagnosed with a noninfectious sepsis mimic, and that these patients with sepsis mimics rarely benefit from all aspects of sepsis-directed care. It cautions that anchoring on a diagnosis of sepsis early in the illness course can result in missed or delayed diagnosis and treatment of the true cause of acute illness. It also notes that a singular episode of hypotension portends a worse outcome and that sepsis outcomes worsen with delays in care, but giving sepsis-specific care when sepsis does not exist may not offer benefit and can risk harm.

### Severe sepsis and acute myocardial dysfunction in an adolescent with Chlamydia trachomatis pelvic inflammatory disease: a case report [^117FyZGc]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although generally asymptomatic, severe Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infections have been documented. C. trachomatis has been associated with myocarditis as well as sepsis.

Case

A 19-year-old girl with type 1 diabetes mellitus developed sudden-onset mental status change and shock after resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis. Abdominal and pelvic imaging showed uterine and adnexal inflammation, and pelvic examination confirmed a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. The patient was intubated, required vasopressor support, and developed severe biventricular myocardial dysfunction. Infectious myocarditis workup was negative. Nucleic acid amplification testing from vaginal discharge was positive for C. trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis and negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

Summary and Conclusion

C. trachomatis should be considered in the workup of septic shock, particularly in populations at high risk for sexually transmitted infections.

### Chance to cut: defining a negative exploration rate in patients with suspected necrotizing soft tissue infection [^113B5mU4]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Physical examination findings and predictive lab models fail to identify every patient with NSTI. The clinical differences between patients who have an NSTI and those who do not are subtle — they present similarly, grow common causative organisms, and have equivalent mortality rates. Surgical exploration remains the gold standard for diagnosis and should not be delayed if there is a high index of suspicion. Our institution found a 20% negative exploration rate. As some negative explorations later progressed to NSTI, we recommend ongoing vigilance by the surgical team until clinical improvement is seen. We advocate for future multi-institutional studies to validate an acceptable negative exploration rate in patients suspected to have an NSTI.

Necrotizing fasciitis — definition, clinical features, and bacteriology are detailed. Necrotizing fasciitis is "an aggressive subcutaneous infection that tracks along the superficial fascia", and "it is the superficial fascia that is most commonly involved". The initial presentation "is that of cellulitis", progressing with "systemic toxicity, often including high temperatures, disorientation, and lethargy", and a distinguishing feature is "the wooden-hard induration of the subcutaneous tissues". In the monomicrobial form, pathogens "are S. pyogenes, S. aureus, V. vulnificus, A. hydrophila, and anaerobic streptococci (Peptostreptococcus)", with most infections "community acquired and present in the limbs, with approximately two-thirds in the lower extremities". Cases after varicella or trivial injuries are "usually due to S. pyogenes", and in group A streptococcal disease with hypotension and organ failure, mortality is "ranging from 30% to 70%". Among S. pyogenes cases, "Nearly 50%" have "no portal of entry" and instead develop deep infection at a site of nonpenetrating trauma. Polymicrobial infection is "most commonly associated with 4 clinical settings" including perianal/abdominal sources, decubitus ulcers, injection sites in illicit drug users, and spread from genital sites.

### Infectious shock and toxic shock syndrome diagnoses in hospitals, Colorado, USA [^113dwcJF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

First described in 1978, toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe febrile illness now confirmed to be caused by exotoxin-producing strains of Staphyloccocus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Investigations based on extensive chart review and/or microbiology laboratory data suggest little or no decrease in overall TSS incidence and an increase in streptococcal TSS. Given the persistence and severity of TSS and the differences in its treatment from other causes of septic shock, its evolving epidemiology needs to be accurately monitored. To this end, we assessed International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)–coded TSS cases in Colorado, USA.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113MEu1L]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — surgical and antimicrobial management centers on urgent debridement, broad coverage for aerobes including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and targeted therapy for group A streptococcus. Surgical intervention is the primary therapeutic modality and is indicated when infection is confirmed or suspected, and most patients should return to the operating room 24–36 hours after the first debridement and then daily until no further debridement is needed. In the absence of definitive trials, antimicrobial therapy should continue until further debridement is unnecessary, the patient has improved clinically, and fever has been absent for 48–72 hours. For polymicrobial infections, treatment should cover both aerobes, including MRSA, and anaerobes, using vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin combined with one of piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and ertapenem), ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole, with coverage modified once microbiology is known. Necrotizing fasciitis and/or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by group A streptococcus should be treated with both clindamycin and penicillin; clindamycin suppresses streptococcal toxin and cytokine production and observational studies suggest greater efficacy than β-lactams. Reported macrolide resistance in group A streptococci is < 5.0% in the United States, 8.2% in Germany, and 18.3% in Spain, and no resistance to clindamycin was found from invasive strains in Chicago.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in the immediate postpartum period [^114P3Drd]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In the puerperal phase, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a relatively uncommon occurrence. However, there has been a rise in the prevalence of more aggressive strains of Group A Streptococcus (GAS), leading to significant maternal morbidity and mortality. In this report, we present a case of a postpartum patient who developed streptococcal toxic shock syndrome with substantial inflammation shortly after delivery. The patient presented on the second postpartum day with hypotension, high fever, hypogastric tenderness and anaemia. After timely workup and appropriate antibiotic therapy, the patient fully recovered. Culture studies confirmed Gram-positive septicaemia with the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes in both the patient's blood and a previously inserted intrauterine device (IUD). This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for GAS as the cause of puerperal infections despite its rarity. This results in prompt administration of antibiotics and source control, preventing consequences and avoiding mortality.
