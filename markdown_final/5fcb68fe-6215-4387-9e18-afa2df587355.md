## Question

at what egfr spironolactone contraindicated in kidney disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when spironolactone is contraindicated in chronic kidney disease based on eGFR. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about regulatory labeling and major guideline positions that define hard contraindications. Then, I should verify heart failure-specific guidance, because HFrEF has a different risk–benefit calculus than resistant hypertension or CKD per se. Next, I will review high-quality trials in stage 3b CKD and HFpEF to understand real-world tolerability and net clinical effect. After that, I need to examine dose-modification thresholds and the eGFR range where spironolactone can be used with caution and enhanced monitoring. Finally, I should integrate potassium-binder strategies and alternative MRAs, and then synthesize a practical recommendation that distinguishes absolute from relative contraindications with safety guardrails and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the highest-credibility sources that speak to formal contraindications and dose limitations. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline advises initiating MRAs in HFrEF only if eGFR is greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium is less than 5.0 mEq/L, and explicitly lists eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² as a contraindication to MRA initiation, which functionally sets a hard lower bound in HF care for steroidal MRAs like spironolactone [^111RKLXp]. Hold on, I should verify the FDA label; it recommends lower starting doses and close monitoring for eGFR 30–50 and offers no guidance below 30, which aligns with avoiding initiation in severe CKD and underscores the absence of label support in advanced kidney disease [^1175cRQ2] [^115ycMqJ]. The European Society of Hypertension 2023 synopsis notes spironolactone is not recommended in CKD G4 or higher, which corresponds to eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², reinforcing a consistent threshold across international guidance for non-HF indications [^114mZvNb]. Finally, the 2025 VA/DoD CKD guideline explicitly suggests avoiding spironolactone altogether when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or potassium exceeds 5.0 mEq/L, which crystallizes a practical absolute contraindication in routine CKD care outside HF contexts [^116HuDGk].

> Next, I should review the heart failure nuance because I don't want to overgeneralize beyond CKD per se. Wait, let me verify whether the same hard cutoff applies in HFrEF as in resistant hypertension; it does not, because HF trials and meta-analyses show maintained cardiovascular benefit even when eGFR is impaired, albeit with attenuated magnitude and more adverse events as eGFR falls. A pooled analysis of RALES, EMPHASIS-HF, TOPCAT, and EPHESUS found benefit across eGFR strata, but the effect was essentially neutralized when eGFR was ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², which supports avoiding initiation below 30 while recognizing that those already on therapy who experience a decline in eGFR may still accrue net benefit if closely monitored [^113seoen]. Let me also double-check contemporary HF guidance; the AHA/ACC/HFSA recommendation remains that initiation should be avoided when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², with vigilant monitoring of potassium and renal function otherwise, consistent with this evidence gradient [^111RKLXp].

> I will now examine the highest-quality CKD-specific evidence to avoid over-relying on HF extrapolations. The BARACK-D randomized trial in stage 3b CKD (mean eGFR about 43) found no reduction in cardiovascular events with spironolactone 25 mg daily and a very high discontinuation rate due to declines in eGFR and hyperkalemia, leading the authors to conclude that spironolactone should not be used in people with stage 3b CKD without another explicit indication such as HF [^1138uhNq] [^115Gkirr] [^116ABNYM]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the study's open-label design and pragmatic BP management could have affected outcomes, but the safety signal was robust, and guideline bodies have incorporated these findings into cautions for resistant hypertension in CKD G3b, which tempers enthusiasm for routine MRA use in this stratum [^114mZvNb].

> Next, I should review HFpEF data because the TOPCAT Americas analysis often gets cited to justify spironolactone across CKD stages. Let me verify the safety profile; although efficacy signals for HF hospitalization were observed in the Americas cohort, the risk of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function rose as eGFR declined, and drug discontinuation for adverse events increased in lower eGFR categories, reinforcing that benefit–risk becomes unfavorable as kidney function worsens even in HFpEF, again supporting avoidance below eGFR 30 for initiation and close surveillance above that threshold [^115hwKXm] [^113sQxRC]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might overturn the 30 mL/min/1.73 m² cutoff, but the risk amplification in advanced CKD and the lack of robust benefit in eGFR ≤ 30 still align with a cautious, indication-specific approach rather than routine broad use in CKD [^114KBJyR].

> Let me consider dose modification thresholds to clarify when use is acceptable with enhanced monitoring rather than absolutely contraindicated. The FDA labeling advises initiating at 25 mg every other day for heart failure when eGFR is 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m², and the 2023 ESH synopsis recommends spironolactone as fourth-line in resistant hypertension only when necessary in CKD G3b with frequent potassium monitoring, with use of potassium binders to mitigate hyperkalemia risk, which operationalizes a cautious, dose-minimized strategy in this window rather than a blanket prohibition [^1144boag] [^114mZvNb]. I should confirm the potassium thresholds; most guidance suggests baseline potassium should be below 5.0–5.5 mEq/L before initiation and that hyperkalemia management plans be in place, consistent with safety frameworks in BARACK-D and with MRA monitoring recommendations in HF and CKD populations [^111RKLXp] [^117Y1Mmc].

> But wait, what if the clinical goal is blood pressure control in resistant hypertension rather than HF or CKD progression per se. The pivotal PATHWAY-2 trial excluded patients with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², so the strong antihypertensive efficacy of spironolactone as a fourth agent cannot be directly extrapolated to stage 3b CKD, and guideline algorithms now direct clinicians toward chlorthalidone or loop diuretics when eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² rather than spironolactone, acknowledging uncertain benefit and higher hyperkalemia risk in that range [^113TDUJC] [^114mZvNb] [^112uqw8b] [^115pKJYa]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives; non-steroidal MRAs such as finerenone have robust cardiorenal outcome data in diabetic CKD with lower hyperkalemia risk, and ocedurenone has phase 2 data in advanced CKD with minimal hyperkalemia, offering safer MRA-class options when indicated and carefully selected [^111JV4Pj] [^115CvcS7].

> I need to ensure safety guardrails are explicit because this is where harm occurs in practice. In patients with eGFR 30–44 or those with any baseline potassium near 5.0 mEq/L, I should double-check for concomitant RAAS blockade, NSAIDs, and other potassium-raising drugs, start at low dose or every-other-day dosing, and check potassium and creatinine within 1–2 weeks and after any dose change, with a low threshold to reduce dose or hold therapy if potassium exceeds 5.5–6.0 mEq/L depending on clinical context, mirroring the stop criteria used in BARACK-D and HF MRA monitoring protocols [^111RKLXp] [^117Y1Mmc]. Let me reconsider the role of potassium binders; the AMBER program shows patiromer enables more persistent spironolactone use in CKD with resistant hypertension by reducing hyperkalemia, and DIAMOND supports broader RAASi enablement, though completion rates wane over time and binder strategies require infrastructure and patient education to be effective [^112qMRjo].

> I should double-check whether there are any scenarios below eGFR 30 where initiation might still be reasonable. The Cochrane review of MRAs in dialysis suggests probable reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality with acceptable hyperkalemia risk, but these are small, heterogeneous studies and current cardiology and nephrology guidance still treats advanced CKD as a relative or formal contraindication for steroidal MRA initiation, reserving such use for carefully selected, closely monitored situations or trials rather than routine practice [^113YXtu7] [^116HuDGk] [^111gCA2s]. Given the absence of robust CKD outcome trials for steroidal MRAs and the poor tolerability signal in stage 3b, the balance favors avoiding initiation below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² outside specific HF indications and specialized settings [^116SUhnT] [^115Gkirr].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line and ensure it aligns with labeling, guidelines, and trials. Absolute contraindication to initiating spironolactone in CKD is best framed as eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² based on FDA labeling silence below 30, AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guidance, and international hypertension guidance that does not recommend use in CKD G4 or higher, with the caveat that continuation in selected HF patients who decline below 30 may still be justified by cardiovascular benefit if risks are meticulously managed [^115ycMqJ] [^111RKLXp] [^114mZvNb]. Relative contraindication or use-only-with-extreme-caution applies to eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m², where low or every-other-day dosing, strict potassium and renal function monitoring, and consideration of potassium binders can mitigate harm, recognizing that BARACK-D did not show outcome benefit and that PATHWAY-2 excluded this group, so any use should be indication-driven and reassessed frequently [^1138uhNq] [^113TDUJC] [^1144boag].

> Finally, I should translate this into a practical recommendation. Do not initiate spironolactone in patients with eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; if already on therapy for HF and eGFR falls below 30, individualize continuation decisions with close lab surveillance and clear hyperkalemia plans, understanding the potential for benefit in high-risk HF populations despite attenuated relative risk reduction [^111RKLXp] [^114KBJyR]. For eGFR 30–44, if there is a compelling indication such as HFrEF or refractory hypertension and no safer alternative suffices, start low, monitor early and often, and employ potassium binders when needed to maintain therapy safely, while planning alternatives like finerenone in diabetic CKD or chlorthalidone in resistant hypertension with advanced CKD where appropriate [^114mZvNb] [^111JV4Pj] [^112uqw8b].

Spironolactone is contraindicated in patients with **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^116HuDGk] due to the high risk of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function. For eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m², use only if clearly indicated — such as for resistant hypertension or heart failure — with close monitoring of potassium and renal function [^111RKLXp]. In eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m², spironolactone can be used with routine monitoring, adjusting the dose as needed for hyperkalemia or renal changes [^1175cRQ2] [^1144boag]. These thresholds reflect guideline consensus and trial data showing increased hyperkalemia and renal adverse events at lower eGFR [^114mZvNb] [^115hwKXm] [^114KBJyR].

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

### Heart failure

In heart failure, the **AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 guidelines** [^111RKLXp] recommend MRAs for HFrEF when eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and serum potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, with close monitoring; initiate at 25 mg every other day if eGFR is 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m² [^117YJcLQ]. For **HFpEF**, the **TOPCAT trial** showed reduced HF hospitalizations with spironolactone [^113sQxRC] but higher hyperkalemia and renal adverse events, especially at lower eGFR; benefits persist with careful monitoring [^115hwKXm].

---

### Resistant hypertension

In resistant hypertension, the **PATHWAY-2 trial** demonstrated significant BP reductions with spironolactone [^113TDUJC], but excluded patients with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², limiting evidence at lower eGFR. The **2023 ESH guidelines** recommend spironolactone for resistant hypertension when eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m²; for eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m², use with caution and frequent potassium monitoring, and avoid if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114mZvNb].

---

### Chronic kidney disease

In chronic kidney disease, the **BARACK-D trial** in stage 3b CKD (eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m²) found no cardiovascular benefit and high discontinuation rates from hyperkalemia and renal function decline, suggesting limited use in this range [^1138uhNq] [^115Gkirr]. A **Cochrane review** concluded that aldosterone antagonists reduce proteinuria and BP in mild-to-moderate CKD but increase hyperkalemia and AKI, reinforcing caution as eGFR declines [^116SUhnT].

---

## Summary of recommendations by eGFR

| **Egfr (ml/min/1.73 m²)** | **Recommendation** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| ≥ 45 | Use spironolactone routinely for resistant hypertension and heart failure | Standard monitoring |
| 30–44 | Use with caution; consider only if clearly indicated (e.g. resistant hypertension or heart failure) | Frequent potassium and renal function monitoring |
| < 30 | Contraindicated due to high risk of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function | Avoid use |

---

## Clinical implications and safety considerations

- **Hyperkalemia**: Risk rises as eGFR falls; monitor closely and adjust or stop therapy if potassium rises [^114KBJyR].
- **Worsening renal function**: Monitor for eGFR declines ≥ 20–25% from baseline or between visits [^117Y1Mmc].
- **Drug interactions**: Avoid concurrent ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or potassium-sparing diuretics when possible, or monitor more frequently [^115J3AUY].

---

## Alternative therapies

Consider **non-steroidal MRAs** such as finerenone for CKD with T2D, which reduce cardiovascular and kidney outcomes with a lower hyperkalemia risk than steroidal MRAs [^1144F9qb] [^114XRdfw]. Use **potassium binders** (e.g. patiromer) to enable spironolactone use in resistant hypertension or heart failure with CKD by reducing hyperkalemia [^112qMRjo] [^112Quxte].

---

Spironolactone is contraindicated when **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** because of the high risk of hyperkalemia and renal function decline; use cautiously in eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m² only if clearly indicated, with close monitoring [^111RKLXp] [^114mZvNb].

Objectives

This study investigated the association between baseline renal function and the net benefit of spironolactone in patients with heart failure (HF) with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Background

Guidelines recommend consideration of spironolactone to reduce HF hospitalization in HFpEF. However, spironolactone may increase risk for hyperkalemia and worsening renal function, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Methods

This investigation analyzed data from patients enrolled in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial) Americas study (N = 1,767) to examine the association between the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest, as well as safety outcomes, including hyperkalemia, worsening renal function, and permanent drug discontinuation for adverse events (AEs). Variations in the efficacy and safety of spironolactone according to eGFR were examined in Cox models using interaction terms.

Results

The incidence of both the primary outcome and drug-related AEs increased with declining eGFR. Compared with placebo, across all eGFR categories, spironolactone was associated with lower relative risk for the primary efficacy outcome and for hypokalemia, but higher relative risk for hyperkalemia, worsening renal function, and drug discontinuation. During 4-year follow-up, the absolute risk for AEs that prompted drug discontinuation was amplified in the lower eGFR categories, which suggested heightened risk for drug intolerance with declining renal function.

Conclusions

Although consistent efficacy of spironolactone was observed across the range of eGFR, the risk of AEs was amplified in the lower eGFR categories. These data supported use of spironolactone to treat HFpEF patients with advanced chronic kidney disease only when close laboratory surveillance is possible.

Finally, recent evidence from the FIDELITY pooled analysis of finerenone trials demonstrates that cardiovascular and kidney benefits were maintained regardless of acute eGFR changes at month 1, with similar efficacy across patients experiencing > 10% eGFR decline, stable eGFR, or eGFR increases, confirming that early eGFR changes do not correlate with long‐term hard outcomes. We suggest focusing on clinically meaningful endpoints rather than over‐interpreting short‐term eGFR fluctuations.

We recommend the authors consider adopting more conservative language regarding renal function changes and acknowledge the limitations of short‐term eGFR monitoring. Future studies would benefit from incorporating confirmatory measurements, longer follow‐up periods and mechanistic assessments to better characterise true renal function changes with low‐dose spironolactone therapy.

### Patiromer to enable spironolactone use in the treatment of patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease: rationale and design of the AMBER study [^117EEe1H]. American Journal of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

While chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in resistant hypertension (RHTN), prior studies -evaluating mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists excluded patients with reduced kidney function due to risk of hyperkalemia. AMBER (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03071263) will evaluate if the potassium-binding polymer patiromer used concomitantly with spironolactone in patients with RHTN and CKD prevents hyperkalemia and allows more persistent spironolactone use for hypertension management.

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group 12-week study of patiromer and spironolactone versus placebo and spironolactone in patients with uncontrolled RHTN and CKD. RHTN is defined as unattended systolic automated office blood pressure (AOBP) of -135–160 mm Hg during screening despite taking ≥ 3 antihypertensives, including a diuretic, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker -(unless not tolerated or contraindicated). The CKD inclusion criterion is an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25 to ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Screening serum potassium must be 4.3–5.1 mEq/L. The primary efficacy endpoint is the between-group difference (spironolactone plus patiromer versus spironolactone plus placebo) in the proportion of patients remaining on spironolactone at Week 12.

Results

Baseline characteristics have been analyzed as of March 2018 for 146 (of a targeted 290) patients. Mean (SD) baseline age is 69.3 (10.9) years; 52.1% are male, 99.3% White, and 47.3% have diabetes. Mean (SD) baseline serum potassium is 4.68 (0.25) mEq/L, systolic AOBP is 144.3 (6.8) mm Hg, eGFR is 35.7 (7.7) mL/min/1.73 m2.

Conclusion

AMBER will define the ability of patiromer to facilitate the use of spironolactone, an effective antihypertensive therapy for patients with RHTN and CKD.

### Concerns regarding renal function claims in low-dose spironolactone study [^117SySqk]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

We read with interest the study by Amini et al. on low‐dose spironolactone in diabetic kidney disease. While we appreciate the authors' investigation of safety at reduced dosing, we believe some aspects of their eGFR interpretation need clarification from a nephrology perspective.

The authors report a statistically significant increase in eGFR from 71.83 ± 19.09 to 74.25 ± 17.81 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (p = 0.042) and describe this as renal function improvement. This interpretation warrants careful consideration:

First, creatinine measurement has inherent analytical variability, and small changes in calculated eGFR may not reflect true kidney function changes. The magnitude of change (3.4%) falls within the expected coefficient of variation for creatinine‐based eGFR calculations. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of 37 studies with 2770 participants demonstrate that eGFR fluctuations of 5.0%–5.2% likely represent analytical noise rather than clinically meaningful change. Such small variations should be interpreted cautiously without confirmatory measurements.

Second, we note that the concurrent decrease in serum creatinine (1.08 ± 0.23 to 1.01 ± 0.23 mg/dL) is difficult to explain mechanistically, as spironolactone does not enhance creatinine clearance or reduce creatinine generation. Furthermore, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists characteristically reduce GFR through hemodynamic effects, including afferent arteriole vasoconstriction and decreased glomerular filtration pressure. An increase in eGFR contradicts established pharmacological mechanisms.

Third, previous studies with identical 12.5 mg spironolactone dosing have consistently shown stable or slightly decreased eGFR, not increases. For example, Oiwa et al.'s multicenter randomised controlled trial demonstrated that eGFR remained stable from 64.2 ± 17.6 to 60.2 ± 16.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the spironolactone group while achieving significant albuminuria reduction. This rigorous randomised controlled trial design with proper control group provides higher‐quality evidence than the current pre‐post intervention study. The present findings are inconsistent with this established pattern from controlled trials.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^115Gkirr]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized PROBE trial, we found that low-dose spironolactone did not reduce the risk of a composite outcome of death, hospitalization for CVD or new cardiovascular events compared to usual care among a community cohort of people (mean age = 74.8 years) with moderate CKD and a high burden of cardiovascular comorbidity. We also found no reduction in risk in any component of the composite outcome nor in our prespecified subgroups of participants with coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension at baseline. In the within-trial economic analysis, spironolactone was not effective compared to usual care. Although difficulties with recruitment left the study underpowered, based on the anticipated effect size, this is unlikely to have influenced the outcomes. The conditional power calculation suggests that there is an 11.8% probability that a statistically significant result would have been found if the trial had reached its recruited target and the observed event rate remained constant with the participants who were recruited. Spironolactone appeared to be poorly tolerated among the study population, and only a third of participants continued on treatment beyond 6 months post-randomization. Participants randomized to spironolactone did have a small but statistically significant greater deterioration in eGFR across follow-up. These participants were also more likely to have hyperkalemia and hypotension. Our results suggest that spironolactone should not be used in people with CKD without another specific indication, such as heart failure.

Safety

In total, 455 participants randomized to spironolactone had treatment withdrawn because of safety concerns. The most common reason (n = 239, 35.4%) was a decrease in eGFR that met the prespecified stop criteria, followed by 128 (18.9%) participants being withdrawn due to potential treatment side effects.

The frequency of adverse events is shown in Table 4 (with classification by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes shown in Supplementary Table 1). An additional 33 participants who were randomized to spironolactone but who did not take any medication were included in the comparator usual care arm in this analysis. There were significantly more episodes of hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or a drop in the systolic pressure of > 20 mm Hg on standing) experienced across all individuals in the spironolactone versus the control arm (49 versus 32, adjusted treatment effect 1.6 (95% CI: 1.04–2.46), P = 0.034), with 11 participants citing hypotension as a reason for withdrawal from treatment (Tables 3 and 4). Participants who received spironolactone experienced significantly more episodes of hyperkalemia (24.7%) overall versus 13.4% in the control arm, defined by a potassium of ≥ 5.5 mmol l⁻¹. Most of these were mild (potassium 5.5–5.9 mmol l⁻¹) in both arms, but 11% of the raised potassium events that occurred were levels of ≥ 6 mmol l⁻¹ and therefore required dose suspension or adjustment, and 8.0% (n = 54) of participants were withdrawn from spironolactone treatment for reasons related to hyperkalemia. Among patients who experienced hyperkalemia, the mean baseline eGFR was 41.9 mL min⁻¹ 1.73 m⁻² (s.d. 7.08) compared to a mean baseline eGFR of 43.9 mL min⁻¹ 1.73 m⁻² (s.d. 6.92) among those who did not experience hyperkalemia.

In conclusion, among participants with stage 3b CKD, treatment with low-dose spironolactone was not associated with a reduction in mortality or cardiovascular events compared to usual care. Discontinuation from the study due to safety concerns was more common among participants randomized to spironolactone. This suggests that low-dose spironolactone should not generally be used in people with stage 3b CKD unless there is another explicit indication for the treatment.

The study BARACK-D was published by F D Richard Hobbs and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the BARACK-D study, the trial question was: what is the role of spironolactone in patients with stage 3b CKD? In the BARACK-D study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BARACK-D study, the population was: 1372 patients (748 female, 624 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with stage 3b CKD. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; T1DM; terminal disease; chronic HF or known LV systolic dysfunction; recent myocardial infarction; active cancer with < 1 year life expectancy or in palliative care; alcohol or drug abuse. In the BARACK-D study, the interventions were: n = 677 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg once daily plus usual care) n = 695 usual care (usual care alone). In the BARACK-D study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, HF, TIA or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline at 3 year follow-up (16.7% vs. 16%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37). In the BARACK-D study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in CVD at 3 years (9.7% vs. 8.8%; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.61) No significant difference in death at 3 years (6.2% vs. 5.5%; HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.7) Significant decrease in eGFR at 3 years (41.7 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 42 mL/min/1.73 m²; TE -1.14, 95% CI -1.92 to -0.37). In the BARACK-D study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. significant differences in hyperkalemia (24.7% vs. 13.4%), hypotension (7.4% vs. 4.7%), adverse events (83.0% vs. 50.7%). In the BARACK-D study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with stage 3b CKD, spironolactone was not superior to usual care with respect to first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, HF, TIA or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline at 3 year follow-up.

Finally, triple antihypertensive drug therapy may not control BP in a number of CKD patients. Hypertension is defined as resistant to treatment when appropriate lifestyle measures and treatment with optimal or best tolerated doses of three or more drugs (a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, a RAS blocker and a CCB) fail to lower office BP to < 140/90 mmHg. The inadequate BP control should be confirmed by uncontrolled 24-h BP (≥ 130/80 mmHg). Evidence of adherence to therapy and exclusion of secondary causes of hypertension are required to define true resistant hypertension. In patients with true resistant hypertension, the fourth line treatment should include the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) spironolactone, based on the evidence from the PATHWAY-2 (Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension) trial and relevant meta-analyses. However, patients with an eGFR with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or potassium > 4.5 mmol/L were excluded from this study and, thus, the efficacy and safety of spironolactone in such individuals are not established. In the AMBER (Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease) trial that used spironolactone with addition of placebo or patiromer in patients with treatment resistant hypertension and eGFR 25 to ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, BP was effectively reduced in both groups, but the rates of hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) were about 60% and 35%, respectively, at 12 weeks. Based on the above, the 2023 ESH Guidelines have also updated the treatment algorithm for true resistant hypertension depending on underlying renal function. Use of spironolactone as a fourth antihypertensive agent in patients with CKD G3b and treatment-resistant hypertension is generally recommended only when necessary (when BP control is not achieved with addition of other agents) and should be done with caution and frequent potassium monitoring. Use of novel potassium binders is advisable to maintain serum potassium < 5.5 mmol/L. Spironolactone is not recommended in patients with CKD G4 or higher. Instead, in the recent CLICK (Chlorthalidone in Chronic Kidney Disease) randomized trial that included 160 patients with CKD G4 and resistant hypertension, the addition of chlorthalidone (mean dose 23 mg daily) on top of previous antihypertensive treatment (including a loop diuretic) was associated with 10.5 mmHg reduction in 24-h SBP; as such, the algorithm now suggests the addition of chlorthalidone for this group of patients.

Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

MRAs (spironolactone and eplerenone) reduce mortality and hospitalizations due to HF in patients with HFrEF, but in these trials, only patients with CKD stages 1 to 3 were enrolled. In the RALES trial (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study), spironolactone exhibited similar risk reduction in all-cause mortality and the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and hospital stay for HF, compared with patients with higher baseline eGFR. However, these benefits went along with an increased risk of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function, but the substantial net benefit of spironolactone therapy remained. Similarly, in a post hoc analysis in patients with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 of the EMPHASIS-HF trial (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure), eplerenone was equally effective to reduce cardiovascular death or HHF (hospitalization for heart failure), which was consistent across the different eGFR strata. Patients treated with eplerenone had an increased risk of potassium > 5.5 mmol/L but not of potassium > 6.0 mmol/L. Given these data, a close monitoring of renal function and potassium is warranted in patients with HF and CKD, especially if eGFR declines.

No data from large clinical trials exist in patients with CKD stages 4 and 5, and these agents are formally contraindicated in advanced CKD. The DOHAS (Dialysis Outcomes Heart Failure Aldactone Study) trial, a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label trial in 5 Japanese centers, investigated the use of spironolactone in oligoanuric hemodialysis patients versus a control group. In this population, spironolactone reduced the primary outcome — a composite of death from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events or hospitalization for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Ongoing large-scale studies such as the ACHIEVE trial (Aldosterone Blockade for Health Improvement Evaluation in End-Stage Renal Disease; unique identifier: NCT03020303) and ALCHEMIST (Aldosterone Antagonist Chronic Hemodialysis Interventional Survival Trial; unique identifier: NCT01848639) will shed more light on this topic.

Monitoring of adverse events

For safety monitoring, adverse events were recorded at trial visits, and any adverse event that was considered related to the study medication as judged by a medically qualified member of the research team or the sponsor was followed up until resolution or until the event was considered stable. Serious adverse events were reported by participating sites to the Clinical Trials Unit within 24 h of discovery or notification of the event. The documentation was then reviewed by a medically qualified member of the trial team, who evaluated the report for causality and expectedness. Any suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were reported to the competent authorities (MHRA in the UK), the Research Ethics Committee concerned and the host NHS trusts, within the timelines defined in the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations, 2004.

Specific 'stop rules' were set by the independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) and took into consideration the established risks of spironolactone. We measured serum creatinine and potassium at every study visit. If a potassium result was between 5.5 and 5.9 mmol l⁻¹, the dose of spironolactone was reduced to 25 mg on alternate days. If the result was between 6.0 and 6.4 mmol l⁻¹, spironolactone was withheld for a week and then restarted on alternate days. Spironolactone was discontinued if there was a single potassium result ≥ 6.5 mmol l⁻¹. Participants were also withdrawn from trial treatment if there was a reduction in eGFR of 20% or more between successive visits or 25% or more from baseline, a systolic blood pressure reading < 100 mm Hg or a symptomatic postural drop in systolic blood pressure > 20 mm Hg. Physicians were strongly encouraged to manage participants' blood pressure according to the NICE guidelines on CKD and on hypertension, which recommended a target clinic blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose spironolactone in management of diabetic kidney disease in a real-world setting [^114FnjGJ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

SGLT2is are glucose‐lowering drugs used to manage T2DM owing to their promising renal and cardiovascular protective effects. Recent studies have shown they reduce albuminuria and preserve eGFR in mild to moderate DKDs with eGFR 30–60. Recently, Vert et al. revealed that the combination of SGLT2i and RAAS blocker significantly improves prognosis in CKD patients without diabetes. However, the high cost of this drug, particularly in developing countries, is a major concern for patients. Spironolactone is inexpensive. Therefore, in the subgroup analyses, we compared a triple therapy consisting of an SGLT2i, a RAAS blocker, and low‐dose spironolactone against a combination of low‐dose spironolactone and a RAAS blocker.

In this study, at the beginning and before using spironolactone, there was no significant difference in the level of albuminuria between patients who were taking SGLT2i and those who were not. In addition, after adding spironolactone to the treatment regimen in both groups, there was still no significant difference in the level of albuminuria between these two groups. Nevertheless, the addition of 12.5 mg/day spironolactone significantly reduced albuminuria in both groups. It should be noted that this secondary analysis was exploratory and was neither designed nor powered to test interaction effects. Therefore, such findings must be viewed cautiously and are not meant to alter the study's main purpose, which is focused on low‐dose spironolactone's independent effect.

Use loop diuretics when eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.72 m², and note that a reduction in eGFR and rise in serum creatinine is expected with BP‑lowering therapy, but a rise in serum creatinine of > 30% should prompt evaluation for possible renovascular disease; CKD is defined as an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.72 m² and caution is advised regarding hyperkalaemia with spironolactone, especially when eGFR is < 45 mL/min/1.72 m² or baseline K ≥ 4.5 mmol/L.

In addition, the recruiting physician could discontinue a participant from the study treatment at any time if it was considered necessary for any reason, including the following general rules:
Ineligibility (either arising during the study or retrospectively having been overlooked at screening).
Significant protocol deviation as judged by the trial physician.
Significant noncompliance with treatment regimen or study requirements.
An adverse event that requires discontinuation of the study medication or results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures.
Disease progression that requires discontinuation of the study medication or results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures.
Lost to follow-up.

Each participant also had the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the time from randomization until the first occurrence of any of the following events: death, hospitalization for heart disease (coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, sudden death or failed sudden death, defined as a cardiac arrest where the participant was successfully resuscitated), stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or PAD, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline.

Prespecified secondary outcomes included changes in blood pressure, natriuretic peptides, ACR and eGFR recorded in the primary care record across follow-up, as well as rates of adverse events, including hyperkalemia and hypotension. Hyperkalemia was considered serum potassium of 5.5 mmol l −1 or greater, subcategorized as 5.5–5.9 mmol l −1, 6.0–6.4 mmol l −1 and ≥ 6.5 mmol l −1. Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or a drop in the systolic pressure of > 20 mm Hg on standing. Progression of kidney disease was defined as a ≥ 30% increase in creatinine from baseline, a drop of ≥ 25% in eGFR from baseline or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR from the previous result.

An independent panel of three senior clinicians adjudicated each of the endpoints, using all the available clinical information independently of each other, with discussion determining the endpoint where there was initial disagreement.

American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Pharmacovigilance

This trial is categorized by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency as type A (no higher than the risk of standard medical care). Patients are being followed up closely throughout this study, and an ongoing evaluation of risk will continue throughout the recruitment period. Both spironolactone and chlorthalidone are considered investigational medicinal products (IMPs) within SPIRO-CKD trial. Any adverse events or serious adverse events that occur during this trial are reportable to the SPIRO-CKD Trials Office at the trials unit up to 6 weeks following last administration of the IMP. Any suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions related to the IMP will be reported irrespective of how long after IMP administration the reaction occurred. Responses to abnormalities of serum sodium, potassium, and eGFR will be guided by predetermined management plans (see Appendix 2).

Blood pressure monitoring

To confirm or deny the trial hypothesis, it is essential that the change in blood pressure during the treatment period is not significantly different in each arm of the trial. A tight blood pressure target was thought impractical; instead, a blood pressure monitoring committee (BPMC) reviews the blood pressure data after each block of 20 patients for the first 100 patients and then after each block of 30 patients to the end of trial recruitment. The precise frequency of review may change on the advice of the BPMC following its independent review of the data. Patients enter the trial with controlled blood pressure so that there are not anticipated to be clinical reasons for adding further drugs for blood pressure control during the randomized treatment phase. In the event of a difference in blood pressure change becoming evident, the BPMC will advise on changes to medication in either arm.

### Finerenone versus spironolactone in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes: a target trial emulation [^115R9C7k]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Eligibility criteria

The target trial emulation included adults aged ≥ 18 years with CKD and T2D who had medical encounters between July 2021 and September 2024. This study period was selected as finerenone was first approved by the US FDA in July 2021. Incident CKD was defined as two eGFR values < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², measured at least 90 days apart, using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) formula. Patients were grouped based on the first prescription (new users) of either finerenone or spironolactone, marking the baseline or index event. Eligible patients had no history of either MRAs use in the preceding 6 months before index event. Exclusion criteria included prior eGFR values < 15 mL/min/1.73 m², end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or recent events such as acute coronary syndromes, stroke, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, or ever dialysis within 60 days of the index prescription. Other exclusions included medical contraindications (e.g. adrenal insufficiency such as Addisonian crisis or history of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors) and safety concerns (e.g. hyperkalemia, defined as serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L, as per the safety warnings for either finerenone or spironolactone). Eligibility criteria and baseline covariates were evaluated during the baseline period, defined as the one-year period prior to the index event. (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).

Treatment strategies

Two treatment strategies were compared: initiation of finerenone or spironolactone at baseline (index event). Treatment initiation was defined as the first prescription of the respective medication (new-user design), following an intention-to-treat approach, with no adjustments for medication adherence, switches, or addition of other MRAs.

MRA

The steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) spironolactone has been shown to attenuate albuminuria in diabetic kidney disease without outcomes data but had numerous disadvantages including sexual side effects and significant hyperkalemia that can be prolonged for as long as 1 week after discontinuation as a result of long-acting metabolites such as canrenone. That noted, spironolactone is evidenced-based for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) based on the RALES trial and is also an excellent choice for resistant HTN in CKD. Lastly, spironolactone is generally used for patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Eplerenone is an additional steroidal MRA used for patients who cannot tolerate spironolactone. More recently, the selective non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone has been of interest given the activity of this receptor in diabetic kidney disease. In two large RCTs, finerenone has demonstrated significant cardiovascular and kidney protection for patients with proteinuric kidney disease due to type-2 diabetes mellitus when used with maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB. An additional benefit of finerenone, is that it exhibited lower hyperkalemic events in addition to no sexual side-effects observed with other less-selective MRAs. Importantly, finerenone should be avoided in those with decompensated cirrhosis There are no head-to-head trials comparing spironolactone, eplerenone, and finerenone. Thus, for patients with proteinuric diabetic kidney disease (T2DM only), finerenone is recommended for both eGFR preservation and cardiovascular protection. Because finerenone is used in CKD with maximally dosed ACEi or ARB, potassium monitoring is an important safety consideration and many patients with reduced eGFR will require concomitant potassium binder therapy.

1 Introduction

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), followed by end‐stage renal disease (ESRD), affecting well over 700 million individuals worldwide. It affects 30% of patients with type 1 (T1DM) and 40% of patients with type 2 (T2DM) diabetes. DKD refers to persistent albuminuria or decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with diabetes, without implying specific underlying kidney pathology. It could be classified based on the presence of proteinuria, the classical type known as diabetic nephropathy (DN), and the non‐classical type identified with decreased eGFR without proteinuria, known as nonproteinuric DKD (NP‐DKD).

Blocking the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) using angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. However, some patients with DN, particularly those who have used ACEIs or ARBs for extended periods, experience a return of aldosterone to its previous levels due to the aldosterone escape phenomenon. Aldosterone can cause nephrosclerosis and kidney fibrosis in patients with DN and hypertension. Moreover, studies have indicated that the use of ACEI and ARB alone cannot prevent the effects of aldosterone. Therefore, adjuvant treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as spironolactone to improve proteinuria in patients with DN is justified.

Studies have shown that adding spironolactone to RAAS blockers is more effective in reducing albuminuria in DKD patients. In addition, the low price of spironolactone in the market is one of the most important features of this drug, especially in developing countries, compared with other newly established drugs that effectively reduce proteinuria, such as sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). However, the increased risk of hyperkalaemia following the administration of spironolactone is a major concern, making physicians hesitant to prescribe it to such patients. Many patients with DN already have underlying hyperkalaemia due to type 4 renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Administration of aldosterone antagonists can worsen hyperkalaemia in these patients. In previous studies, spironolactone was prescribed at a dose of 25–100 mg/day.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^1138uhNq]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a substantial risk of progression to end-stage renal disease and vascular events. The nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), finerenone, offers cardiorenal protection for people with CKD and diabetes, but there is uncertainty if the steroidal MRA, spironolactone, provides the same protection. In this prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint trial, we assessed the effectiveness of 25 mg spironolactone in addition to usual care or usual care alone for reducing cardiovascular outcomes in stage 3b CKD among an older community cohort (mean age = 74.8 years and s.d. = 8.1). We recruited 1,434 adults from English primary care, of whom 1,372 (96%) were included in the primary analysis. The primary outcome was time from randomization until the first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline. Across 3 years of follow-up, the primary endpoint occurred in 113 of 677 participants randomized to spironolactone (16.7%) and 111 of 695 participants randomized to usual care (16.0%) with no significant difference between groups (hazard ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.81–1.37). Two-thirds of participants randomized to spironolactone stopped treatment within 6 months, predominantly because they met prespecified safety stop criteria. The most common reason for stopping spironolactone was a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate that met prespecified stop criteria (n = 239, 35.4%), followed by participants being withdrawn due to treatment side effects (n = 128, 18.9%) and hyperkalemia (n = 54, 8.0%). In conclusion, we found that spironolactone was frequently discontinued due to safety concerns, with no evidence that it reduced cardiovascular outcomes in people with stage 3b CKD. Spironolactone should not be used for people with stage 3b CKD without another explicit treatment indication. ClinicalTrials.gov registration:

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): results in the pre-specified subgroup with heart failure [^114EJaeW]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The present data, stemming from a trial aimed at demonstrating the MRA‐enabling effect of the potassium binder patiromer in high cardiovascular risk patients, corroborate and extend the results obtained in another HFrEF population. 19 In that trial (PEARL‐HF), patiromer enabled spironolactone use and prevented hyperkalaemia in patients with predominantly HFrEF with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or a history of hyperkalaemia that provoked discontinuation of drugs blocking the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. 19 Whether this enabling effect may ultimately lead to improved cardiovascular outcomes is currently being tested in the ongoing DIAMOND trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03888066).

Several clinical outcome trials have been performed in patients with HFpEF, yet none have met their primary endpoint. 9 The TOPCAT trial comparing spironolactone with placebo did not meet its primary endpoint, with an 11% non‐significant reduction in cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. The 18% nominally significant risk reduction of the primary outcome in the Americas has encouraged societies in the US to believe that, if properly implemented, spironolactone may improve outcomes in patients with HFpEF. 9 In HFpEF patients with resistant hypertension from the Americas enrolled in TOPCAT, a post hoc analysis showed that spironolactone enabled better blood pressure control. 20 The magnitude of the blood pressure‐lowering effect [−5.53 (1.95) mmHg vs. placebo] after 4 months in TOPCAT 20 was actually close to that observed after 3 months (−8 to −9 mmHg) in both treatment groups of HF patients receiving open‐label spironolactone in AMBER, despite the fact that the two study populations were notably different (i.e. kidney function being more impaired in AMBER: mean of 36 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in AMBER vs. 61–64 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in TOPCAT). Moreover, the blood pressure reductions in the HF subgroup in AMBER were generally consistent with those observed in the overall study population (−11 to −12 mmHg). If the guidelines for the treatment of HFpEF include spironolactone, the results of the AMBER subgroup analysis presented here would become even more broadly applicable.

Reno-protective effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in clinical trials

Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

A meta-analysis of 14 studies, which included 1193 adults with eGFR > 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and proteinuria on ACEi/ARB, showed that spironolactone or eplerenone reduced proteinuria compared with placebo or standard care over a median of 3.5 months. In 130 patients with T2D and CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and UACR ≥ 30 mg/g), spironolactone 12.5 mg/day vs control decreased UACR levels over 24 weeks. In 140 patients with T2D at high risk of or with CV diseases, eplerenone 100–200 mg/day vs placebo decreased UACR levels by 34% over 26 weeks. Similarly, in 1175 patients with HFpEF from the TOPCAT trial, after correcting for the placebo response, spironolactone reduced UACR levels by 39% at the 1-year visit compared with baseline in the overall population, and by 76% in those with severely increased albuminuria levels (UACR > 300 mg/day). In post hoc analyses of the EMPHASIS-HF and TOPCAT Americas trials, MRAs caused a decrease in eGFR within weeks of treatment initiation but did not alter the long-term trajectories of eGFR in both HFrEF and HFpEF populations (Table 3). Similar eGFR trajectories with MRAs were observed in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% after myocardial infarction (MI). Importantly, the acute eGFR decline is haemodynamically mediated and neither injures kidney itself nor negates clinical benefits of MRAs, as evidenced by clinical trials.

Table 3.
Effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on glomerular filtration rate slope and renal composite outcome

The efficacy and safety of spironolactone in chronic haemodialysis patients remain under investigation. In the ALCHEMIST trial (n = 644, NCT01848639), spironolactone did not reduce primary CV outcomes but lowered the risk of HF hospitalization compared with placebo and was well-tolerated (Rossignol, unpublished data). The ongoing larger Phase III trial, ACHIEVE (NCT03020303), aims to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of spironolactone in dialysis patients, with the goal of providing more clarity in this population.

### Potential role of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in nondiabetic chronic kidney disease and glomerular disease [^111yu8LD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Considering the Safety of MRAS in Glomerular Disease

People with CKD have an increased risk of hyperkalemia, which can lead to serious issues such as cardiac arrhythmia episodes and sudden death.MRA treatments can potentially cause or worsen hyperkalemia in patients with kidney impairment, (Table 2) and is a pressing safety concern of these drugs. As per prescribing information, eplerenone is contraindicated for treating hypertension in patients with a creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, and steroidal MRAs are not indicated for treatment of CKD with or without diabetes. A meta-analysis of data from studies of spironolactone and eplerenone has indicated that these agents conferred no significant risk of hyperkalemia in patients with nondiabetic proteinuric CKD, but this needs further investigation. The advantages of ns-MRAs include possibly lower risk of hyperkalemia (as seen with finerenone), having potency similar to spironolactone and greater than eplerenone, and greater selectivity for the MR, translating to its more specific anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects versus steroidal MRAs. It has been suggested that as finerenone increases potassium levels in a predictable way, patients at risk of hyperkalemia can be identified early in clinical practice and monitored for an easy management. Nonetheless, precautions are advised when prescribing finerenone. Serum potassium and eGFR should be measured in all patients before initiating treatment and should be monitored periodically during treatment, with the dose modified accordingly. Treatment should not be started if serum potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L. Finally, more frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients at risk for hyperkalemia, including those on concomitant medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium.

As noted, potassium binders such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are available to manage hyperkalemia. The ongoing MorphCKD trial is exploring the feasibility of adding patiromer to allow for improved renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade (including use of an MRA), thereby reducing albuminuria in patients with albuminuric CKD where full treatment might otherwise be limited by hyperkalemia. As noted in the KDIGO 2022 guidelines, "hyperkalemia associated with the use of an ACEi or ARB can often be managed by measures to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping the ACEi or ARB immediately"; these measures include a low potassium diet and the use of diuretics and potassium binders.

Potential cardiovascular benefits from mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in chronic kidney disease subgroups

Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Spironolactone or eplerenone provide robust and consistent CV benefits in patients with HFrEF, those with LVEF < 40% after MI or those with acute MI, and may have the potential for CV risk reduction in those with HFpEF Across clinical trials of MRA therapy, the prevalence of CKD varied. However, overall, CV benefits from spironolactone and eplerenone remained consistent regardless of CKD status or severity (Table 4). However, it must be emphasized that in most steroidal MRAs trials, patients with low eGFR were excluded (Table 4). In a sub-analysis of the EMPHASIS-HF trial, when eplerenone doses were stratified by the renal function severity, its effects on CV outcomes were similar between patients with impaired and preserved renal function. Additionally, in a meta-analysis of the RALES, EMPHASIS-HF, TOPCAT Americas, and the EPHESUS trials, MRAs vs placebo reduced the composite of CV death or HF hospitalization across a wide spectrum of eGFR; however, the effect of MRAs was attenuated as eGFR decreased, leading to neutralization in those with an eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P for trend = .033).

Table 4.
Effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on primary outcome across kidney function categories

Despite declines in kidney function after MRA initiation, the cardioprotective effects of steroidal MRAs generally appear to be maintained. In a sub-analysis of the RALES trial, patients facing worsening renal function (WRF, > 30% decline in eGFR) by week 12 had an increased risk of all-cause mortality with placebo, whereas the risk was mitigated in those receiving spironolactone (P for interaction = .009). Similar findings were also reported in sub-analyses of the EPHESUS, EMPHASIS-HF, and TOPCAT trials, highlighting the persistent cardioprotective effects of MRA therapy despite occurrences of WRF. Furthermore, in a meta-analysis of the RALES and EMPHASIS-HF trials (n = 4355), 6.8% of patients experienced eGFR deterioration to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 after randomization. These patients showed a similar relative reduction in CV risk with MRAs compared with those who maintained eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 throughout the study.

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^111pYSoa]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The effect of thiazide-like drugs on LV mass in early-stage CKD has not previously been examined, although they are effective in lowering blood pressure in this group. The study will also provide evidence on the safety of both spironolactone and chlorthalidone in subjects with early-stage CKD, giving valuable data on the effects of both drugs on kidney function measured by eGFR and on changes in serum potassium and sodium concentrations. If safety and efficacy are confirmed, the rationale would be provided for a larger clinical trial designed to examine the effects of MRB drugs on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality end points. It is acknowledged that the nonblinded study design increases the risk of bias, but the PROBE design maintains the benefits associated with a strict randomization procedure, whereas the blinded end points help to eliminate bias. In a meta-analysis of trials of an ARB, changes in mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in double-blind and PROBE trials were not significantly different.

### Aldosterone antagonists in addition to renin angiotensin system antagonists for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^116SUhnT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non-selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia).

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) to other anti-hypertensive strategies or placebo in participants with proteinuric CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used together with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE.

Main Results

Forty-four studies (5745 participants) were included. Risk of bias in the evaluated methodological domains were unclear or high risk in most studies. Adequate random sequence generation was present in 12 studies, allocation concealment in five studies, blinding of participant and investigators in 18 studies, blinding of outcome assessment in 15 studies, and complete outcome reporting in 24 studies. All studies comparing aldosterone antagonists to placebo or standard care were used in addition to an ACEi or ARB (or both). None of the studies were powered to detect differences in patient-level outcomes including kidney failure, major cardiovascular events or death. Aldosterone antagonists had uncertain effects on kidney failure (2 studies, 84 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.65, I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), death (3 studies, 421 participants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.50, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), and cardiovascular events (3 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.56; I² = 42%; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce protein excretion (14 studies, 1193 participants: SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.20, I² = 82%; very low certainty evidence), eGFR (13 studies, 1165 participants, MD -3.00 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.51 to -0.49, I² = 0%, low certainty evidence) and systolic blood pressure (14 studies, 911 participants: MD -4.98 mmHg, 95% CI -8.22 to -1.75, I² = 87%; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists probably increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (17 studies, 3001 participants: RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.22, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), acute kidney injury (5 studies, 1446 participants: RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.97, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), and gynaecomastia (4 studies, 281 participants: RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Non-selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB had uncertain effects on protein excretion (2 studies, 139 participants: SMD -1.59, 95% CI -3.80 to 0.62, I² = 93%; very low certainty evidence) but may increase serum potassium (2 studies, 121 participants: MD 0.31 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.45, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared to diuretics plus ACEi or ARB. Selective aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 500 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.95, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared ACEi or ARB (or both). There were insufficient studies to perform meta-analyses for the comparison between non-selective aldosterone antagonists and calcium channel blockers, selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB (or both) and nitrate plus ACEi or ARB (or both), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists and selective aldosterone antagonists.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of aldosterone antagonists when added to ACEi or ARB (or both) on the risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and kidney failure in people with proteinuric CKD are uncertain. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce proteinuria, eGFR, and systolic blood pressure in adults who have mild to moderate CKD but may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia when added to ACEi and/or ARB.

### Spironolactone use and higher hospital readmission for Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction [^113uWVso]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although randomized controlled trials have demonstrated benefits of aldosterone antagonists for patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), they excluded patients with serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dl, and their use is contraindicated in those with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present analysis, we examined the association of spironolactone use with readmission in hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries with HFrEF and advanced CKD. Of the 1,140 patients with HFrEF (EF < 45%) and advanced CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 45 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), 207 received discharge prescriptions for spironolactone. Using propensity scores (PSs) for the receipt of discharge prescriptions for spironolactone, we estimated PS-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for spironolactone-associated outcomes. Patients (mean age 76 years, 49% women, 25% African-American) had mean EF 28%, mean eGFR 31 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and mean potassium 4.5 mEq/L. Spironolactone use had significant PS-adjusted association with higher risk of 30-day (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.90) and 1-year (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.63) all-cause readmissions. The risk of 1-year all-cause readmission was higher among 106 patients with eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (HR 4.75, 95% CI 1.84 to 12.28) than among those with eGFR 15 to 45 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.61, p for interaction 0.003). Spironolactone use had no association with HF readmission and all-cause mortality. In conclusion, among hospitalized patients with HFrEF and advanced CKD, spironolactone use was associated with higher all-cause readmission but had no association with all-cause mortality or HF readmission.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^112ExzFr]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Although it is possible that our study failed to detect a treatment effect of spironolactone because of the comparatively small sample size, there is no suggestion of this from the data. Two-thirds of participants randomized to spironolactone discontinued treatment within the first 6 months, largely due to them meeting prespecified 'stop' criteria, such as prespecified reductions in renal function. The high number of participants who discontinued spironolactone treatment at an early stage may be important in explaining our results and implies that poor tolerability of spironolactone is a barrier to its use in this population. The difference in results between the finerenone trials and the BARACK-D trial may be explained by the differences in tolerability and efficacy of spironolactone as a steroidal MRA compared to the nonsteroidal MRA, finerenone. Finerenone may have additional benefits compared to spironolactone, such as an antifibrotic effect in the heart and inhibition of the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in the kidney. Finerenone is also associated with a low risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension, meaning discontinuation rates are likely to be lower than for spironolactone, and more participants are able to continue on treatment.

The differences in trial results may also partly relate to differences in the study populations. The BARACK-D trial population were mainly older participants (mean age of 74.8 years versus median age of 64.8 years in the FIDELITY study), with CKD mainly defined by age-related kidney impairment. In contrast, the finerenone trial populations involved CKD participants mainly defined by kidney damage in the context of diabetes. The mean baseline eGFR in our study was lower than the FIDELITY study (43.5 versus 57.5 mL min⁻¹ 1.73 m⁻²), but 98.2% of those in the FIDELITY study had moderate to significant proteinuria, compared to a mean baseline urinary ACR of just 1.5 mg mmol⁻¹ (IQR = 0.6–4.3) in BARACK-D. Despite the encouraging results of finerenone, our study suggests that the results cannot be immediately applied to older populations with CKD without diabetes or albuminuria.

### Spironolactone [^111NREs7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Considerations

Spironolactone oral suspension is not therapeutically equivalent to Aldactone. Follow dosing instructions given here. In patients requiring a dose greater than 100 mg, use another formulation. Doses of the suspension greater than 100 mg may result in spironolactone concentrations higher than expected [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Spironolactone oral suspension can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73m2, initiate treatment at 20 mg (4 mL) once daily. Patients who tolerate 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage increased to 37.5 mg (7.5 mL) once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage reduced to 20 mg (4 mL) every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73m2, consider initiating treatment at 10 mg (2 mL) because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3 Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 20 mg (4 mL) to 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses > 75 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4 Treatment of Edema Associated with Hepatic Cirrhosis

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended initial daily dose is 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. In patients requiring titration above 100 mg, use another formulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112uqw8b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

In June 2023, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) presented and published the new 2023 ESH Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension, a document that was endorsed by the European Renal Association (ERA). Following the evolution of evidence in recent years, several novel recommendations relevant to the management of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) appeared in these Guidelines. These include recommendations for target office blood pressure (BP) < 130/80 mmHg in most and against target office BP < 120/70 mmHg in all patients with CKD; recommendations for use of spironolactone or chlorthalidone for patients with resistant hypertension with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) higher or lower than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively; use of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for patients with CKD and estimated eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2; use of finerenone for patients with CKD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, albuminuria, eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium < 5.0 mmol/L; and revascularization in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease and secondary hypertension or high-risk phenotypes if stenosis ≥ 70% is present. The present report is a synopsis of sections of the ESH Guidelines that are relevant to the daily clinical practice of nephrologists, prepared by experts from ESH and ERA. The sections summarized are those referring to the role of CKD in hypertension staging and cardiovascular risk stratification, the evaluation of hypertension-mediated kidney damage and the overall management of hypertension in patients with CKD.

### Influence of baseline and worsening renal function on efficacy of spironolactone in patients with severe heart failure: insights from RALES (randomized aldactone evaluation study) [^1175aXgb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study investigated the influence of baseline and worsening renal function (WRF) on the efficacy of spironolactone in patients with severe heart failure (HF).

Background

Renal dysfunction or decline in renal function is a known predictor of adverse outcome in patients with HF, and treatment decisions are often on the basis of measures of renal function.

Methods

We used data from the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) in 1,658 patients with New York Heart Association functional class III or IV HF and an ejection fraction < 35%. Participants were randomized to spironolactone 25 mg, which could be titrated to 50 mg, or placebo daily. Renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) was estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Worsening renal function was defined as a 30% reduction in eGFR from baseline to 12 weeks post-randomization.

Results

Individuals with reduced baseline eGFR exhibited similar relative risk reductions in all-cause death and the combined endpoint of death or hospital stays for HF as those with a baseline eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and greater absolute risk reduction compared with those with a higher baseline eGFR (10.3% vs. 6.4%). Moreover, WRF (17% vs. 7% for spironolactone and placebo groups, p < 0.001) was associated with an increased adjusted risk of death in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 1.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 2.6) but not in those randomized to spironolactone (hazard ratio: 1.1, 95% confidence interval: 0.79 to 1.5, p interaction = 0.009). The risk of hyperkalemia and renal failure was higher in those with worse baseline renal function and those with WRF, particularly in the spironolactone arm, but the substantial net benefit of spironolactone therapy remained.

Conclusions

The absolute benefit of spironolactone was greatest in patients with reduced eGFR. Worsening renal function was associated with a negative prognosis, yet the mortality benefit of spironolactone was maintained.

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^116MePwR]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Table I
Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Table II
Primary and secondary outcome measures

The trial started recruitment in June 2014 and aimed to recruit 350 patients over a 2-year period. However, the rate of recruitment was slower than anticipated, and it became evident by November 2015 that recruitment of this number would not be completed within the funded time, and the decision was taken to change the study design to one with the single primary end point of change in LV mass. This allowed a sample size which could be recruited within the funded time frame (see sample size calculations section). This decision was made following discussions with the funder, that is, the British Heart Foundation; the Trial Management Group; and the Trial Steering Committee who remain blind to any interim data analyses.

Ethical approval for this study was awarded by the West Midlands National Research Ethics Service Committee in September 2013 (13/WM/0304). The study is funded by the(SP/12/8/29620) and is registered with Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (Clinical Trials Authorization No. 21761/0295/001–0001). The authors are solely responsible for the design and conduct of this study, all study analyses, the drafting and editing of the article, and its final contents.

Recruitment and screening

Recruitment of 154 patients was completed by 31 December 2016. Eligible patients (Table I) were identified using hospital and primary care medical records. All recruitment took place within hospital outpatient clinics in the aforementioned institutions in 2 stages. Firstly, all patients apparently fulfilling the eligibility criteria were asked for written consent for additional screening procedures to be undertaken. Screening procedures were as follows:
1 Ensuring that potential participants met the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria.
2 Physical examination to check pulse, office blood pressure, and signs of hypovolemia, and a cardiovascular examination to exclude signs of heart failure or valvular disease. Echocardiography was performed only in cases of clinical uncertainty about the presence of heart failure or valve disease.
3 Recording an electrocardiogram.
4 Blood tests for routine biochemical and hematological parameters including eGFR.
5 Females of child-bearing potential underwent a pregnancy test.

When patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria, informed written consent was obtained for randomization into the main SPIRO-CKD trial in keeping with the principles set out by the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Effects of spironolactone and chlorthalidone on cardiovascular structure and function in chronic kidney disease: a randomized, open-label trial [^114Bb7rE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, treatment with spironolactone in early-stage CKD reduced left ventricular mass and arterial stiffness compared with placebo. It is not known if these effects were due to BP reduction or specific vascular and myocardial effects of spironolactone.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point study conducted in four UK centers (Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and London) comparing spironolactone 25 mg to chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily for 40 weeks in 154 participants with nondiabetic stage 2 and 3 CKD (eGFR 30–89 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). The primary end point was change in left ventricular mass on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were on treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and had controlled BP (target ≤ 130/80 mm Hg).

Results

There was no significant difference in left ventricular mass regression; at week 40, the adjusted mean difference for spironolactone compared with chlorthalidone was -3.8 g (95% confidence interval, -8.1 to 0.5 g, P = 0.08). Office and 24-hour ambulatory BPs fell in response to both drugs with no significant differences between treatment. Pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups; at week 40, the adjusted mean difference for spironolactone compared with chlorthalidone was 0.04 m/s (-0.4 m/s, 0.5 m/s, P = 0.90). Hyperkalemia (defined ≥ 5.4 mEq/L) occurred more frequently with spironolactone (12 versus two participants, adjusted relative risk was 5.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 22.1, P = 0.02), but there were no patients with severe hyperkalemia (defined ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). A decline in eGFR > 30% occurred in eight participants treated with chlorthalidone compared with two participants with spironolactone (adjusted relative risk was 0.2, 95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 1.1, P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Spironolactone was not superior to chlorthalidone in reducing left ventricular mass, BP, or arterial stiffness in nondiabetic CKD.

### Efficacy and safety of a low-sodium diet and spironolactone in patients with stage 1–3a chronic kidney disease: a pilot study [^1154gyBr]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive salt intake is associated with the deterioration of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Aldosterone is also known as an independent risk factor for kidney injury. Dietary sodium intake acts as a main stimulator in aldosterone-mediated kidney injury. Hence, this study aimed to further investigate the renal protective effects and safety of a low-sodium diet in combination with spironolactone (SPL) in stage 1–3a CKD.

Methods

This single-center, SPL-blinded randomized controlled trial recruited patients with stage 1–3a CKD, randomized into three groups, low-sodium (3g/d salt)+placebo, medium-sodium (5g/d salt)+SPL, and low-sodium (3g/d salt)+SPL. Patients received 12weeks of intervention. The primary and secondary endpoints were 24-h urine protein and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the end of the intervention, respectively.

Results

A total of 74 patients were analyzed eventually. Significantly decreased 24-h urine protein was found in all three groups, from 0.37 to 0.23g/d (P = 0.004) in the low-sodium+placebo group, from 0.44 to 0.29g/d (P = 0.020) in the medium-sodium+SPL group, and from 0.35 to 0.31g/d (P = 0.013) in the low-sodium +SPL group. There were no significant differences among the three groups in 24-h urine protein amount change after intervention from pre-treatment values (P = 0.760, ITT set). The results of the 24-h urine protein by using PP set analysis was similar to the ITT set. No significant differences in eGFR, nutritional, metabolic, inflammatory, and other biomarkers were observed across all three groups (P > 0.05). No safety signal was observed.

Conclusion

No additional benefit was observed when SPL was prescribed to patients already on a low-sodium diet (3.0g/d). Still, small doses of SPL may benefit patients with poor sodium restriction. A combination of short-term low-dose SPL and ARB is safe for patients with stage 1–3a CKD, but blood potassium must be regularly monitored.

### Potential role of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in nondiabetic chronic kidney disease and glomerular disease [^116AzmAG]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Experience of MRAs in Diabetic Glomerular Disease

The renin-angiotensin system has been a therapeutic target for the management of diabetic glomerular disease for decades. Use of steroidal MRAs (e.g. spironolactone) in the setting of cardiovascular indications has revealed kidney protective effects, highlighting the intrinsic links between heart and kidney outcomes. A subanalysis of a phase 3 clinical trial of spironolactone in heart failure showed the antiproteinuria effects of this drug (39% placebo-adjusted reduction in albuminuria). The results from a phase 4 study of high-dose eplerenone in people with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk also showed an encouraging antiproteinuric effect (34% reduction in albuminuria versus placebo). However, the results of a pooled analysis of steroidal MRA clinical trials showed that although these drugs reduce heart failure hospitalizations and mortality across a wide range of patients with kidney dysfunction (based on baseline eGFR), these benefits are much reduced and have associated safety concerns in patients who had more severe kidney dysfunction at baseline, particularly those with eGFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. There is an absence of phase 3 outcome data with steroidal MRAs in the kidney space.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116PVLB9]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in CKD with diabetes — Systematic reviews and meta-analyses show benefit for slowing CKD progression and decreasing major adverse cardiovascular events, but evidence for steroidal MRAs on cardiovascular events and CKD progression is conflicting; in the BARACK open-label trial of CKD with eGFR 30–49 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria < 618 mg/g, spironolactone 25 mg daily showed no benefit and was not well-tolerated, with two-thirds discontinuing within six months due to decline in kidney function or hyperkalemia; meta-analysis results reported risk ratio (RR) 0.86 for kidney failure and RR 0.84 for cardiovascular events; finerenone, the only currently approved non-steroidal MRA, was tested in FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD enrolling diabetes with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73m2 and albuminuria > 30 mg/g on maximally tolerated ACEI or ARB with serum potassium 4.8 mmol/L or less, and a prespecified pooled analysis at a median follow-up of 3 years showed reduced composite cardiovascular endpoint (HR: 0.86) and composite CKD progression endpoint (HR: 0.77) with finerenone, with cardiovascular benefit largely driven by fewer hospitalizations for heart failure.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for hypertension management in advanced chronic kidney disease: BLOCK-CKD trial [^113qGJVW]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone, a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, is recommended as add-on therapy for treatment-resistant/uncontrolled hypertension. However, caution is advised in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to an increased risk for hyperkalemia. KBP-5074 is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist under investigation for the treatment of treatment-resistant and uncontrolled hypertension in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD. BLOCK-CKD is a phase 2, international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KBP-5074, on top of current therapy, in patients with stage 3B/4 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 15 and ≤ 44 mL/[min·1.73 m 2]) and resistant hypertension (trough cuff seated systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 2 or more antihypertensive medicines with complementary mechanisms). Patients (n = 240) will be randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily treatment with KBP-5074 0.25 mg, KBP-5074 0.5 mg, or placebo, stratified by estimated glomerular filtration rate (≥ 30 versus < 30 mL/[min·1.73 m 2]) and systolic blood pressure (≥ 160 versus < 160 mmHg). Approximately 30% of enrolled patients should have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 29 mL/(min·1.73 m 2). The primary efficacy analysis is the change in trough cuff seated systolic blood pressure from baseline to day 84 for the KBP-5074 doses compared with placebo. Changes in urinary albumin-creatinine ratio will be assessed along with changes in serum potassium/incidence of hyperkalemia and changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine. BLOCK-CKD will determine whether the addition of KBP-5074 will effectively lower blood pressure without an increased risk of hyperkalemia in patients who are not candidates for steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists due to advanced CKD.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1175cRQ2]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that the addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic BP (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2, with reductions greater than with doxazosin, bisoprolol, or clonidine. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects; eplerenone is a potential alternative, but RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily and effective treatment may require higher dosages, and nonsteroidal MRA for moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111RKLXp]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter. In this population, MRA therapy provides high economic value. In patients taking MRA whose serum potassium cannot be maintained at < 5.5 mEq/L, MRA should be discontinued to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. MRAs show consistent improvement in all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, and SCD in HFrEF, and eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L are contraindications to MRA initiation.

### Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease: pathophysiological insights and therapeutic options [^111gCA2s]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

On the basis of large randomized studies showing a reduction in total mortality, β-blockers are also recommended as first-line therapy in parallel to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors to counteract sudden cardiac death and progression of HF in patients with HFrEF. – A meta-analysis of intervention studies with β-blockers in patients with CKD stage 3 to 5 clearly demonstrated that these patients benefit from this therapy, suggesting that β-blockers are equally effective in patients with CKD as in non-CKD patients. Recent data underline the benefits of a β-blocker therapy in patients with CKD (CKD stages 3–4) with HF, left ventricular EF < 50%, and sinus rhythm. If patients with HFrEF are still symptomatic despite treatment with ACE inhibitors and β-blockers, and if the left ventricular EF is ≤ 35%, administration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) is indicated, but with particular caution in patients with advanced CKD. Spironolactone and eplerenone improved the prognosis of patients with HFrEF, and this therapy is effective in patients with HF and CKD stages 1 to 3. In the DOHAS study (Dialysis Outcomes Heart Failure Aldactone Study), 309 patients with CKD stage 5D were randomized to either 25 mg spironolactone per day or to standard of care only. Compared with the control group, the combined primary end point of mortality and cardio- or cerebrovascular hospitalization was significantly reduced in the spironolactone group (hazard ratio, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.20–0.81]). However, cardiovascular efficacy and safety of spironolactone are still uncertain in CKD stage 5. In recent placebo-controlled trials, spironolactone appeared safe in carefully monitored maintenance CKD stage 5 patient cohorts but it did not affect cardiovascular parameters like diastolic functionor left ventricular mass, ambulatory blood pressure, left ventricular EF, 6-minute walk test distance, or New York Heart Association class. Because spironolactone increased the frequency of moderate — albeit not severe — hyperkalemia in patients with CKD stage 4 to 5, MRAs formally are still contraindicated in advanced CKD. The ongoing ALCHEMIST trial (ALdosterone Antagonist Chronic HEModialysis Interventional Survival Trial) examines the effect of aldosterone on cardiovascular outcome (including HF) in chronic hemodialysis patients. Novel therapeutic strategies with potassium binders may provide an additional option for patients with hyperkalemia.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): rationale and design [^112Qh78D]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

‐intervention, study visits and follow‐up

Patients are randomized 1:1 to open‐label MRA (either spironolactone or eplerenone) plus usual care versus usual care alone. Patients randomized to MRA receive a prescription to be filled and paid for out of pocket. (In both Sweden and the US, spironolactone can be obtained for approximately 10 US cents per day. In Sweden, patients pay out‐of‐pocket for prescription medications up to an annual maximum of approximately 250 Euro, after which additional medication costs are covered by the government). Spironolactone is more potent than eplerenone, but the initial dose in guidelines and clinical practice is generally 25 mg/day for both drugs and is the dose recommended in SPIRRIT‐HFpEF. A dose of 25 mg every other day or 25 mg, half tablet every day, may be prescribed at investigator discretion for patients judged to be at higher risk of hyperkalaemia or kidney dysfunction. Patients who at baseline are known not to tolerate spironolactone due to gynecomastia or who prefer eplerenone will be prescribed eplerenone. Eplerenone is relatively inexpensive, although more expensive than spironolactone. Spironolactone (or eplerenone) is recommended to be increased to a target dose of 50 mg daily if tolerated.

Most previous RRCTs in Sweden have involved one‐time interventions (i.e. not chronic therapy) without the need for monitoring during follow‐up. Spironolactone is familiar to all clinicians but is associated with a risk of hyperkalaemia and worsening kidney function. Therefore, there are no required in‐person follow‐up visits in the trial, but potassium and eGFR are measured for all patients in both groups at local laboratories at weeks 1, 4, 26, and 52 after randomization, at end of study, 7–14 days after any dose changes, and as needed at the discretion of the investigator. Local sites order blood tests, instruct patients to have blood drawn at their local clinic, and these laboratory results are then available to investigators in Sweden from regional electronic health records, and in the US laboratory data are acquired from site investigators from individual testing sites and/or the electronic medical record. After obtaining the laboratory result, the investigator or study coordinator has telephone contact with the patient and provides instruction on continued treatment and records any events, laboratory values, and treatment decisions in a separate case report form.

### Finerenone versus spironolactone in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes: a target trial emulation [^113w9VYt]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major complication of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a leading cause of kidney failure worldwide. Patients with CKD and T2D have a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular disease and progressive kidney dysfunction, despite treatment with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. However, even with these therapies, a high residual risk of adverse outcomes remains, highlighting the need for additional treatment strategies.

Finerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), has demonstrated cardiorenal benefits in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes in the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials. In contrast, spironolactone, a traditional and cost-effective steroidal MRA, has been shown to reduce proteinuria and blood pressure but is limited by a high incidence of hyperkalemia –. The BARACK-D trial evaluated spironolactone in patients with CKD and found limited cardiovascular benefits, with high discontinuation rates due to declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and hyperkalemia.

Recently, steroidal agents such as spironolactone and eplerenone, along with the nonsteroidal agent finerenone, have been guideline-recommended for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)and are increasingly used in CKD, particularly in diabetic nephropathy. However, direct comparisons of finerenone and spironolactone in real-world CKD and T2D populations remain scarce. Given their distinct pharmacological properties, further evaluation of their comparative effectiveness and safety is warranted in clinical practice. In this work, we conducted a target trial emulation using real-world electronic health records from the TriNetX network to compare the effectiveness and safety of finerenone and spironolactone in patients with CKD and T2D.

The study PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) was published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the trial question was: what is the role of add-on spironolactone in patients with drug-resistant hypertension? In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the population was: 335 patients (105 female, 230 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were secondary/accelerated hypertension; T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min; sustained AF; non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the interventions were: n = 285 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12) n = 274 placebo (matching placebo daily for 12 weeks). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 4.1 mmHg; AD 8.7 mmHg, 95% CI 7.69 to 9.72). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in home SBP at week 12 (14.4 mmHg vs. 4.2 mmHg; AD 10.2 mmHg, 95% CI 8.74 to 11.7) Significant increase in reduction in seated clinic SBP through week 6 to week 12 (20.7 mmHg vs. 10.8 mmHg; AD 9.92 mmHg, 95% CI 8.59 to 11.3). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months, spironolactone was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose spironolactone in management of diabetic kidney disease in a real-world setting [^111bTPAV]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Adding spironolactone to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers has been shown to reduce albuminuria in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, the increased risk of hyperkalaemia is a major concern. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose (12.5mg/day) spironolactone in reducing albuminuria and improving renal function in Iranian adults with DKD.

Methods

This was a pre-post-treatment study of 60 patients with type 2 diabetes, age > 18years, albuminuria ≥ 30mg, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30mL/min/1.73m 2, and serum potassium level ≤ 5mEq/L, who were referred to the diabetes clinic of Shariati Hospital, Tehran, Iran. The patients were prescribed spironolactone (12.5mg) once daily. Changes in urinary albumin excretion (U. Alb), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR), blood pressure, serum creatinine (Cr) levels, and serum potassium levels from the baseline over the 12-week intervention period were measured. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

Results

After 12weeks of taking 12.5mg/day spironolactone, there was a statistically significant but modest increase in eGFR (p = 0.042), and a statistically significant decrease was observed in both the U. Alb and uACR (p < 0.001). There was a significant reduction in the mean Cr level (p = 0.003). Systolic blood pressure did not decrease significantly (p = 0.079), but diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly (p = 0.007). Changes in serum potassium levels over time were not significant (p = 0.302). The reduction in albuminuria in patients taking only spironolactone and those taking spironolactone with SGLT2i was not significantly different (p = 0.916 and p = 0.948, respectively).

Conclusions

This study found that adding spironolactone to RAAS blockers effectively reduced albuminuria, mildly increased eGFR, and improved renal outcomes in patients with DKD. Additionally, spironolactone significantly reduced albuminuria, regardless of the concurrent use of SGLT2i.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^114Gzgri]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Power calculations

We determined that a sample size of 1,511 participants per group (3,022 total) would be required at 80% power to detect a 20% relative risk reduction in death or cardiovascular events over 3 years of follow-up, accounting for an anticipated treatment withdrawal rate of 13%. We chose to power the trial conservatively on a 20% risk reduction because this proposed treatment effect was around half the risk reduction observed in a trial of the aldosterone receptor antagonist, eplerenone, in patients with mild heart failure.

Statistical analysis

We performed an intention-to-treat analysis, including all participants who had undergone randomization except for those who were found to be ineligible for participation postrandomization. For the primary outcome, we report the HR and 95% CI for the time to the first occurrence of a primary endpoint event using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for randomized treatment allocation. The safety analysis included all participants who had actually received the treatment versus the total number of people receiving usual care.

We report the frequency and percentage of the proportion of participants that reached the primary endpoint, the time at risk in days and the incidence rate per 100 years at risk. A Kaplan–Meier curve is used to compare the time to the first occurrence of a primary endpoint event between intervention groups. These analyses are repeated for each individual component of the primary endpoint (hospitalization, CVD and death).

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose spironolactone in management of diabetic kidney disease in a real-world setting [^117GbvpP]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding hyperkalaemia during spironolactone use, almost all studies conducted with 25–100 mg of spironolactone have reported some rate of hyperkalaemia among the study population. Lin et al. reported 2.5% mild to moderate and 1.6% severe hyperkalaemia among 640 patients. Oxlunda et al. reported hyperkalaemia as the most frequent complication, leading to dose reduction in three patients and discontinuation in one. In a study by Tofte et al. involving 1775 participants, 25 mg of spironolactone was used to assess the progression of microalbuminuria. The study reported that 13% of the participants using spironolactone experienced hyperkalaemia. However, our study, similar to the Oiwa et al. study, showed that low‐dose (12.5 mg/day) spironolactone played a significant role in reducing albuminuria and increasing eGFR, without causing hyperkalaemia (K > 5 mEq/L) in any of the participants.

Although a limited number of studies have tested 12.5 mg/day spironolactone, our study contributes value by validating the efficacy and safety of this regimen in real‐world clinic‐based care in the Middle East (Iran). Unlike in well‐controlled RCTs, our patients were treated in routine clinical care with a wider array of comorbid illnesses and access to healthcare constraints. This environment approximates where spironolactone cost‐effectiveness would be seen to have the most impact. Additionally, the study involved serial K checks, proving it is feasible to utilise low‐dose spironolactone safely in clinic‐based care. Therefore, although the efficacy signal is consistent with prior data, the study yields useful evidence on implementation and real‐world applicability, notably in areas with reduced healthcare resources where hyperkalaemia concerns would restrict utilisation of spironolactone.

Efficacy

After 12 weeks of intervention, as the primary endpoint (ITT set), 24-h urine protein decreased from 0.37 (0.23, 0.70) to 0.23 (0.16, 0.51) in the low-sodium+placebo group (P = 0.004). The 24-h urine protein decreased from 0.44 (0.33, 0.71) to 0.29 (0.17, 0.50) in the medium-sodium+SPL group (P = 0.020). The 24-h urine protein decreased from 0.35 (0.26, 0.73) to 0.31 (0.22, 0.60) in the low-sodium+SPL group (P = 0.013). There were no significant differences among the three groups in 24-h urine protein amount changes after intervention from pre-treatment values (P = 0.760), as shown in Table 2.

In the low-sodium+placebo group, the 24-h urine protein to creatine ratio was decreased from 30.54 (18.83, 77.38) to 25.40 (14.12, 50.71) (P = 0.012). Meanwhile, the 24-h urine protein to creatine ratios were decreased from 54.00 (28.77, 81.30) to 24.72 (18.49, 44.10), and from 33.12 (25.90, 58.68) to 29.20 (15.69, 62.39) in the medium-sodium+SPL (P = 0.011) and low-sodium+SPL (P = 0.026) groups, respectively. As for the changes pre- and post-intervention, there were no differences among the three groups (P = 0.118). The secondary endpoint eGFR also showed no significant differences among the three groups. In addition, the results of the 24-h urine protein by using PP set analysis was similar to the ITT set (PP set; Table 3).

### Design and baseline characteristics of the finerenone, in addition to standard of care, on the progression of kidney disease in patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (FIND-CKD) randomized trial [^115jHW4k]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The efficacy and safety of the non-steroidal MRA finerenone has been demonstrated in the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials. Based on these trials, clinical practice guidelines recommend finerenone as part of the pharmacological treatment to prevent kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events in CKD patients with T2D. Both trials excluded patients with CKD without diabetes. The FIND-CKD trial is ongoing to address this knowledge gap and is evaluating the efficacy and safety of finerenone in participants with CKD without diabetes.

Activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor contributes to sodium and water retention, inflammation and fibrosis, which in the long term impairs kidney and cardiovascular function. Small clinical studies in patients with CKD with and without diabetes showed that the steroidal MRAs spironolactone and eplerenone reduced albuminuria and stabilized eGFR decline during 1 year of treatment. However, spironolactone and eplerenone increase potassium levels and the risk of hyperkalaemia, particularly in patients with more severe CKD. This side effect has dampened enthusiasm to conduct large clinical trials to determine the long-term effects on clinical kidney outcomes and the lack of sufficient data has limited their use; neither eplerenone nor spironolactone are approved for the treatment of CKD. The pharmacological properties of finerenone are different from the steroidal MRAs. Indeed, in the prespecified pooled analysis of the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials (FIDELITY) the incidence of permanent drug discontinuation due to hyperkalaemia was low (1.7%). In an indirect comparative analysis of FIDELITY and the AMBER trial (NCT03071263), finerenone was associated with a lower risk of hyperkalaemia and discontinuation than spironolactone. Although comparisons across trials should be interpreted carefully, a head-to-head comparison of finerenone and spironolactone in ≈400 patients with heart failure and CKD supports the notion that finerenone is associated with a lower risk of hyperkalaemia than spironolactone. The lower risk of hyperkalaemia with finerenone compared with steroidal MRAs may be attributed to a combination of physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including a short half-life (2–3 hours) and a distinct receptor binding mode with subsequent differential gene expression. The FIND-CKD trial will monitor potassium levels throughout the study and provide a detailed characterization of the effects of finerenone on this safety parameter in patients with CKD due to non-diabetic causes.

### Clinical benefit of spironolactone in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and severe renal dysfunction: data from the Korean heart failure registry [^117HCWrt]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Backgrounds

We investigated the relationship between spironolactone use and all-cause mortality in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients with severe renal dysfunction. The clinical benefit of spironolactone in the treatment of heart failure (HF) has been described in several large randomized clinical trials. However, its clinical benefits have not been studied in hospitalized ADHF patients with severe renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)).

Methods and Results

We retrospectively analyzed data from the Korean Heart Failure Registry. We included 1,035 ADHF patients with severe renal dysfunction. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, all-cause mortality in the spironolactone-treated group was significantly lower than that in the nonspironolactone group (18.1% vs 24.9%, respectively, log rank P = 0.028). However, spironolactone use was not an independent predictor after adjusting other HF risk factors (hazard ratio 0.974, 95% CI 0.681–1.392, P = 0.884) and after propensity score matching (P = 0.115). In subgroup analysis, the clinical benefit of spironolactone use was preserved in women, prehospital spironolactone use, the chronic kidney disease stage 3b (eGFR 30–44 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)), and the appropriate spironolactone use (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and K ≤ 5.0 mmol/L).

Conclusion

The spironolactone therapy was not beneficial in ADHF patients with severe renal dysfunction after multivariable adjusting and propensity score matching. However, we reassured the current HF guidelines for spironolactone use and the clinical benefit in chronic kidney disease stage 3b should be assessed in future clinical trial.

### Aldosterone antagonists for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^115HRjnS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is increasingly used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of aldosterone antagonists (both selective (eplerenone) and non-selective (spironolactone)) alone or in combination with ACEi or ARB in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including major cardiovascular events, hospitalisation and all-cause mortality; kidney function (proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, and need for renal replacement therapy; and adverse events (including gynaecomastia and hyperkalaemia).

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 30 January 2013 using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists alone or in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) with other anti-hypertensive strategies or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. We tested for heterogeneity in estimated treatment effects using the Cochran Q test and I² statistic. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used.

Main Results

We identified 27 studies (1549 participants) that were eligible for inclusion. These studies provided no data relating to aldosterone antagonists in addition to ACEi or ARB (or both) on patient-level outcomes including major cardiovascular events and mortality and progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis or transplantation. Compared with ACEi or ARB (or both), non-selective aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone) combined with ACEi or ARB (or both) significantly reduced 24-hour protein excretion (11 studies, 596 participants): SMD -0.61, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.13). There was a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) at the end of treatment with additional non-selective aldosterone antagonist therapy (systolic BP (10 studies, 556 participants): MD -3.44 mm Hg, 95% CI -5.05 to -1.83) (diastolic BP (9 studies, 520 participants): MD -1.73 mm Hg, 95% CI -2.83 to -0.62). However, we found that aldosterone antagonist treatment had imprecise effects at the end of treatment on GFR (9 studies, 528 participants; MD -2.55 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.67 to 0.51), doubled the risk of hyperkalaemia (11 studies, 632 patients): RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.20; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH): 7.2, 95% CI 3.4 to ∞) and increased the risk of gynaecomastia compared to ACEi or ARB (or both) (4 studies, 281 patients): RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23; NNTH: 14.1, 95% CI 8.7 to 37.3). Most studies enrolled few patients (range 12 to 268) and were powered to observe differences in surrogate end points rather than patient-focused outcomes. Nine studies had a cross-over design and the majority of studies did not adequately report study methods to assess methods and study quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Aldosterone antagonists reduced proteinuria and blood pressure in adults who had mild to moderate CKD and were treated with ACEi or ARB (or both), but increase hyperkalaemia and gynaecomastia. Whether adding aldosterone antagonists to ACEi or ARB (or both) reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events or ESKD in this population is unknown.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose spironolactone in management of diabetic kidney disease in a real-world setting [^114LiCJz]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a lower dose (12.5 mg/day) of spironolactone in lowering albuminuria and improving renal function in Iranian adults with DN. Because of known risks of hyperkalaemia with higher doses, we specifically evaluated whether a reduced dose would preserve clinical benefit without increasing adverse effects. Since spironolactone is low‐cost and readily available, proof of its efficacy and safety with a lower dose might be a feasible, low‐cost option for enhancing renal outcomes in DKD. Additionally, we examined whether low‐dose add‐on therapy with spironolactone might have additive effects when combined with conventional RAAS blockers, with or without SGLT2is.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) use — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an ACEi or ARB, a CCB, and a diuretic. Replacing thiazide-type diuretics (eg, HCTZ or bendroflumethiazide) with thiazide-like diuretics (eg, chlorthalidone and indapamide) may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection among patients with previous MI or stroke. Randomized controlled trials have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour SBP by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg when compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR < 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol, and the magnitude of reduction in 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP was greater with spironolactone than clonidine in a separate clinical trial. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects. For eplerenone, RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily when compared with placebo, and effective treatment may require higher dosages; use of nonsteroidal MRA for treating resistant hypertension in patients with moderate to advanced CKD has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism for non-diabetic kidney disease [^115CvcS7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Novel approaches to enable the use of MRAs in CKD patients include the use of potassium binders. In the AMBER trial it was evaluated if patients eligible for spironolactone to treat uncontrolled resistant hypertension with CKD (eGFR 25 to ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2) could better tolerate spironolactone when a potassium binder (patiromer) was simultaneously administered. After 12 weeks, the patiromer significantly increased the proportion of patients that continued spironolactone treatment (86%) as compared with placebo (66%).

Ocedurenone, a non-steroidal MRA, was tested in the BLOCK-CKD study, a phase 2b multicenter RCT that evaluated the efficacy of ocedurenone to reduce blood pressure in patients with advanced CKD (stage 3B/4) when added to standard treatment. After 84 days of follow up, ocedurenone (0.25 and 0.5 mg/day) significantly reduced blood pressure, with no difference in the incidence of hyperkalemia (≥ 5.6 to < 6 mmol/L) and no hyperkalemia events (≥ 6.0 mmol/L), showing the potential safety of non-steroidal MRAs for advanced CKD patients. In this study, no effect of ocedurenone was observed on albuminuria, but the short-term nature of the trial did not allow an evaluation of whether ocedurenone could have an impact on long-term albuminuria.

2.3.1 Use of finerenone

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) like spironolactone and eplerenone have been demonstrated to improve blood pressure control, reduce proteinuria and slow progression of CKD and reduce mortality in heart failure. However, their use is limited by their propensity to cause hyperkalaemia in people with CKD, especially those with diabetes. Finerenone is a non‐steroidal, selective MRA with greater mineralocorticoid receptor affinity and selectivity, and as such its use is associated with less hyperkalaemia and minimal gynaecomastia compared with the steroidal MRAs.

Based on the strong evidence of cardio‐renal protection offered by the addition of finerenone in the FIDELIO‐CKD and FIGARO‐CKD studies, we suggest in people with CKD who have persistent albuminuria (ACR > 30 mg/mmol) despite the use of maximum tolerated doses of RASi and SGLT2i, to consider addition of finerenone to reduce the risk of adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. Finerenone can be used if eGFR is more than or equal to 25 mL/min/1.73m 2 and serum potassium is normal (< 5 mmol/L). Finerenone can also be used as a second line drug in addition to ACE inhibitor or ARB if SGLT2i is not tolerated. It is important to monitor serum potassium level after commencing treatment and the dose of finerenone adjusted accordingly.

2.3.2 Use of‐1 receptor agonists (‐1)

At present, one primary kidney end point study reported with GLP‐1 RAwhich demonstrated kidney benefits and CVD mortality benefits with the use of semaglutide on top of RASi as compared to standard of care (RASi‐only). In this trial, ~15.6% of the cohort were on SGLT‐2 inhibitors at baseline and no major heterogeneity of treatment effect or results were observed in those on this combination. GLP‐1 RA also have robust data in people with type 2 diabetes with multiple clinical trials demonstrating CVD benefits in those at risk of CVD or with established CVD. The available limited data from recent studies and real‐world data suggest potential complementary and additive effects and in our opinion combination treatment GLP‐1 RA and SGLT‐2 inhibitors should also be considered early in the management people with T2D and CKD to address residual cardio‐renal risk (Tiers 1 or 2).

Potassium binding agents and RAS/MRA continuation — trial data indicate that in the 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled AMBER trial, 86% of patiromer versus 66% of placebo-treated participants were able to remain on spironolactone at week 12. The DIAMOND trial (randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled) evaluated continued patiromer to maintain target doses of RAS inhibitor versus stopping and was associated with a higher rate of achieving target dose while maintaining normokalemia; participants had stage G3 or G4 CKD before randomization. Additional reporting noted maintaining at least 50% of target mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist dose, but only 44% completed 12 weeks of therapy and only 17% completed 54 weeks of therapy.

### Mitigating risk of aldosterone in diabetic kidney disease [^113kf5j8]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

STEROIDAL MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS

The correlation between aldosterone levels and breakthrough with decline in GFR supports aldosterone as a target for intervention in DKD in individuals on ACEi or ARB. The steroidal MRA spironolactone is potent but nonselective causing gynecomastia. Spironolactone was investigated in doses 25–50 mg/day in combination with ACEi or ARBs in individuals with T1D or T2D, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria or nephrotic range albuminuria in 16 studies lasting 2–18 months demonstrating a significant 39% reduction in albuminuria with the major concern being a more than six-fold increased risk for hyperkalemia particularly in individuals with impaired renal function. Similar data were found in meta-analyses including diabetic and nondiabetic CKD. A recent 72 weeks intervention study with four arms combining irbesartan 150 or 300 mg daily with spironolactone 20 mg or placebo confirmed long-term 30% antiproteinuric effect and safety in elderly with T2D and DKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2] when spironolactone was add-on to irbesartan. Prevention of DKD (onset of microalbuminuria and loss of eGFR) in T2D, with spironolactone is being tested in the 3-year PRIORITY study including normoalbuminuric patients with high risk for DKD determined from a urinary proteomics-based risk pattern for CKD (CKD273). The study includes only individuals with GFR more than 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2, to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia.

### Early detection of diabetic kidney disease by urinary proteomics and subsequent intervention with spironolactone to delay progression (PRIORITY): a prospective observational study and embedded randomised placebo-controlled trial [^111wLqBk]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Microalbuminuria is an early sign of kidney disease in people with diabetes and indicates increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We tested whether a urinary proteomic risk classifier (CKD273) score was associated with development of microalbuminuria and whether progression to microalbuminuria could be prevented with the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone.

Methods

In this multicentre, prospective, observational study with embedded randomised controlled trial (PRIORITY), we recruited people with type 2 diabetes, normal urinary albumin excretion, and preserved renal function from 15 specialist centres in ten European countries. All participants (observational cohort) were tested with the CKD273 classifier and classified as high risk (CKD273 classifier score > 0.154) or low risk (≤ 0.154). Participants who were classified as high risk were entered into a randomised controlled trial and randomly assigned (1:1), by use of an interactive web-response system, to receive spironolactone 25 mg once daily or matched placebo (trial cohort). The primary endpoint was development of confirmed microalbuminuria in all individuals with available data (observational cohort). Secondary endpoints included reduction in incidence of microalbuminuria with spironolactone (trial cohort, intention-to-treat population) and association between CKD273 risk score and measures of impaired renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; observational cohort). Adverse events (particularly gynaecomastia and hyperkalaemia) and serious adverse events were recorded for the intention-to-treat population (trial cohort). This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 20120–004523–4) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02040441) and is completed.

Findings

Between March 25, 2014, and Sept 30, 2018, we enrolled and followed-up 1775 participants (observational cohort), 1559 (88%) of 1775 participants had a low-risk urinary proteomic pattern and 216 (12%) had a high-risk pattern, of whom 209 were included in the trial cohort and assigned to spironolactone (n = 102) or placebo (n = 107). The overall median follow-up time was 2.51 years (IQR 2.0–3.0). Progression to microalbuminuria was seen in 61 (28%) of 216 high-risk participants and 139 (9%) of 1559 low-risk participants (hazard ratio [HR] 2.48, 95% CI 1.80–3.42; p < 0.0001, after adjustment for baseline variables of age, sex, HbA₁c, systolic blood pressure, retinopathy, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR], and eGFR). Development of impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2) was seen in 48 (26%) of 184 high-risk participants and 119 (8%) of 1423 low-risk participants (HR 3.50; 95% CI 2.50–4.90, after adjustment for baseline variables). A 30% decrease in eGFR from baseline (post-hoc endpoint) was seen in 42 (19%) of 216 high-risk participants and 62 (4%) of 1559 low-risk participants (HR 5.15, 95% CI 3.41–7.76; p < 0.0001, after adjustment for basline eGFR and UACR). In the intention-to-treat trial cohort, development of microalbuminuria was seen in 35 (33%) of 107 in the placebo group and 26 (25%) of 102 in the spironolactone group (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49–1.34; p = 0.41). In the safety analysis (intention-to-treat trial cohort), events of plasma potassium concentrations of more than 5.5 mmol/L were seen in 13 (13%) of 102 participants in the spironolactone group and four (4%) of 107 participants in the placebo group, and gynaecomastia was seen in three (3%) participants in the spironolactone group and none in the placebo group. One patient died in the placebo group due to a cardiac event (considered possibly related to study drug) and one patient died in the spironolactone group due to cancer, deemed unrelated to study drug.

Interpretation

In people with type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria, a high-risk score from the urinary proteomic classifier CKD273 was associated with an increased risk of progression to microalbuminuria over a median of 2.5 years, independent of clinical characteristics. However, spironolactone did not prevent progression to microalbuminuria in high-risk patients.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^117YJcLQ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Heart Failure: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertension: Initiate treatment at 25 to 100 mg daily in either single or divided doses (2.3).
Edema: Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly. The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses (2.4).
Primary hyperaldosteronism: Initiate treatment at 100 to 400 mg in preparation for surgery. In patients unsuitable for surgery use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient (2.5).

2.1	General Considerations

ALDACTONE can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2	Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 25 mg once daily may have their dosage reduced to 25 mg every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, consider initiating therapy at 25 mg every other day because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3	Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 25 to 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses is recommended. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4	Treatment of Edema

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The recommended initial daily dosage is 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

2.5	Treatment of Primary Hyperaldosteronism

Administer ALDACTONE in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, ALDACTONE can be used as long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.

### Antihypertensive effects and safety of esaxerenone in patients with moderate kidney dysfunction [^116we8vy]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Esaxerenone was well tolerated in both studies. Sex hormone-related adverse events, which occur frequently with spironolactone, were not observed in either study, consistent with other esaxerenone studies. Hyperkalemia is another safety concern with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers, particularly in the presence of decreased kidney function. In the present study, elevations in the serum K + level were transient, and no patient met dose reduction or therapy discontinuation criteria, even when esaxerenone was added to a RAS inhibitor. In the add-on study, seven of 58 patients had transient serum K + levels ≥ 5.5 mEq/L, which is comparable to the rate with low-dose spironolactone added to a RAS inhibitor in nondiabetic early-stage CKD patients (nine of 56 patients). The same study showed that spironolactone decreased the eGFR by 3 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and another study in nondiabetic CKD patients (baseline eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) showed a decrease of 15.1%. In the present study, a similar decrease in the eGFR was observed until week 12 (−4.45 mL/min/1.73 m 2: −8.56%), but the eGFR returned to baseline levels during the follow-up period. A transient eGFR decline has been reported with all mineralocorticoid receptor blockers, and this decline is thought to be due to the improvement in renal glomerular hyperfiltration. Thus, esaxerenone seems to have a safety profile comparable to that of low-dosage (25 mg/day) spironolactone in patients with moderate kidney dysfunction treated with a RAS inhibitor.

### Changing from the CKD-EPI to the EKFC creatinine equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate in adults in a Northern European health system [^111dK6ze]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) 2021 equation to estimate GFR performs as well or better than the CKD-EPI 2009 equation in predominantly white adult European populations, with less bias and greater accuracy against measured GFR. This study explores how changing from the CKD-EPI to the EKFC equation in a large European health system may impact disease distribution, prognosis and clinical decisions.

Methods

We studied over 1.7 million adults in Stockholm undergoing routine care during 2006–2021. We compared eGFR values and reclassification across KDIGO GFR categories when changing from the CKD-EPI to EKFC equation and examined associations of eGFR and reclassification with risk for kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT), mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) using Cox models. We also modelled the impact of eGFR equation change on clinical decisions like nephrology referral or medication eligibility/contraindication.

Results

EKFC yielded modestly lower eGFR values than CKD-EPI by a median (IQR) of -4.9 (-8.3 to -2.2) mL/min/1.73 m². As a result, CKD G3-G5 prevalence rose from 4.5% to 6.2%. Both equations strongly predicted KFRT, mortality, and MACE. Participants reclassified to lower eGFR categories were older; after adjustment for age, participants had similar risks of mortality and MACE to those not reclassified and a lower risk of KFRT. Changing to the EKFC equation would impact clinical decisions at low eGFR thresholds, such as nephrology referrals (22% higher), eligibility for SGLT2is (39% higher) or contraindication for spironolactone in heart failure (26% higher).

Conclusions

Adopting the EKFC equation in this Northern European health system would modestly lower eGFR estimates, increasing the prevalence of moderate/severe CKD and affecting clinical classification and decisions. eGFR by both equations strongly predicted outcomes, but individuals reclassified to a lower eGFR category by EKFC did not have consistent associations across outcomes.

### Steroidal MRA across the spectrum of renal function: a pooled analysis of RCTs [^114KBJyR]. JACC: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are underused in patients with kidney dysfunction, and their efficacy among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of steroidal MRAs across the spectrum of estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) in randomized controlled trials. The study included patients with heart failure (HF) or myocardial infarction and advanced CKD who participated in the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study), EMPHASIS-HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure), TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist) in the Americas, and EPHESUS (Eplerenone Post-AMI Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study) trials.

Methods

This study used individual patient data meta-analysis using Cox models stratified by trial with treatment-by-eGFR interaction terms. eGFR was recalculated by using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine formula.

Results

A total of 12,700 patients were included, of whom 331 (2.6%) had an eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (mean eGFR: 26.8 ± 3.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Patients with advanced CKD had higher annualized event rates for all studied outcomes: placebo event rate for the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization was ∼3-fold higher in patients with eGFR ≤ 30 compared with those with eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2: 41.6 vs 14.6 events per 100 person-years. MRAs (vs placebo) reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, but the effect was attenuated as eGFR decreased: the corresponding HRs by eGFR categories were: HR for > 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2: 0.62 (95% CI: 0.49–0.78); HR for 61–90 mL/min/1.73 m 2: 0.69 (95% CI: 0.61–0.77); HR for 46–60 mL/min/1.73 m 2: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74–0.95); HR for 31–45 mL/min/1.73 m 2: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.68–0.91); and HR for ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.70–1.32) (treatment-by-eGFR interaction P for trend = 0.033). Investigator-reported hyperkalemia and worsening renal function were more frequent (2- to 3-fold) among MRA users, and hyperkalemia was more frequent as eGFR decreased (treatment-by-eGFR interaction P for trend = 0.002).

Conclusions

Steroidal MRAs reduced HF hospitalizations and mortality across a wide range of eGFR. However, declining benefit and worsening safety may limit their use in patients with lower eGFR, particularly those with levels ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^111K9iw2]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — spironolactone add-on therapy: For patients with resistant hypertension (defined as those who are not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated dose of triple therapy [i.e., a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker]), we suggest adding spironolactone in those patients without contraindications (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone more effectively reduced SBP and DBP compared to placebo when added as the fourth agent to the treatment regimen of patients with resistant HTN, and in patients with a history of hyperkalemia and diminished renal function, spironolactone should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of potassium and renal function.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111J3t7t]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) was published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the trial question was: is spironolactone superior to add-on doxazosin in patients with drug-resistant hypertension? In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the population was: 335 patients (105 female, 230 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were secondary/accelerated hypertension; T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min; sustained AF; non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the interventions were: n = 285 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12) n = 282 doxazosin (at a dose of 4 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 8 mg/day through week 12). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 8.7 mmHg; AD 4.03 mmHg, 95% CI 3.02 to 5.04). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in home SBP at week 12 (14.4 mmHg vs. 9.1 mmHg; AD 5.3 mmHg, 95% CI 3.83 to 6.77) Significant increase in reduction in seated clinic SBP through week 6 to week 12 (20.7 mmHg vs. 16.3 mmHg; AD 4.42 mmHg, 95% CI 3.09 to 5.75). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months, spironolactone was superior to doxazosin with respect to reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^113bPnR2]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinicians at participating practices were encouraged to manage all participants' blood pressure according to NICE guidelines, and the mean results suggested that most participants achieved a reduction in systolic blood pressure across follow-up regardless of the randomization group. Patients in both arms had adjustments made to their blood pressure treatment, and this may have diluted the treatment effect of spironolactone, where some potential reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality would be expected to be achieved through hypertension control.

Recruitment was challenging for several reasons. We found there were fewer eligible patients than anticipated at participating practices, a relatively low response rate to take part in the study among eligible patients and difficulty recruiting additional new practices to the study. The study was designed so that participants would attend 15 study visits across 3 years. People with CKD are typically older with a high burden of multiple long-term conditions and may have been put off volunteering for the study because of concerns around the number of study visits, their own medication burden, the interaction of spironolactone with their current treatment, potential side effects from the drug or issues with mobility and access to healthcare services for follow-up. Future trials could consider using more routinely collected health data to reduce the burden of appointments and demands on study participants in the future to improve recruitment.

Future research could seek to determine if there is a treatment effect from nonsteroidal MRAs, such as finerenone, among a broader population of patients with CKD, such as people without type 2 diabetes or significant albuminuria, to determine whether the positive findings reported in the FIDELITY study could be replicated more widely. Given the high incidence of hyperkalemia associated with spironolactone, other antihypertensive agents, such as ACEi or ARB, may continue to be considered as treatments for blood pressure in preference to MRA in people with CKD. However, one benefit of spironolactone compared to finerenone is its relative effectiveness in reducing blood pressure. A future trial could investigate whether spironolactone could prevent the progression of CKD or reduce vascular events if it were combined with a potassium-binding agent to reduce discontinuation rates due to hyperkalemia.

This prespecified subgroup analysis of the phase 2b BLOCK-CKD study demonstrates that Ocedurenone reduces SBP without major safety concerns across a variety of subgroups of patients with stage 3b/4 CKD. Specifically, this analysis provides new important information on patients with advanced CKD, including differences in ethnicity, diabetic status, stage of CKD, and severity of albuminuria. The results from this post hoc analysis demonstrate that Ocedurenone can lower blood pressure effectively with a minimal risk of hyperkalemia and other adverse effects across important subgroups with uncontrolled/resistant hypertension.

In the PATHWAY-2 study, spironolactone reduced SBP by 9 mm Hg compared with placebo and was superior to doxazosin and bisoprolol in patients with uncontrolled/resistant hypertension and stage 1–3a CKD, with a serum potassium level ≥ 6.0 mmol/l in 6 patients (2%) among people with good estimated GFRs (mean eGFR was 91.6 ml/min/1.73 m 2). In contrast, the BLOCK-CKD study found a larger magnitude of SBP reduction with Ocedurenone in patients with uncontrolled/resistant hypertension and moderate-to-severe CKD (−10.6 mm Hg placebo-subtracted with the 0.5 mg dose) with no instances of serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/l in patients with mean eGFR of 31.9 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Consistent with these results, the present subgroup analysis found clinically meaningful SBP reductions in high-risk patients, which has not been previously reported.

A recent subgroup analysis of the AMBER study, where spironolactone was again used, found SBP reductions of 6 mm Hg (non-placebo-subtracted) in patients with an eGFR 25 to < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (stage 4 CKD) and 12 to 13 mm Hg (non-placebo-subtracted) in patients with an eGFR 30 to 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (stage 3b CKD). The AMBER study excluded patients with an eGFR < 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2, while the BLOCK-CKD study included patients with eGFR as low as 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Although a direct comparison between spironolactone and Ocedurenone is not currently available, these changes in SBP are less than those seen in the BLOCK-CKD study.

### Incidence, predictors and clinical management of hyperkalaemia in new users of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^111UrRph]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

We looked at the prescribed doses in the last spironolactone prescription prior to hyperkalaemia. The most commonly prescribed dose was 25 mg/day (in 65% of participants), followed by 50 mg/day (23% of participants) (Figure 2 A). Dosages exhibited a weak association with the patient's underlying kidney function (Figure 2 B). Daily MRA doses of 50 mg were more common among moderate and severe hyperkalaemias compared to mild ones (online supplementary Figure S6).

Figure 2
Distribution of prescribed spironolactone dosages at index hyperkalaemia and in relation to kidney function. eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate.

After hyperkalaemia occurrence, 53% of participants continued MRA therapy, 47% discontinued. Among those who remained on therapy, 10% reduced the prescribed MRA dose (Table 3). Discontinuation of concomitant ACEi/ARB use occurred in 282 (23%) of cases, being slightly more common among those who discontinued MRA (28%) compared to those who continued (19%). As many as 45% of participants received de novo diuretics, and 1.6% started SPS. MRA discontinuation or dose reduction was slightly more common after moderate/severe compared to mild hyperkalaemias (Table 3). Likewise, more participants received diuretics or SPS after a moderate/severe event compared to mild events. Timing of therapy also influenced prescription patterns. As compared to late events, hyperkalaemias occurring within the first 3 months of MRA therapy were more often followed by MRA discontinuation, MRA dose reductions and prescription of diuretics, or SPS. Findings were similar in the subpopulation of patients with heart failure (online supplementary Table S10).

### Effect of spironolactone on kidney function in kidney transplant recipients (the SPIREN trial): a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial [^111fAYii]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The study SPIREN was published by Line A Mortensen and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. This study is related to the following diseases: Kidney transplantation. In the SPIREN study, the trial question was: what is the effect of spironolactone in patients with kidney transplantation? In the SPIREN study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SPIREN study, the population was: 180 patients (63 female, 117 male). The inclusion criteria were kidney transplant recipients. The key exclusion criteria were intolerance to spironolactone; CrCl < 30 mL/min; serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L; resin or digoxine treatment; pregnancy. In the SPIREN study, the interventions were: n = 90 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg/day for 3 months, then 50 mg/day for the rest of the study) n = 90 placebo (matching placebo plus standard therapy for 3 years). In the SPIREN study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in reduction in measured GFR at 1 year (6.2 mL/min vs. -1.4 mL/min; AD 7.6 mL/min, 95% CI -101.82 to 117.02). In the SPIREN study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in 24 hour proteinuria at 1 year (0.09 g/day vs. -0.07 g/day; AD 0.16 g/day, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.29) No significant difference in reduction in fibrosis at 2 years (0.52% vs. 3.08%; AD -2.56%, 95% CI -9.36 to 4.24) Significant increase in reduction in SBP at 1 year (0.61 mmHg vs. -3.97 mmHg; AD 4.59 mmHg, 95% CI 1.08 to 8.1). In the SPIREN study, the conclusion was: in kidney transplant recipients, spironolactone was not superior to placebo with respect to reduction in measured GFR at 1 year.

### The cardio-kidney patient: epidemiology, clinical characteristics and therapy [^116NQZT6]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment of HFmrEF/HFpEF

Various cardiovascular outcome trials have assessed the effect of drugs with proven benefit in HFrEF in patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction, ≥ 40%). Until recently, none of these trials could show a significant reduction of the cardiovascular primary end point. However, recently, 2 large cardiovascular outcome trials with the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin or dapagloflozin, EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin in Heart Failure with a Preserved Ejection Fraction)and DELIVER (Dapagliflozin in Heart Failure with Mildly Reduced or Preserved Ejection Fraction), convincingly showed in patients with an ejection fraction above 40% that SGLT2 inhibitor treatment reduces the combined end point of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death compared with placebo. Prespecified subgroup analyses did not show a significant difference between patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min per m 2 and an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min per m 2, suggesting that patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF and CKD benefit from the treatment with one of these SGLT2 inhibitors. The role of MRAs in the treatment of HFmrEF/HFpEF is still under discussion. The TOPCAT trial (Spironolactone for Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Trial) was the first to compare the effect of spironolactone to placebo with nonsignificant difference in the primary end point. However, a recent post hoc analysis that stratified only the patients of the TOPCAT Americas according to kidney function showed consistent efficacy of spironolactone across the range of eGFR, while the risk of adverse events was amplified in the lower eGFR categories. The significance for nonsteroidal MRAs in the treatment of HFmrEF and HFpEF is currently investigated in the ongoing FINARTS-HF (Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Finerenone on Morbidity & Mortality in Participants With Heart Failure and Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Greater or Equal to 40%) study (unique identifier: NCT04435626), which evaluates the effect of finerenone compared with placebo in the reduction of cardiovascular death and total HF events, including HF hospitalization and urgent visits for HF in patients experiencing HF with an ejection fraction ≥ 40%.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^112xX7tb]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF): evidence for RAAS blockade

Patients with heart failure can be categorised on the basis of left ventricular (LV) systolic function into those with HFrEF and those with HFpEF. In HFrEF, the primary cardiac abnormality is major impairment in LV systolic function. In HFpEF, LV systolic function is not necessarily normal but the ejection fraction is.

Both ACEIs and MRAsreduce mortality and HF hospitalisations in patients with HFrEF when compared with placebo. The combination of the neutral endopeptidase (neprilysin) inhibitor, sacubitril, with the ARB, valsartan, reduced mortality and HF hospitalisations compared with the previous gold standard, enalapril. Quality of life is also improved by the RAAS inhibitors. All are at least as effective in patients with mild degrees of renal impairment as those with normal renal function (among those who met the inclusion criteria of the trials). For example, enalapril, spironolactone, eplerenone and sacubitril/valsartan in HFrEF all confer similar or greater reduction in mortality and heart failure hospitalisation in those with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 compared with those with normal renal function.

Patients with severe renal disease at baseline were excluded from the definitive HFrEF trials. In SOLVD Treatment and Randomised Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES), patients with a creatinine of > 221 µmol/L were excluded; in Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM), those with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were excluded. As a result, there is no certainty of benefit from RAAS blockers for patients with severely impaired renal function.

In contrast to the large body of evidence of the benefit of RAAS blockade in HFrEF, there is no convincing evidence of benefit in HFpEF. The only trial to suggest possible benefit was the post hoc analysis by region of Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial (spironolactone versus placebo in HFpEF).
There is unequivocal evidence that inhibitors of the RAAS improve survival in patients with HFrEF.
All such patients should be offered RAAS inhibitors.
There is no such evidence for patients with HFpEF.

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): results in the pre-specified subgroup with heart failure [^112Quxte]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

The AMBER trial demonstrated that concomitant use of patiromer enabled the more persistent use of spironolactone by reducing the risk of hyperkalaemia in patients with resistant hypertension and advanced chronic kidney disease. We report herein the pre-specified subgroup analysis in patients with heart failure (HF).

Methods and Results

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either placebo or patiromer (8.4 g once daily), in addition to open-label spironolactone (starting at 25mg once daily) and their baseline blood pressure medications. Dose titrations were permitted after 1 week for patiromer/placebo and after 3weeks for spironolactone. The primary endpoint was the between-group difference at week 12 in the proportion of patients on spironolactone. Efficacy endpoints and safety were assessed in all randomized patients (intention to treat). A total of 295 patients were enrolled, of whom 132 (45%) had HF. In the HF subgroup, 68.1% of patients receiving placebo remained on spironolactone at week 12, compared with 84.1% of patients receiving patiromer (P = 0.0504). The reason for discontinuation from spironolactone use was hyperkalaemia in the majority of both groups. There was no significant interaction between the subgroups with HF and without HF (P = 0.8085) for the primary endpoint.

Conclusions

Consistent with the overall AMBER trial results, this pre-specified subgroup analysis in patients with HF, resistant hypertension and advanced chronic kidney disease demonstrated that patiromer enabled more persistent use of spironolactone by reducing the risk of hyperkalaemia.

### Aldosterone antagonists for people with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis [^113YXtu7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring dialysis are at a particularly high risk of cardiovascular death and morbidity. Several clinical studies suggested that aldosterone antagonists would be a promising treatment option for people undergoing dialysis. However, the clinical efficacy and potential harm of aldosterone antagonists for people with CKD on dialysis has yet to be determined.

Objectives

This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of aldosterone antagonists, both non-selective (spironolactone) and selective (eplerenone), in comparison to control (placebo or standard care) in people with CKD requiring haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 5 August 2020 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross-over RCTs, and quasi-RCTs (where group allocation is by a method that is not truly random, such as alternation, assignment based on alternate medical records, date of birth, case record number, or other predictable methods) that compared aldosterone antagonists with placebo or standard care in people with CKD requiring dialysis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for included studies. We used a random-effects model meta-analysis to perform a quantitative synthesis of the data. We used the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity among the studies in each analysis. We indicated summary estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean differences (SMD) if different scales were used, with their 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence for each of the main outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.

Main Results

We included 16 studies (14 parallel RCTs and two cross-over RCTs) involving a total of 1446 participants. Thirteen studies compared spironolactone to placebo or standard care and one study compared eplerenone to a placebo. Most included studies had an unclear or high risk of bias. Compared to control, aldosterone antagonists probably reduced the risk of death (any cause) for people with CKD requiring dialysis (9 studies, 1119 participants: RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.67; I² = 0%; moderate certainty of evidence). Aldosterone antagonist probably decreased the risk of death due to cardiovascular disease (6 studies, 908 participants: RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.64; I² = 0%; moderate certainty of evidence) and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity (3 studies, 328 participants: RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; I² = 0%; moderate certainty of evidence). While aldosterone antagonists probably increased risk of gynaecomastia compared with control (4 studies, 768 participants: RR 5.95, 95% CI 1.93 to 18.3; I² = 0%; moderate certainty of evidence), aldosterone antagonists may make little or no difference to the risk of hyperkalaemia (9 studies, 981 participants: RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.78; I² = 47%; low certainty of evidence). Aldosterone antagonists had a marginal effect on left ventricular mass among participants undergoing dialysis (8 studies, 633 participants: SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.05; I² = 77%). In people with CKD requiring dialysis received aldosterone antagonists compared to control, there were 72 fewer deaths from all causes per 1000 participants (95% CI 47 to 98) with a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 14 (95% CI 10 to 21) and for gynaecomastia were 26 events per 1000 participants (95% CI 15 to 39) with a number need to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 38 (95% CI 26 to 68).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on moderate certainty of the evidence, aldosterone antagonists probably reduces the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death and probably reduces morbidity due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in people with CKD requiring dialysis. For the adverse effect of gynaecomastia, the risk was increased compared to control. For this outcome, the absolute risk was lower than the absolute risk of death. It is hoped the three large ongoing studies will provide better certainty of evidence.

### Patiromer-facilitated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor utilization in patients with heart failure with or without comorbid chronic kidney disease: subgroup analysis of DIAMOND randomized trial [^111iKzV9]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The STRONG-HF trial of patients hospitalized with acute HF showed that high-intensity care of rapidly up-titrating guideline-directed medical therapy, including ≥ 50% of maximum MRA dose, within 2 weeks of discharge followed by close monitoring improved outcomes, including risk of all-cause death and HF readmission, compared with usual care. Moreover, the effect was numerically greater in patients with median eGFR ≤ 59.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 than those with eGFR > 59.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Nevertheless, MRAs are only used in approximately 1.2% of patients with CKD; therefore, facilitating doses of RAASi including MRAs, with proven effectiveness in patients with CKD, especially in the presence of HFrEF, is a key unmet need. In DIAMOND, similar numbers of patients with and without CKD (≥ or < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) achieved RAASi optimization while maintaining an sK + level of ≥ 4.0 to ≤ 5.0 mEq/L; this suggests that patiromer can help optimize RAASi dose while maintaining normokalemia in patients across the spectrum of eGFR. This is in line with the findings of the much smaller PEARL-HF trial.

During the DIAMOND randomized double-blind treatment phase, the win ratio for overall RAASi use score was higher with patiromer than placebo across all eGFR subgroups, except the eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 subset. This supports the role of patiromer in allowing maintenance of effective RAASi doses over time, irrespective of eGFR. Future analyses would be beneficial to explore the effect of patiromer versus placebo on RAASi use score in this high-risk subgroup. Patiromer also resulted in a greater maintenance of MRA dose above target dose over time compared with placebo across all eGFR subgroups. This is in line with the findings from the AMBER study in patients with resistant hypertension and CKD (eGFR 25 to ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2), which showed that patiromer enabled more patients (86%) to continue treatment with spironolactone than placebo (66%), with less HK.

RAASi use score win-ratio point estimates favored patiromer versus placebo across eGFR subsets except the eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 subset (Fig. 5).

The primary endpoint was the mean difference in sK + levels from baseline (immediately prior to randomization) until trial end. Secondary hierarchical outcomes included (1) time-to-first event of HK > 5.5 mEq/L; (2) time to discontinuation or reduction of target MRA dose for at least 14 days or less if at the end of study (i.e. lack of durable enablement of MRA at target dose); (3) investigator-reported AEs of HK (first and recurrent); (4) win ratio for HK-related morbidity-adjusted outcomes with the following sequence: time to cardiovascular death, cardiovascular hospitalization, total hyperkalemic events > 6.5 mEq/L, > 6.0 to 6.5 mEq/L, and > 5.0 to 6.0 mEq/L; and (5) win ratio of novel RAASi use score (range 0–8), based on two components: 1/0 to 2 points for all-cause death, occurrence of a cardiovascular hospitalization, or neither; 2/0 to 2 points for each HF medication use and dose of (i) ACEi/ARB/ARNi, (ii) an MRA, and (iii) a beta-blocker (as described previously).

Baseline eGFR Subgroup Analysis

The present prespecified subgroup analysis (in patients eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at screening) stratified patients into subgroups based on baseline eGFR, corresponding with CKD stage. Outcomes in patients with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD stage 1–2) were compared with those in patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD stage ≥ 3a – prespecified analysis), and outcomes in patients with eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD stage ≤ 3a) were compared with those in patients with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD stage ≥ 3b – prespecified analysis). Although patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD stage > 4) at screening were excluded from the DIAMOND trial because they were unable to be prescribed spironolactone, patients could have eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline and then a further post hoc, exploratory subgroup analysis with patients stratified by eGFR ≥ 30 versus < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline was conducted.

### Safety and tolerability of the novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist BAY 94–8862 in patients with chronic heart failure and mild or moderate chronic kidney disease: a randomized, double-blind trial [^114qD2gY]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

In part A of the study, the safety, tolerability, and renal effects of oral BAY 94–8862 [2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily (q.d.)] compared with placebo were investigated in patients with HFrEF and mild CKD. The effects on serum potassium concentration, eGFR, and albuminuria were assessed. An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) reviewed data from part A to confirm the safety and tolerability of BAY 94–8862 in patients with HFrEF and mild CKD before the initiation of part B.

In part B, the primary endpoint was the change in serum potassium concentration after treatment with oral BAY 94–8862 or placebo in patients with HFrEF and moderate CKD, measured at visits 6 and 7 [i.e. the mean of the changes from baseline to visits 6 (day 22 ± 2) and 7 (day 29 ± 2)] to reduce the variability associated with isolated measurements. The timing of the primary endpoint assessment was based on observations from the PEARL-HF trial, in which serum potassium concentrations increased in the first 7 days after treatment initialization or up-titration of spironolactone and remained nearly stable thereafter. The effect of oral BAY 94–8862 on serum potassium concentration was also compared with that of oral open-label spironolactone at a dose of 25 mg q.d. up-titrated to 50 mg q.d. as a secondary objective. Other secondary objectives were the safety and tolerability of BAY 94–8862 and its effects on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and levels of serum aldosterone, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and amino-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), eGFR, and albuminuria measured at visit 4 (day 15 ± 1, i.e. before dose up-titration in the spironolactone group) and visit 7 (day 29 ± 2). Because all secondary endpoints were only exploratory, results at the end of the treatment period were assessed (i.e. visit 7 only rather than visits 6 and 7 combined).

Resurrection of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Summary of key clinical trials in cardiac diseases

Despite preclinical data on BP lowering and cardiorenal protection, it was not until 1999 that the first seminal trial with spironolactone in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was published. Results of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES; N = 1663) showed that spironolactone (∼25 mg/day) reduced the risk of death by 30% vs. placebo [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60–0.82; P < 0.001) in patients with HFrEF New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III–IV [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 35%). The effects were so robust that the trial was stopped prematurely for efficacy. Incidences of progressive HF and sudden death were reduced; HR for hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) was 0.65; and NYHA class improved. However, rates of breast pain and gynaecomastia increased (10% with spironolactone vs. 1% with placebo).

The major limitation of aldosterone blockade with spironolactone was hyperkalaemia. In 2004, a pharmacoepidemiological study noted an increased incidence of hyperkalaemia after the RALES publication; this also correlated with an increase in prescription of spironolactone. The increased incidence of hyperkalaemia was likely related to spironolactone use in patients who would have been excluded from RALES [i.e. those with low estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR)], and to the use of higher spironolactone doses than that used in RALES. A more judicious use of spironolactone and closer patient monitoring may reduce the occurrence of hyperkalaemia.

Eplerenone was subsequently developed as a more selective version of spironolactone, with another seminal trial to test its effects among myocardial infarction (MI) patients with an LVEF ≤ 40% and symptomatic HF. Results of the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS; N = 6642) showed that eplerenone was associated with a 15% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo and a 13% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular (CV) mortality or hospitalization due to CV causes compared with placebo.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^116HuDGk]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist safety in resistant hypertension: Spironolactone should be avoided altogether in patients with eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m² or a serum potassium greater than 5.0 mEq/L, and since spironolactone has both antiandrogenic and endocrine effects, it should also be used cautiously in patients with menstrual irregularities, breast pain or gynecomastia. From a safety perspective, spironolactone, eplerenone, and amiloride all consistently resulted in a modest increase in serum potassium.

### Rationale and design of ARTS: a randomized, double-blind study of BAY 94–8862 in patients with chronic heart failure and mild or moderate chronic kidney disease [^1127q9bs]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

BAY 94–8862 is a novel, non-steroidal, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with greater selectivity than spironolactone and stronger mineralocorticoid receptor binding affinity than eplerenone. The aims of the MinerAlocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Tolerability Study (ARTS; NCT01345656) are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAY 94–8862 in patients with heart failure associated with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and to examine the effects on biomarkers of cardiac and renal function. Methods ARTS is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study divided into two parts. In part A, oral BAY 94–8862 [2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily (o.d.)] is compared with placebo in ∼60 patients with HFREF and mild CKD. Outcome measures include serum potassium concentration, biomarkers of renal injury, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and albuminuria. Part B compares BAY 94–8862 (2.5, 5, or 10 mg o.d., or 5 mg twice daily), placebo, and open-label spironolactone (25–50 mg o.d.) in ∼360 patients with HFREF and moderate CKD. Outcome measures include the change in serum potassium concentration with BAY 94–8862 vs. placebo (primary endpoint) and vs. spironolactone, safety and tolerability, biomarkers of cardiac and renal function or injury, eGFR, and albuminuria. BAY 94–8862 pharmacokinetics are also assessed. Perspectives ARTS is the first phase II clinical trial of BAY 94–8862 and is expected to provide a wealth of information on BAY 94–8862 in patients with HFREF and CKD, including the optimal dose range for further studies.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1144F9qb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with demonstrated benefit to improve cardiovascular outcomes and reduce the risk of CKD progression in patients with T2DM and CKD with albuminuria treated with maximum tolerated doses of ACEi or ARB.

Steroidal MRAs

Over the past decades, two MRAs with steroidal chemical structures were developed: spironolactone and eplerenone. Spironolactone and eplerenone are approved for increasing survival in persons with HF with reduced ejection fraction based on results from landmark trials. Studies of spironolactone and eplerenone in participants with HF with preserved ejection fraction have demonstrated a lack of efficacy in this setting. Consequently, neither have an indication in HF with preserved ejection fraction.

Despite hyperkalemia being relatively uncommon and not depriving participants with HF of survival benefit in clinical trials of spironolactone and eplerenone, data from real‐world studies have shown a high incidence of hyperkalemic events in individuals treated with these therapies. The higher rates of hyperkalemia with steroidal MRAs in observational studies compared with clinical trials may be associated with inappropriate use of high doses, use in persons with conditions that predisposed them to hyperkalemia, and limited serum potassium monitoring. In addition, spironolactone (but not eplerenone) is associated with increased gynecomastia.

Data from HF outcomes trials with spironolactone and eplerenone indicated that they did not delay the progression of CKD, even in high‐risk participants. Due to the lack of long‐term clinical trial data in individuals with CKD, neither spironolactone nor eplerenone is indicated for use in this population. Thus, nonsteroidal MRAs were developed to improve long‐term clinical outcomes in persons with CKD.

### Appropriateness of spironolactone prescribing in heart failure patients: a population-based study [^115jxk7d]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) established the safety and benefit of spironolactone for heart failure (HF) patients with systolic dysfunction. However, recent data have raised concerns regarding hyperkalemia secondary to spironolactone use and suggest it occurs more commonly in routine practice.

Methods and Results

We explored factors potentially associated with hyperkalemia from spironolactone therapy in a population-based cohort of 9165 HF patients hospitalized in Ontario, Canada, between 1999 and 2001. Compared with patients enrolled in RALES, community-based patients were older (mean age 75 years versus 65 years, P < .001) and were more likely to be female (50% versus 27%, P < .001). Of the 1502 patients that were prescribed spironolactone at discharge, 18% had elevated serum potassium levels (> 5 mmol/L) during hospitalization and 23% were discharged on concurrent potassium supplements. Although only 8% of patients had serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, many patients had stage III (53.1%), stage IV (12.8%), or stage V (3.9%) chronic renal insufficiency according to glomerular filtration rate.

Conclusion

Spironolactone was often prescribed to inappropriate HF candidates because of the presence of relative or absolute contraindications. These findings highlight the need for more careful patient selection when prescribing spironolactone to minimize potential life-threatening hyperkalemia.

### Kidney outcomes with finerenone: an analysis from the FIgARO-DKD study [^114XRdfw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Finerenone had a similar magnitude of effect on CV outcomes in patients with moderately and severely increased albuminuria at baseline; these included hospitalization for HF, which was the main driver of the finerenone benefit for the CV composite primary endpoint in the FIGARO-DKD primary analysis. These findings highlight the CV benefits in patients with both early- and late-stage CKD and support the need for albuminuria screening in patients with T2D to identify patients with CKD at earlier stages to reduce their CV risk.

Treatment-emergent adverse events were generally well balanced between patients in the finerenone and placebo treatment arms. The incidences of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the study and serious TEAEs were higher in patients with moderately increased albuminuria compared with patients with severely increased albuminuria at baseline, likely reflective of the lower mean eGFR of the former subgroup. Although total hyperkalemia events were increased with finerenone versus placebo, the incidence of clinically meaningful events was low in both treatment arms, with few hospitalizations or study drug discontinuations due to hyperkalemia, and no hyperkalemia-related deaths. More hyperkalemia-related TEAEs occurred with moderately increased than severely increased albuminuria; however, this observation is consistent with expectations because decreasing eGFR is an established risk factor for hyperkalemia. In addition to the fact that only short-term data on UACR are available with steroidal MRAs, unlike the long-term follow-up in FIGARO-DKD, finerenone also appears to have good tolerability in comparison with the steroidal MRAs based on their respective hyperkalemia profiles. In the phase II ARTS-HF study, finerenone treatment led to less hyperkalemia than spironolactone over 4 weeks in patients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction and moderate CKD. Finerenone also does not appear to be associated with any sexual side effects, unlike spironolactone.

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^113vL8hE]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Run-in phase

For those patients wanting to take part but not immediately eligible because they are either on existing diuretic therapy or not taking ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy or taking both of these agents, a 4- to 6-week run-in phase is used. For patients on existing loop or thiazide diuretic therapy who wish to take part in the trial, after obtaining consent, diuretic therapy is stopped, and the patient is reviewed after 4 weeks to ensure that he/she meets the eligibility criteria (Table I). For patients not on ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, after obtaining consent, an ACE inhibitor or ARB of the physician's choice is introduced and titrated to a well-tolerated therapeutic dose over a 4-week period. The patient is then reviewed to ensure eligibility. For patients on dual ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy, after obtaining consent, either the ACE inhibitor or the ARB is stopped. Patients are then reviewed to ensure eligibility. Those patients who fulfill all entry criteria are consented and randomized into the main SPIRO-CKD trial.

Randomization

Once informed consent is received and the baseline assessments completed, patients are entered into the main SPIRO-CKD trial. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either spironolactone (25 mg once a day) or chlorthalidone (half a 50-mg tablet once a day, as there are no 25-mg tablets available for use in the UK) for 40 weeks without blinding. A secure central randomization service was provided by the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (University of Birmingham) using a computer-generated program, using a minimization algorithm to ensure balance between the arms with regard to the important clinical variables of blood pressure, age, and gender. Compliance with treatment is monitored by study coordinators using tablet counting.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with heart Failure and impaired Renal Function [^113seoen]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Kidney dysfunction often leads to reluctance to start or continue life-saving heart failure (HF) therapy.

Objectives

This study sought to examine the efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction experiencing significant kidney dysfunction.

Methods

We pooled individual patient data from the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) and EMPHASIS-HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure) trials. The association between MRA treatment and outcomes was assessed according to whether the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) declined to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or not. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization.

Results

Among 4,355 patients included, 295 (6.8%) experienced a deterioration of eGFR after randomization to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. These patients had more impaired baseline cardiac and kidney function (eGFR 47.3 ± 13.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 vs 70.5 ± 21.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and had a higher risk of the primary outcome than patients without eGFR deterioration (HR: 2.49; 95% CI: 2.01–3.08; P < 0.001). However, the risk reduction in the primary outcome with MRA therapy was similar in those who experienced a decrease in eGFR to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.43–0.99) compared with those who did not (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.56–0.71) (P interaction = 0.87). In patients with a decrease in eGFR to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 21 fewer individuals (per 100 person-years) experienced the primary outcome with MRA treatment, vs placebo, compared with an excess of 3 more patients with severe hyperkalemia (> 6.0 mmol/L).

Conclusions

Because patients experiencing a decrease in eGFR to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 are at very high risk, the absolute risk reduction with an MRA in these patients is large and this decline in eGFR should not automatically lead to treatment discontinuation.

### Representation of patients with CKD in trials of cardiovascular disease medications… [^114V52nd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective To evaluate the underrepresentation of patients with CKD in cardiovascular RCTs, and to highlight evidence gaps in CVRM medications in this population. Evidence Review. The proportion of RCTs in which dose adjustment based on kidney function was required or medication was contraindicated based on kidney function remained consistent across different periods. The kidney exclusion criteria applied were heterogeneous but generally based on eGFR or serum creatinine level. The exclusion of patients with CKD for individual drug groups is illustrated in eFigure 2 in Supplement 1. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers were also evaluated for patients receiving dialysis and thiazides for patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2.

Other antihypertensives were not evaluated in these populations. None of the antihypertensives were evaluated for recipients of a kidney transplant. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, niacin, and icosapent ethyl were also evaluated for this population. For patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2, only the combination of statins and ezetimibe was evaluated. For patients receiving dialysis, statins were evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with ezetimibe. For kidney transplant recipients, only statin monotherapy was evaluated. The complexity of extrapolating results to patients with CKD was illustrated by statins. Although these drugs reduced cardiovascular risk in patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in individuals with kidney failure.

44 The lack of RCTs conducted in patients between these ends of the CKD spectrum makes it impossible to determine the tipping point at which statins lose their benefits. Consequently, patients may unintentionally be overtreated or undertreated since the balance between benefits and adverse effects remains unknown.
