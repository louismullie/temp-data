## Question

Vertical diplopia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vertical diplopia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming whether the diplopia is monocular or binocular. Then, I should verify the core history elements that localize the problem. Next, I will examine the neuro-ophthalmic exam with attention to torsion, comitance, and gaze-dependent changes. After that, I need to construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and decide when to image. Finally, I will outline management pathways, including conservative options, surgical indications, and special scenarios like thyroid eye disease and post-cataract diplopia, and I will close with prognosis and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the nature of the diplopia, because monocular diplopia points to refractive or media issues rather than ocular motor pathology, whereas binocular diplopia implies misalignment and mandates a strabismic workup. I should double-check by asking the patient to close one eye; if the double image persists, that supports monocular causes such as cataract, corneal irregularity, or higher-order aberrations, whereas resolution with monocular occlusion supports binocular etiologies like cranial nerve palsy, thyroid eye disease, myasthenia gravis, or skew deviation [^6fa5b5f4] [^9220824a].

> Next, I should review the history with a structured approach, and I need to ensure I capture onset and tempo, pain, associated neurologic or systemic symptoms, and any prior strabismus, trauma, or surgery. Sudden painless vertical diplopia suggests microvascular cranial neuropathy, painful diplopia raises concern for compressive lesions or inflammatory disease, and fluctuating or fatigable symptoms point toward myasthenia gravis. I should also ask about head tilt compensation, which is common in superior oblique palsy, and about recent cataract surgery or vision changes that could unmask latent strabismus or fixation switch diplopia [^81e7d7c7] [^9ca4c9ae] [^68203190] [^f65de386].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the examination sequence to localize the lesion. I will start with visual acuity and refraction, then perform a careful motility exam in nine positions of gaze, measure vertical deviations with prism and alternate cover testing, and assess for torsion using double Maddox rods or fundus photography. I should confirm comitance versus incomitance, because comitant vertical deviations are more typical of skew deviation or decompensated phoria, whereas incomitant deviations with gaze-dependent changes suggest superior oblique palsy or restrictive myopathy. I will also check for ptosis, pupillary changes, and other cranial neuropathies, and I should remember that a positive three-step test supports superior oblique palsy but can be falsely positive in thyroid eye disease or myasthenia, so I must interpret it in context [^d5e22221] [^e5482e05] [^9ca4c9ae].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis, and I need to prioritize by prevalence and danger. Fourth nerve palsy is a leading cause of vertical diplopia in adults, often traumatic or microvascular, with hypertropia worsening in contralateral downgaze and excyclotorsion of the hypertropic eye. Thyroid eye disease frequently causes restrictive vertical diplopia from inferior rectus restriction and can mimic superior oblique palsy. Skew deviation produces a vertical misalignment with torsion and an ocular tilt reaction and warrants neuroimaging when central features are present. Third nerve palsy can cause vertical and horizontal diplopia with ptosis and pupillary involvement, prompting urgent aneurysm evaluation. Myasthenia gravis presents with fluctuating ptosis and diplopia that do not fit a single cranial nerve pattern. And fixation switch diplopia can emerge after cataract surgery or other vision-improving procedures in patients with latent strabismus [^735dfa1e] [^ba0c677a] [^f56c06c7] [^4e387aa6] [^68203190] [^f65de386].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging thresholds so I do not over- or under-image. For isolated fourth nerve palsy in a patient over 50 with vascular risk factors, observation is reasonable, but I should image if there is no improvement by 3 to 6 months, if the palsy is non-isolated, or if there are atypical features. For third nerve palsy, I should obtain urgent brain MRI with contrast and neurovascular imaging to exclude aneurysm. For skew deviation or any central ocular motor sign, I should image promptly. And for thyroid eye disease, orbital imaging helps confirm restrictive myopathy and guide management [^9193f024] [^e5482e05] [^889bc6d3].

> Let me consider conservative management first, because many cases improve spontaneously or can be managed non-surgically. For small vertical deviations, prisms can reduce diplopia, though lateral incomitance and torsion can limit success. For superior oblique palsy, I should observe for 6 to 12 months to allow for spontaneous recovery, using prisms or occlusion in the interim. For thyroid eye disease, I should optimize systemic management and consider prism or temporary occlusion while inflammation is active. And for myasthenia gravis, I should coordinate neurologic care and consider pyridostigmine or immunotherapy, recognizing that diplopia may persist despite treatment [^29911364] [^646b2989] [^ba0c677a] [^240802dd].

> I should confirm surgical indications and options when conservative measures fail or when a compensatory head posture causes neck pain or social burden. For superior oblique palsy, inferior oblique weakening procedures such as myectomy, recession, or anterior transposition are effective, and randomized data suggest anterior transposition may better reduce hypertropia in adduction, though evidence quality is limited. For thyroid eye disease, strabismus surgery is typically deferred until the disease is quiescent, and adjustable sutures are often used to titrate alignment. For small vertical deviations, targeted rectus muscle surgery or tenotomy can improve alignment and reduce prism dependence. And for post-cataract fixation switch diplopia, I should reverse monovision when feasible and consider prisms or surgery if diplopia persists [^95475ff7] [^e5482e05] [^92c893c0] [^68203190].

> But wait, what if the vertical diplopia is actually a manifestation of a central process rather than a peripheral ocular motor nerve palsy. I should double-check for red flags such as vertigo, skew deviation, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, or other brainstem signs, because these features shift the pretest probability toward a central lesion and mandate neuroimaging. In acute vestibular presentations, a pathologic skew greater than about 3 degrees is strongly associated with stroke, whereas smaller skews may be peripheral; this distinction guides urgency and the need for MRI and stroke pathways [^8cc19a56] [^d4dcec7e].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios that commonly confound the workup. After cataract surgery, new-onset vertical diplopia may reflect unmasked latent strabismus, aniseikonia, or fixation switch diplopia; careful refraction, prism trial, and review of preoperative records are essential. In patients with high myopia, strabismus fixus and heavy eye syndrome can cause large-angle esotropia with vertical components and may require specialized surgical approaches. And in older adults, sagging eye syndrome produces distance esotropia with modest vertical misalignment and responds well to prism or surgery [^f65de386] [^68203190] [^92a4c7b9].

> Let me reconsider prognosis so I counsel accurately. Microvascular fourth nerve palsies recover spontaneously in roughly 80 percent within about 1.5 months, though recovery is slower and less complete with larger initial deviations or non-vascular etiologies. Thyroid eye disease diplopia often fluctuates with disease activity and may require staged surgery after medical optimization. And post-cataract diplopia related to fixation switch or aniseikonia may improve with refractive or prism adjustments, but persistent cases may need strabismus surgery [^367913c0] [^ba0c677a] [^68203190].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up cadence and safety netting. For presumed microvascular cranial neuropathies, reassessment at 6 to 12 weeks is reasonable, with earlier imaging if new neurologic signs emerge or if there is no improvement. For thyroid eye disease, coordination with endocrinology and periodic orthoptic reassessment are key. And for all patients, I should document baseline measurements, educate about warning symptoms, and set expectations that the goal is comfortable single binocular vision in primary and reading positions, recognizing that some residual diplopia in extreme gaze is often acceptable [^9193f024] [^ba0c677a] [^0231957f].

---

Vertical diplopia is most often due to **superior oblique palsy** (cranial nerve IV) [^735dfa1e], **thyroid eye disease** (inferior rectus restriction) [^ba0c677a], or **skew deviation** (vestibular/brainstem) [^f56c06c7]. A **focused history and exam** — including the Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test [^d5e22221], torsion assessment [^e5482e05], and forced ductions — localizes the cause and guides imaging [^e5482e05]. Neuroimaging is indicated for non-isolated palsies, atypical features, or suspected central causes [^9193f024]. Management is cause-specific: observation or prisms for small/stable deviations [^29911364]; surgery for persistent or large deviations [^95475ff7]; and urgent care for compressive or inflammatory etiologies [^notfound].

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Vertical diplopia arises from **misalignment of the visual axes in the vertical plane**, most often due to:

| **Category** | **Common causes** | **Pathophysiology** |
|-|-|-|
| Cranial nerve palsies | - Superior oblique (CN IV) palsy [^735dfa1e] <br/> - Inferior rectus (CN III) palsy [^9f800a07] | - Neurogenic weakness or paralysis of extraocular muscles [^4e387aa6] <br/> - Often ischemic, traumatic, or compressive [^9ca4c9ae] |
| Orbital restrictive disease | - Thyroid eye disease (TED) [^ba0c677a] <br/> - Orbital trauma/fracture [^d01c067f] <br/> - Orbital masses [^b0a3395a] | - Mechanical restriction of extraocular muscle movement [^ba0c677a] <br/> - Often due to inflammation, fibrosis, or entrapment [^d01c067f] |
| Supranuclear/vestibular | - Skew deviation [^f56c06c7] <br/> - Brainstem lesions [^8cc19a56] <br/> - Cerebellar disease [^d4dcec7e] | - Asymmetric vestibulo-ocular input causing vertical misalignment and torsion [^f56c06c7] [^d4dcec7e] |
| Neuromuscular junction | - Myasthenia gravis [^240802dd] | - Fluctuating muscle weakness affecting extraocular muscles [^240802dd] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: onset, duration, pain, trauma, systemic symptoms, comorbidities, prior surgery [^81e7d7c7].
- **Examination**: cover-uncover, prism and alternate cover testing, motility, torsion, forced ductions, pupils, lids [^3159a7c4].
- **Three-step test**: Parks-Bielschowsky test to localize vertical deviations, especially for superior oblique palsy [^d5e22221].
- **Torsion assessment**: double Maddox rod, fundus photography, or synoptophore to distinguish excyclotorsion (SO palsy) from incyclotorsion (skew) [^e5482e05] [^f56c06c7].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI brain and orbits with contrast for non-isolated palsies, atypical features, or suspected central causes [^9193f024].
- **Laboratory tests**: thyroid function, acetylcholine receptor antibodies if myasthenia suspected [^notfound].
- **Forced duction testing**: differentiates restrictive from neurogenic causes [^e5482e05].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **etiology, severity, and chronicity**:

- **Observation/prisms**: for small, stable deviations or neurogenic palsies with expected spontaneous recovery [^29911364].
- **Surgery**: for persistent, large, or symptomatic deviations; options include inferior oblique weakening, superior oblique tuck, or vertical rectus surgery [^95475ff7].
- **Medical therapy**: immunosuppression for TED or myasthenia gravis [^notfound].
- **Urgent intervention**: for compressive lesions (e.g. aneurysm, tumor) or acute inflammatory disease [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **cause**: microvascular cranial neuropathies often recover spontaneously within months [^7be20848], whereas restrictive or compressive etiologies may require surgery and carry variable outcomes [^bb7719af]. Early, accurate diagnosis and **targeted therapy** optimize recovery and reduce chronic diplopia [^44a1be1b].

---

Vertical diplopia reflects diverse causes; a **focused history and exam**, judicious imaging, and cause-specific therapy are key to effective management.

Diplopia is a relatively common chief complaint encountered in an outpatient neurology clinic and carries a broad differential diagnosis. In this case, a 67-year-old woman presented with new horizontal, binocular diplopia and ptosis of 8-month duration, which persisted without significant progression. This case highlights the need for a comprehensive list of differential diagnoses for patients with acquired ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. Key learning points include an illustration of the stepwise diagnostic approach to evaluate for common etiologies, the importance of interpreting test results in the appropriate clinical setting, and the significance of recognizing specific signs and symptoms in achieving the correct diagnosis.

### Acute binocular diplopia: peripheral or central? [^4f1bae65]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute diplopia (perception of two different images) accounts for 0.1% of the patients that present at an emergency department. An ocular misalignment of more than 200 µm can cause binocular diplopia.

The most common causes of acute binocular diplopia are acute third (CNIII), fourth (CNIV) and sixth (CVI) cranial nerve palsies (ocular motor palsies: OMP). The ocular motor nuclei are located throughout the brainstem, from the midbrain (CNIII) to the pons (CNIV) and the ponto-medullary junction (CNVI). Within the brainstem they have a long (CNIII, CNVI) or short (CNIV) so-called fascicular part. After exiting the brainstem heading towards the eye, they pass through critical structures, such as the cavernous sinus. Because of their complicated anatomy and vicinity to these structures, prompt diagnosis of the localization of the OMP lesion is both very difficult and very important, in particular to diagnose a brainstem stroke. The importance of a prompt diagnosis in the emergency department is shown in a large prospective study, where 16% of the 50,000 emergency department visits due to diplopia were due to a life-threatening underlying disease.

There have been several prospective and retrospective studies on the etiologies of acute OMPs, each from a different point of view. The underlying diseases range from microvascular to acute life-threatening diseases, although the reported frequencies vary greatly from study to study.

In addition, Dieterich and Brandt have previously shown the important role of measuring mono- and binocular subjective visual verticality in the differentiation between a central and a peripheral lesion.

In this study, we focus on the clinical differentiation of peripheral versus central OMPs in the acute phase in an effort to identify signs and symptoms that would assist a non-specialist in the emergency department in making the correct clinical decision regarding further diagnostic procedures and management.

Objectives

Acute diplopia is a diagnostic challenge for clinicians, in particular in the emergency department. The most common cause of acute diplopia are ocular motor nerve palsies (OMP). In this prospective study, we focused on identifying the most crucial signs and symptoms for differentiating between peripheral and central OMP.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated 56 non-consecutive patients who presented at our emergency department with acute binocular diplopia (≤ 10 days). The patient history was taken using a standardized questionnaire and patients underwent a neurological, neuro-ophthalmological and neuro-otological examination, including measurement of the subjective visual vertical (SVV), Harms tangent screen test, and cranial MRI.

Results

Forty-six out of 56 patients were diagnosed with an ocular motor cranial nerve palsy (OMP), 21 of peripheral and 23 of central origin; in two patients, the etiology remained unknown. The following features were different in peripheral and central OMP: (1) the presence of vertigo/dizziness was more frequent in central (43.5%) than in peripheral (9.5%) OMP. (2) Central ocular motor signs, such as saccadic smooth pursuit, additional internuclear ophthalmoplegia, skew deviation, and saccade palsies, were also found more frequently in the central than in the peripheral group (86.7% vs. 33.3%). (3) Further, a pathological SVV deviation by monocular testing of the non-affected eye was also more common in central (77.3%) than in peripheral OMP (38.9%). The presence of all three factors has a positive predictive value of 100% (CI 50–100%) for the presence of a central lesion.

Conclusions

In acute diplopia due to central OMP, the most important accompanying symptom is vertigo/dizziness, and the most important clinical signs are central ocular motor disorders (which require examination of the non-paretic eye) and an SVV deviation in the non-paretic eye.

Progressive weakness and diplopia have a wide differential diagnosis, which can be narrowed by obtaining a detailed history and performing a careful physical examination. It is essential to determine whether these 2 symptoms are due to a single, unifying process or separate processes. We review the case of a 73-year-old man with progressive proximal lower than upper extremity weakness, followed by binocular horizontal diplopia. Clinical history, with attention to rate of progression and associated symptomatology, guided our diagnostic approach and final diagnosis.

### Surgical interventions for vertical strabismus in superior oblique palsy [^95475ff7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Superior oblique palsy is a common cause of vertical strabismus in adults and children. Patients may be symptomatic from binocular vertical diplopia or compensatory head tilt required to maintain single vision. Most patients who are symptomatic elect to undergo strabismus surgery, but the optimal surgical treatment for vertical strabismus in people with superior oblique palsy is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the relative effects of surgical treatments compared with another surgical intervention, non-surgical intervention, or observation for vertical strabismus in people with superior oblique palsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 12), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 13 December 2016), Embase Ovid (1947 to 13 December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to 13 December 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 13 December 2016, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 13 December 2016, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 13 December 2016. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials that compared at least one type of surgical intervention to another surgical or non-surgical intervention or observation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently completed eligibility screening, data abstraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and grading of the evidence.

Main Results

We identified two randomized trials comparing four different surgical treatments for this condition, two methods in each trial. The studies included a total of 45 children and adults. The surgical treatments were all procedures to weaken the ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle. One study compared inferior oblique myectomy to recession of 10 mm; the other study compared inferior oblique disinsertion to anterior transposition (2 mm anterior to the temporal border of the inferior rectus insertion). We judged both studies to be at unclear risk of bias due to incomplete reporting of methods and other methodological deficiencies. Neither study reported data on the primary outcome of this review, which was the proportion of participants with postoperative surgical success, defined as hypertropia less than 3 prism diopters (PD) in primary gaze. However, both studies reported the average reduction in hypertropia in primary gaze. One study found that at 12 months' postoperatively the average decrease in hypertropia was higher in participants who underwent inferior oblique myectomy than in those who underwent recession, however data were not available for statistical comparison. The other trial found that after at least six months of follow-up, the mean decrease in primary position hypertropia was lower in participants who underwent inferior oblique disinsertion than in those who underwent anterior transposition (mean difference (MD) -5.20 PD, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.76 to -2.64; moderate-quality evidence). Both trials also reported the average postoperative reduction in vertical deviation in adduction. One study reported that the average reduction in hypertropia in adduction was greater in participants who underwent inferior oblique myectomy than in those who underwent recession, but data were not available for statistical comparison. The other study found a lower decrease in hypertropia in contralateral gaze in participants who underwent inferior oblique disinsertion than in those who underwent anterior transposition (MD -7.10 PD, 95% CI -13.85 to -0.35; moderate-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes with sufficient data for analysis included proportion of participants with preoperative head tilt that resolved postoperatively and proportion of participants who underwent a second surgery. These outcomes were assessed in the trial comparing inferior oblique anterior transposition to disinsertion; both outcomes favored anterior transposition (risk ratio 7.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 121.39 for both outcomes; very low-quality evidence). None of the participants who underwent inferior oblique anterior transposition or disinsertion developed postoperative hypotropia or reversal of the vertical deviation. All participants who underwent inferior oblique anterior transposition developed elevation deficiency, which the authors deemed to be clinically insignificant in all cases, whereas no participants who underwent inferior oblique disinsertion experienced this complication. Additionally, the trial comparing inferior oblique myectomy to recession reported that no participant in either group required another strabismus surgery during the postoperative period.

Authors' Conclusions

The two trials included in this review evaluated four inferior oblique weakening procedures for surgical treatment of superior oblique palsy. We found no trials comparing other types of surgical procedures for this disorder. Both studies had enrolled a small number of participants and provided low-quality evidence due to limitations in completeness and applicability. We therefore found no high-quality evidence to support recommendations for optimal surgical treatment of superior oblique palsy. Rigorously designed, conducted, and reported randomized trials are needed to identify the optimal surgical treatment for vertical strabismus in this disorder.

### Clinical reasoning: a 51-year-old woman with diplopia and headache [^bfcca7d2]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

A 51-year-old woman presented with a pressure-like headache behind her right eye and horizontal diplopia. On examination, she was unable to abduct or adduct the right eye but had intact vertical eye movements. Her deficits could not be overcome using the oculocephalic reflex. Imaging initially was interpreted as optic neuritis, but on careful review with radiology, a diffuse enhancing hyperintense signal within the orbital apex confirmed an orbital infiltrate. The focus of this case study is to review the localization approach for diplopia and build a differential diagnosis for orbital processes. Another key point is the importance of relying on the physical examination as the guide to a patient's management rather than imaging findings, which can often be misleading.

### Eyes and stroke: the visual aspects of cerebrovascular disease [^45cc16e0]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Diplopia equally occurs in right versus left-sided strokes. Diplopia can be a consequence of horizontal or vertical ocular misalignment, either from third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve palsy (figure 5) or from skew deviation. A prospective multicentre observational case cohort study by conducted by Rowe et al found that 16.5% of patients with poststroke had ocular misalignment with diplopia.

### Clinical outcomes and aetiology of fourth cranial nerve palsy with acute vertical diplopia in adults [^367913c0]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We investigated the clinical outcomes of fourth cranial nerve (CN4) palsy with acute vertical diplopia in adults.

Methods

A total of 80 patients with acute CN4 palsy who underwent at least 3 months of follow-up were included in this study. We retrospectively investigated the aetiology, rate of recovery, and factors associated with recovery between March 2016 and January 2019.

Results

The average age of patients with CN4 palsy was about 60 years, and the duration of recovery was 1.5 months: 48 (60.0%) patients had a vascular aetiology and 17 (21.3%) patients had a trauma history. Brain lesions were found in four (5.0%) patients and decompensated cause accounted for four (5.0%) cases. Among the total of 80 patients, 13 (16.3%) failed to completely recover. Non-isolated CN4 palsy with other cranial nerve palsies were recorded in seven cases. The comparison between recovery and non-recovery groups showed that initial deviation angle, aetiology, fundus extorsion, and head tilt status were significantly different factors.

Conclusion

The recovery rate of acute CN4 palsy was about 80% and duration of recovery was 1.5 months. However, the varying rates and duration of recovery was presented according to aetiology thus we should consider the prognosis by aetiology.

### Painful vertical diplopia as a presentation of a pituitary mass [^ab4bdba1]. BMC Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In our case there was an initial sudden onset of vertical diplopia which may have been the result of compromise to the vascular supply of the third nerve. Pupil involvement eventually followed. On radiological analysis the tumour appeared to abut the optic chiasm however visual fields remained full. Although this presentation is unusual, a pituitary mass should be included in the differential diagnosis in cases of isolated painful diplopia.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^035d1d98]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — binocular central diplopia management — Treatment for binocular central diplopia includes diminishing the diplopia, and the patient should be monitored/observed if symptoms are mild or occasional or if the patient is opposed to treatment. Although cover testing often shows small-angle strabismus that is nearly always vertical, prismatic or surgical correction of this deviation is not curative because it does not resolve the mismatch of distorted macular images or the conflict between foveal and peripheral alignment, though intervention can sometimes reduce symptoms. Reduced diplopia awareness has been reported with the use of prism correction or fogging in some patients, and fogging the vision in one eye, which eliminates the foveal conflict by producing a central scotoma, may be successful. Any diplopia relief from prism correction is most often transient, although in rare patients it may prove helpful.

### Painful vertical diplopia as a presentation of a pituitary mass [^7dd7a643]. BMC Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pituitary tumours may present with a variety of neurological and endocrinological signs and symptoms. It is very rare however for them to present with sudden onset painful diplopia. The current literature and possible mechanisms for this are discussed.

Case presentation

We describe a case of a pituitary mass which presented with sudden onset painful diplopia with an associated restricted pattern on Lees Chart testing. This led to an initial working diagnosis of orbital myositis.

Conclusion

Awareness of different modes of presentation of pituitary lesions is important so that appropriate imaging may be requested and delay in diagnosis prevented.

### Acute binocular diplopia: peripheral or central? [^9595cf33]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Over a period of 3 years, we prospectively recruited adult (≥ 18 years) patients from the neurological emergency department of Campus Grosshadern of the Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, who presented because of acute diplopia. Diplopia had to be present for less than 10 days and be the leading symptom and the main cause for the patient's referral to our department. Patients with monocular diplopia or binocular diplopia due to known pre-existing causes, such as myasthenia, were excluded from the study.

At the time of presentation, all patients underwent a complete clinical–neurological evaluation and had to answer a study questionnaire regarding their symptoms and presentation of diplopia. Furthermore, blood samples were obtained. A standardized neuro-ophthalmological and neuro-orthoptic examination, including Harms tangent screen and monocular (each eye separately) measurements of the subjective visual vertical (SVV), was performed on the same or the following day. The SVV was measured using either the bucket test or a dome. The SVV test was performed by an experienced orthoptician, who rotated the bucket manually and slowly from a randomized offset position towards zero, alternating between the two directions in each trial. The patient looked with one eye (the other eye was covered with an eye patch) at a straight line visible on the inner bottom of a bucket or of a dome without other visual cues, and had to align it properly, indicating the vertical position verbally. On the outer bottom surface of the bucket, an angular protractor allowed the examiner to readout the tilt angle; when the dome was used, the tilt angle was computed automatically. Central ocular motor signs included saccadic smooth pursuit, saccade palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and skew deviation (in addition to the ocular motor palsy).

### Acute binocular diplopia: peripheral or central? [^5be3ea33]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Both patient groups had their first medical contact on average 2 days after diplopia onset and were seen in our department on the same day or a day later. 70% of the patients had acute onset diplopia, in 23% the diplopia was progressive, and 7% of patients woke up with the symptoms (no difference between groups).

Regarding patients' symptoms, statistical analysis showed that more central OMP patients reported concomitant vertigo or dizziness, whereas headache and/or periorbital pain were reported equally in both groups. Furthermore, both groups did not differ in terms of the presence of other neurological symptoms (such as hypoesthesia and paresthesia).

Regarding the clinical and neuro-ophthalmological findings, 87% of patients with a central OMP had additional central ocular motor deficits (such as spontaneous nystagmus, saccadic smooth pursuit, saccadic palsy on the healthy eye, internuclear ophthalmoplegia or skew deviation that was not justified by the underlying palsy, e.g. in CNVI palsies). 77% of the non-paretic eyes of patients with central OMP showed a pathological > 2.5° deviation, which was significantly more than in peripheral OMP (Table 2). One non-paretic eye in one patient with peripheral OMP could not be tested, due to severe congenital amblyopia. The patient groups showed no difference regarding the presence of other neurological signs.

Based on these findings, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of these three signs and symptoms (vertigo/dizziness, pathological subjective visual vertical in the non-paretic eye — SVVnp — and central ocular motor disorders-Omd) for identifying a central lesion (Table 3).

Table 3
Diagnostic performance of central ocular motor disorder (Omd), SVV deviation in the non-paretic eye (SVVnp) and vertigo/dizziness (V/D) for detecting central OMP

PPV positive predictive value, NPV negative predictive value, LR+ positive likelihood ratio, LR− negative likelihood ratio

According to our data, the concomitant presence of all three factors has a 100% specificity (CI 81–100%) and 100% positive predictive value (CI 50–100%). Therefore, a patient with OMP that reports vertigo or dizziness and has pathological SVV and central ocular motor disorder (Omd) on the non-affected eye most likely has a brainstem lesion.

### Painful vertical diplopia as a presentation of a pituitary mass [^2edc3994]. BMC Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It is rare for a pituitary tumour to present with painful diplopia due to a partial third nerve palsy. We present such a case in which the initial lack of pupil involvement or ptosis combined with the restricted painful ocular movements, led to an initial suspected diagnosis of orbital myositis. This is a previously undocumented mode of presentation of a large non-secretory pituitary mass. The history is unusual in its acute, painful onset and examination findings were in keeping with a restricted ocular motility defect.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^b3770e57]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — skew deviation diagnosis (history): Skew deviation is almost always acute to subacute in onset; however, if the etiology is demyelination or a slow-growing tumor, onset may be more insidious. Skew associated with acute end-organ vestibular neuronitis will likely be associated with severe vertigo, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, whereas skew in association with brainstem or cerebellar demyelination, stroke, or a mass lesion will demonstrate associated neurologic features (e.g., nystagmus, internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), hemiparesis, sensory loss, ataxia, and Horner's syndrome) and may be acute to subacute in onset. A history of neurological symptoms or symptoms of vertigo and nausea, in addition to the classic vertical diplopia and head tilt, may help guide additional evaluation, and vertical diplopia and commonly torticollis and subjective tilting of the perceived visual world are characteristic.

### Recurrent diplopia after consuming alcoholic beverages… [^7a65e8d4]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

to the editor: A 67-year-old night watchman was referred to our clinic by an ophthalmologist because of a one-month history of recurrent vertical diplopia. The diplopia usually occurred after work when he was exhausted or after he had consumed sake. The diplopia always resolved spontaneously after sleeping, but this time it persisted for several weeks, and he finally consulted an ophthalmologist. On examination, his right eye was higher than the left, which produced the vertical diplopia, but there was no facial swelling. Three-dimensional computed tomography showed a complete bone defect in the orbital floor and a mucocele displacing the eyeball superiorly, which resulted in the symptom of vertical diplopia. Despite the defect in his orbital floor, the periosteum was intact. The mucocele was drained by aspiration through the gingivobuccal sulcus.

After removing 20 mL of mucus, the right eye returned to the same level as the left eye, and the diplopia resolved completely. The aspirated mucus had no bacterial infection and the cytologic study showed no malignancy. A Caldwell-Luc surgical technique had been performed on this patient for right maxillary sinusitis 30 years earlier, but the nasoantral window for drainage had gradually narrowed. The mucosal lining of the sinus continued to produce mucus, and it became swollen during and after inflammation and pushed the eyeball superiorly. The diagnosis was postoperative maxillary sinus mucocele. Postoperative maxillary sinus mucocele is rare in the United states and Europe 1–3; however, it is common in Japan.
4. 5 It typically occurs 10 to 15 years after the initial Caldwell-Luc operation and is accompanied by a swollen and painful cheek. 5 Interestingly, this patient had never complained of a swollen and painful cheek.

Even without those symptoms, recurrent diplopia would occur. The history of sinus surgeries is important to detect in such cases. Currently, we are planning to reoperate on the right maxillary sinus to provide permanent drainage by an endoscopic sinus surgery. However, the patient's liver function does not permit use of general anesthesia, because of chronic hepatitis.

### Adult hypertropia: a guide to diagnostic evaluation based on review of 300 patients [^735dfa1e]. Eye (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To highlight the key clinical features of various aetiologies of adult hypertropia and to discuss the diagnostic approach towards evaluation of vertical double vision.

Methods

This is a retrospective cross-sectional study. A total of 300 consecutive patients with vertical diplopia were evaluated by a single neuro-ophthalmologist and strabismologist in a tertiary care setting from 2005–2008. The medical records of all patients with vertical diplopia coded with one of the following diagnoses; hypertropia, diplopia, thyroid eye disease, fourth nerve palsy, ocular myasthenia, congenital strabismus, and third nerve palsy were reviewed. The main outcome measures were determination of aetiologies of hypertropia.

Results

Fourth nerve palsy and thyroid eye disease were the most common causes of vertical diplopia in our series and comprised more than 50% of patients. The other causes of vertical diplopia were ocular surgery, orbital fracture, neurosurgery, childhood strabismus, skew deviation, third nerve palsy, myasthenia gravis, and decompensated hyperphorias. Ocular motility deficits were seen in 33% of the cohort of whom thyroid eye disease comprised the largest group. Orbital ultrasonography was sensitive in detecting thyroid orbitopathy.

Conclusion

In the majority of patients, the aetiologies of hypertropias can be ascertained by history and careful ophthalmic examination alone. Fourth nerve palsy and thyroid eye disease were the most common causes of vertical diplopia in this series.

### Diplopia in autoimmune thyroid disease… [^ba0c677a]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Diplopia without obvious exophthalmos, caused by infiltrative endocrine ophthalmopathy, developed in 12 patients with clinical and laboratory confirmation of autoimmune thyroid disease. In eight patients, the diplopia alone prompted medical attention, which led to the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease. A hypotropia secondary to restrictive tightening of the inferior rectus muscle, producing vertical diplopia, was the most common manifestation of the disorder. The ocular muscle imbalance in autoimmune thyroid disease is caused by mechanical orbital restriction of the extraocular muscle, not by an innervational defect. Evidence of orbital restriction of the eye muscles can establish the diagnosis, regardless of the patient's thyroid function. Appen RE, Wendelborn D, Nolten WE. Diplopia in Autoimmune Thyroid Disease. Arch Intern Med. 1982; 142: 898–901.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^de9d7ad2]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — binocular central diplopia diagnosis and testing — Binocular central diplopia develops within days to weeks of worsening maculopathy or foveal abnormality because the foveal image in the two eyes becomes too dissimilar to fuse. A detailed medical history should include information on ocular conditions and specifically retinal disease involving the macula, and an examination should include eliciting any history of retinal disease affecting the macula of one or both eyes. A full orthoptic examination is warranted because a proportion of patients who have maculopathy and diplopia have other forms of treatable strabismus, and prism and alternate cover testing demonstrates either no strabismus or a small vertical deviation. Metamorphopsia may be identified on the Amsler grid test and quantified using M-Charts, and aniseikonia (unequal images) can be quantified using the Awaya test. For dragged-fovea diplopia syndrome, the lights on/off test is pathognomonic, but this test is not effective unless the entire room is darkened with no cues to peripheral fusion; an alternative is the optotype-frame test in which diplopia of the letter with a single monitor frame indicates that peripheral fusion has taken over and foveal diplopia syndrome is present.

### How do I manage functional visual loss [^546ece8a]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

b Prisms can be used in several ways to assess for functional vision loss in monocular cases. In severe monocular functional visual loss, a 10-dioptre vertical prism test can be used to displace an image vertically towards the apex of the prism, thus leading to recognition of diplopia. Even if the patient denies experiencing diplopia, the diplopic images are difficult to ignore or 'suppress' and the patient can often be observed looking from one image to the other where visual acuity is near equal. Similarly, a prism reflex test, typically with a 20-dioptre horizontal prism, can be used in an adult patient to induce a motor fusion response. The prism is placed base out before one eye whilst the patient fixes on a near target. This induces diplopia and the eye behind the prism adducts towards the apex of the prism to move the prismatic image to the fovea. The fellow eye will make a corresponding abduction but due to ongoing diplopia it will make a positive fusional adduction after a second or so to restore binocular single vision. This fusional movement confirms the patient has binocular vision even if they don't report experiencing diplopia - only patients with severe unilateral visual loss will not overcome the prism and therefore not make the second fusional movement. In unilateral cases with less severe impairment the similar monocular vertical prism dissociation test using a 4-dioptre vertical prism can be used over to induce vertical diplopia whilst fixating on a high acuity target (eg single 6/6 Snellen optotype at distance). This relies on the patient reporting they observe diplopia and if so to compare the sharpness of the two letters. If they are reported as similar, then this confirms good acuity in both eyes.

### Pearls&Oy-sters: vertical diplopia and ocular torsion: peripheral vs central localization [^83734513]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

We describe a case with torsional deviation of the eyes from a brainstem lesion. Torsional eye movement refers to changes in the position of the eyes in the roll plane around the visual axis. When the head is tilted laterally (that is, rolled toward the shoulder), the eyes roll in the opposite direction as part of the torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex known as the ocular counter-roll. Pathologies that affect the otolith-ocular pathway can lead to a torsional deviation of the eyes as part of the ocular tilt reaction (OTR) that also causes vertical deviation of the eyes (skew deviation) and head tilt. Lesions caudal to the pontomedullary junction (such as the labyrinth, eighth cranial nerve, or vestibular nucleus) result in an OTR with ipsiversive torsional deviation, whereas lesions rostral to the junction result in an OTR with contraversive torsional deviation. Furthermore, torsional deviation of the eyes in the OTR is conjugate (incyclotorsion in the higher eye and excyclotorsion in the lower eye), whereas torsional deviation from ocular palsy in peripheral lesions is disconjugate (e.g., exyclotorsion only in the higher eye with superior oblique palsy). Therefore, the pattern of torsional eye deviation can be helpful in localizing the lesion. Several techniques including fundus photography, double Maddox rod testing, optical coherence tomography, and video-oculography are used to measure torsional eye position.

Provider and setting — diagnosis and management of 6th nerve palsy require the training and clinical judgment of an experienced ophthalmologist, and orthoptists working under ophthalmologist supervision can be an asset; counseling and referral guidance state that neuroimaging should be considered in all young patients or in any patient with other cranial neuropathies, other neurologic change or elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), signs of elevated intracranial pressure, or if there are no compelling vasculopathic risk factors, and in the aging population with risk factors, lack of resolution over time suggests a need for neuroimaging; if the primary diagnosis is uncertain, referral should also be considered to providers with expertise in neuro-ophthalmology and adult strabismus, the ophthalmologist should discuss findings, diagnosis, and management options, patients should be advised that the goal of treatment is to eliminate diplopia in the primary position and to create a reasonable field of single binocular vision, and patients will most likely continue to have diplopia in extreme lateral gaze.

- A 55-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus had vertical diplopia secondary to metastasis to the brain stem. The lesion was detected by magnetic resonance scanning but not by computed tomography. Clinically, the disturbance in ocular motility localized to the right inferior rectus muscle. At autopsy, a single metastasis was present in the brain stem, contiguous with the right oculomotor nucleus and involving a small portion of the nucleus. The findings in this case support the concept that, in humans, the oculomotor nucleus is organized into functional subnuclei. Pusateri TJ, Sedwick LA, Margo CE.

### Nonneurologic causes of binocular diplopia for the neurologist [^ea7d719c]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review several etiologies of nonneurologic diplopia that the neurologist should be familiar with. The pathophysiology, clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and treatment options are briefly summarized for each condition.

Recent Findings

Certain etiologies for diplopia can be associated with life-threatening neurologic conditions and should be investigated thoroughly for proper localization and immediate management of the underlying disease. However, nonneurological causes of binocular diplopia are very common and disabling, but are often nonemergent and may not require in-depth investigation or neuroimaging. Some of the etiologies of nonneurologic diplopia mimic cranial nerve palsies, making them confusing to evaluate when the physician is not familiar with these etiologies. Unfamiliarity with these diagnoses can lead to unnecessary neuroimaging, inefficient utilization of medical resources, and undue alarm to the patient. Recent advances in clinical diagnostic tools and neuroimaging have clarified our understanding of the diverse underlying mechanisms of nonneurologic binocular diplopia.

Summary

Diplopia can be a difficult symptom for the neurologist to evaluate. A systematic approach to the evaluation of diplopia can help establish the urgency and necessity of an extensive workup. This review will help to familiarize the neurologist with nonneurological causes of binocular diplopia, minimize expensive and unnecessary evaluations, and reassure patients and physicians alike.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^646b2989]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — superior oblique muscle palsy background notes that superior oblique muscle palsy is one of the common types of vertical strabismus seen in adults, and annual incidence has been reported to be 6.3 cases per 100,000 people with a higher incidence among males than females; risk factors include head trauma and increasing age (in age-related decompensation of congenital weakness). In long-standing and presumed congenital superior oblique palsy (SOP), patients may experience no diplopia or intermittent diplopia and a long-standing effective compensatory head position minimizes diplopia awareness; based on later-decade presentations, the natural history of presumed congenital SOP is deterioration in some cases. Treatment is warranted for diplopia, compensatory head position sometimes associated with neck pain, and asthenopia.

### Diplopia due to skew deviation following neurotologic procedures [^2f107284]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe and characterize diplopia resulting from skew deviation after cerebellopontine angle (CPA) surgery and labyrinthectomy.

Patients and Interventions

Retrospective case series of 4 patients who developed vertical diplopia from skew deviation after resection of tumors in the CPA or labyrinthectomy

Main Outcome Measure

Complete neuro-opthalmologic examination including opticokinetic testing, confrontational visual field assessment, color plate, pupillary reflex, slit lamp examination, and head tilt test.

Results

Four patients with residual hearing preoperatively developed skew deviation immediately after surgical intervention, including translabyrinthine (n = 1) and retrosigmoid (n = 2) approaches to the CPA and labyrinthectomy (n = 1). Neuro-ophthalmologic examination demonstrated intact extraocular movements, and 2- to 14-mm prism diopter hypertropia on both primary gaze and head tilt testing. In all cases, skew deviation resolved spontaneously with normalization of the neuro-ophthalmologic examination within 10 weeks.

Conclusion

Patients undergoing CPA surgery or labyrinthectomy can develop postoperative diplopia due to skew deviation as a consequence of acute vestibular deafferentation. Patients with significant hearing preoperatively, a probable marker for residual vestibular function, may be especially at risk for developing skew deviation postoperatively.

### Comatic aberration as a cause of monocular diplopia [^9220824a]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Three patients (5 eyes) presented with complaints of monocular diplopia and no history of ocular trauma or surgery. The patients had comprehensive neuroophthalmic evaluation including manifest refraction, anterior segment and dilated fundus examination, and corneal topography. All patients also had wavefront analysis using the LADARWave system (Alcon). Two patients (4 eyes) also had hard contact lens overrefraction. The patients had a normal initial examination including corneal topography. One patient (2 eyes) did not experience resolution of diplopia with pinhole. No eye improved with manifest refraction or hard contact lens overrefraction. However, each patient had a significant amount of coma on wavefront analysis. Moreover, eyes with horizontal diplopia had horizontal coma and eyes with vertical diplopia had vertical coma as measured with the wavefront device. Higher-order optical aberrations such as coma may be associated with monocular diplopia. Wavefront technology may be useful in the workup of monocular diplopia.

### Persistent vertical binocular diplopia after cataract surgery [^1ee61790]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the incidence of, and factors associated with, persistent vertical diplopia after cataract surgery.

Design

Consecutive interventional case series.

Methods

Retrospectively, all adult patients examined during a five year, five month period because of new onset persistent (> 3 months) vertical binocular diplopia after cataract surgery were analyzed. All patients had their cataract surgery at the same outpatient ophthalmic surgery center, and were referred to the author, enabling calculation of incidence. Trends in anesthesia type and strabismus complications therefrom were also assessed. Comparison was made between ophthalmologist-administered retrobulbar anesthesia versus anesthesia staff-administered retrobulbar anesthesia. Incidence during a period in which hyaluronidase was not incorporated in the retrobulbar anesthetic was calculated.

Results

Persistent vertical diplopia occurred after cataract surgery in 32 (0.18%) of 17,531 eyes that had cataract surgery. No patient whose cataract surgery was conducted with topical anesthesia (3817 eyes) had persistent vertical diplopia, whereas 32 (0.23%) of the 13714 eyes whose cataract surgery was done after retrobulbar anesthesia were affected. No cases of persistent postoperative diplopia were found among 7410 cataract surgery eyes after retrobulbar injection given by one cataract surgeon. There was a threefold greater number of left eyes involved than right eyes (P < .005). No significant (P > .20) increase in cases of persistent vertical diplopia was noted during a period of hyaluronidase shortage.

Conclusions

In this study, persistent binocular vertical diplopia after cataract surgery occurred in 0.23% of cases in which retrobulbar anesthesia was performed. No cases were found after topical anesthesia. Occurrence may be technique-related.

### Current concepts in acute vestibular syndrome and video-oculography [^d4dcec7e]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Video test of skew

A vertical ocular misalignment, or skew deviation, can be seen in both peripheral and central causes of AVS, as lesions at various levels of the otolithic (utricular) pathway may lead to an ocular tilt reaction (OTR), including head tilt, ocular counterroll and skew. Typical central lesions producing pathologic OTR occur in the vestibular nuclei (lateral medullary or Wallenberg syndrome, caudal to the decussation of utriculo-ocular motor fibres causing an ipsiversive OTR), medial longitudinal fasciculus (usually pontine – rostral to the decussation causing a contraversive OTR) and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (midbrain – contraversive OTR).

A recent cross-sectional study of AVS patients found a skew deviation prevalence of 26%; however, this included some very small skews that were detected only with VOG and not with bedside ocular alignment testing. Skews larger than 3.3 degrees (5.8 diopters) were indicative of stroke and typically caused vertical diplopia, while 'peripheral' skews were smaller in magnitude and rarely caused vertical diplopia. Because the very small 'peripheral' skews could not be appreciated in these studies without VOG or Maddox rod testing, alternate cover testing as part of the originally described HINTS examination ('Test of Skew') was sufficient to recognize larger skews (> 3 degrees) that were likely to be central in origin. We observed a difficulty in recording skew with VOG due to the following reasons:

(1) Small skews are not detectable in noisy signals due to artifacts or improper eye tracking.
(2) There can be a lack of synchronization between visual stimulus (right versus left eye viewing occurring during alternate cover) and the detection of saccades in time dependency of the stimulus.
(3) There might be an overestimation of skew in patients with spontaneous nystagmus with a vertical component or a potential crosstalk between horizontal and vertical eye movements.

Crosstalk occurs when we observe simultaneous and synchronous vertical eye movements (refixation movements during alternate cover) during pure horizontal eye movements (spontaneous horizontal nystagmus). It can be the result of an improper head/eye calibration when VOG goggles or the cameras on the head are tilted.

### "Retinal diplopia" associated with macular wrinkling [^59187d29]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Binocular diplopia is usually due to misalignment from ocular motor dysfunction. Three patients with chronic binocular vertical diplopia and small comitant hypotropic deviations due to macular displacement (heterotopia) associated with monocular retinal wrinkling are described. This maculopathy was idiopathic in two and secondary to treated retinal detachment in the third. Displacement of the macula by vitreoretinal traction is an unusual cause of binocular diplopia that requires careful ophthalmoscopy to diagnose.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^e5482e05]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — evaluation of torsion and superior oblique palsy (SOP) should include refractive assessment and selective neuroimaging based on clinical features. Determination of refractive error should be included in the examination, and assessment of torsion does not require, but is enhanced by, evaluation on a synoptophore using fusable targets with square edges; that assessment determines whether torsion is a barrier to fusion and the amount to correct. Fundus torsion by indirect ophthalmoscopy or with fundus photography is less useful because normal values have a wide range, and therefore it is almost always impossible to assess the change from a previous undocumented state to the current state. Neuroimaging is rarely indicated in isolated unilateral SOP or bilateral cases in which trauma is the known cause, but acquired symptomatic diplopia with poor fusional amplitudes may be an indication for brain and/or orbital MR imaging with contrast, and neuroimaging should always be performed if there are additional central nervous system signs or symptoms. Occult thyroid eye disease (TED) can present as new-onset vertical diplopia with a positive three-step test that resembles SOP, and acute-onset SOP may be caused by giant cell arteritis. Intraoperative exaggerated forced ductions often reveal a lax superior oblique tendon in presumed congenital SOP; quantitative torsion forced ductions help quantify lax or tight oblique muscles, and vertical rectus forced ductions in clinic or at surgery may reveal ipsilateral limitation of downgaze from superior rectus contracture or contralateral restriction of elevation from inferior rectus contracture, which many consider important to address in any surgical plan.

Results

Subject characteristics

We prospectively enrolled 14 patients with binocular diplopia and 10 healthy controls. All patients completed both the CRT and the Hess test. They were 7 men and 7 women with a median age of 46 years old (IQR 29–62.25). On the bedside exams, 9 patients had vertical diplopia, and 5 patients had horizontal diplopia. The affected sides were 8 on the right side and 6 on the left side. The presumed causes of diplopia were 7 infranuclear palsies (50%), 2 supranuclear palsies (14.3%), 3 orbital disorders (2 traumatic and 1 myogenic) (21.4%), and 2 unknown (14.3%). The median time interval from symptom onset to evaluation was 30 days (IQR 12.75–62.5) (Table 1).

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^9ca4c9ae]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Superior oblique palsy (SOP) — disease definition, presentation, differential features, and common causes are outlined as follows: SOP is due to partial or complete paralysis of the 4th cranial nerve (trochlear nerve), producing a motility disturbance with vertical, torsional, and to a lesser degree horizontal incomitance; both congenital and acquired forms exist, with the presumed congenital type sometimes first presenting in adulthood. Patients may show hypertropia of the involved eye with compensatory head tilt and report diplopia, asthenopia, and/or anomalous head posture. Decompensated congenital SOP can include facial asymmetry with a shorter maxilla on the side opposite the SOP, and some chronic vertical deviations consistent with SOP lack a decreased superior oblique muscle belly on neuroimaging, sometimes showing only compartmental atrophy; these may be referred to as presumed SOP or masquerading SOP. Non-inflammatory or post-inflammatory TED with unilateral or bilaterally asymmetric inferior rectus enlargement can present with a three-step test mimicking SOP. Head trauma (including concussion) is among the most common identifiable causes of unilateral or bilateral acquired SOP, though isolated trochlear schwannomas and giant cell arteritis are extremely rare causes. Skew deviation can resemble SOP and is more frequently associated with less benign etiology and more often warrants neuroimaging.

### Vertical diplopia and ptosis from removal of the orbital roof in pterional craniotomy [^a95608c4]. Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a newly recognized clinical syndrome consisting of ptosis, diplopia, vertical gaze limitation, and abduction weakness that can occur after orbital roof removal during orbito-zygomatic-pterional craniotomy.

Design

Case series.

Participants

Eight study patients (7 women), 44 to 80 years of age, with neuro-ophthalmic symptoms after pterional craniotomy.

Methods

Case description of 8 study patients.

Main Outcome Measures

Presence of ptosis, diplopia, and gaze limitation.

Results

Eight patients had neuro-ophthalmic findings after pterional craniotomy for meningioma removal or aneurysm clipping. The cardinal features were ptosis, limited elevation, and hypotropia. Three patients also had limitation of downgaze and 2 patients had limitation of abduction. Imaging showed loss of the fat layers that normally envelop the superior rectus and levator palpebrae superioris. The muscles appeared attached to the defect in the orbital roof. Ptosis and diplopia developed in 2 patients despite Medpor titanium mesh implants. Deficits in all patients showed spontaneous improvement. In 2 patients, a levator advancement was required to repair ptosis. In 3 patients, an inferior rectus recession using an adjustable suture was performed to treat vertical diplopia. Follow-up a mean of 6.5 years later revealed that all patients had a slight residual upgaze deficit, but alignment was orthotropic in primary gaze.

Conclusions

After pterional craniotomy, ptosis, diplopia, and vertical gaze limitation can result from tethering of the superior rectus-levator palpebrae superioris complex to the surgical defect in the orbital roof. Lateral rectus function sometimes is compromised by muscle attachment to the lateral orbital osteotomy. This syndrome occurs in approximately 1% of patients after removal of the orbital roof and can be treated, if necessary, by prism glasses or surgery.

### A cyclic vertical deviation with dysthyroid ophthalmopathy: a case report [^69aac0a2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 40-year-old woman was referred to our strabismus clinic with a complaint of double vision. She had already been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, and her thyroid function had normalized after 2 months of treatment with antithyroid medication; subsequently, 2.5 mg carbimazole was used as a maintaining dose. She did not take systemic steroid medication, because her dysthyroid ophthalmopathy was not severe (Clinical Activity Score, CAS 2) and there was no aggravated symptomatic sign. She subsequently developed worsening diplopia and proptosis in her left eye 1 month prior to presentation. At the initial examination, her visual acuity was normal in both eyes (20/20), and 2 mm exophthalmos was noted in her left eye. She exhibited left hypotropia of 35 prism diopters (PD) in the primary position with marked limitation of left eye elevation (Fig. 1a). Asymmetric enlargement of the inferior and medial rectus muscles was demonstrated in her left eye on computed tomography (CT), and was compatible with dysthyroid ophthalmopathy (Fig. 1c). The forced duction test (FDT) revealed restriction in the upward direction in her left eye. She described a highly predictable fluctuating pattern of diplopia, that spontaneously switched at approximately 8 o'clock every night. To differentiate the causes of the fluctuating diplopia, such as myasthenia gravis, we performed laboratory tests, including a determination of acetylcholine receptor antibody titer; all results were normal. Based on her description, we recommended that she keep a diary to record her diplopia episodes and have her picture taken during episodes of both mild and severe diplopia. At the next visit, during which she exhibited relatively mild diplopia, cover testing revealed left hypotropia of 7 PD in the primary position with mild limitation of left eye elevation (Fig. 1b). Her diary clearly revealed the "every-other-day" pattern of diplopia. During the 6 months since the first visit, her thyroid function remained normal and the proptosis of her left eye decreased. A cycle involving diplopia-free days was gradually predominant. Finally, the left hypotropia of 7 PD remained, but without a cyclic pattern. Her diplopia was well compensated with mild chin elevation.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^2df1eb50]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Ocular motility in diabetes mellitus — ocular motility disorders may occur in individuals with diabetes secondary to diabetic neuropathy involving the third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerves, and mononeuropathies may present a diagnostic challenge because many are not due to diabetes and other causes need to be ruled out. Pupillary involvement in diabetes-associated oculomotor nerve palsy occurs in about one fourth of all cases; the resolution can be variable depending on pupillary involvement and (Evidence Grade: B) these patients can generally be treated conservatively and monitored on a regular basis. Palsies of the third nerve are generally more common and are usually accompanied by ptosis of the eyelid with exotropia and hypotropia; acute pain may be associated with onset, and pupil sparing helps distinguish diabetes-related third nerve palsy from intracranial aneurysms or tumors. Sixth nerve palsy usually presents with horizontal diplopia; the affected eye is esotropic and is generally unable to be moved past the mid-line, and patients may turn their heads in the direction of their paretic field of action in order to eliminate diplopia. Fourth nerve palsy usually causes vertical diplopia that is typically sudden in onset and initially worsens; vertical deviation increases with downward gaze or lateral gaze away from the affected muscle when the head is tilted toward the affected side. Full ocular motility recovery generally occurs within two to six months; however, recurrences are common.

### Poorly differentiated orbital neuroendocrine carcinoma [^b0a3395a]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A man in his 70s presented with painless bilateral eyelid oedema and vertical diplopia. Evaluation showed a restrictive pattern of extraocular motility testing with MRI demonstrating significant enlargement of the right superior rectus and left superior oblique muscles along with right orbital fat stranding. Subsequent right orbital biopsy revealed poorly differentiated high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma without a systemic primary site on further diagnostic workup. The patient was treated with carboplatin and etoposide and passed away from an infection a month after diagnosis. This case along with a review of other published cases highlights the varied presentation of orbital neuroendocrine carcinomas that may mimic a broad differential of orbital processes, thus requiring careful diagnostic workup. Subsequently, additional considerations in metastatic evaluation should be based on tumour histological features.

A 37-year-old Asian nonsmoking man with no known medical or drug history presented with an insidious onset of left-eye ptosis and subsequent painless vertical diplopia for 1 year. He did not complain of headaches, facial numbness, dysarthria, facial droop, dysphagia, or limb weakness or numbness. There was no history of joint pain or constitutional symptoms. Neurological examination revealed a nonfatigable partial left-eyelid ptosis, left-eye hypotropia at primary position, and impaired left eye supraduction with a nonreactive left pupil on direct and consensual light reflexes. There were no other cranial nerve deficits. Limb reflexes, motor testing, and sensory testing results were normal, and the plantar responses were flexor. Cheng N.

Adult strabismus with a history of childhood strabismus — management plan specifies that the patient "should be monitored/observed if symptoms are mild, occasional, and well tolerated or if patient is opposed to treatment". It advises to "Consider if alignment might be improved with changing optical correction (e.g., correction of hyperopia and appropriate bifocal or progressive lenses for adults approaching presbyopia)". It further notes that "Reversal of monovision may be necessary and may resolve symptoms", and that "Prisms to address some forms of diplopia, and orthoptic exercises to address some forms of diplopia and asthenopia can be considered".

Skew deviation — definition and characteristic signs: Skew deviation is a vertical strabismus linked to vestibular end-organ or supranuclear utriculo-ocular pathway disorders in the posterior fossa, and the vertical strabismus may be comitant or incomitant with vertical diplopia, ocular torsion, torticollis, and an ocular tilt reaction characterized by head tilt toward the hypotropic shoulder with both eyes rotating in the direction of the head tilt; if present, vertical visual field tilt is in the same direction as the head tilt. With skew deviation the hypertropic eye shows fundus incyclotorsion and the hypotropic eye shows fundus excyclotorsion, helping distinguish it from 4th nerve palsy in which the hypertropic eye is most typically excyclotorted; ocular torsion in skew may be conjugate or disconjugate.

### Prevalence of non-strabismic binocular vision anomalies and age-related changes in binocular vision among middle-aged and older adults: a systematic review [^fef86e68]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of NSBVAs in middle-aged and older adults

The diagnosis of NSBVAs primarily relies on symptoms and clinical signs. Accurate identification of symptom types is essential for developing targeted treatment strategies to enhance visual function and improve quality of life. Common symptoms include blurred vision, diplopia, eye strain, headaches, reading difficulties, and comprehension issues. These may worsen after prolonged near work or brief periods of reading. Binocular diplopia, a prevalent symptom, is not age-correlated in some studies but peaks at age 70 due to microvascular stroke or tumors. Strabismus decompensation in the elderly involves increased near exophoria, reduced convergence fusion range, and anatomical degeneration, leading to vertical, horizontal, or cyclostrabismus and binocular diplopia. Symptoms of presbyopia overlap with those of NSBVAs, making clinical differentiation challenging.

The Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) questionnaire measures treatment efficacy for symptomatic convergence insufficiency (CI). It uses cut-off scores of 16 for children and 21 for adults to differentiate CI from normal binocular vision. A score of 15 or higher is recommended for identifying CI-related symptoms in presbyopic individuals. However, its diagnostic accuracy for screening CI varies across studies. For example, Horan et al. found the CISS lacks specificity in adolescents, while Horwood et al. suggested it is unsuitable for screening young adults. Horan et al. noted that the CISS was not designed specifically for assessing CI and has been used in studies to identify symptoms of various binocular vision problems. Discrepancies exist between CISS scores and clinical findings in CI patients, as symptom severity does not always correlate significantly with scores. Thus, relying solely on the CISS for diagnosing or evaluating CI outcomes may not be advisable. Menjivar et al. emphasized that the NPC break is most effective for identifying CI in children, suggesting the need to revise the CISS by incorporating specific clinical tests.

### Refractive errors preferred practice pattern ® [^9851b1f8]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Anisometropia — eyeglass correction tolerance and management is described, noting that the majority of adults can tolerate up to 3.00 D of difference in eyeglass refractive correction between the two eyes, and that occasionally individuals may tolerate more than 3.00 D of difference. Reduction of symptomatic aniseikonia may be accomplished either by undercorrecting at the expense of acuity or modifying the lens base curve or lens thickness to alter relative image size. Vertical prism-induced diplopia can be a problem in presbyopic patients who wear bifocals; small amounts of induced prism can be corrected by either slabbing-off or slabbing-on the bifocal segment, and dissimilar segment types can also be used; a separate pair of reading eyeglasses, although less convenient, will avoid the problem of vertical anisophoria.

Adult strabismus with a history of childhood strabismus — initial exam history and physical evaluation prioritize documenting chronicity and targeted testing. Initial exam history includes "History of chronicity, review past clinical, surgical and imaging records" and "Neuro-ophthalmic evaluation in cases where presentation suggests neurologic or systemic disease". The physical exam includes "Optical correction (glasses) and presence of any ground-in or overlay prism, and impact that the current correction might have on alignment", "Dry manifest and cycloplegic refraction providing clues to original oculomotor disturbance", and a "Complete motility examination, including cover-uncover, alternate-cover testing, prism and alternate cover measurements, and testing for binocular fusion and stereopsis, and assessment of alignment by light reflex testing (e.g. Krimsky) to compare with cover test and identification of abnormal angle kappa". Additional evaluation includes "Inspection of the ocular surface for conjunctival scars (prior incision sites) and exposure of the thinned sclera behind anatomical insertions (evidence of likely muscle recession)", "Inspection of the interpalpebral fissures for evidence of prior vertical or horizontal rectus muscle resection (smaller interpalpebral fissure) or recession (larger interpalpebral fissure)", and "Prism testing to simulate desired postsurgical alignment and range of overcorrection and undercorrection comfortably tolerated and unlikely to result in diplopia". Torsion assessment is advised with "Assessment for ocular torsion by sensory testing or anatomic evidence of torsion noted during indirect ophthalmoscopy, particularly in patients with vertical strabismus", and imaging options — computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, or optical coherence tomography (OCT) — are noted as "Imaging (e.g. CT, MRI, ultrasound or OCT) although nearly all cases can be managed without imaging".

### Approach to patient with diplopia [^9193f024]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

This article presents an overview of the most important points a neurologist must remember when dealing with a patient complaining of diplopia. Patients with monocular diplopia and those with full ocular motility and comitant misalignment should be referred to an ophthalmologist and do not require further testing. Patients with recent onset of binocular diplopia who have associated "brainstem" symptoms should have an urgent brain MRI. All patients with 3rd cranial nerve palsy require urgent brain CTA to rule out compressive aneurysmal lesion. Management of patients over 50 years of age with microvascular risk factors with new onset of 6th nerve palsy is controversial: some image these patients at presentation while others choose a short period of observation as most of these patients would have a microvascular etiology for the 6th nerve palsy which should improve spontaneous in 2–3 months. All others with 6th nerve palsy require brain MRI with contrast. Patients with 4th palsy with hyperdeviation that worsens in downgaze should have an MRI with contrast and all others referred to an ophthalmologist. If there is more than one cranial nerve palsy, urgent neuroimaging should be performed with attention to cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure. Ocular myasthenia should be suspected in patients with eye misalignment that does not fit a pattern for any cranial nerve palsy. Orbital pathology (most commonly thyroid eye disease) can result in restriction of ocular motility and has specific clinical signs associated with it.

### A cyclic vertical deviation with dysthyroid ophthalmopathy: a case report [^4add23dd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cyclic strabismus is a very rare condition of ocular motility characterized by alternating strabismus and orthotropia. We report a patient with a 48-h cycle of vertical deviation associated with dysthyroid ophthalmopathy that spontaneously resolved.

Case presentation

A 40-year-old woman experienced sudden onset vertical double vision. She had already been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Asymmetric enlargement of the inferior and medial rectus muscles was demonstrated in her left eye on computed tomography, and was compatible with dysthyroid ophthalmopathy. She clearly described the "every-other-day" pattern of diplopia that spontaneously switched around 8 o'clock every night. She exhibited left hypotropia of 35 prism diopters on a bad day, and 7 prism diopters on a good day.

Conclusions

This case illustrates that cyclic vertical deviation may spontaneously resolve along with the course of the underlying diseases that initiated the cyclic deviation, especially in patients with conditions involving motor component changes such as dysthyroid ophthalmopathy.

### Outcomes of extraocular muscle surgery for diplopia or abnormal head posture after treatment of brain disease [^44a1be1b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Ocular alignment in most patients after treatment of SCVD or BT showed not only horizontal strabismus but complicating vertical deviation and/or cyclotorsion; hence, these ocular motility disturbances were considered refractory to EOM surgery. However, EOM surgery was effective in eliminating diplopia and AHP. In addition, it became apparent that it took an average of 4 years from the onset of diplopia to first EOM surgery. Therefore, we recommend that these patients visit an ophthalmologist much sooner and undergo EOM surgery.

Orbital and adnexal trauma — Key clinical indicators and management triggers are described. Pain with motility and diplopia can be indicative of orbital trauma. In children, orbital floor fractures are often caused by significant blunt trauma to the face and orbits and, unlike in adults, may present without significant lid edema and ecchymosis. These fractures are often greenstick-type with entrapment of intra-orbital contents leading to restricted vertical ocular movements, and if accompanied by nausea, vomiting, bradycardia and/or syncope (oculocardiac reflex) urgent surgical repair is needed.

### Clinical course and prognosis of trochlear nerve schwannomas [^58827340]. Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To delineate the disease course and prognosis of patients with mass lesions of the fourth nerve presumed to be schwannomas.

Design

Nonrandomized retrospective case series.

Participants

Thirty-seven consecutive cases of presumed trochlear nerve schwannoma from 9 tertiary university neuro-ophthalmology centers.

Methods

Cases were collected, and their clinical characteristics on presentation and follow-up are described. Inclusion criteria were brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a lesion suggestive of a schwannoma along the course of the fourth nerve. Exclusion criteria were other causes of fourth nerve palsy, such as congenital, traumatic or microvascular; normal (or lack of) initial brain MRI; lack of adequate clinical information; and disappearance of the lesion on subsequent follow-up brain MRI.

Main Outcome Measures

Demographics of patients, presence of neurofibromatosis, symptoms on presentation, vertical deviation, lesion size (on presentation and follow-up), length of follow-up, and outcomes of treatment for lesions or diplopia.

Results

Seven patients were excluded and of the 30 patients included in our series, patients were predominantly male (77%) with a mean age of 51 years (range 9–102 years). In contrast with prior case reports, almost all of our cases had a fourth nerve palsy on presentation (29/30), often isolated. Mean follow-up was 3.1 years (range 0.2 months to 11.1 years). There was no significant difference between initial and follow-up lesion size (4.4 vs. 5 mm) for patients who did not receive treatment of lesions (P = 0.36). Only 3 patients underwent neurosurgical resection and an additional patient received gamma-knife radiotherapy. The majority of patients (24/30) did not pursue strabismus surgery for vertical diplopia.

Conclusions

Patients with isolated fourth nerve palsy and small lesions of the fourth nerve have a good prognosis and should be followed with serial MRI scans without neurosurgical intervention unless they develop signs of brain stem compression. Most patients with diplopia and benign fourth nerve lesions typical of trochlear nerve schwannoma can adapt with either prism spectacles or no treatment at all, although strabismus surgery can be successful.

### Strabismus following uncomplicated cataract surgery… [^f65de386]. JAMA Network (1997). Excellent credibility.

During the PAST several years the incidence of bothersome postoperative diplopia in some patients following otherwise uneventful and successful cataract surgery has increased. Typically, these patients show outstanding improvement in visual acuity but are troubled by persistent incapacitating vertical and, occasionally, horizontal diplopia noted during the first few postoperative days. Usually, the cataract surgeon is surprised and perplexed by these new complaints. The diplopia has no single cause; rather, a variety of different reasons accounts for these distressing strabismic problems. The cataract surgeon is familiar with monocular causes of postoperative diplopia, such as corneal irregularities or lens decentration, as well as binocular problems related to anisometropia. In my experience, these causes for postoperative diplopia are uncommon, and a search for a true strabismic cause is frequently required.

Some patients may have previously unrecognized strabismic conditions that become manifest following visual acuity improvement, eg, patients with thyroid ophthalmopathy, especially those who Rosenbaum AL. Strabismus Following Uncomplicated Cataract Surgery. Arch Ophthalmol. 1997;

Adult strabismus diagnosis — history indicates that the medical history should include the following elements: a description of ocular misalignment in an adult with a history of persistent or recurrent childhood strabismus; strabismus angle and direction may be the same as the original presentation in childhood or different as a result of aging of the extraocular muscles or the impact of prior strabismus surgery; history of chronicity is important, and an acute change or newly symptomatic diplopia may warrant evaluation for other causes such as cranial nerve palsy, thyroid eye disease (TED), and myasthenia gravis; formal neuro-ophthalmic evaluation may be indicated in some cases where presentation suggests other neurologic or systemic disease; and an attempt should be made to acquire and review past clinical and surgical records as well as any prior imaging studies, although this is not always possible.

### Emergence of diplopia and oscillopsia due to heimann-bielschowsky phenomenon after cataract surgery [^4bf21ac6]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

The Heimann-Bielschowsky phenomenon (HBP) refers to coarse vertical oscillation of the eye with impaired vision. The ocular movements are strictly monocular, occurring only in the eye with amblyopia. The vertical oscillation is of equal velocity in both vertical directions, or may sometimes be greater in the downward than upward direction. HBP develops several years after loss of vision. It can be differentiated from dissociated nystagmus in spasmus nutans, congenital nystagmus and internuclear ophthalmoplegia based on the strict unilaterality, vertical direction and low frequency. Previously, only a few reports described the development of oscillopsia due to HBP after cataract surgery, which resolved spontaneously or responded to gabapentin. However, visual impairments due to diplopia or oscillopsia from HBP after cataract surgery have received little attention. We report a man who developed persistent vertical diplopia and oscillopsia due to HBP after a cataract operation, which markedly impaired his vision.

### A case of skew deviation and downbeat nystagmus induced by lithium [^4dd98e79]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Skew deviation is defined as vertical misalignment of the eyes due to asymmetric supranuclear input involving otolith-ocular pathways. It can occur with a variety of abnormalities in the vestibular system, brainstem, or cerebellum and can be associated with other neurologic symptoms. Skew deviation and downbeat nystagmus in a patient with a lesion in the NPH, a key constituent of the vestibular-cerebellar-brainstem neural network, have been also reported previously. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of skew deviation in addition to downbeat nystagmus in a potential case of lithium toxicity.

Another unique feature of our case is that the patient's symptoms temporarily improved after intravenous fluid therapy or consuming a sports drink. Volume depletion regardless of the underlying origin is a common cause of chronic lithium intoxication and hydration helps maximize lithium clearance. In this case, consumption of sports drinks and intravenous fluid therapy appeared to control the symptoms temporarily. Furthermore, our case emphasized that early recognition of neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms in cases suspicious of lithium toxicity despite a normal therapeutic level of lithium, and consequent prompt drug cessation, could increase the likelihood of avoiding irreversible sequelae.

There are several limitations to this study. Brain MRI was not performed and serum magnesium level was not evaluated due to patient refusal. However, there was no history of alcohol abuse or relevant viral infection. The patient had normal neurological measures and normal serum levels of vitamin B12 and valproate, and electrolytes, reducing the likelihood of other causes of skew deviation and downbeat nystagmus. Other aetiologies of downbeat nystagmus include structural lesions of the brain and metabolic abnormalities, such as hypomagnesaemia, thiamine deficiency, and vitamin B12 deficiency. Lamotrigine toxicity has also been reported to be a rare cause of downbeat nystagmus, and its half-life is extended when used with valproate. However, while our patient takes lamotrigine, she experienced vertical diplopia and nystagmus only after an increase in daily lithium dose, and symptoms resolved completely after cessation of lithium without other medication changes. This supports the presumption that both skew deviation and downbeat nystagmus can be attributed to lithium consumption in this case.

In conclusion, skew deviation and downbeat nystagmus can occur in patients with long-term lithium use, even within the therapeutic range, and symptoms may improve with cessation of the drug.

### Neuro-ophthalmology in emergency medicine [^e424fde0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Understanding the anatomy and physiology of the eye, the orbit, and the central connections is key to understanding neuro-ophthalmologic emergencies. Anisocoria is an important sign that requires a systematic approach to avoid misdiagnosis of serious conditions, including carotid dissection (miosis) and aneurysmal third nerve palsy (mydriasis). Ptosis may be a sign of either Horner syndrome or third nerve palsy. An explanation should be pursued for diplopia since the differential diagnosis ranges from the trivial to life-threatening causes.

Adult Strabismus Preferred Practice Pattern glossary — diagnostic tests and instruments: Awaya Test uses adjacent calibrated half moons — one red and one green — to determine the degree of difference in image size and appearance, with images presented in any meridian enabling quantification of vertical, horizontal, and oblique aniseikonia. Bagolini Lenses are striated lenses used to test for suppression and normal or abnormal retinal correspondence. Optotype-Frame Test assesses central versus peripheral fusion by asking the patient to fixate an isolated Snellen optotype on an illuminated monitor and describe whether the letter is single or double; if maintaining a single frame causes diplopia of the letter, peripheral fusion has taken over and foveal diplopia syndrome is present, a disorder wherein stronger peripheral fusion makes it impossible to maintain single binocular vision centrally when foveal image disparity is sufficient to disrupt central fusion. Synoptophore is an instrument that measures the manifest strabismus angle in all planes, can fix the misalignment and test the ability to fuse superimposed images, and can be used for orthoptic training, exercising fusional vergences, and predicting whether strabismus surgery may result in binocular fusion; the field of view is only 20 to 24 degrees in diameter, which can limit peripheral fusion.

### Interventions for dissociated vertical deviation [^1d6bbbe0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The term "strabismus" describes misalignment of the eyes. One or both eyes may deviate inward, outward, upward, or downward. Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is a well-recognized type of upward drifting of one or both eyes, which can occur in children or adults. DVD often develops in the context of infantile- or childhood-onset horizontal strabismus, either esotropia (inward-turning) or exotropia (outward-turning). For some individuals, DVD remains controlled and can only be detected during clinical testing. For others, DVD becomes spontaneously "manifest" and the eye drifts up of its own accord. Spontaneously manifest DVD can be difficult to control and often causes psychosocial concerns. Traditionally, DVD has been thought to be asymptomatic, although some individuals have double vision. More recently it has been suggested that individuals with DVD may also suffer from eyestrain. Treatment for DVD may be sought either due to psychosocial concerns or because of these symptoms. The standard treatment for DVD is a surgical procedure; non-surgical treatments are offered less commonly. Although there are many studies evaluating different management options for the correction of DVD, a lack of clarity remains regarding which treatments are most effective.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of various surgical and non-surgical interventions in randomized controlled trials of participants with DVD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2015), PubMed (1948 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2015), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) (last searched 3 February 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 August 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical and non-surgical interventions for the correction of DVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently completed eligibility screening, data abstraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and grading of the evidence.

Main Results

We found four RCTs eligible for inclusion in this review (248 eyes of 151 participants between the ages of 6 months to 22 years). All trials were assessed as having unclear risk of bias overall due to insufficient reporting of study methods. One trial was conducted in Canada and compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle with resection versus anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle alone; one in the USA compared superior rectus recession with posterior fixation suture versus superior rectus recession alone; and two in the Czech Republic compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle versus myectomy of the inferior oblique muscle. Only one trial reported data that allowed analysis of the primary outcome for this review, the proportion of participants with treatment success. The difference between inferior oblique anteriorization plus resection versus inferior oblique anteriorization alone was uncertain when measured at least four months postoperatively (risk ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 2.11, 30 participants, very low-quality evidence). Three trials measured the magnitude of hyperdeviation, but did not provide sufficient data for analysis. All four trials reported a relatively low rate of adverse events; hypotropia, limited elevation, and need for repeat surgery were reported as adverse events associated with some of the surgical interventions. No trials reported any other secondary outcome specified for our review.

Authors' Conclusions

The four trials included in this review assessed the effectiveness of five different surgical procedures for the treatment of DVD. Nevertheless, insufficient reporting of study methods and data led to methodological concerns that undermine the conclusions of all studies. There is a pressing need for carefully executed RCTs of treatment for DVD in order to improve the evidence for the optimal management of this condition.

### Persistent diplopia after retrobulbar anesthesia [^f8a22cbb]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the causative factors of persistent diplopia after retrobulbar anesthesia.

Setting

Strabismus Section, Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.

Methods

Prism and alternate cover tests in the diagnostic positions of gaze and ductions/versions were performed in 28 patients with persistent diplopia 6 months after retrobulbar anesthesia. The Lancaster test, Bielshowsky head tilt test, double Maddox rod test, fundoscopic examination for torsion, forced duction test, force generation test, tensilon test, thyroid function test, and/or orbit computed tomography were performed when necessary.

Results

Most of the patients (26 patients, 93%) did not have diplopia before retrobulbar anesthesia. Of the 14 patients with extraocular muscles imbalance, 12 patients showed vertical rectus overaction (11 superior recti, 1 inferior rectus) and 2 patients, mild vertical rectus underaction. Nine patients were presumed to have a sensory strabismus related to the preoperative poor vision, but this went unnoticed preoperatively. Three patients showed a small vertical deviation without any specific causative factors.

Conclusions

Fifty percent of the cases of diplopia were associated with either direct trauma or anesthetic myotoxicity to the extraocular muscles, in which overactions were more common than underactions. Thirty-two percent of the patients were presumed to have sensory strabismus, which suggested the importance of preoperative examination for strabismus as well as providing an explanation about the risk of postoperative diplopia before surgery.

### Superior rectus transposition in the management of duane retraction syndrome: current insights [^8a8ea2d2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Induced Cyclotorsion

Lateral transposition of the superior rectus muscle would also be expected to intort the eye, raising concern over induced torsional diplopia. While studies analysing torsion, using double Maddox rod or by direct fundus observation, before and after SRT have reported post-operative intorsion, clinically significant torsional diplopia was nearly absent in these studies. This can be possibly explained by the patient's fusion capacity (< 8 PD) or by modelling of the orbital forces to prevent diplopia. They also reported that the extent of induced torsion did not correlate with the use of augmentation or its technique, the pre-operative esotropic deviation or the post-operative vertical deviation, if any.

Vertical Misalignment in affected Lateral Gaze

Vertical misalignment in the affected lateral gaze has also been reported following SRT. Mehendale et al noted clinically insignificant hypotropia in attempted abduction in several cases after surgery. However, as explained by Rhiu et al, this finding was present pre-operatively in all of them. This may be caused by a pre-existing dysinnervation leading to IR activation or SR relaxation in attempted abduction or due to the differential activation of the superior and inferior parts of the LR. As a result, post-operative hypertropia in lateral gaze has also been reported. All these patients have also been found to have a more severe abduction deficiency.

### A new gene for autosomal dominant facial palsy / migraine identified in a family by whole exome sequencing [^b0de4b8a]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Facial palsy manifests as unilateral or bilateral weakness and inability to move some of the facial muscles. The aetiology may be different including idiopathic, trauma, infections or brain tumours or it can be associated with chronic neurological diseases. For instance, in recurrent migraine, an increased risk of idiopathic facial palsy (often unilateral) has been observed. Migraine is a neurovascular disorder characterized by mild to severe intensity of headaches, often associated with neuro‐ophthalmological symptoms.

Methods

A family is reported where five members were affected by facial palsy associated with other clinical features including migraine, diplopia, facial swelling, eye conjunctivitis following a vertical transmission. Whole exome sequencing was performed in three members (two affected and one healthy) in order to identify potential variants causative of their phenotype.

Results

A missense variant c.304G > A was found leading to the p.(Ala102Thr) substitution in the TRPM8 gene, previously related to migraine by genome wide association studies. This variant was classified as deleterious by several predictor tools, and the mutant residue was predicted to alter the protein structure in terms of flexibility and interactions with the surrounding residues.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that TRPM8 could be a new causative gene further linking migraine and recurrent facial palsy.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^d01c067f]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Strabismus after orbital trauma — disease definition and etiologies are described as follows: Strabismus after orbital trauma is common and may be present along with other ophthalmic, medical, and surgical conditions, and determining the cause of diplopia after orbital trauma requires a detailed history, examination, and often imaging. The etiology may be multifactorial, including direct damage to the extraocular muscles and their associated nerves, surrounding orbital structures or contemporaneous central nervous system trauma, with mechanisms such as rectus or oblique muscle avulsion, tear, or flap tear, hemorrhage, edema, or paresis, orbital bone fracture with and without entrapment of muscle, fat, or muscle pulleys; cranial neuropathies; disorders of accommodation or convergence; disruption of fusion, fusional amplitudes, saccades and smooth pursuit; decompensation of previous heterophoria; and other supranuclear defects that may result in diplopia.

Complications

The post-operative complications of SRT in DRS (Table 5) are as described below:

Table 5
Table Summarizing Post-Operative Complications of SRT and Preventive and Management Strategies

Induced Vertical Deviations

Although SRT is an asymmetrical and potentially imbalanced transposition, vertical deviations causing diplopia have been noted infrequently. Escuder et al reported induced/new onset vertical deviation in 7% in 69 patients with DRS or 6th nerve palsy undergoing SRT. Similarly, in the series by Sachdeva et al, none of the patients undergoing bilateral SRT had any new onset vertical deviation in the primary position.

Both hypertropia, and hypotropia, have been observed following SRT, although there is a greater tendency for the development of hypodeviation. Escuder et alobserved that the onset of vertical diplopia was generally within the first few days or weeks after the surgery and did not develop beyond 3 months.

Mechanism of Induced Hypotropia

A hypotropia may be induced as the elevating force of SR is decreased by the transposition or if there is inadvertent advancement of the SO with the SR. Rarely, there may be intrinsic weakness of the orbital connective tissues causing slippage of the belly of the SR, causing it to align parallel to the LR, diminishing its vertical force.

Mechanism of Induced Hypertropia

On the other hand, the vertical action of SR may be strengthened after SRT due to its advancement when re-inserted along the spiral of Tillaux or due to dysinnervation of the muscles. This can compensate the propensity of the transposition to cause a hypodeviation or can even lead to hypertropia especially in a tight SR.

Management

Often, these vertical deviations are small and asymptomatic. However, some of these patients may require post-operative prism glasses or sometimes may need a revision of the transposition procedure or an ipsilateral IRT to treat the hypertropia.

### Factors influencing the self-reported sense of deviation in adults with successful surgical outcomes for strabismus [^06d4623e]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

There were some limitations to this study. First, we used criteria for a successful outcome that included motor alignment (no greater than 10 pd. horizontal and 5 pd. vertical deviations) and the desired diplopia (no diplopia/visual confusion at primary and reading positions), whereas some previous studies use a lower threshold for vertical alignment (2 pd). When we used the stricter definition (within 10 pd. horizontal and 5 pd. vertical deviations), we didn't find any factors associated with subjects' sense of deviation. Further evaluations should be combined with more factors in future studies.

Second, although social anxiety levels have been reported to be related to the judgement of post-operative HRQOL in adult patients and although psychosocial characteristics are thought to play a more important role than clinical aspects in the well-being of populations with strabismus, we did not review psychosocial features, e.g. social anxiety and depression, we also did not review other factors that may influence the patient's perspective, such as palpebral fissure width, persistent redness of the conjunctiva in the current study.

### Functional outcomes of late posttraumatic enophthalmos correction [^bb7719af]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Posttraumatic enophthalmos has debilitating functional consequences, resulting in restriction of ocular motility and diplopia. Surgical correction aims to restore the globe position and ultimately improve function. This study evaluates the functional outcome of posttraumatic enophthalmos repair.

Methods

Patients included in this study had posttraumatic enophthalmos and diplopia requiring enophthalmos repair. Diplopia was graded from 0 (no diplopia) to 4 (constant diplopia) based on the Functional Diplopia Grading Scale. Limitations of eye movements were recorded in the vertical, horizontal, and torsional directions. Data were gathered prospectively at preoperative assessment, postenophthalmos repair, and final follow-up.

Results

Between 2002 and 2014, 41 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Substantial functional improvement, defined as a decrease of greater than or equal to 1 grade of diplopia, was achieved in 65.9 percent of patients (27 of 41) after all surgical interventions. Patients with residual diplopia (34 of 41) after enophthalmos surgery were managed with secondary strabismus surgery (10 of 34) and/or prism glasses (four of 34). After all interventions, vertical restrictions improved from -1.95 ± 1.13 to -1.06 ± 0.98. Horizontal restrictions improved from -0.88 ± 0.62 to 0.59 ± 0.6. Adequate clinical correction of enophthalmos to within 2 mm of the contralateral globe was achieved in 37 of 41.

Conclusions

This is the largest case series evaluating functional outcomes of patients undergoing posttraumatic delayed enophthalmos repair. A multidisciplinary care approach resulted in improved globe position and eye movement, and improvement of diplopia. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better understand and treat this important and challenging problem.

### Causes and outcomes for patients presenting with diplopia to an eye casualty department [^7be20848]. Eye (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the causes and outcomes for patients presenting with diplopia to an eye casualty department.

Methods

Patients presenting with diplopia as a principal symptom, who were referred to the Orthoptic Department from Moorfields Eye Casualty over a 12-month period, were retrospectively investigated.

Results

One hundred and seventy-one patients were identified with complete records in 165 cases. There were 99 men and 66 women with an age range of 5–88 years. Monocular diplopia accounted for 19 cases (11.5%), whereas 146 patients (88.5%) had binocular diplopia. Cranial nerve palsies were the most common cause of binocular diplopia accounting for 98 (67%) of cases. Isolated sixth nerve palsy was the largest diagnostic group (n = 45). Microvascular disease (hypertension or diabetes mellitus, or both) was present in 59% of patients with cranial nerve palsies, and of this group, 87% resolved spontaneously by 5 months rising to 95% by 12 months.

Conclusion

Patients with clinically isolated single cranial nerve palsies associated with diabetes or hypertension are likely to recover spontaneously within 5 months and initially require observation only. However, patients with unexplained binocular diplopia and those who progress or fail to recover should be investigated to establish the underlying aetiology and managed as appropriate.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^d5e22221]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — diagnosis of superior oblique muscle palsy (SOP) emphasizes history and examination, including a detailed medical and ocular history with specific questions about prior head trauma, diplopia, and compensatory head posture and review of prior photos for a pattern of long-standing and potentially worsening compensatory head posture. Examination includes a sensorimotor evaluation with special attention to measuring torsion and the magnitude of misalignment in nine gaze positions to determine the position of gaze with the greatest deviation; the Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test is often used to confirm the diagnosis, and hypertropia is greatest in lateral gaze to the opposite side and head tilt to the same side. The three-step test may appear to confirm SOP where neuroimaging of the muscle belly fails to confirm involvement; these cases may be referred to as presumed SOP or masquerading SOP, but the surgical approach is the same as when addressing confirmed SOP and the associated vertical, torsional and horizontal deviations; quantifying the magnitude and direction of torsion enhances surgical planning, and extorsion is commonly found and may be quantified using Double Maddox Rods or Lancaster red–green testing and by noting fundus torsion.

### Medical and surgical treatment for ocular myasthenia [^240802dd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 50% of people with myasthenia gravis present with purely ocular symptoms, so called ocular myasthenia. Of these between 50% to 60% develop generalized disease, most within two years. Their management is controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2006 and previously updated in 2008 and 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for ocular myasthenia and to answer three specific questions. Are there any treatments that impact the progression from ocular to generalized disease? Are there any treatments that improve symptoms of diplopia or ptosis? What is the frequency of adverse effects associated with treatments used?

Search Methods

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (3 August 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1996 to July 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to July 2012) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as case-control and cohort studies. The titles and abstracts of all articles were read by both authors and the full texts of possibly relevant articles were reviewed. The references of all manuscripts included in the review were scanned to identify additional articles of relevance and experts in the field were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished data. Where necessary, we contacted authors for further information.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion required meeting three criteria: (a) randomized (or quasi-randomized) controlled study design; (b) active treatment compared to placebo, no treatment or some other treatment; and (c) results reported separately for patients with ocular myasthenia (grade 1) as defined by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data regarding the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis, improvement in ocular symptoms, and the frequency of treatment-related side effects.

Main Results

In the original review, we identified two RCTs relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia, only one of which reported results in terms of the pre-specified outcome measures used in this review. This study included only three participants and was of limited methodological quality. There were no new RCTs in searches conducted for this or previous updates. In the absence of data from RCTs, we present a review of the available observational data.

Authors' Conclusions

The available randomized controlled literature does not permit any meaningful conclusions about the efficacy of any form of treatment for ocular myasthenia. Data from several reasonably good quality observational studies suggest that corticosteroids and azathioprine may be beneficial in reducing the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis.

### Clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of isolated inferior rectus palsy [^29c52a97]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

A complete cure was defined as a vertical deviation of ≤ 3 PD in primary and reading positions, an absence of diplopia and normal head posture. An improvement was considered to be present when the vertical deviation was > 3 PD but ≤ 10 PD in primary position with an anomalous head posture. Failures were defined as > 10 PD vertical deviation and persistent diplopia in the primary position or downward gaze.

Statistical analysis was performed with use of the SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL). All values presented represent means ± SD. Pre- versus post-operative values were compared using a paired t-test. A p -value < 0.05 was required for results to be considered statistically significant.

Background

Approximately 50% of people with myasthenia gravis present initially with purely ocular symptoms, so called ocular myasthenia and between 50 to 60% of these people will progress to develop generalized disease. The vast majority will do so within the first one to two years. There is controversy surrounding the appropriate management of patients with ocular myasthenia.

Objectives

To perform a systematic review of the literature relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia and to answer three specific questions. Are there any medical or surgical treatments that have an impact on the risk of progression from ocular to generalized myasthenia gravis? Are there any medical or surgical treatments that improve symptoms of diplopia or ptosis in ocular myasthenia? What is the frequency of side effects associated with treatments used in people with ocular myasthenia?

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (searched December 2004), MEDLINE (1996 to 2004) and EMBASE (1980 to 2004) for randomized controlled trials as well as case-control and cohort studies. The titles and abstracts of all articles were read by both authors and the full text of all articles that were of possible relevance was reviewed in full.
