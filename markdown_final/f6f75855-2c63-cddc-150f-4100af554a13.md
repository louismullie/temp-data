## Question

Diagnostic criteria for pandas

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic criteria for PANDAS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical PANDAS criteria and their origin. Then, I should verify how PANDAS fits within the broader PANS framework. Next, I will examine the five original PANDAS criteria in detail and check for any nuances or exceptions. After that, I need to review the strength of evidence and controversies, including what to do about biomarkers and ancillary tests. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and note key differentials and pitfalls to avoid, anchoring to high-credibility sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the historical criteria. PANDAS was defined by Swedo and colleagues with five clinical characteristics: presence of OCD and/or tic disorder, prepubertal onset, abrupt onset with episodic (relapsing-remitting) course, temporal association with group A streptococcal (GAS) infection, and association with neurological abnormalities such as motoric hyperactivity or choreiform movements, and these five criteria have been used in research and clinical practice for decades [^0a741add] [^73e6b513].

> Wait, let me verify the age criterion because I initially thought "strictly prepubertal", but I should double-check whether there is any flexibility. The original criteria specify prepubertal onset, typically before age 12, and this remains a core definitional feature of classic PANDAS; however, the broader PANS construct that subsumes PANDAS allows for pediatric onset without a hard prepubertal cutoff, which is why some clinicians encounter older adolescents with PANS-like presentations that do not meet strict PANDAS age criteria [^0a741add] [^577667bb].

> I need to ensure I capture the temporal association correctly. The streptococcal link should be supported by documentation of GAS infection — throat culture, rapid antigen testing, or serology — and symptoms should begin or exacerbate within a clinically meaningful window around the infection; importantly, serologic titers (ASO, anti-DNase B) can support prior GAS exposure but are not reliable for acute infection diagnosis and should be interpreted cautiously and in context [^73e6b513] [^a8f61dbb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about neurological signs. I should confirm that choreiform movements or motoric hyperactivity are the classic abnormalities during exacerbations, and that these are not required for PANS, which is a broader umbrella that includes PANDAS but does not mandate neurological signs; this distinction matters when considering cases with abrupt-onset OCD/tics but minimal or no adventitious movements [^0a741add] [^8c7f57e0].

> Next, I should review how PANDAS sits within PANS. PANS was introduced to encompass abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms triggered by diverse infectious and noninfectious causes, with GAS being just one potential trigger; thus, PANDAS is now considered a subset of PANS, and the PANS criteria require abrupt onset of OCD or severely restricted food intake plus at least two additional severe neuropsychiatric symptoms from defined categories, while excluding other known neurologic or medical explanations [^577667bb] [^8c7f57e0].

> I will now examine the evidentiary foundation and controversies. Large prospective and epidemiologic studies show mixed results: some find a small increase in tic/OCD exacerbations temporally linked to GAS, whereas others, including a blinded longitudinal cohort, find no excess temporal association in strictly defined PANDAS cases; a meta-analysis found no significant increase in GAS-linked exacerbations, and a Danish registry study found a modest association between strep and later OCD/tics but also a similar signal after nonstreptococcal infections, arguing against a unique streptococcal causality in most cases [^f363427d] [^f1ca2e3f] [^1987cc71] [^ad93d1ef].

> But wait, what if biomarkers could salvage diagnostic certainty? I should confirm the status of the Cunningham Panel and other antibody assays. Independent studies show poor sensitivity/specificity and low positive predictive value for the Cunningham Panel, with high positivity in healthy controls and poor test-retest reliability; thus, routine use for diagnosis is not recommended by pediatric expert panels, despite earlier claims of correlation with symptom change that have not been validated in prospective, blinded designs [^36835365] [^031301fa] [^344c1c51].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. The working model posits molecular mimicry with cross-reactive antibodies targeting basal ganglia antigens, and there is intriguing translational work showing PANDAS IgG binding to striatal cholinergic interneurons with functional effects in vitro; however, these findings remain hypothesis-generating rather than validated diagnostic markers, and inconsistent detection of anti-basal ganglia antibodies in clinical cohorts limits their diagnostic utility at present [^1fc6567d] [^2554e6c7] [^82dcf79e].

> I should double-check the practical diagnostic approach. Diagnosis remains clinical and exclusionary: confirm abrupt-onset OCD and/or tics, verify prepubertal onset for PANDAS, document a relapsing-remitting course, establish a temporal link to GAS when present, and look for neurological signs during flares; concurrently, rule out Sydenham chorea, autoimmune encephalitis, Tourette syndrome, systemic autoimmune disease, and other known causes, using targeted testing rather than broad panels, and reserve neuroimaging or CSF analysis for atypical features or red flags suggesting autoimmune encephalitis or alternative diagnoses [^46cadb9b] [^173ad4e9] [^6d872e82].

> Hold on, I should verify treatment implications so I don't overstate diagnostics. Even if PANDAS is suspected, first-line management of OCD/tics remains evidence-based psychiatric care (CBT, SSRIs when indicated), with antibiotics reserved for documented GAS infection and immunomodulatory therapies considered only in severe, refractory cases within specialty settings; tonsillectomy is not routinely recommended and should be individualized with shared decision-making given limited and low-quality evidence [^e38c764d] [^19cca33f] [^8f064301].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise: PANDAS is defined by five criteria — OCD and/or tics, prepubertal onset, abrupt/episodic course, temporal association with GAS, and neurological abnormalities during exacerbations — yet these criteria remain a research construct with ongoing controversy, and diagnosis should be cautious, differential, and anchored in clinical judgment rather than unvalidated biomarkers; PANS broadens the construct to include other triggers and is the preferred umbrella for many pediatric cases with abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms [^0a741add] [^577667bb] [^344c1c51].

PANDAS is diagnosed using the **five Swedo criteria** [^0a741add] [^73e6b513]: (1) presence of OCD and/or tics, (2) prepubertal onset (typically ages 3–12), (3) abrupt, episodic course with dramatic flares, (4) temporal association with GAS infection (documented by throat culture or rising ASO/anti-DNase B), and (5) neurological abnormalities during flares (choreiform movements, motor hyperactivity, or tics) [^7a6499ff]. Diagnosis is **clinical and exclusionary**, requiring careful differentiation from Sydenham chorea, Tourette syndrome, autoimmune encephalitis, and other medical or psychiatric causes [^46cadb9b] [^173ad4e9]. Routine labs (CBC, ESR/CRP, metabolic panel) are not recommended for diagnosis, and the Cunningham Panel is not validated for routine use [^344c1c51] [^36835365]. Management focuses on treating GAS when present, standard OCD/tic therapies, and selective immunomodulation only in severe, refractory cases [^e38c764d] [^19cca33f].

## Diagnostic criteria for PANDAS

The diagnostic criteria for PANDAS were established by Swedo et al. (1998) and include the following **five core criteria**:

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| 1. Presence of OCD and/or tic disorder | The child must have clinically significant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or a tic disorder, as defined by DSM criteria [^0a741add] [^73e6b513]. |
| 2. Prepubertal onset | Symptoms typically begin before puberty, usually between the ages of 3 and 12 years [^0a741add] [^73e6b513]. |
| 3. Abrupt onset and episodic course | The onset of symptoms is sudden and dramatic, with a relapsing-remitting course characterized by acute exacerbations followed by partial remissions [^0a741add] [^73e6b513]. |
| 4. Temporal association with GAS infection | There is a documented association between symptom onset or exacerbations and a Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection, confirmed by positive throat culture or rising titers of anti-streptococcal antibodies (ASO, anti-DNase B) [^0a741add] [^73e6b513]. |
| 5. Neurological abnormalities during exacerbations | During exacerbations, children exhibit neurological abnormalities such as choreiform movements, motor hyperactivity, or tics [^0a741add] [^73e6b513]. |

---

## Clinical features and symptoms

Children with PANDAS typically present with the following **clinical features**:

- **Sudden onset of OCD symptoms**: Intrusive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, and significant distress or impairment [^0a741add].
- **Tic disorders**: Motor and/or vocal tics, often appearing suddenly and intensifying during exacerbations [^0a741add].
- **Emotional lability**: Rapid mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation [^8c7f57e0].
- **Behavioral regression**: Return to earlier developmental behaviors, such as temper tantrums, clinginess, or loss of previously acquired skills [^8c7f57e0].
- **Neurological abnormalities**: Choreiform movements, motor hyperactivity, and coordination difficulties during exacerbations [^0a741add].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation and assessment

The diagnosis of PANDAS is primarily **clinical**, based on careful history, examination, and exclusion of alternative explanations. Recommended steps include:

- **Thorough clinical history**: Document the abrupt onset of OCD and/or tics, episodic course, and temporal association with GAS infections [^0a741add].
- **Physical and neurological examination**: Identify neurological abnormalities (choreiform movements, motor hyperactivity) during exacerbations [^0a741add].
- **Laboratory testing**: Confirm GAS infection with throat culture or rapid antigen detection test. Serologic testing (ASO, anti-DNase B) may support recent GAS exposure but is not diagnostic on its own [^a8f61dbb].
- **Exclusion of alternative diagnoses**: Rule out Sydenham chorea, Tourette syndrome, autoimmune encephalitis, and other medical or psychiatric conditions [^46cadb9b] [^173ad4e9].

---

## Differential diagnosis

PANDAS must be differentiated from several **conditions with similar presentations**:

- **Sydenham chorea**: A post-streptococcal autoimmune disorder characterized by choreiform movements, hypotonia, and psychiatric symptoms [^8cb203a0].
- **Tourette syndrome**: A chronic tic disorder with a gradual onset and persistent symptoms, not episodic or infection-triggered [^f8e16c32].
- **Autoimmune encephalitis**: An inflammatory brain disorder with acute neuropsychiatric symptoms, often requiring CSF analysis and neuroimaging for diagnosis [^173ad4e9].
- **Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS)**: A broader syndrome encompassing abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms triggered by various infectious or non-infectious causes, including but not limited to GAS infections [^577667bb].

---

## Controversies and challenges

The PANDAS diagnosis remains **controversial** due to several challenges:

- **Lack of definitive biomarkers**: No reliable biological markers or laboratory tests definitively confirm PANDAS [^344c1c51].
- **Overlap with other conditions**: Significant overlap with tic disorders, OCD, and other neuropsychiatric conditions complicates diagnosis [^f8e16c32].
- **Limited evidence base**: Few large-scale, controlled studies have validated the diagnostic criteria or established standardized treatment protocols [^1987cc71].
- **Controversial treatments**: The use of antibiotics, immunoglobulin therapy, and other immunomodulatory treatments remains debated, with limited evidence supporting their efficacy [^e795c25e].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **cautious, evidence-based approach**:

- **Treat documented GAS infections**: Use antibiotics to eradicate GAS when confirmed, but avoid routine antibiotic prophylaxis in the absence of active infection [^a8f61dbb].
- **Standard psychiatric care**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remain first-line treatments for OCD and anxiety symptoms [^e38c764d].
- **Selective immunomodulatory therapy**: Consider intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or other immunomodulatory treatments only in severe, refractory cases, and with careful monitoring [^e795c25e].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involve pediatricians, psychiatrists, neurologists, and immunologists in comprehensive evaluation and management [^e38c764d].

---

PANDAS is defined by abrupt-onset OCD and/or tics in prepubertal children, with an episodic course linked temporally to GAS infection and accompanied by neurological abnormalities during flares. Diagnosis is **clinical and exclusionary**, with no validated biomarkers, and management combines treating GAS when present, standard OCD/tic care, and selective immunomodulation for severe cases.

### The pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) etiology for tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: hypothesis or entity? Practical considerations for the clinician [^74d59574]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Clinicians have been faced with much publicity and contradictory scientific evidence regarding a recently described condition termed pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS). It has been proposed that children with PANDAS experience tics, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and perhaps other neuropsychiatric symptoms as an autoimmune response to streptococcal infection. We review current scientific information and conclude that PANDAS remains a yet-unproven hypothesis. Until more definitive scientific proof is forthcoming, there seems to be insufficient evidence to support 1) routine microbiologic or serologic testing for group A streptococcus in children who present with neuropsychiatric symptoms or 2) the clinical use of antibiotic or immune-modifying therapies in such patients. The optimum diagnostic and therapeutic approach awaits the results of additional research studies.

### The role of tonsillectomy in the treatment of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) [^f77911c0]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) in children describes neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations that relate temporally to streptococcal infections. Recent case reports suggest tonsillectomy may effectively reduce these symptoms; however, no consensus treatment guidelines exist. This study examines whether tonsillectomy improves neuropsychiatric symptoms in children with PANDAS who have incomplete response to antibiotic therapy.

Observations

Ten patients met strict diagnostic criteria for PANDAS. Comparisons were made between parental reports of symptom severity at diagnosis, after antibiotic treatment (in 10 patients), and after tonsillectomy (in 9). From a baseline severity score of 10, antibiotics alone improved symptoms to a median (interquartile range [IQR]) score of 8 (6.5–10.0) (P = 0.03). Nine children who subsequently underwent tonsillectomy reported symptom improvement in comparison with treatment with antibiotics alone, including those with no response to antibiotics. Symptom severity improved at all periods after tonsillectomy compared with antibiotics alone. The median score [IQR] 3 months postoperatively was 3 (0.0–6.5) (P = 0.01); 6 months postoperatively, 3 (0.0–5.0) (P = 0.02); 1 year postoperatively, 3 (0.0–5.0) (P = 0.02); and 3 years postoperatively, 0.5 (0.0–2.3) (P = 0.03). Four of the 9 had complete resolution after tonsillectomy.

Conclusions and Relevance

This PANDAS cohort whose neuropsychiatric symptoms did not respond sufficiently to antibiotics may have gained benefit from tonsillectomy.

### Randomized, controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections [^e795c25e]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) are hypothesized to occur as a result of cross-reactive antibodies produced in response to group A streptococcal infections. Previous research suggests that immunomodulatory therapies, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), may lead to rapid and sustained symptom improvement in patients with PANDAS.

Method

A total of 35 children meeting criteria for PANDAS and moderate to severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were enrolled in a randomized-entry, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week trial of IVIG (1 g/kg/day on 2 consecutive days), followed by optional open-label treatment for nonresponders, with follow-up at 12 and 24 weeks. Primary outcome measures were the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) rating. "Responders" were defined, a priori, by a ≥ 30% decrease in CY-BOCS total score, and a "much" or "very much" improved rating on CGI-I.

Results

During the double-blind phase, the mean decrease in CY-BOCS score was 24% ± 31% in the IVIG group (n = 17) and 12% ± 27% in the placebo group (n = 18), with six responders in the IVIG group (35%) versus four (22%) in the placebo group; these differences were not statistically significant. Twenty-four participants met criteria for nonresponse to double-blind infusion and received open-label IVIG at week 6. Among all participants, the mean CY-BOCS improvement from baseline was 55% ± 33% at week 12 and 62% ± 33% at week 24.

Conclusion

IVIG was safe and well tolerated. Between-group differences were smaller than anticipated, and the double-blind comparison failed to demonstrate superiority of IVIG over placebo. The observed open-label improvements indicate that future trials would benefit from larger sample sizes designed in part to aid in the identification of biomarkers predictive of a positive response to immunotherapy. Future investigations focused on the natural history of PANDAS are also warranted.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^577667bb]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) — the sudden onset of severe behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms in children requires guidance for accurate diagnosis and treatment, and clinicians need expert guidance about whether such symptoms indicate a diagnosis compatible with PANS. The cause of PANS is unknown, but it is theorized to be triggered, in some cases, by a recent infection and/or autoimmunity issues, and the condition is clinically challenging because it lacks disease-specific biomarkers, strong evidence for pathogenic causes, and consensus on treatment. The evidence base for PANS encompasses multiple subspecialties, including child and adolescent psychiatry, pediatric rheumatology, pediatric neurology, pediatric infectious diseases, pediatric immunology, and developmental-behavioral pediatrics. This clinical report focuses primarily on PANS as an umbrella condition that encompasses pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), and although PANDAS is, by definition, associated with streptococcal infection, it is now considered by many to represent a subset of the larger spectrum of infection-induced acute-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms. Developed after a comprehensive literature review, the findings are presented as a report rather than a clinical practice guideline and aim to provide guidance and advice for pediatric clinicians and families.

### Streptococcal infections and exacerbations in PANDAS: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1987cc71]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) hypothesis suggests an association between group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infections and subsequent onset or exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or tic disorders.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including longitudinal, prospective studies on exacerbations of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with GABHS infections in children with PANDAS. We searched PubMed and EMBASE through August 14, 2017. Two independent reviewers extracted data and we used random-effects analysis to calculate rate ratios (RR).

Results

Three studies were included with a total of 82 PANDAS cases and 127 control children with obsessive-compulsive disorder or chronic tic disorder. PANDAS cases had a nonsignificantly increased RR of 2.33 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63–8.70, P = 0.21, I = 28.3%] for exacerbations of neuropsychiatric symptoms in temporal proximity to a GABHS infection and no increased risk of GABHS infections (RR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.56–1.73, P = 0.97, I = 45%) compared with the control children. However, PANDAS cases had an increased risk of neuropsychiatric exacerbations in general with a RR of 1.54 (95% CI: 1.12–2.11, P = 0.008, I = 0%) compared with the control children. The studies had methodologic heterogeneity, high risk of selection bias and differed concerning case definition and infection measures.

Conclusions

Our findings did not show significant evidence concerning higher rates of temporally associated GABHS infections and exacerbations of neuropsychiatric symptoms in children with PANDAS. The included studies were small and limited by low GABHS rates and exacerbations. Future studies with large population sizes and routine evaluations are needed to thoroughly examine the PANDAS hypothesis.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome [^54fc2980]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Whether some instances of obsessive-compulsive disorder are secondary to infectious and/or autoimmune processes is still under scientific debate. The nosology has undergone an iterative process of criteria and acronyms from PITANDS to PANDAS to PANS (or CANS for neurology). This review focuses on the clinical presentation, assessment, proposed pathophysiology, and treatment of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus (PANDAS), and the newest iteration, pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). Children who have these symptoms, which have become known as PANS, have been described by their parents as "changed children".

### Streptococcal infections of skin and PANDAS [^2f3b9b68]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcal infections are associated with a variety of infections and a subset of obsessive-compulsive disorder and/or tic disorders. Screening of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and tics in patient with streptococcal infection of skin must be effective in identifying subjects who met published criteria for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).

### Clinical factors associated with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections [^912f9150]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore associated clinical factors in children with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).

Study Design

Children with tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or both (n = 109) were examined with personal and family history, diagnostic interview, physical examination, medical record review, and measurement of baseline levels of streptococcal antibodies.

Results

Significant group differences were found on several variables, such that children in whom PANDAS (versus without PANDAS) were more likely to have had dramatic onset, definite remissions, remission of neuropsychiatric symptoms during antibiotic therapy, a history of tonsillectomies/adenoidectomies, evidence of group A streptococcal infection, and clumsiness.

Conclusion

The identification of clinical features associated with PANDAS should assist in delineating risks for this subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder/tics.

### Autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection: sydenham chorea, PANDAS, and PANDAS variants [^d7342c8f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Streptococcal infection in children is usually benign and self-limited. In a small percentage of children, prominent neurologic and/or psychiatric sequelae can occur. Sydenham chorea is the best defined and best recognized. PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection) is a well-defined syndrome in which tics (motor and/or vocal) and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder consistently exacerbate in temporal correlation to a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. PANDAS constitutes a subset of children with tics, Tourette syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In addition to strictly defined PANDAS, we and others have recognized several PANDAS variants, including adult-onset variant, a dystonic variant, a myoclonic variant, and a "chronic" PANDAS variant. The nosology and classification of these entities are rapidly evolving. The recognition that some pediatric neurobehavioral syndromes have infectious and/or immunologic triggers points to important new avenues of disease treatment. In this review, we summarize this complex and rapidly evolving area of clinical research.

### Association of streptococcal throat infection with mental disorders: testing key aspects of the PANDAS hypothesis in a nationwide study [^ad93d1ef]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Streptococcal infection has been linked with the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders, a concept termed pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS). However, previous studies of this association have been small, and the results have been conflicting.

Objective

To investigate the risk of mental disorders, specifically OCD and tic disorders, after a streptococcal throat infection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A population-based cohort study was conducted using data from the nationwide Danish registers from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2013, with up to 17 years of follow-up. The Danish National Health Service Register provided information on individuals with the registration of a streptococcal test. Data analysis was conducted from January 1, 2016, to February 28, 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Individuals were followed up in the nationwide Psychiatric Central Register for a diagnosis of any mental disorder, OCD, or tic disorders. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by Poisson regression analysis.

Results

Of the 1 067 743 children (< 18 years of age) included in the study (519 821 girls and 547 922 boys), 638 265 received a streptococcal test, 349 982 of whom had positive test results at least once. Individuals with a positive streptococcal test result had an increased risk of any mental disorder (n = 15 408; IRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15–1.21; P < .001), particularly of OCD (n = 556; IRR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.28–1.77; P < .001) and tic disorders (n = 993; IRR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.21–1.50; P < .001), compared with individuals without a streptococcal test. Furthermore, the risk of any mental disorder and OCD was more elevated after a streptococcal throat infection than after a nonstreptococcal infection. Nonetheless, individuals with a nonstreptococcal throat infection also had an increased risk of any mental disorder (n = 11 315; IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06–1.11; P < .001), OCD (n = 316; IRR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.07–1.53; P = 0.006), and tic disorders (n = 662; IRR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.12–1.41; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

This large-scale study investigating key aspects of the PANDAS hypothesis found that individuals with a streptococcal throat infection had elevated risks of mental disorders, particularly OCD and tic disorders. However, nonstreptococcal throat infection was also associated with increased risks, although less than streptococcal infections for OCD and any mental disorder, which could also support important elements of the diagnostic concept of pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome.

### PANS and PANDAS-symptoms beyond OCD and tics-a systematic review [^18613ae5]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This article aims to describe the symptomatology of Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS) and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS), and to highlight some of their potential distinctive features, by juxtaposing available data with existing literature on pediatric obsessive - compulsive disorder (OCD). Given the scarcity of high-quality studies, we decided to review a wide range of publications on the clinical presentation of PANS and PANDAS, including case series and case reports, regardless of their methodological heterogeneity. Although PANS and PANDAS share many characteristics with non-PANS/PANDAS OCD, the acute onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in conjunction with concomitant features, especially separation anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, or dysgraphia should prompt consideration of a possible post-infectious etiology. Further research aimed at creating more precise diagnostic tools is needed to facilitate differential diagnosis.

### Evaluation of autoimmune phenomena in patients with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) [^c78924a4]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) are basically characterized by obsessive-compulsive symptoms and/or tics triggered by group-A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus infections. Poor data are available about the clear definition of PANDAS's autoimmune origin. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of autoimmune phenomena, including thyroid function abnormalities, specific celiac disease antibodies, and positivity of organ- or nonorgan-specific autoantibodies in a large cohort of Caucasian children and adolescents with PANDAS. Seventy-seven consecutive patients (59 males, 18 females; mean age 6.3 ± 2.5 years, range 2.0–14.5 years) strictly fulfilling the clinical criteria for PANDAS diagnosis were recruited. In all subjects we evaluated serum concentrations of free-T3, free-T4, thyrotropin, and the following auto-antibodies: anti-thyroperoxidase, anti-thyroglobulin, anti-thyrotropin receptor, anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium, anti-tissue transglutaminase, anti-nuclear, anti-smooth muscle, anti-extractable nuclear antigens, anti-phospholipid, plus lupus-like anticoagulant. The results were compared with those obtained from 197 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (130 males, 67 females; mean age 6.8 ± 2.9 years, range 2.3–14.8 years). The frequencies of subclinical (3.8% vs 3.6%) and overt hypothyroidism (1.2% vs 0%), autoimmune thyroiditis (2.46% vs 1.14%), celiac disease (1.2% vs 0.05%), and positivity of organ- and nonorgan-specific autoantibodies (5.1% vs 4.8%) were not statistically significant between patients with PANDAS and controls. Evaluating the overall disease duration, we did not observe any significant difference between patients with (3.4 ± 2.15 years) and without (3.4 ± 2.89 years) autoimmune abnormalities. However, PANDAS patients with autoimmune diseases or positivity for any organ- and nonorgan-specific antibodies showed significantly higher anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNAse B titers, as well as a history of more frequent throat infections than controls (p < 0.0001). Abnormalities of thyroid function and thyroid autoimmune diseases, as well as the association with celiac disease or organ- and nonorgan-specific autoimmunity seem not more frequent in children and adolescents with PANDAS than in healthy controls. A potential relationship between autoimmunity and PANDAS should be assessed further in larger studies. Children and adolescents with PANDAS should not be actually screened for thyroid function, celiac disease and/or autoimmune diseases.

### PANDAS: current status and directions for research [^0a741add]. Molecular Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The recognition of the five criteria for PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) by Swedo et al established a homogenous subgroup of children with childhood onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tic disorders. The five clinical characteristics that define the PANDAS subgroup are the presence of OCD and/or tic disorder, prepubertal age of onset, abrupt onset and relapsing-remitting symptom course, association with neurological abnormalities during exacerbations (adventitious movements or motoric hyperactivity), and a temporal association between symptom exacerbations and a Group-A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection. These five criteria have been used for the purpose of systematic research on the phenomenology and unique therapies for the PANDAS subgroup as well as studies of the pathophysiology of post-streptococcal OCD and tic disorders. The etiology of OCD and tics in the PANDAS subgroup is unknown, but is theorized to occur as a result of post-streptococcal autoimmunity in a manner similar to that of Sydenham's chorea. The working hypothesis for the pathophysiology begins with a GAS infection in a susceptible host that incites the production of antibodies to GAS that crossreact with the cellular components of the basal ganglia, particularly in the caudate nucleus and putamen. The obsessions, compulsions, tics, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in these children are postulated to arise from an interaction of these antibodies with neurons of the basal ganglia.

### Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders and streptococcal infections: role of otolaryngologist [^408a45b3]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To increase awareness and understanding of the putative role of streptococcal infection in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders in children and to discuss therapeutic options in this group of patients.

Methods

Case illustration and literature review.

Results

Two siblings, one with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and one with a tic disorder, had tonsillectomy for recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis. At the latest follow-up visit (11 mo postoperatively), both patients exhibited significant improvement in their psychiatric illnesses. We discuss these cases as well as the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).

Conclusion

PANDAS is an active area of research investigating the relationship between streptococcal infections and the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder or tic disorders (or both) in children. The etiopathogenesis of PANDAS is thought to reflect autoimmune mechanisms and involvement of the basal ganglia of susceptible hosts. Because otolaryngologists evaluate a large portion of pediatric patients with recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, it is important to be aware of this association and to manage these patients appropriately.

### Clinical approach to the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis in the pediatric patient [^6d872e82]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Other diagnoses within the differential are PANS and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS). These conditions describe an idiopathic or postinfectious onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating restriction, other emotional syndromes, tics, loss of skills, or personality change. Both clinical phenotypes lack robust biomarkers, and pathogenesis remains disputed; however, there is some evidence of immune mediation and immunotherapy responsiveness. Although patients may appear to have an acquired brain syndrome, most children with PANDAS or PANS would not fulfill the proposed pediatric AE criteria.

Also, monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes may involve the brain, such as the genetic interferonopathies, vasculopathies, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. These disorders typically present in early childhood, result in chronic progressive disease, often involving increasing spasticity, intracranial calcifications and microcephaly, and are associated with persistent CSF immune activation. These syndromes are distinguished from AE by the presence of non-neurologic features, such as skin lesions, cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, and lung disease.

Finally, neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in pediatric AE and are also the hallmark of primary psychiatric disorders. Delusions, hallucinations, reduced speech, sleep disturbance, and cognitive difficulties may be seen in both disease groups. Features that distinguish patients with AE from those with psychiatric disease include autonomic instability, hyperkinesia, dyskinesia, rapid progression of psychosis despite therapy, seizures, slowing or epileptic activity on EEG, CSF pleocytosis, CSF oligoclonal bands, and MRI abnormalities.

### PANDAS anorexia nervosa – endangered, extinct or nonexistent? [^a237b1b8]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Substantial evidence exists for the concept of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptoccoccal infection (PANDAS) such as some cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder and tics/Tourette's syndrome. More recently PANDAS-AN has been described. The aim of this article is to provide a critical review of this concept.

Method

The literature was searched using Medline, Psychinfo, and Google.

Results

There is some evidence for the entity of PANDAS-AN but this is considerably limited by a wide range of methodological problems, including the seemingly low prevalence, the lack of clarity in diagnostic criteria, and the lack of specificity in the diagnostic tests. Innovative treatment approaches hold promise but require further evaluation.

Conclusion

Further research into PANDAS-AN, using more clearly defined and consistent diagnostic criteria is needed, given the potential for enhancing the understanding of the pathogenesis of AN and for more effective treatments.

### Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections-anesthetic implications and literature review [^2520a5cb]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) are rare neurobehavioral disorders in children. Affected children may have a diverse array of perioperative manifestations including compulsive behavior, agitation, and abnormal movements. Perioperative management might be more challenging for anesthesiologists. Series of therapeutic plasmapheresis in these children may complicate their anesthesia management. We describe the first case of a patient with PANDAS and its anesthesia implications.

### Development of autoimmune diseases among children with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome [^ae0cb172]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is characterized by abrupt-onset obsessive-compulsive symptoms plus other abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms (sleep disruption, urinary changes, cognitive function loss, behavior deterioration, emotional lability, and irritability) causing significant patient, family, or caregiver distress. Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome follows a relapsing-remitting course of flares (abrupt psychiatric symptom deteriorations) between periods of relative symptom quiescence. Classification of a pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) requires a temporal association with group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. The more general term, PANS, describes similar symptoms as PANDAS but is agnostic to the preceding infection(eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1). Provisional management recommendations for PANS include (1) clearing an infection if present, (2) anti-inflammatory treatments, and (3) standard psychiatric care. Anti-inflammatory treatments include intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but randomized placebo-controlled trials are lacking.,

Emerging evidence shows a role for adaptive and innate immune systems in PANS and PANDAS, likely involving basal ganglia inflammation. Imaging demonstrates basal ganglia swelling in the acute stage, microglia activation, and microstructural changes. Xu and colleaguesidentified autoantibodies targeting and altering cholinergic interneuron function in the basal ganglia. Patients with PANS or PANDAS have movements during rapid eye movement sleep — a factor associated with other basal ganglia disorders, including Parkinson disease. Chain and colleaguesfound subsets of autoantibodies distinguishing patients with PANDAS from controls. Animal models of PANDAS demonstrate an adaptive immune response, involving autoantibodies and Th17 cells, leading to central nervous system pathologic findings, including neurovascular damage affecting the basal ganglia. Rahman and colleaguesreported that proinflammatory monocytes were more elevated during flare periods vs recovery periods; both periods had higher levels than controls. Approximately one-third of patients with PANS undergoing lumbar puncture have elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein and/or elevated levels of the albumin quotient, which may be a nonspecific marker of neuroinflammation. These findings support an inflammatory diathesis in an immunogenetically susceptible host.

### Maternal history of autoimmune disease in children presenting with tics and / or obsessive-compulsive disorder [^b87e754e]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

A commonality across a number of pediatric neuropsychiatric disorders is a higher than typical rate of familial - and especially maternal - autoimmune disease. Of recent interest, a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders known collectively as Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus (PANDAS) is believed to be secondary to central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity that occurs in relation to group A streptococcal infection. Thus, we hypothesized that a sample of children with OCD and/or tics would have an increased maternal risk for an autoimmune response relative to population norms. We also expected maternal prevalence of various autoimmune diseases to be higher among those participants that met the putative criteria for PANDAS.

Methods

We examined, via structured interview, the medical history of the biological mothers of 107 children with OCD and/or tics.

Results

Autoimmune disorders were reported in 17.8% of study mothers, which is significantly greater than the general prevalence among women in the United States (approximately 5%). Further, study mothers were more likely to report having an autoimmune disease if their children were considered "likely PANDAS" cases versus "unlikely PANDAS" cases.

Conclusions

The results offer preliminary support for hypothesized links between maternal autoimmune disease and both OCD/tics and PANDAS in youth. Further research is necessary to clarify these general associations; links to specific autoimmune disease; and relevance of autoimmune disease in other family members (e.g., fathers).

### Immunological causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: is it time for the concept of an "autoimmune OCD" subtype? [^5bdf499c]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly disabling mental illness that can be divided into frequent primary and rarer organic secondary forms. Its association with secondary autoimmune triggers was introduced through the discovery of Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal infection (PANDAS) and Pediatric Acute onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS). Autoimmune encephalitis and systemic autoimmune diseases or other autoimmune brain diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, have also been reported to sometimes present with obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS). Subgroups of patients with OCD show elevated proinflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies against targets that include the basal ganglia. In this conceptual review paper, the clinical manifestations, pathophysiological considerations, diagnostic investigations, and treatment approaches of immune-related secondary OCD are summarized. The novel concept of "autoimmune OCD" is proposed for a small subgroup of OCD patients, and clinical signs based on the PANDAS/PANS criteria and from recent experience with autoimmune encephalitis and autoimmune psychosis are suggested. Red flag signs for "autoimmune OCD" could include (sub)acute onset, unusual age of onset, atypical presentation of OCS with neuropsychiatric features (e.g., disproportionate cognitive deficits) or accompanying neurological symptoms (e.g., movement disorders), autonomic dysfunction, treatment resistance, associations of symptom onset with infections such as group A streptococcus, comorbid autoimmune diseases or malignancies. Clinical investigations may also reveal alterations such as increased levels of anti-basal ganglia or dopamine receptor antibodies or inflammatory changes in the basal ganglia in neuroimaging. Based on these red flag signs, the criteria for a possible, probable, and definite autoimmune OCD subtype are proposed.

### Evaluation of the cunningham panel ™ in pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) and pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): changes in antineuronal antibody titers parallel changes in patient symptoms [^95ea218e]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This retrospective study examined whether changes in patient pre- and post-treatment symptoms correlated with changes in anti-neuronal autoantibody titers and the neuronal cell stimulation assay in the Cunningham Panel in patients with Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal Infection (PANDAS), and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS).

Methods

In an analysis of all tests consecutively performed in Moleculera Labs' clinical laboratory from April 22, 2013 to December 31, 2016, we identified 206 patients who were prescribed at least one panel prior to and following treatment, and who met the PANDAS/PANS diagnostic criteria. Patient follow-up was performed to collect symptoms and treatment or medical intervention. Of the 206 patients, 58 met the inclusion criteria of providing informed consent/assent and documented pre- and post-treatment symptoms. Clinician and parent-reported symptoms after treatment or medical intervention were categorized as "Improved/Resolved" (n = 34) or "Not-Improved/Worsened" (n = 24). These were analyzed for any association between changes in clinical status and changes in Cunningham panel test results. Clinical assay performance was also evaluated for reproducibility and reliability.

Results

Comparison of pre- and post-treatment status revealed that the Cunningham Panel results correlated with changes in patient's neuropsychiatric symptoms. Based upon the change in the number of positive tests, the overall accuracy was 86%, the sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 83% respectively, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 93.4%. When evaluated by changes in autoantibody levels, we observed an overall accuracy of 90%, a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 92% and an AUC of 95.7%. Assay reproducibility for the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.90 (p < 1.67 × 10–6) and the ELISA assays demonstrated test-retest reproducibility comparable with other ELISA assays.

Conclusion

This study revealed a strong positive association between changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms and changes in the level of anti-neuronal antibodies and antibody-mediated CaMKII human neuronal cell activation. These results suggest there may be clinical utility in monitoring autoantibody levels and stimulatory activity against these five neuronal antigen targets as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of infection-triggered autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders. Future prospective studies should examine the feasibility of predicting antimicrobial and immunotherapy responses with the Cunningham Panel.

### Streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections and exacerbations of tic and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: a prospective longitudinal study [^f1ca2e3f]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this blinded, prospective, longitudinal study was to determine whether new group A β hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections are temporally associated with exacerbations of tic or obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in children who met published criteria for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS). A group of children with Tourette syndrome and/or OC disorder without a PANDAS history served as the comparison (non-PANDAS) group.

Method

Consecutive clinical ratings of tic and OC symptom severity were obtained for 31 PANDAS subjects and 53 non-PANDAS subjects. Clinical symptoms and laboratory values (throat cultures and streptococcal antibody titers) were evaluated at regular intervals during a 25-month period. Additional testing occurred at the time of any tic or OC symptom exacerbation. New GABHS infections were established by throat swab cultures and/or recent significant rise in streptococcal antibodies. Laboratory personnel were blinded to case or control status, clinical (exacerbation or not) condition, and clinical evaluators were blinded to the laboratory results.

Results

No group differences were observed in the number of clinical exacerbations or the number of newly diagnosed GABHS infections. On only six occasions of a total of 51 (12%), a newly diagnosed GABHS infection was followed, within 2 months, by an exacerbation of tic and/or OC symptoms. In every instance, this association occurred in the non-PANDAS group.

Conclusions

This study provides no evidence for a temporal association between GABHS infections and tic/OC symptom exacerbations in children who meet the published PANDAS diagnostic criteria.

### Immunological causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: is it time for the concept of an "autoimmune OCD" subtype? [^7a6499ff]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation of patients with possible immune-related OCD

Diagnostic criteria of PANDAS

The PANDAS consensus criteria were developed by Swedo and colleagues and describe a neuropsychiatric syndrome with the presence of OCD or tic disorder and a temporal association of symptom onset with group A streptococcal infection. Up to now, reports of similar cases in adulthood are rare. PANDAS can be diagnosed with all of the following symptoms (1–5) present:
Presence of OCD or a tic disorder,
Prepubertal symptom onset,
Acute symptom onset and episodic (relapsing-remitting) course,
Temporal association between Group A streptococcal infection and symptom onset/exacerbations,
Association with neurological signs (motor hyperactivity or choreiform movements;).

Diagnostic criteria of PANS

The PANS criteria were developed at the 2013 PANS Consensus Conference. They represent an extension of the PANDAS criteria. PANS can also be diagnosed in the presence of other neurotropic pathogens besides streptococci or in the context of other autoimmune diseases and without the presence of neurological symptoms. The following criteria (1–3) must be met:
Abrupt, dramatic onset of OCD or severely restricted food intake.
Concurrent presence of additional neuropsychiatric symptoms (with similarly severe and acute onset), from at least two of the following seven categories:

○ Anxiety,
○ Emotional lability and/or depression,
○ Irritability, aggression, and/or severely oppositional behaviors,
○ Behavioral (developmental) regression,
○ Deterioration in school performance (related to attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder-like symptoms, memory deficits, cognitive changes),
○ Sensory or motor signs,
○ Somatic alterations and symptoms, including sleep disturbances, enuresis, or in urinary frequency.

3 Symptoms are not better explained by a known neurologic or medical disorder, such as Sydenham chorea, systemic lupus erythematosus, Tourette disorder or others.

The PANS criteria are quite broad and, thus, "non-specific." The rationale for omitting tics from the PANS criteria and adding eating disorders with severely restricted food intake (compared with the PANDAS criteria) contributes to the broadening of the concept. Thus, PANS criteria can only give indications of a possible autoimmune OCD syndrome, but can by no means prove it. Further research is required to establish the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria vis-à-vis an immunotherapy-responsive OCD syndrome, although notable trials of immunotherapy in this group have been negative or inconclusive (summarized in), potentially suggesting a need for modification of the criteria.

### Neuroinflammation in obsessive-compulsive disorder: sydenham chorea, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections, and pediatric acute onset neuropsychiatric syndrome [^2e6204ed]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Sydenham chorea (SC), pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) and pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) are postinfectious neuroinflammatory diseases that involve the basal ganglia and have obsessive-compulsive disorder as a major manifestation. As is true for many childhood rheumatological diseases and neuroinflammatory diseases, SC, PANDAS and PANS lack clinically available, rigorous diagnostic biomarkers and randomized clinical trials. Research on the treatment of these disorders depend on three complementary modes of intervention including: treating the symptoms, treating the source of inflammation, and treating disturbances of the immune system. Future studies should aim to integrate neuroimaging, inflammation, immunogenetic, and clinical data (noting the stage in the clinical course) to increase our understanding and treatment of SC, PANDAS, PANS, and all other postinfectious/immune-mediated behavioral disorders.

### Development of autoimmune diseases among children with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome [^d90a926a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Most of the patients had an overlapping or interconnected subgroup of diagnoses (ERA, PsA, and SpA), which is distinctly different when compared with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of juvenile arthritis. This subgroup is overrepresented, while other subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are not represented (oligoarticular-extended arthritis, rheumatoid factor–negative or rheumatoid factor–positive polyarticular arthritis, systemic arthritis), suggesting a pathophysiological link between this subgroup and PANS.

Enthesitis-related arthritis is part of ILAR classification criteria for JIA and not applied to adults. However, ERA is thought to be a forme fruste of PsA and SpA. To our knowledge, there are not yet validated criteria for juvenile SpA, and many pediatric patients with inflammatory back pain are classified as having ERA given that they do not meet ASAS criteria for SpA (because criteria were developed using primarily adult data). Both PsA and SpA are insidious in their presentation, and separating the ERA and SpA diagnoses is an artificial construct in youth; hence, we applied the ERA classification criteria despite the patients being 16 years of age or older.

IL-17 has been implicated in (1) animal models of PANDAS, (2) subtypes of arthritis in our PANS or PANDAS cohort, (3) pediatric OCD, and (4) psoriasis. In murine models, repeated GAS infection has been shown to induce a robust Th17 response in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue. This model showed that GAS exposure promoted migration and persistence of GAS-specific Th17 cells to the brain, leading to neurovascular dysfunction. Moreover, GAS-specific Th17 cells are found in the tonsils of patients exposed to GAS. Interleukin-17 is likely a factor associated with the 3 overlapping arthritis types that we see in our cohort, and has also been reported to be present in high levels in pediatric patients with OCD. Similar to the PANDAS mouse model, repeated GAS infections may also play a role in psoriasis, thus making the nail pitting finding in our cohort relevant because this is a common finding in psoriasis.

### Association of pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with microstructural differences in brain regions detected via diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging [^af2f8edb]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The diagnostic considerations of childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have evolved substantially since the late 1980s. Early prospective studies, of children with OCD revealed that a subgroup experienced an unusually abrupt onset (< 48 hours) and a relapsing-remitting course of neuropsychiatric symptoms, notably after streptococcal pharyngitis. In parallel, research on Sydenham chorea, a neurological sequela of group A streptococcal infection, found that 50% to 70% of affected children experienced obsessions and compulsions before, during, or after onset of chorea. These findings led to the hypothesis that Sydenham chorea might share a common pathophysiology with acute-onset OCD even when chorea is absent, thus forming the basis of a new diagnostic entity, namely, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).

The new PANDAS classification was subsequently met with skepticism. Concerns were raised in particular about the lack of clear distinction between PANDAS and other neuropsychiatric diagnoses, as well as the strength of the association between OCD and group A streptococcal infection. To address these issues, a group of clinicians and scientists convened in 2010 to discuss all possible cases of acute-onset OCD regardless of cause. Participants unanimously agreed that acute onset was the key distinguishing clinical feature and proposed the more inclusive term of pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). Since the development of this diagnostic entity, a number of clinics and research programs have further characterized the many comorbid symptoms that can suddenly start along with OCD, including sleep disturbances, emotional dysregulation, eating restriction, pain and sensory disturbances, urinary symptoms (enuresis and polyuria), cognitive and behavior regression, anxiety, transient psychotic symptoms, oppositionality, impulsivity, irritability and rage.

### Antibodies in the diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of psychotic disorders [^86600730]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Other diagnoses of organic psychosis that can be aided by a positive antibody test are most often made in the context of a systemic or CNS disease that can present with psychosis. Examples include SLE, the antiphospholipid syndrome, vasculitis, or neurosyphilis. In these cases, the diagnostic antibody is not usually specific to a psychotic presentation but to the disease more generally. One possible exception is psychosis associated with SLE (or "lupus psychosis"), which may be specifically associated with antibodies to the NR2 subunit of the NMDAR (and shown to cross-react with dsDNA) or with ribosomal P antibodies.

Perhaps surprisingly, antibody-based diagnostics in psychiatry have probably impacted clinical practice most within the pediatric sphere. Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is a (somewhat contentious) clinical diagnosis defined by the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms or eating restrictions in combination with a number of other possible comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, and is strongly associated with infection with group A streptococcus and other pathogens. Particularly relevant to this review, about a quarter of patients also present with psychotic symptoms, although these do not form part of the diagnostic criteria.PANS, along with a related syndrome, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), have been variously associated with (putatively causal) antibodies targeting the basal ganglia, the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, enolase, beta-tubulin, and lysoganglioside-GM1 (lyso-GM1). The sensitivity and specificity of various antibody-based diagnostics for these disorders is however variable, with a recent study demonstrating that a popular commercially available panel of antibodies (the Cunningham panel) had relatively poor performance in identifying children with clinically defined PANS/PANDAS, with positive results among healthy controls and poor test-retest reliability.

We suggest that a "bottom-up," single-platform multi-specificity detection approach may show promise in identifying diagnostic biomarkers for psychotic disorders, although to what extent this is possible is of course likely to be dependent on the extent to which the psychotic disorder group is aetiologically heterogenous. By identifying the panel of antibodies that most discriminate patients with psychotic disorder from matched healthy or psychiatric controls, it is possible that truly diagnostic biomarker identification can be facilitated.

### The burden of caring for a child or adolescent with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): an observational longitudinal study [^80b9db44]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the longitudinal association between disease severity, time established in clinical treatment, and caregiver burden in a community-based patient population diagnosed with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS).

Methods

The study included an observational longitudinal cohort design, with Caregiver Burden Inventories (CBIs) collected between April 2013 and November 2016 at the Stanford PANS multidisciplinary clinic. Inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: pediatric patients meeting strict PANS/pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) diagnostic criteria (n = 187), having a caregiver fill out at least 1 complete CBI during a disease flare (n = 114); and having family who lives locally (n = 97). For longitudinal analyses, only patients whose caregiver had filled out 2 or more CBIs (n = 94 with 892 CBIs) were included. In the study sample, most primary caregivers were mothers (69 [71.1%] of 97), the majority of PANS patients were male (58 [59.8%] of 97), and mean age at PANS onset was 8.8 years.

Results

In a patient's first flare tracked by the clinic, 50% of caregivers exceeded the caregiver burden score threshold used to determine respite need in care receiver adult populations. Longitudinally, flares, compared with quiescence, predicted increases in mean CBI score (6.6 points; 95% CI, 5.1 to 8.0). Each year established in clinic predicted decreased CBI score (-3.5 points per year; 95% CI, -2.3 to -4.6). Also, shorter time between PANS onset and entry into the multidisciplinary clinic predicted greater improvement in mean CBI score over time (0.7 points per year squared; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.3). Time between PANS onset and treatment with antibiotics or immunomodulation did not moderate the relationship between CBI score and time in clinic.

Conclusions

PANS caregivers suffer high caregiver burden. Neuropsychiatric disease severity predicts increased caregiver burden. Caregiver burden tends to decrease over time in a group of patients undergoing clinical treatment at a specialty PANS clinic. This decrease could be independent of clinical treatment.

### Pediatric early-onset neuropsychiatric obsessive compulsive disorders [^6b70ed8c]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

At the time of this writing, most pediatricians or child psychiatrists will probably have treated a child with early acute-onset obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) behaviors due to the pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, abbreviated PANDAS, described more than two decades ago; or Tourette syndrome, incorporating motor and vocal tics, described more than a century ago. One typically self-limited post-infectious OCD resulting from exposure to other putative microbial disease triggers defines PANS, abbreviating pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndrome. Tourette syndrome, PANDAS and PANS share overlapping neuroimaging features of hypometabolism of the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus on brain 18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography fused to magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) consistent with involvement of common central nervous system (CNS) pathways for the shared clinical expression of OCD. The field of pediatric neuropsychiatric disorders manifesting OCD behaviors is at a crossroads commensurate with recent advances in the neurobiology of the medial temporal area, with its wide-ranging connectivity and cortical cross-talk, and CNS immune responsiveness through resident microglia. This review advances the field of pediatric neuropsychiatric disorders and in particular PANS, by providing insights through clinical vignettes and descriptive clinical and neuroimaging correlations from the author's file. Neuroscience collaborations with child psychiatry and infectious disease practitioners are needed to design clinical trials with the necessary rigor to provide meaningful insights into the rational clinical management of PANS with the aim of developing evidence-based guidelines for the clinical management of early, abrupt-onset childhood OCD to avert potentially life-long neuropsychological struggles.

### Neurological soft signs at presentation in patients with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome [^d81052cb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) are abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric disorders thought to be triggered by infection. Basal ganglia inflammation may be an important mechanism in these disorders, based on imaging studies demonstrating basal ganglia swelling in the acute stage, microglia activation in the caudate and putamen, and microstructural changes that are most prominent in the basal ganglia. Sleep studies in this patient population indicating movements during rapid eye movement sleep, implicate basal ganglia pathologic characteristics. Parkinson disease is a basal ganglia disorder in which movements in rapid eye movement sleep, and the glabellar reflexcan predate clinical onset of Parkinson disease. These findings have also been shown in PANS, suggesting PANS is a basal ganglia disorder.

Autoantibodies targeting cholinergic interneurons in the basal ganglia have been identifiedthat could cause imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the basal ganglia and may contribute to the cardinal symptoms of PANS. Animal models of PANDAS demonstrate an adaptive immune response involving autoantibodies and T H 17 cells, leading to central nervous system pathologic characteristics, including neurovascular injury, blood-brain barrier disruption, activation of microglia, and loss of excitatory synaptic proteins.

PANS classification criteria require abrupt onset or abrupt recurrence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and/or eating restrictions with 2 or more additional new and abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms, which commonly include emotional lability, irritability, aggression, severely oppositional behaviors, behavioral regression and/or behavior outbursts, deterioration in school performance, sensory amplification, motor abnormalities, sleep disturbances, and urinary issues.

Although "hard" neurological examination findings of basal ganglia dysfunction, such as chorea or dystonia, suggest a condition other than PANS, neurological soft signs (NSSs), such as voluntary movement overflow, have been described in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), autism, and Sydenham chorea, and may also indicate basal ganglia dysfunction. The prevalence of these findings in PANS is not known.

The goal of this study was to characterize the prevalence of NSSs that may be associated with basal ganglia dysfunction and examine the association between the number of NSSs and the impairment levels at clinical presentation of PANS. We hypothesized a high prevalence of NSSs among patients with PANS and that patients with more NSSs would exhibit more severe disease states.

### Obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents [^491fed9b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

There has been emerging clinical evidence over the past 10–15 years of a subgroup of children who experience sudden onset OCD and/or tics after streptococcal infection. This group of children was originally given the acronym PANDAS (paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus), but more recently the term PANS (paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome) has been used in preference, as it is felt to capture both the sudden onset and the uncertainty about aetiology. These children tend to have more widespread neuropsychiatric difficulties than other children with OCD, including enuresis, deterioration in handwriting and impulsivity. The exact mechanism of sudden onset neuropsychiatric disorder is unknown, but there has been interest in delivering therapies that target immune and infectious causes. However, other small studies suggest that OCD in this population responds as well to standard treatments, and effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics has been inconsistent.

### Biomarkers for diagnosis of pediatric acute neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS)-sensitivity and specificity of the cunningham panel [^36835365]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Pediatric Acute Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) are conditions marked by sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), tics, or avoidant/restrictive food intake in combination with multiple psychiatric symptoms. A diagnosis of PANS or PANDAS may be supported by the Cunningham Panel, a commercially available set of immunologic assays currently in clinical use. However, the relationship between Cunningham Panel results and patient symptoms remains unclear. This study was done to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the Cunningham Panel in patients with suspected PANS or PANDAS.

Method

All Swedish patients who had taken the Cunningham Panel prior to June 2014 (n = 154) were invited and 53 patients participated in the study. Based on comprehensive psychiatric assessment (the reference standard of diagnosis), subjects were classified as PANS, PANDAS, or neither. Prior Cunningham Panel test results were collected from patient records, and new blood samples were similarly analyzed within the scope of this study. In addition, results were compared to healthy controls (n = 21) and a test-retest reliability analysis was performed.

Results

Sensitivities of individual biomarkers in the Cunningham Panel ranged from 15 to 60%, and specificities from 28 to 92%. Positive predictive values ranged from 17 to 40%, and negative predictive values from 44 to 74%. A majority of the healthy controls had pathological Cunningham Panel results and test-retest reliability proved insufficient.

Conclusion

Clinical use of the Cunningham Panel in diagnosing PANS or PANDAS is not supported by this study.

### Epigenetic, ribosomal, and immune dysregulation in paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome [^23b32ba4]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome/tics disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are increasing in prevalence, and now affect 1 in 6 children. Overlaps in clinical symptoms and comorbidities of NDDs suggest shared genetic etiologies. While genetic factors exert a significant influence on NDDs, most cases are attributed to common susceptibility loci, rather than rare gene variants. The interplay of genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of childhood NDDs is increasingly recognized, starting from preconception and extending into early adulthood. During this period, the central nervous system undergoes dynamic changes including neurogenesis, cell migration, cell differentiation, and synaptogenesis. Additionally, brain immune cells, primarily microglia, actively refine neural networks, through synaptic pruning. Early life programming, influenced by environmental exposures during critical developmental periods, can affect a child's developmental trajectory. This lasting impact is proposed to occur through cellular stress on the epigenetic and gene regulatory program of brain and immune cells.

Environmental exposures in the postnatal period, such as infections and stress are known to trigger or cause fluctuations in tics, or neuropsychiatric symptoms in children with NDDs. However, a small subgroup of children can suffer abrupt and severe onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms accompanied by developmental regression, leading to the proposal of clinical syndromes, such as Paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) or Paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with Streptococcal infection (PANDAS), which is a subset of PANS. Although these syndromes have been described in literature, their aetiology remains enigmatic, thus not fully recognized as 'discrete biological entities'. Early clinical observations of PANS/PANDAS proposed these conditions as distinct autoimmune entities, akin to autoimmune encephalitis. However, an alternative hypothesis is that PANS is part of the broader NDD continuum, representing a phenotype that demonstrates ongoing interactions between the immune system and brain in a subset of people with NDDs. Studies that investigate the underlying pathophysiology of PANS/PANDAS are lacking. Furthermore, antibiotics and immune modulation, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), have been proposed to benefit individuals with PANS/PANDAS, but these treatments remain contentious.

### Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus: comparison of diagnosis and treatment in the community and at a specialty clinic [^d08774ad]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to examine whether pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus were appropriately diagnosed in the community and to determine subsequent rates of unwarranted use of antibiotic treatment for tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms without the identification of an infection.

Methods

The design was a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study of 176 children and adolescents who were evaluated in a specialty program for tics, Tourette's disorder, and related problems. Previously published diagnostic criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus in our clinic.

Results

Subjects were significantly less likely to receive a diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus at the specialty clinic than in the community. In the community, subjects were significantly more likely to be treated with antibiotics or immunosuppressant medication if they received a diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus. Of the 27 subjects with a community diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus who were treated with antibiotics, 22 (82%) were treated without laboratory evidence of an infection; 2 were treated with immunomodulatory medications.

Conclusions

Our results support our hypothesis that pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus are frequently diagnosed in the community without the application of all working diagnostic criteria. This phenomenon has resulted in unwarranted use of antibiotic treatment for tics/obsessive-compulsive disorder without evidence of laboratory infection.

### Acute postinfectious movement and psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents [^4d557399]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The authors report 4 children and adolescents who had the acute onset of a movement and psychiatric disorder after a febrile illness. The differential diagnosis includes poststreptococcal syndromes (Sydenham chorea, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection [PANDAS], acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) and other postinfectious conditions. Their cases illustrate difficulties in making an accurate diagnosis and determining proper therapy and they recommend a standard diagnostic approach. More research is needed to clarify the nature, causes, and appropriate treatment of these types of disorders.

### PANDAS / PANS treatments, awareness evolve, but some experts skeptical… [^e444523a]. publications.aap.org (2017). Low credibility.

Streptococcus. The diagnostic criteria for PANDAS include sudden-onset OCD or severely restricted food intake, Dr. Swedo said, and at least two of the following symptoms:

- anxiety;
- emotional lability or depression;
- irritability or aggression;
- behavioral regression;
- attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like symptoms that cause a deterioration in school performance;
- sensory or motor abnormalities; and
- somatic symptoms like sleep disturbances and frequent urination. PANDAS primarily affects children younger than 12 because they are less likely to have streptococcal antibodies. While more centers like the one in Arizona are being established around the country to treat PANDAS, not all clinicians are convinced that strep infections trigger neuropsychiatric behaviors. "The main reason PANDAS/PANS is not diagnosed more is because of almost 20 years of controversy, " Dr. Swedo said.

Making a diagnosisPANS is a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring a comprehensive evaluation. The PANDAS Physicians Network maintains a diagnostic algorithm on its website as well as treatment guidelines. The PPN draws on the expertise of more than 40 doctors who serve on its scientific and medical advisory boards to help medical professionals better understand the disorders. "As literature is published, our expert panel updates our guidelines, " said David Brick, M. D. FAAP, PPN president and a pediatric cardiologist. "We want to reflect the standard of care by expert consensus. " Much of PPN's diagnostic guidelines are based on a consensus statement from a 2013 PANS Consensus Conference published in the. Cognitive behavioral therapy can benefit those with mild impairments, according to PPN treatment guidelines.

If symptoms persist, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin or therapeutic plasma exchange may be necessary, the guidelines state. IVIG and therapeutic plasma exchange, however, can be expensive and difficult to get approved by insurance. "While I think some children do have PANDAS, I just don't know how to help them since the information regarding antibiotic therapy is conflicting, " Dr. Fisher said. "I am patiently awaiting more studies. " Early studies with a likely selection bias fueled the confusion, Dr. Brick said. In those studies, a few doctors outside of NIMH selected patients with well-established Tourette syndrome or classic OCD symptoms who happened to have a strep infection, rather than patients with sudden-onset severe OCD.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^f2173447]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

PANS and PANDAS — PANS is described as an umbrella term that subsumes PANDAS, and infections suggested as triggers of PANS-like symptoms include group A Streptococcus (GAS), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza, and sinusitis, but not all cases are infection-triggered and no single microbe has been associated with onset; PANDAS' 5 diagnostic criteria include presence of OCD and/or tic disorder; prepubertal onset of symptoms; episodic course characterized by acute, severe onset and dramatic symptom exacerbations; temporal relationship between GAS infection, symptom onset, and exacerbations; and association with neurologic abnormalities (eg, choreiform movements, motor hyperactivity, tics), and the hypothesized GAS–basal ganglia molecular mimicry mechanism remains unproven based on current evidence.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^959aacfe]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Environmental risk factors and PANDAS in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are not established, with the text stating there are no established environmental risk factors for OCD and that the role of stressful life events (including pregnancy and childbirth) as potential risk factors for OCD still warrants further studies, while streptococcal infection may be associated with early-onset OCD characterized by abrupt onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and co-occurring tics, often termed pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS).

### Post-streptococcal autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system [^692d4a46]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Autoimmune disease has long been intertwined with investigations of infectious causes. Antibodies that are formed against an infectious agent can, through the process of molecular mimicry, also recognize healthy cells. When this occurs, the immune system erroneously destroys the healthy cells causing autoimmune disease in addition to appropriately destroying the offending infectious agent and attenuating the infectious process. The first infectious agent shown to cause a post-infectious autoimmune disorder in the central nervous system was Streptococcus pyogenes in Sydenham's chorea. The present review summarizes the most recent published findings of central nervous system diseases that have evidence of a post-streptococcal autoimmune etiology.

Recent Findings

Sydenham's chorea and other central nervous system illnesses that are hypothesized to have a post-streptococcal autoimmune etiology appear to arise from targeted dysfunction of the basal ganglia. PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune disorders associated with streptococcal infections) is the acronym applied to a subgroup of children with obsessive-compulsive disorder or tic disorders occurring in association with streptococcal infections. In addition, there are recent reports of dystonia, chorea encephalopathy, and dystonic choreoathetosis occurring as sequelae of streptococcal infection. Investigators have begun to isolate and describe antistreptococcal-antineuronal antibodies as well as possible genetic markers in patients who are susceptible to these illnesses.

Summary

Clinical and research findings in both immunology and neuropsychiatry have established the existence of post-streptococcal neuropsychiatric disorders and are beginning to shed light on possible pathobiologic processes.

### Pediatric movement disorders: an update [^b93731fa]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pediatric movement disorders the represent a broad range of disorders, the majority of which are intermittent and hyperkinetic. The goal of this review is to discuss recent findings in several under-recognized conditions (motor stereotypy disorder, restless legs syndrome, and infantile masturbation) as well as the area of autoimmune movement disorders [Sydenham's chorea and PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection)].

Recent Findings

Advances to be discussed include clarification of symptoms, diagnostic clues, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment.

Summary

Significant progress has been made in the study of several paroxysmal movement disorders. Motor stereotypies can occur in typical children and persist over time. Infantile masturbation is often misdiagnosed for seizures or dystonia. Restless leg syndrome is a relatively common problem in children and established criteria are available. Advances have been made in the hallmark autoimmune disorder Sydenham's chorea, but PANDAS remains controversial.

### Anti-brain antibodies in PANDAS versus uncomplicated streptococcal infection [^1420fea6]. Pediatric Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess brain involvement through the presence of antineuronal antibodies in Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus (PANDAS) and in uncomplicated active Group A streptococcal infection. We compared serum antibrain antibody to human basal ganglia sections assessed by indirect tissue immunofluorescence in two groups: a PANDAS group, comprised of 22 patients (mean age 10.1 years; 20 male, 2 female) who met strict National Institutes of Mental Health diagnostic criteria for PANDAS and had clinically active tics or obsessive-compulsive disorder, or both; and a GABHS control group consisting of 22 patients (mean age 9.1 years; 15 mol/L, 7 female) with clinical evidence of active Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection confirmed by throat culture and elevated antistreptolysin O titers but without history or clinical evidence of tics or obsessive-compulsive disorder. We observed positive anti-basal ganglia staining (defined as detectable staining at 1:10 serum dilution) in 14/22 patients in the PANDAS group (64%) but only 2/22 (9%) in the GABHS control group (P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). These results suggest that antibrain antibodies are present in children with PANDAS that cannot be explained merely by a history of GABHS infection.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^8f064301]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

PANDAS and poorly validated indications — "Tonsillectomy has been considered for treating pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), but evidence is anecdotal and the etiology poorly understood," and "A recent systematic review found no recommendations either for or against performing tonsillectomy specifically to treat PANDAS." Poorly validated indications listed include "chronic tonsillitis, febrile seizures, muffled ("hot potato") speech, halitosis, malocclusion of teeth, tonsillar hypertrophy, cryptic tonsils, and chronic pharyngeal carriage of GABHS," and "There is a substantial role for shared decision making with caregivers when considering tonsillectomy for ≥ 1 of these conditions."

### Echocardiographic findings in the PANDAS subgroup [^8e46cad9]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Sydenham's chorea is the neurologic manifestation of rheumatic fever and is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring only the presence of frank chorea in the absence of another neurologic disorder. Two thirds of children with Sydenham's chorea also have rheumatic carditis (pathologic mitral valve regurgitation). Although there are similar neuropsychiatric symptoms and preceding group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection associated with both Sydenham's chorea and the PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) subgroup, it is unknown whether patients in the PANDAS subgroup have any cardiac involvement.

Methods

Sixty children meeting the criteria for PANDAS were entered into protocols at National Institute of Mental Health between 1993 and 2002. Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiograms were performed on these subjects to assess valvular heart disease.

Results

Of these 60 children, no echocardiographic evidence of significant mitral or aortic valve regurgitation was found. One patient was found to have mild mitral regurgitation, and all patients had normal left atrial size and normal left ventricular size and function. Follow-up echocardiograms on 20 children showed no significant valvular regurgitation.

Conclusion

The evidence of a clear lack of rheumatic carditis in these children supports the hypothesis that PANDAS is a distinct neuropsychiatric diagnosis separate from Sydenham's chorea.

### Oxidative stress and gut-derived lipopolysaccharides in children affected by paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections [^fc222d13]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Thirty consecutive subjects (24 males and 6 females, mean age 9 ± 3), who were referred to the Allergology and Pediatric Neurology clinic of "Sapienza" University of Rome from January 2018 to December 2019, were enrolled. Thirty control subjects (24 males and 6 females, mean age 9 ± 3), matched for aged and gender, were enrolled at the same pediatric clinic at the same period. Controls were recruited through a screening program in childhood.

Inclusion criteria were represented by: subjects aged between 3 and 16 years affected by PANDAS.

PANDAS was defined according to the criteria elaborated by Dr. Swedo and collaborators:
presence of OCD (diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria) and/or tic disorders.
onset of symptoms between 3 years and puberty.
episodic course of the disease.
symptoms and exacerbations temporally associated with GAS infections.
association with neurological anomalies (choreiform movements and motor hyperactivity during symptoms exacerbations).

Exclusion criteria were represented by: PANS not related to GAS, Sydenham corea, Tourette syndrome, Autoimmune encephalitis, Systemic autoimmune diseases, Wilson's disease, congenital heart disease, renal disease, cancer, treatment with immuno-suppressive drugs or antioxidants, liver disease, acute disease.

The study conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Sapienza University of Rome Ethics Committee (n. 5377).

Blood sampling

Blood samples were collected, between 8.00 and 9.00 am, in Vacutainers (Vacutainer Systems, Belliver Industrial Estate, Plymouth, UK) after an overnight fast (12 h). Samples were centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored at − 80 °C until dosage.

### Development of autoimmune diseases among children with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome [^79b90684]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

We postulate that postinfectious neuroinflammation of PANS or PANDAS might be accompanied by or associated with systemic inflammation, as is seen in acute rheumatic fever, where patients often develop obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), emotional lability, involuntary movements, arthritis, vasculitis, carditis, and other inflammatory signs. Given the suspected inflammatory underpinnings of PANS, we aimed to evaluate signs of immune activation and vasculopathy during flares and estimate the risk of developing arthritis and other autoimmune diseases among children with PANS.

### Tic disorders: neural circuits, neurochemistry, and neuroimmunology [^f2e03749]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The neuroanatomy and neurochemistry underlying tic disorders are thought to involve corticostriatothalamocortical circuits and dysregulation of their component neurotransmitter systems. Tourette syndrome is a tic disorder that begins in childhood and follows a waxing and waning course of tic severity. Although it is generally believed to have a genetic component, its etiology has not been fully elucidated. The clinical entity pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) has led some to suggest that the pathophysiology of tics in some individuals might involve a postinfectious autoimmune component. We review the neural circuits and neurochemistry of Tourette syndrome and evaluate the evidence for and against a role for autoimmunity in the expression of tics.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^c7d18807]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis and recommended workup — The diagnosis and workup of PANS/PANDAS is complicated by several issues, including a lack of clarity about the potential causes of PANS with a broad array of possible causes to be considered and the absence of a PANS listing in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) or in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11) coding system.

### Deep clinical phenotyping of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder: an approach towards detection of organic causes and first results [^12156513]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common and severely disabling mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 1 to 3.5% and is associated with a significant loss of quality of life. It is assumed that OCD has a multi-factorial pathogenesis with biological, psychological, and social causes, as well as additional external stressors like critical life events or infections. Biologically, dysbalance of the cortico–striato–thalamo–cortical circuits, a dysregulation of serotonergic, glutamatergic, or dopaminergic neurotransmissions, as well as (epi-)genetic alterations, are assumed. In contrast to these primary forms of OCD, the DSM-5 and the upcoming ICD-11 distinguish obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) in the context of organic causes — i.e. "organic OCD" forms from classical OCD. Organic OCD forms are based on clear-cut organic findings to which OCS can be attributed, like neurological lesions or tumors. In recent years, autoimmune mechanisms have been increasingly discussed in the context of organic OCD. The most prominent example is Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS). There is also increasing evidence for organic OCD independent of infection due to different neuronal antibodies or in the context of systemic autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Non-inflammatory causes could include neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease or genetic syndromes such as velocardiofacial syndrome (cf.). To date, little is known about the prevalence of organic OCD.

### A case of PANDAS treated with tetrabenazine and tonsillectomy [^f5c96007]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by the presence of tics, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or chorea in the context of an immediately precedent streptococcal infection. In this report, we describe the case of an 11-year-old boy who developed PANDAS with severe choreic movements. The criteria for PANDAS diagnosis were met. Moreover, serum antibrain antibodies were present. The patient was initially treated with tetrabenazine 12.5 mg twice daily with remission of the neurological symptoms. Subsequently, the patient underwent tonsillectomy and has been asymptomatic since, with antistreptolysin O titer levels in range.

### Neuropsychiatric symptoms following sore throat in a young boy [^339fdeae]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A previously healthy 6-year-old boy was referred to us by his primary provider, with a history of sudden onset behavioural abnormalities including irritability, sleep disturbance and anxiety. Physical examination revealed no significant findings; further analyses were not suggestive of meningitis, encephalitis, metabolic abnormalities, toxicity or any other obvious cause. On rechecking the patient's history, an episode of throat pain 1week prior to the symptom onset was noted. Therefore, the possibility of paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) was considered. The antistreptolysin O titre was high (1078 IU/mL), and it increased to 1194 IU/mL 4 weeks later, leading to a diagnosis of PANDAS. He was started on ampicillin and administered one dose of intravenous immunoglobulin. His abnormal behaviours subsided and he returned to a normal state within 48hours of treatment. This report aims to provide insights into the symptomology and diagnosis of PANDAS in children.

### Immunological causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: is it time for the concept of an "autoimmune OCD" subtype? [^90a55d22]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

OCD and immune activation

OCD and PANDAS/PANS

It is an established concept that obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) may be associated with Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal infection (PANDAS;), which is proposed to be caused by an infection with group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes. It is assumed that reactive autoimmune phenomena can develop after infections that cause PANDAS. The concept of PANDAS was recently supported by a Danish population-based cohort study of 1,067,743 children, demonstrating that children with positive streptococcal test results had an increased risk for developing OCD. Interestingly, first degree relatives of patients with OCD also appear to be more frequently affected by streptococcal infections. Recently, the concept of PANDAS has been extended to pathogens other than streptococcus and other autoimmune causes, and the term pediatric acute neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) was introduced. In this context, other pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Borna disease virus, and Toxoplasmosis gondii have also been identified as possible causes of immune-related PANS. Whether immune-mediated secondary OCD could also develop as a consequence of COVID-19 poses a highly relevant research question to be elucidated in the near future. The first studies of their kind have demonstrated infection-triggered neuronal antibody production against various antigens in COVID-19 patients who were presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms.

### Streptococcal infection and exacerbations of childhood tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: a prospective blinded cohort study [^f363427d]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

If pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections is a unique clinical entity, we hypothesized that children meeting diagnostic criteria would have more clinical exacerbations temporally linked to bona fide group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection than matched control subjects (chronic tic and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder with no known temporal relationship to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection).

Patients and Methods

Subjects included 40 matched pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections case-control pairs who were prospectively evaluated with intensive laboratory testing for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and clinical measures for an average of 2 years. Additional testing occurred at the time of any clinical exacerbations or illness. Laboratory personnel were blinded to case or control status and clinical (exacerbation or not) condition. Clinical raters were blinded to the results of laboratory tests.

Results

The cases had a higher clinical exacerbation rate and a higher bona fide group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection rate than the control group. Only 5 of 64 exacerbations were temporally associated (within 4 weeks) with a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection, and all occurred in cases. The number (5.0) was significantly higher than the number that would be expected by chance alone (1.6). Yet, ≥ 75% of the clinical exacerbations in cases had no observable temporal relationship to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection.

Conclusions

Patients who fit published criteria for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections seem to represent a subgroup of those with chronic tic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder who may be vulnerable to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection as a precipitant of neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection is not the only or even the most common antecedent event associated with exacerbations for these patients. Additional intensive studies are needed to determine whether there is clinical or scientific evidence to support separating out subgroups of tic disorder and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder patients based on specific symptom precipitants.

### Executive and attention functioning among children in the PANDAS subgroup [^bf089127]. Child Neuropsychology (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence from past studies indicates that adults and children with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) experience subtle neuropsychological deficits. Less is known about neuropsychological functioning of children and adolescents with a symptom course consistent with the PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infection) subgroup of OCD and tics. To provide such information, we administered three tests of attention control and two of executive function to 67 children and adolescents (ages 5–16) diagnosed with OCD and/or tics and a symptom course consistent with the PANDAS subgroup and 98 healthy volunteers (HV) matched by age, sex, and IQ. In a paired comparison of the two groups, the PANDAS subjects were less accurate than HV in a test of response suppression. Further, in a two-step linear regression analysis of the PANDAS group in which clinical variables were added stepwise into the model and in the second step matching variables (age, sex, and IQ) were added, IQ emerged as a predictor of performance on this task. In the same analysis, ADHD diagnosis and age emerged as predictors of response time in a continuous performance task. Subdividing the PANDAS group by primary psychiatric diagnosis revealed that subjects with TS or OCD with tics exhibited a longer response time compared to controls than subjects with OCD only, replicating previous findings within TS and OCD. This study demonstrates that children with PANDAS exhibit neuropsychological profiles similar to those of their primary psychiatric diagnosis.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^46cadb9b]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) initial evaluation and differential diagnosis emphasize discussing diagnoses broader than PANS and targeted testing for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection when indicated. Pediatric health care providers are encouraged to initially discuss the likelihood of a diagnosis that is broader than PANS — including acute-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or other anxiety disorders, tic disorder, Tourette syndrome, Sydenham chorea, or autoimmune encephalitis (AE). A review of symptom longevity is required to assess these possibilities. Initial laboratory workup consists of a diagnostic test for GAS infection (eg, throat culture, a rapid antigen detection test, or a nucleic acid amplification test) when signs of pharyngitis are present. Focal neurologic signs and symptoms and those that indicate the potential for AE require additional evaluation.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^19cca33f]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) — novel augmentation agents and PANDAS interventions: Trials of stimulants, gabapentin, sumatriptan, pindolol, inositol, opiates, St. John's wort, N-acetyl cysteine, memantine, and riluzole have been reported, but none meet minimal standards that permit recommendation for routine use. In putative pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), penicillin prophylaxis failed in one study but was effective in a subsequent study with decreases in infections and OCD symptoms during the prophylaxis year compared with the previous baseline year; however, extant data are insufficient to recommend routine antibiotic prophylaxis for children with OCD, and standard treatments for OCD and streptococcal infections are recommended. Therapeutic plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin remain experimental with substantial risk and potential morbidity, and D-cycloserine augmentation of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) remains unproved in children, although a meta-analysis in adults suggests efficacy.

### Association between streptococcal infection and obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, and tic disorder [^524adb5b]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Reports have suggested that streptococcal infection may be etiologically related to pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders (PANDAS), but there are few good epidemiologic studies to support this theory. Using population-based data from a large West-Coast health maintenance organization, we assessed whether streptococcal infection was associated with increased risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette's syndrome (TS), or tic disorder.

Methods

This is a case-control study of children 4 to 13 years old receiving their first diagnosis of OCD, TS, or tic disorder between January 1992 and December 1999 at Group Health Cooperative outpatient facilities. Cases were matched to controls by birth date, gender, primary physician, and propensity to seek health care.

Results

Patients with OCD, TS, or tic disorder were more likely than controls to have had prior streptococcal infection (OR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.69) in the 3 months before onset date. The risk was higher among children with multiple streptococcal infections within 12 months (OR: 3.10; 95% CI: 1.77, 8.96). Having multiple infections with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus within a 12-month period was associated with an increased risk for TS (OR: 13.6; 95% CI: 1.93, 51.0). These associations did not change appreciably when limited to cases with a clear date of onset of symptoms or with tighter matching on health care behavior.

Conclusion

These findings lend epidemiologic evidence that PANDAS may arise as a result of a postinfectious autoimmune phenomenon induced by childhood streptococcal infection.

### Post-infectious group A streptococcal autoimmune syndromes and the heart [^f1112f07]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

There is a pressing need to reduce the high global disease burden of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and its harbinger, acute rheumatic fever (ARF). ARF is a classical example of an autoimmune syndrome and is of particular immunological interest because it follows a known antecedent infection with group A streptococcus (GAS). However, the poorly understood immunopathology of these post-infectious diseases means that, compared to much progress in other immune-mediated diseases, we still lack useful biomarkers, new therapies or an effective vaccine in ARF and RHD. Here, we summarise recent literature on the complex interaction between GAS and the human host that culminates in ARF and the subsequent development of RHD. We contrast ARF with other post-infectious streptococcal immune syndromes - post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) and the still controversial paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), in order to highlight the potential significance of variations in the host immune response to GAS. We discuss a model for the pathogenesis of ARF and RHD in terms of current immunological concepts and the potential for application of in depth "omics" technologies to these ancient scourges.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^f8e16c32]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Tic disorders in children and adolescents — genetic and environmental factors with PANDAS/PANS are described as follows: Chronic tic disorder (CTD) shows a genetic link, but candidate-gene association and nonparametric linkage studies have not yielded definitive susceptibility genes for tic disorders, and a recent genome-wide association study revealed that no markers reached a genome wide threshold of significance. Identified rare variants via cytogenetic assays and analysis of copy number variations have shown overlap with other neuropsychiatric disorders and affect a small percentage of those with tic disorders, and a parametric linkage study has ignited interest in histidine decarboxylase with implications for histaminergic and dopaminergic signaling in the striatum. Tics appear to be sensitive to environmental stimuli such as temperature changes, stress, illness, and fatigue that can exacerbate tics. PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with streptococcus) describes childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tics with acute onset following a streptococcal infection, neurological signs, and an episodic course, whereas PANS (pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome) describes sudden-onset OCD in which tics are not a required feature and a link to prior streptococcal infections is not always evident. In children with PANS/PANDAS, reported associated symptoms include separation anxiety, nightmares, personality change, oppositional behaviors, and deterioration in mathematics skills and handwriting, and studies suggest that in some cases a prior history of infections may increase risk for developing tic disorder, although this remains controversial.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sydenham chorea: consensus guidelines [^62e57a80]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Sydenham chorea (SC) — consensus areas of need and future study identify 10 priorities with high agreement. Under "Areas of need in Sydenham chorea," items with "100 (24)" agreement include an in‑depth understanding of SC epidemiology and pathophysiology; longitudinal studies on patients' and families' support needs; exploring presumed genomic susceptibility to acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and SC; developing a standardized assessment scale including motor and psychiatric symptoms; and high‑quality studies on secondary antibiotic prophylaxis and on symptomatic treatments and immunotherapy for relapse prevention. Statements on the relation between neuropsychiatric symptoms in SC and PANS/PANDAS and on reducing pain and distress from long‑term intramuscular antibiotic prophylaxis each had "95.8 (24)." Improving adherence with long‑term intramuscular antibiotic prophylaxis had "100 (23)," and feasibility/efficacy of vaccine development to prevent group A β‑hemolytic streptococcal infections had "100 (26)." Abbreviations include pediatric acute‑onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).

### The cunningham panel is an unreliable biological measure [^031301fa]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

We have previously questioned the diagnostic value of the Cunningham Panel. In a Swedish study consisting of 53 patients (40 children and adolescents and 13 adults) with suspicion of having pediatric acute neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) and/or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), the property of the Cunningham Panel was investigated. To our knowledge, our study is the only independent study evaluating the Cunningham Panel hitherto published. Twenty-four of the patients met diagnostic criteria for PANS and/or PANDAS, whereas 29 did not. We also tested 27 healthy controls with the Cunningham Panel. Ten out of 21 (48%) healthy controls had elevated CaMKII activity as compared to 35 out of 53 (66%) of the patients. Moreover, at least one positive autoantibody titer was found in 17 of the healthy controls. In conclusion we found a so-called positive value on the Cunningham Panel in 86% of the healthy controls, as compared to 92% in the patients assessed for PANS and PANDAS.

To summarize, Connery et al. do not present any objective data in the causal pathway from symptoms to outcomes. Seveteen children with autism in the study were not treated with IVIG on the basis that their CaMKII was not elevated. Consequently, the effect of IVIG in children with autism and subthreshold levels of CaMKII activity is not tested. The reported improvements in the children with elevated CaMKII activity may stem from placebo response or the natural course, not necessarily from IVIG. Considering that the Cunningham Panel to a great extent is positive among healthy people, it seems premature to suggest that it can predict treatment response based on a small selection of children with autism in an open-label, uncontrolled study. At this point of time we cannot draw any quantitative conclusions about biomarkers from open label treatment studies of disorders like ASD.

### Involvement of community paediatricians in the care of children and young people with mental health difficulties in the UK: implications for case ascertainment by child and adolescent psychiatric, and paediatric surveillance systems [^a6f61fc2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Epidemiological studies are important for understanding disease trends and planning services. Large scale epidemiological studies help to determine reliable population estimates of common health conditions. However, for less common disorders, large epidemiological studies may not identify enough cases to enable the required analyses. For example, despite a very large representative sample size of 9117 children, the 'Mental Health of Children and Young People in England Survey' stated that the 'sample was too small to reliably detect change in a low prevalence condition'.herefore, using typical epidemiological surveys to study uncommon conditions may require prohibitively large sample sizes that would render such studies unaffordable and impractical.

On the other hand, surveillance methodology provides a cheaper and more efficient alternative epidemiological approach to studying uncommon conditions. This methodology was pioneered by the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) in 1986. The BPSU has so far conducted 120 surveillance studies, many of which have had important policy impact. Indeed, this surveillance strategy developed by the BPSU has been referred to as a success story of modern paediatrics. The success has led to its replication for paediatric research in many countries (Lynn and Reading). Also, similar methodology has been developed in the UK for obstetrics and gynaecology, ophthalmology, and child and adolescent mental health. The latter is referred to as the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Surveillance System (CAPSS).

Although surveillance methodology is typically applied to uncommon disorders, the strategy can equally be used to study aspects of common conditions. Examples include rare events associated with common conditions or practices such as the incidence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with use of antipsychotic medications. Surveillance strategy can also apply to studies of uncommon subtypes of common conditions such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) related to paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).

The principle of surveillance methodology is described in detail elsewhereand illustrated in figure 1. Using CAPSS as example, every month, the surveillance team based at the Royal College of Psychiatrists send emails to all consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists in the UK and Ireland requesting them to report whether they have seen a new case of the condition being studied. Consultants who report that they have seen cases are contacted by the researchers (who are independent of CAPSS) to obtain the relevant research data about the case. BPSU and CAPSS operate active case surveillance, which means that consultants are also requested to report if they have not seen a case. This approach helps to monitor response rate and compliance.

Diagnostic investigations and typical findings

Suggestions for the diagnosis of PANDAS/PANS

Clinical evaluations should include psychiatric and neurological evaluations, an assessment of somatic symptoms, infectious disease evaluation (streptococcal infection or associated [non]febrile infectious illnesses such as rhinosinusitis, pharyngitis, or bronchitis), assessment of symptoms and history that necessitate further evaluation of immune dysregulation (i.e. autoimmune disease, inflammatory disease) or an evaluation for immunodeficiency, and medical and family history. Laboratory diagnostics in patients with suspected PANDAS/PANS should include the detection of underlying pathogens, various laboratory analyses, and additional investigations according to common consensus criteria (see Supplemental Table 1).

Diagnostic possibilities for the detection of autoimmune OCD in general

Based on studies in patients with PANDAS/PANS, as well as AE and AP, different blood analyses, electroencephalography (EEG), MRI, and CSF investigations may be useful to detect an autoimmune cause of OCD. Administration of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and/or 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO-PET) may also be helpful in distinguishing between autoimmune and primary OCD. The "Cunningham panel" is proposed to measure PANDAS/PANS-associated antibodies, including anti-D1/D2R, anti-β-tubulin, and anti-lysoganglioside antibodies, as well as CaMKII activity. However, as a limitation, it must be mentioned that the "Cunningham panel" has not been validated in adults and has failed in tests of sensitivity or specificity in a previous study, so its clinical utility is currently questionable. According to the experiences with AE/AP, confirmatory tests should be used for neuronal antibodies with established methods, such as fixed cell-based assays, live cell-based assays, immunoblots, and/or indirect immunofluorescence on murine brain sections. Table 3 gives an overview of potentially helpful diagnostic tests.

### Cross-cutting issues and future directions for the OCD spectrum [^ec040250]. Psychiatry Research (2009). Low credibility.

The research planning agenda for DSM-V examined possible similarities in phenomenology, comorbidity, familial and genetic features, brain circuitry, and treatment response between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and several related disorders that are characterized by repetitive thoughts or behaviors. Such data support a re-examination of the DSM-IV-TR classification of OCD and the anxiety disorders, with possible inclusion of a group of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders (OCSDs) in DSM-V. Various disorders were systematically examined for inclusion in such a grouping, and later a smaller number were determined to meet threshold criteria for inclusion in the OCSDs. The disorders that were originally examined included OCD, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), Tourette's syndrome (TS) and other tic disorders, Sydenham's chorea, Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS), trichotillomania (TTM), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), autism, eating disorders, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease, impulse control disorders, as well as substance and behavioral addictions. Certain disorders such as BDD, OCPD, TS, and TTM share many commonalities with OCD in phenomenology, comorbidity, familial and genetic features, brain circuitry, and treatment response. Other disorders, such as the impulse control disorders (ICDs) share some common features with OCD, but also differ in many ways as well. The articles presented in this issue of Psychiatry Research are a result of this international collaboration, which examined diagnostic and classification issues of OCSDs for DSM-V in a conference titled "The Future of Psychiatric Diagnosis: Refining the Research Agenda: Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior Spectrum" held in June 2006 at the American Psychiatric Association's headquarters in Arlington, VA.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^2554e6c7]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

PANDAS experimental immunology — Autoimmune-prone rats immunized with GAS antigen exhibited motor symptoms and compulsive behaviors that were alleviated by haloperidol and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, with autoantibodies deposited in the striatum, thalamus, and frontal cortex; immunoglobulin G from GAS-exposed rats induced similar behavioral and motor problems in naive rats with striatal IgG deposits. Translational data report that sera from patients with well-characterized PANDAS infused into the striatum of mice bound to 80% of cholinergic interneurons, and after immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) treatment and symptom improvement, their sera no longer contained antibodies with elevated binding; however, sera from patients with PANDAS and Tourette syndrome infused into rat striata did not induce behavioral changes, and attempts to identify definite autoantibodies in PANDAS have yielded inconsistent results with no association between symptom exacerbations and changes in antineuronal antibody levels.

### Inflammation in tic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder: are PANS and PANDAS a path forward? [^2d565dde]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review and commentary is the product of an invited lecture called "Autoimmunity: PANS/PANDAS" presented at the 2018 Neurobiology of Diseases in Children Symposium in Chicago, IL. The talk addressed clinical and scientific questions and recently published data. At this time, among highly experienced and respected clinicians and researchers spanning relevant disciplines, there is substantial controversy regarding a role for inflammation in producing tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This commentary summarizes these controversies, discusses reasons for opposing views on best clinical practices, and concludes with suggestions for pathways forward.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^8c7f57e0]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) — diagnostic criteria and symptom domains specify an unusually abrupt and dramatic onset of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or severely restricted food intake, plus concurrent, abrupt onset of additional severe neuropsychiatric symptoms from at least 2 of the following 7 categories: anxiety; emotional lability and/or depression; irritability, aggression, and/or severe oppositional behaviors; developmental regression; deterioration in school performance; sensory or motor abnormalities including heightened sensitivity to sensory stimuli, hallucinations, dysgraphia, and complex motor and/or vocal tics; and somatic signs and symptoms including sleep disturbances, enuresis, or urinary frequency that are not better explained by a known neurologic or medical disorder. PANS is described as involving simultaneous and rapid-onset psychiatric and neurologic symptoms, and although group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection is a hallmark of PANDAS' description, PANS encompasses other potential instigator events.

### Oxidative stress and gut-derived lipopolysaccharides in children affected by paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections [^24826292]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is defined as a wide spectrum of disorders characterised by sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or severely restricted food intake in children. A particular subtype of PANS is considered the paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections syndrome (PANDAS) that identifies patients with acute onset of obsessive-compulsive and/or tic disorders related to Group-A streptococcus (GAS) infection. The close relation with streptococcus infection led to hypothesize to an autoimmune pathogenesis of PANDAS in which streptococcal antibodies cross-react with neuronal antigens. This latter elicits dysregulation of dopamine receptors placed in the basal ganglia and in other types of neurons in the cortex and to a persisting neuroinflammation.

Growing evidence showed that oxidative stress has an important role in the neuroinflammation process as shown in neurodegenerative disease and in psychotic disorders. Previous experimental studies found that reactive oxygen species (ROS), derived from NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX2), have a pivotal role in apoptotic pathways and in mediating the inflammatory processes in the central nervous system. To the best of our knowledge, no study has analyzed oxidative stress and NADPH oxidase activation in children affected by PANDAS.

Several studies in animals and humans suggested that alterations of gut microbiota are associated to neuro-inflammation. A recent study by Quagliarello et al. showed that children affected by PANDAS have changes of the gut microbiota that could favor the neuro-inflammation.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), derived from gram-negative bacteria, plays a pivotal role in causing neuroinflammation by an increase of oxidative stress. A relationship among LPS, oxidative stress and NOX2 activation, in other clinical situations as NAFLD, pneumonia atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disease, has been previously reported. We speculated that children affected by PANDAS have NOX2 over-activation and increased oxidative stress that may favor to onset and persistence of the disease. Thus, this study wanted to assess NOX2 and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α), as markers of oxidative stress, in serum of PANDAS and controls. Furthermore, we wanted to assess the potential role for gut-derived LPS in eliciting systemic NOX2 levels in children affected by PANDAS.

### Genetics of obsessive-compulsive disorder [^e0a3df09]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple risk factors may contribute to the development of OCD, including both genetic and environmental risk factors, such as perinatal complications, childhood trauma, reproductive cycle events (e.g. age of onset of menarche) and stressful life events (as reviewed in detail elsewhere; Brander, Pérez-Vigil, Larsson, & Mataix-Cols; Raposo-Lima & Morgado). However, the majority of the studies assessing environmental risk factors are based on retrospective self-reports, limiting causal inference. A persistent low-grade inflammation involving both innate and adaptive immune systems has also been observed in OCD (Gerentes, Pelissolo, Rajagopal, Tamouza, & Hamdani). Most prominently, it has been proposed that an autoimmune response to infection leading to inflammation in the basal ganglia may underlie some cases of unusually abrupt early-onset OCD (Swedo et al.). This condition was initially termed pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), but has recently been broadened to pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS), emphasizing that the illness may start with infectious triggers other than streptococcal (Chiarello, Spitoni, Hollander, Matucci Cerinic, & Pallanti). Notably, OCD itself represents a risk factor for the subsequent diagnosis of other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia (Cheng et al; Meier et al.) and anorexia nervosa (Cederlöf et al.), suggesting an etiological overlap.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^344c1c51]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) — tests and workups not recommended: Although "some groups recommend that children with potential PANS have a CBC with differential, ESR, CRP, metabolic panel, and urinalysis," "there is no evidence for the utility of these tests in deciding on either diagnosis or treatment; therefore, they should not be routinely performed." Beyond these, "there is no evidence for the following tests; their use is not recommended for diagnosing PANS:" including "PCR assay for Mycoplasma infection (pharynx)" because "good evidence to support this hypothesis does not exist," the "antinuclear antibody test" in isolation due to "its high false-positive rate," and the "Cunningham panel," which has "very low specificity (eg, 6% for PANS and 10% for PANDAS)" and "is not recommended." If ANA is positive with systemic features and inflammatory markers, "the patient should be referred to a rheumatologist for consideration of an alternate diagnosis to PANS." Regarding broader evaluations, "workups for these conditions are rarely, if ever, helpful," and "such a workup should not be performed… unless symptoms of encephalopathy, seizures, myelitis, or other focal neurologic deficits are present or there is overlap of other neuropsychiatric symptoms typical of these syndromes." "Obtaining imaging is not warranted unless CNS or orbital complications are being evaluated."

### Neuropsychiatric movement disorders following streptococcal infection [^2064e73c]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe post-streptococcal movement disorders that form part of the acute rheumatic fever complex. The clinical records of patients diagnosed with Sydenham's chorea were analyzed retrospectively to investigate epidemiology, the significance of socioeconomic deprivation, clinical manifestations, treatments, outcomes, long-term morbidity, and disease evolution. Forty-two patients (21 males, 21 females) were diagnosed with Sydenham's chorea. The median presentation age was 9 years 8 months (range 3y 5mo to 13y 2mo). Nineteen patients were of indigenous African ancestry; 23 were of mixed ancestry. All patients lived in poverty and had poor access to medical care. Twelve of the total group had disabling symptoms for longer than 2 years; six of these patients developed paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with Streptococcus (Paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with Streptococcus [PANDAS]), five Tourette syndrome (TS), and one learning difficulties. Poor outcome was significantly more prevalent in patients of mixed ancestry, in those with a positive family history, previous behavioural problems, or a failure to complete 10 days of penicillin and 'bed-rest'/hospitalization. Sydenham's chorea is one manifestation of post-streptococcal neuropsychiatric movement disorders. This study demonstrates that patients can present with one diagnosis and evolve other neuropsychiatric conditions such as TS and PANDAS. In the South African context, it is important to delineate neuropsychiatric movement disorders associated with streptococcal infections. The potential genetic susceptibility should be explored.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^e38c764d]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) treatment — AAP expert panel opinion and clinician guidance emphasizes that PANS "may be part of a group of conditions that are potentially triggered by infectious agents and/or involve autoimmunity." Best-practice modalities "are not clear at this time, other than consistent use of CBT and SSRIs when OCD and/or anxiety are prominent symptoms," and there "is a strong evidence base for behavioral and psychiatric treatments for OCD and other neuropsychiatric symptoms; these treatments are effective and should be the first line of therapies when identified in children with concern for PANS." For GAS throat infection, "a short 10-day course of amoxicillin should be administered in children who have a positive test result," whereas "there is a lack of evidence to support the use of antimicrobial and immunomodulatory agents." In severe cases, "Subspecialty consultation should be sought," and clinicians "are encouraged to describe the evidence quality for effective interventions to families as well as the lack of evidence for unproven treatments that parents may ask about."

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^a8f61dbb]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Initial workup for possible streptococcal triggers — Although some have proposed testing all children with new-onset abrupt neuropsychiatric symptoms for S pyogenes (eg, throat culture, throat swab for S pyogenes PCR or antigen tests), current recommendations are to perform this test only for children who otherwise are recommended to undergo streptococcal diagnostic tests, and the AAP does not believe the data are strong enough to support universal testing of all cases of acute onset neuropsychiatric symptoms consistent with PANS, does not endorse universal GAS testing and subsequent antibiotic treatment of children who are positive, but for children who meet criteria for testing because of signs and symptoms consistent with current recommendations the AAP recommends testing and appropriate treatment; antistreptococcal serologic testing (antistreptolysin O and anti-DNase B) is not recommended to evaluate for GAS infection because of sensitivity/specificity limitations and titers are difficult to interpret.

### Prospective identification and treatment of children with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococcal infection (PANDAS) [^73e6b513]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Background The current diagnostic criteria for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococcal infection are pediatric onset, neuropsychiatric disorder and/or tic disorder; abrupt onset and/or episodic course of symptoms; association with group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infection; and association with neurological abnormalities. The working criteria for a diagnosis of PANDAS are presence of OCD and/or tic disorder; pediatric onset; abrupt onset and episodic course; association with GABHS infections; and association with neurological abnormalities, such as motoric hyperactivity, choreiform movements, or tics. 6, 7.

Subsequent patients with similar symptoms and severity were followed through the pediatric office without referral to psychiatric care. The severity of the illness was determined by parental report. All patients met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition16 criteria for severe OCD because they were unable to attend or function at school or child care. The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale17 criteria of time spent, interference, distress, resistance, and control over obsessions would place these children in the category of severe to extreme severity. Serologic testing Serologic tests for acute GABHS were conducted on 3 children. Titers for anti–DNase B were elevated above the laboratory reporting range for 2 patients at the onset of the neuropsychiatric episodes. Two patients also had elevated ASO titers at the time of the PANDAS diagnosis.

One patient was tested for antineuronal antibodies9 and they were detected. Although more than 60% of patients with rheumatic fever show significantly elevated ASO titers, those with chorea are less likely to exhibit elevated ASO titers, and multiple antibody tests, including anti–DNase B, may be needed to document bona fide GABHS infection. 2 When obtained, serologic test results showed the children had very elevated anti–DNase B and/or elevated ASO titers.

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy for PANDAS-related obsessive-compulsive disorder: findings from a preliminary waitlist controlled open trial [^c0c0b54b]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide preliminary estimates of the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) of the pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus (PANDAS) subtype.

Method

Seven children with OCD of the PANDAS subtype (range 9–13 years) were treated in a 3-week intensive CBT program conducted at a university clinic. Six of seven children were taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication(s) upon presentation. Assessments were conducted at four time points: baseline, pretreatment approximately 4 weeks later, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Raters were blind to the nature of the study treatment.

Results

Six of seven participants were classified as treatment responders (much or very much improved) at posttreatment, and three of six remained responders at follow-up. Clinician severity ratings, as measured by the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for DSM-IV Child Interview Schedule-Parent version, decreased significantly following intervention, with effect sizes of 3.38 and 2.29, respectively. Self-reported general anxiety and depression symptoms were not significantly reduced.

Conclusions

This study provides preliminary support for CBT in treating the PANDAS subtype of pediatric OCD. This approach is also considered a safe and minimally invasive treatment approach.

### Clinical and polysomnographic course of childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy [^8fa47eab]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

In previous observations, we have reported that childhood cataplexy is not characterized solely by peculiar hypotonic features, but also includes motor overactivity compared with control subjects. Some of these hyperkinetic features, such as choreic movements, were reminiscent of brain paediatric autoimmune post-streptococcal diseases and correlated with anti-streptolysin-O titres. These hyperkinetic movements should not be confused with the myoclonic features of cataplexy that have been documented in polygraphic studies in adults, subjectively reported by patients, and observed in our case series only at follow-up. The similarities between PANDAS (Paediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections), Sydenham's Chorea and childhood narcolepsy phenotypes include a partial remission over time and an association with biochemical evidence of past streptococcal infection. The non-significant decrease of anti-streptolysin-O over time that may be influenced by insufficient follow-up time given the evidence of higher anti-streptolysin-O in patients closer to narcolepsy with cataplexy onset, and by the limited number of patients in our series and by the relatively frequent occurrence of streptococcal infections in the paediatric population. Conversely, the enhancement of these active motor phenomena during emotional stimulation suggests a relation with genuine cataplexy and thus a distinct pathophysiological role of hypocretinergic interactions.

### Tourette's syndrome: a cross sectional study to examine the PANDAS hypothesis [^64d8bc26]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The classical neurological disorder after group A beta haemolytic streptococcal infection is Sydenham's chorea. Recently a tic disorder occurring after group A streptococcal infection has been described and termed PANDAS (paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection). It is proposed that antibodies induced after group A streptococcal infection react with basal ganglia neurones in Sydenham's chorea and PANDAS. Anti-basal ganglia antibodies (ABGA) are present in most cases of acute Sydenham's chorea, but rarely in controls.

Objective

To investigate the hypothesis that Tourette's syndrome may be associated with group A streptococcal infection and ABGA.

Methods

100 patients with Tourette's syndrome (DSM-IV-TR) were enrolled in a cross sectional study. Children with neurological disease (n = 50) and recent uncomplicated streptococcal infection (n = 40), adults with neurological disease (n = 50), and healthy adults (n = 50) were studied as controls. Recent group A streptococcal infection was defined using antistreptolysin O titre (ASOT). ABGA were detected using western immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence.

Results

ASOT was raised in 64% of children with Tourette's syndrome compared with 15% of paediatric neurological disease controls (p < 0.0001), and in 68% of adults with Tourette's syndrome compared with 12% of adult neurological controls and 8% of adult healthy controls (p < 0.05). Western immunoblotting showed positive binding in 20% of children and 27% of adults with Tourette's syndrome, compared with 2–4% of control groups (p < 0.05). The most common basal ganglia binding was to a 60 kDa antigen, similar to the proposed antigen in Sydenham's chorea. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed autoantibody binding to basal ganglia neurones. Serological evidence of recent group A streptococcal infection, assessed by a raised ASOT, was detected in 91% (21/23) of Tourette's syndrome patients with positive ABGA compared with 57% (44/77) with negative ABGA (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

The results support a role of group A streptococcal infection and basal ganglia autoimmunity in a subgroup of patients with Tourette's syndrome and suggest a pathogenic similarity between Sydenham's chorea and some patients with Tourette's syndrome.

### Antibodies from children with PANDAS bind specifically to striatal cholinergic interneurons and alter their activity [^1fc6567d]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) sometimes appears rapidly, even overnight, often after an infection. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections, or PANDAS, describes such a situation after infection with Streptococcus pyogenes. PANDAS may result from induced autoimmunity against brain antigens, although this remains unproven. Pilot work suggests that IgG antibodies from children with PANDAS bind to cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the striatum. CIN deficiency has been independently associated with tics in humans and with repetitive behavioral pathology in mice, making it a plausible locus of pathology. The authors sought to replicate and extend earlier work and to investigate the cellular effects of PANDAS antibodies on cholinergic interneurons.

Methods

Binding of IgG to specific neurons in human and mouse brain slices was evaluated ex vivo after incubation with serum from 27 children with rigorously characterized PANDAS, both at baseline and after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, and 23 matched control subjects. Binding was correlated with symptom measures. Neural activity after serum incubation was assessed in mouse slices using molecular markers and electrophysiological recording.

Results

IgG from children with PANDAS bound to CINs, but not to several other neuron types, more than IgG from control subjects, in three independent cohorts of patients. Post-IVIG serum had reduced IgG binding to CINs, and this reduction correlated with symptom improvement. Baseline PANDAS sera decreased activity of striatal CINs, but not of parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons, and altered their electrophysiological responses, in acute mouse brain slices. Post-IVIG PANDAS sera and IgG-depleted baseline sera did not alter the activity of striatal CINs.

Conclusions

These findings provide strong evidence for striatal CINs as a critical cellular target that may contribute to pathophysiology in children with rapid-onset OCD symptoms, and perhaps in other conditions.

### The cunningham panel: concerns remain [^efa13ecc]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

We thank the authors of the Connery paperfor their responseon the reliability of the Cunningham Panel. The panel is developed and marketed by Moleculera Labs as a diagnostic test for pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcus (PANDAS). Here we address some misconceptions raised by the authors and present new data.

First, the 21 healthy controls (median age 15 years) tested with the Cunningham Panel in our study were indeed healthy. None had ever been diagnosed with any psychiatric, motor, or autoimmune disorder. It is correct that we did not investigate previous infections or a "family history of psychiatric, autoimmune, or movement disorder". Notably, Moleculera does not warn clinicians that these factors may affect the results of the Cunningham Panel.

Second, we are criticized for using invalid serum collection tubes in the healthy controls and the retest part of our study. Moleculera recommends glass tubes with no additives for serum collection. At the time of our study, the instructions from the company that marketed the panel in Europe (Wieslab) stated that blood should be drawn in serum tubes, with or without a separator gel (i.e. Gold Top or Red Top tubes), contrary to Moleculera's instructions. Tubes with a serum separator gel are regarded as interchangeable with the tubes with no additive when measuring many antibodies, according to the tube manufacturer. Consequently, we have questioned whether the tubes used in our study affect the Cunningham Panel results. The reader should note that the main analysis of diagnostic accuracy was made using Cunningham Panel tests that were ordered and paid for by the patient's treating physicians, who presumably followed Wieslab's instructions, which included plastic tubes and gold top tubes.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sydenham chorea: consensus guidelines [^8cb203a0]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Sydenham chorea — differential diagnosis and phenotypic features note that SC should be differentiated from other poststreptococcal or postinfectious neuropsychiatric manifestations, that pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections or pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome is represented by tics and not by chorea, and that patients with SC typically have hypotonia or low muscle tone, including a rare but severe paralytic form known as chorea paralytica.

### Prospective longitudinal analysis of immune responses in pediatric subjects after pharyngeal acquisition of group A streptococci [^76a527da]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Subjects

Two previous studies designed to examine the possible association between GAS infection and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci (PANDAS) enrolled the original 160 subjects [. The subjects ranged in age from 6 to 15 years and were enrolled at multiple academic medical centers across the United States; the planned observation time was 108 weeks. The current study evaluated a subset of 41 subjects who experienced 51 new pharyngeal acquisitions of GAS during the 2-year study period. A new immunologically significant acquisition was defined as a throat culture that tested positive for an emm type of GAS that had not been isolated previously and was followed by an immune response to 1 or more antigens in the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) panel. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, the University of Minnesota, and the respective clinical sites that participated in the original studies.

Throat Cultures

Throat swabs were obtained on enrollment, every 4 weeks thereafter, and when the subjects showed any signs or symptoms of pharyngitis [. Swabs were sent to the University of Minnesota Streptococcal Reference Laboratory, where group A β-hemolytic streptococci were identified, grouped, and emm typed [.

Serum Samples

Serum samples were obtained on enrollment and every 13 weeks from each study subject. In the intervals between scheduled collections, signs and symptoms of pharyngitis resulted in an additional serum collection and an additional convalescent sample 4 to 6 weeks after the acute episode [.

### Anti-streptococcal, tubulin, and dopamine receptor 2 antibodies in children with PANDAS and tourette syndrome: single-point and longitudinal assessments [^82dcf79e]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2013). Low credibility.

Single-point-in-time ELISA optical densities for three putative antibodies identified in Sydenham's chorea, the streptococcal group A carbohydrate antigen, N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosamine, tubulin, and the dopamine 2 receptor, showed no differences in children with PANDAS (n = 44) or Tourette syndrome (n = 40) as compared to controls (n = 24). Anti-tubulin and D2 receptor antibodies assessed in serial samples from 12 PANDAS subjects obtained prior to a documented exacerbation, during the exacerbation (with or without a temporally associated streptococcal infection), and following the exacerbation, showed no evidence of antibody levels correlating with a clinical exacerbation. These data do not support hypotheses suggesting an autoimmune hypothesis in either TS or PANDAS.

### Oxidative stress and gut-derived lipopolysaccharides in children affected by paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections [^74e06c1f]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

To evaluate whether gut permeability can explain the LPS increase in PANDAS, we assessed the circulating levels of zonulin, which modulate gut permeability by disassembling the intercellular tight junctions. Previous studies showed that zonulin up-regulation increases gut permeability. The high serum levels of zonulin in PANDAS patients and its correlation with serum LPS provide the evidence that gut permeability is enhanced in this neuropsychiatric disorder and may be responsible for the increased circulating levels of LPS.

The study has some limitations. NOX2 and oxidative stress were studied in blood and not in the nervous system by biopsies. However, this procedure is unethical and invasive. Furthermore, we did not assess other NADPH isoforms, such as NOX1 and NOX4, which could also increase oxidative stress. The present study did not address the mechanism that contribute to the translocation of LPS from the gut microbiota to the central nervous system. However, changes in intestinal permeability may be a plausible mechanism, since an increase in serum zonulin is significantly correlated with blood LPS.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and obsessive-compulsive disease: a case report [^6d660b9b]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

It has been demonstrated that obsessive-compulsive disease and/or tic syndromes in children may be triggered by an antecedent infection especially with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, and this subgroup of children has been designated by the acronym PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections). Other infectious agents such as viruses and bacteria have also been reported to be associated with the acute onset or dramatic exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive disease or Tourette syndrome, and another acronym, PITAND (pediatric infection-triggered autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder) has appeared in the literature. The involvement of other infectious agents such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been described in single case reports. We describe a case of a 5.5-year-old boy who suddenly developed obsessive-compulsive disease symptoms during a M. pneumoniae pneumonia. After treatment with oral clarithromycin, all his obsessive-compulsive disease symptoms disappeared. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows the association between Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and obsessive-compulsive disease.

### Immunological causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: is it time for the concept of an "autoimmune OCD" subtype? [^38ee5947]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The recommendations elaborated here for autoimmune OCD are based on the consensus of emerging clinical evidence and expert experiences but not on systematic randomized studies. Future systematic research is required to validate the clinical predictive value of the proposed model. Similar developments in the research of AP in psychiatry and AE in neurology can serve as a role model. Diagnostic approaches such as the Cunningham panel for antibody testing in patients with PANDAS/PANS are still controversial. The well-characterized neuronal antibodies established in AE have rarely been investigated in the context of OCD. Therefore, antibody testing with established methods such as fixed cell-based assays, live cell-based assays, immunoblots, and/or indirect immunofluorescence on murine brain sections should be addressed in future studies with OCD patients. So far, children have accounted for the majority of patients with PANDAS/PANS, whereas only a few cases have been described in adults. RCTs for the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment approaches and immunotherapies for patients with PANDAS/PANS and autoimmune OCDs are necessary.

### Development of autoimmune diseases among children with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome [^d4354146]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our data collection did not include reviewing the electronic medical record for all tender joints. Instead, we focused our review on clinical features that distinguished this patient population from typical cohorts with JIA (ie, DIP joint tenderness, spinous process tenderness). We plan on reporting the full 66 swollen and 68 tender joint count, and the Mander enthesitis index at clinical presentation and the evolution of the arthritis in this cohort. We plan to do a cluster analysis and predictor analysis to understand the findings of DIP joint tenderness and nail pitting. This analysis will include controlling for confounding variables including pain amplification (using the American College of Rheumatology fibromyalgia tool measured at every visit for the past decade).

Limitations

This study has some limitations. We did not have a control sample to make a direct comparison, but this is a planned future project dependent on funding. We did not study medications that might be associated with risk of arthritis, but this will be a future study. Our study is limited by missing data. Changes in our clinical standards and the complexity of the childrens' psychiatric presentation challenged the completion of comprehensive testing and examinations. We initially focused on infectious triggers of PANS or PANDAS and performed rheumatologic examinations only for children with joint pain. As we learned that children were underreporting joint symptoms, we standardized our evaluations to include a comprehensive rheumatologic evaluation. Laboratory data were missed for children with needle phobia, small blood volume due to young age, challenging behavior, and/or lack of insurance. Thus, our results are likely more accurate for recent and older patients and those with less-severe psychiatric illness. Although our findings may be relevant to other postinfectious neuropsychiatric conditions, the results should not be generalized beyond patients with PANS.

### Immunology of obsessive-compulsive disorder [^347aa557]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Childhood OCD often develops into a chronic illness that lasts decades. Proof that some type of immunotherapy (such as antibiotic prophylaxis) could significantly reduce recurrence or exacerbation of symptoms of OC or tics would suggest a supportive role for immune triggers in the onset or worsening of these conditions and provide additional tools for improving outcome. The validity of PANDAS will continue to be questioned, however, because demonstrating a clear causation will be difficult on a background ofa common childhood illness. Along with the previously mentioned immuno-therapy study, validation of the PANDAS phenotype (broadly interpreted)would be advanced from new and continued research in the following areas: (1) prospective studies to identify infectious triggers in the onset and exacerbations of OCD spectrum disorders, (2) biological measures for immune and genetic susceptibility, and (3) large scale epidemiological studies demonstrating the relationship between infection and OCD spectrum disorders. The assimilation of these study results should allow for elucidation of the immune system's role in the onset and maintenance of OCD.

### Sydenham chorea and PANDAS in south Africa: review of evidence and recommendations for management in resource-poor countries [^3be51ad4]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

In South Africa, and worldwide, rheumatic fever represents a public health problem. Improved diagnosis and management of Sydenham chorea, a major manifestation of acute rheumatic fever is key to prevention of rheumatic heart disease. This article reviews Sydenham chorea from its original description to current opinions. Recommendations are founded on expert opinion as class 1 data is lacking. This South African perspective is relevant to resource-poor settings globally insofar as it provides diagnosis and management recommendations for primary- and secondary-level healthcare professionals who care for patients in such environments. Four basic tenets of care are recommended, namely, elimination of the streptococcal infection, symptomatic treatment, immunological treatment, and nonpharmacologic interventions. A user-friendly outcome measurement tool, viable for use in low-resource settings is presented. Introduction of this tool may lead to increased awareness of the neuropsychiatric manifestations of poststreptococcal movement disorders in Africa, where reports are limited.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^9a2c5dc8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) etiology in youth — genetic studies show that concordance rates for monozygotic twins are significantly higher than for dizygotic twins, and family studies demonstrate familial aggregation with a risk for OCD of almost 12% in first-degree relatives of adult probands and age-corrected morbid risk from 24% to 26% in relatives of pediatric probands; linkage signals include susceptibility loci on chromosomes 1q, 3q, 6q, 7p, 9p, 10p, and 15q, and glutamate receptor/modulating genes may be associated with OCD. Nongenetic influences are emphasized: even among monozygotic twins OCD is not fully concordant, nonheritable etiologic factors are as great or greater than genetic factors for the risk of developing OCD, many cases are sporadic without a positive family history, and studies have focused on perinatal exposures (intrauterine including potential teratogens such as alcohol and tobacco, birth, and postnatal) and immune-mediated neuropsychiatric models. PANDAS is described as controversial, with a hypothesized immune response to group A b-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) producing basal ganglia inflammation and a distinct neurobehavioral syndrome that includes OCD, tics, and perhaps hyperactivity.

### Association of pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with microstructural differences in brain regions detected via diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging [^f3eace7a]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

By definition, PANS includes not only PANDAS but also early, abrupt-onset OCD associated with other infectious and noninfectious triggers. A comprehensive diagnostic workup must be performed to rule out other known differential diagnoses, such as Sydenham chorea, Tourette syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Current recommended diagnostic testing targets inflammatory biomarkers given the link between OCD disorders and autoimmunity observed in epidemiological studies. Symptoms of PANS and PANDAS are hypothesized to result from cross-reactive antibodies that breach a compromised blood-brain barrier and damage neuronal tissues in the basal ganglia and amygdala. However, some studies, have reported poor predictive value (17%-40% for positive predictive value and 44%-74% for negative predictive value) and low test performance (15%-60% sensitivity and 28%-92% specificity) for standard PANS diagnostic evaluations, including inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and antibody titers. There remains a pressing need for reliable biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy and validate the underlying pathophysiology of PANS.

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) could potentially serve as a noninvasive tool for assessing microstructural differences of the brain in children with a suspected inflammatory cause of abrupt-onset OCD. Although prior research has identified volumetric and inflammatory changes in the basal ganglia, no studies to our knowledge have yet assessed cerebral blood flow (CBF), which may be associated with local inflammation, or the mean diffusivity or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which measures the magnitude of water molecule diffusion within tissue. In the setting of neuroinflammation, ADC is expected to increase because of water molecules diffusing freely throughout the extracellular space. Herein, a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was conducted of regional brain volume, ADC, and CBF differences across various brain regions in patients with PANS and in pediatric control participants. It was hypothesized that affected children would exhibit higher diffusivity compared with control participants in the deep gray matter (eg, thalamus, basal ganglia, and limbic structures) given the predominant symptoms of OCD, emotional dysregulation, and sleep disturbances. We expected limited volumetric or CBF differences because of patient group heterogeneity in the timing of imaging after an acute flare in neuropsychiatric symptoms.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^173ad4e9]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

PANS and autoimmune encephalitis — PANS and AE are not the same, and the 2 conditions have different diagnostic criteria, treatment recommendations, and testing and diagnostic workups; children with AE present with acute or subacute (usually less than 3 months) onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms attributable to an underlying abnormal immune response of the central nervous system (CNS). The diagnostic criteria for pediatric seronegative AE require evidence of inflammation within the CNS by examination of the cerebrospinal fluid or magnetic resonance imaging, and when a pathogenic antibody is identified in the serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid patients are described as seropositive AE, whereas absence of such an antibody is described as seronegative AE; AE symptoms persist over time, differing from the relapsing-remitting course observed with PANS, and the vast majority of children with AE demonstrate some degree of cognitive impairment whereas most children with PANS demonstrate normal cognition on formal testing.

### Youth with severe mental illness and complex non-somatic motor abnormalities: conflicting conceptualizations and unequal treatment [^367278d1]. Npj Mental Health Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The methodology used for bibliographical network analysis is described in detail below.

The global literature about PANS and pediatric catatonia was extracted from the online database Web of Science, date 2021–11–07. The following search terms were applied to all searchable fields using one query to identify the closest matching publications: "Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome", "Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections", "Paediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome", "Paediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections", "PANS/PANDAS", "pediatric"+"catatonia", "paediatric"+"catatonia", "catatonia"+"adolescent", "catatonia"+"adolescence" or "catatonia"+"childhood". 568 scientific articles were extracted with full records and cited references. The Vosviewer (previously described in greater detail elsewhere,) was implemented to perform a direct citation analysis of the extracted data, establishing linkages between scientific papers based on whether or not one cites the other.

In the citation analysis, we focused on the most influential research pertaining to the two topics and specified the minimum number of citations for inclusion of a document to 30. Of the 568 documents, 98 met this threshold. As some of these were not related to each other, only 89 documents in total, the largest set of connected items, were shown in the resulting visualization. In the direct citation visualization, the value for scale was set at 1, item (i.e. document) size was determined by total link strength, coloring of items was chosen according to clusters with the color scheme Viridis and size variation of items was set at 0.5. Size variation for links was set at 1, with a minimum strength of 0 and a maximum strength of 1000. We allowed curved links in our analysis. Normalization was determined by association strength. The settings for "attraction" and "repulsion" in the layout were 2 and 1, respectively. The clustering was done at a resolution of 1 with a minimum cluster size of 1. Small clusters were merged for visualization purposes. We recommend these settings for optimal viewing.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^9a2b04de]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Family history — The family history may be contributory but is not conclusive for supporting the diagnosis of PANS or suggesting other diagnoses, and first-degree relatives of patients with PANS have been reported to have increased rates of OCD, tics, acute rheumatic fever, and maternal autoimmune disorders, although it is not known whether these conditions suggest a genetic cause of PANS versus heightened recognition in such families.

### COVID-19 patient transcriptomic and genomic profiling reveals comorbidity interactions with psychiatric disorders [^43a72250]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 can enter many cell types, including neurons, by interacting with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)and there are plausible pathological mechanisms by which CNS function could be affected. There are documented pathogen-triggered acute psychiatric manifestations, for example, the paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with Streptococcus (PANDAS), characterised by sudden-onset severe tics, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and other debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms. This is thought to be the result of autoimmune antibodies mistakenly targeting basal ganglia antigens instead of the intended bacterial antigen and producing antinuclear antibodies triggering the onset of symptoms. Dysregulated immune responses to infection and resulting neuroinflammation are documented to cause or exacerbate neurological dysfunction. Further, both psychological distress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the stress of being infected may activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system, with consequent release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines. Glucocorticoids affect many aspects of general physiology and behaviour, and their immunosuppressive effects have been postulated as contributing to PTSD symptoms via the HPA axis changes, which in turn may exacerbate both emotional dysregulation and physical comorbidities.

Pathogenic influences on brain functions may also act via other mechanisms, as dysregulations in immune function resulting from neuroendocrine interactions with aspects of the immune systems may unmask predispositions to infectious and inflammatory diseases. In the example of PTSD, resulting in HPA axis dysregulation alongside impaired glucocorticoid signalling can give rise to a pro-inflammatory state that may lead to cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are also linked to immune dysfunction, with both disorders carrying a higher risk of developing respiratory diseases. Individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders have already been noted to have increased risks of infection and poorer health outcomes amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

These lines of evidence suggest that COVID-19 infection may share pathological determinants with some psychiatric disorders through which they may interact. Such interactions can be examined by studying cellular pathways that are altered in these conditions and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. To address these issues we applied computational and bioinformatics approaches to study SARS-CoV-2 blood cell and immune panel transcriptome and GWAS data. These studies identified SARS-CoV-2 acute response genes concordant with bipolar disorder, PTSD and schizophrenia. For these genes, we performed extensive functional analyses, and then applied data mining approaches to identify validated biomarkers in order to determine how SARS-CoV-2 response genes and pathways may interact with these three psychiatric disorders.

### Immunological causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: is it time for the concept of an "autoimmune OCD" subtype? [^b6a0a1b6]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 5 provides an overview of the presently suggested syndromal criteria for autoimmune OCD compared with established ICD-10/11 and DSM-5 classification criteria for OCD, as well as PANDAS/PANS criteria. Notably, specific criteria for autoimmune forms of OCD in adults do not exist yet.

Table 5
Diagnostic criteria following ICD-10/11 and DSM-5 in comparison with PANDAS/PANS and suggested autoimmune OCD criteria [9,34;].

ICD International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, DSM Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder, EEG electroencephalography, MRI magnetic resonance imaging.

In the future, the detection of novel neuronal antibodies associated with OCD could play a relevant role in the diagnosis of autoimmune OCD, which has proven fruitful in the case of psychoses. Noteworthy, little is known about the link between T cell responses and OCD. This field should be investigated and will likely improve our understanding of the disease. Finally, identified autoimmune OCD forms can have direct implications for the treatment of OCD and require specific treatment regimens beyond standard-of-care treatment (Fig. 3). Based on possible, probable, and definite autoimmune OCD criteria, treatment approaches for autoimmune OCD could be developed based on the diagnostic certainty of an autoimmune cause because of a multimodal diagnostic evaluation (and not only based on the severity of the symptoms, which has been recommended for PANDAS syndrome so far). Depending on the diagnostic certainty, one could then proceed with a treatment using immunotherapies and escalate in analogy to the situation in AE and AP. This could imply, for example, that even a patient with moderate symptoms who meets the criteria for definite autoimmune OCD would receive immunotherapy. The role of the psychiatrists is central in the diagnostics and in evaluating treatment response in this patient group, and concrete treatment approaches should be developed with multidisciplinary consulting teams, including psychiatrists, neurologists, neuroimmunologists, rheumatologists, and infectiologists. Personalized treatment approaches based on clinical criteria for possible, probable, or definite autoimmune OCD could prevent undertreatment and chronification while also avoiding unnecessary immunotherapies that are not without (potentially very serious) side effects and are sometimes requested by worried patients and relatives because of "non-specific" findings – to this extent it is crucial that any proposed criteria are validated vis a vis their sensitivity and specificity in identifying immunotherapy-responsive cases of OCD. The first clinical trials are already investigating the effects of immunotherapies, such as rituximab, in autoimmune OCD subtypes. Based on the experience of patients with AE/AP and other neuroimmunological disorders, it can be assumed that immunotherapy in patients with clear autoimmune causes can lead to an improvement in prognosis.

### Complex movement disorders at disease onset in childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy [^b0f36c7e]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

The association between 'active' motor phenomena and evidence of recent streptococcal infection was the second notable finding of this study. We wish to indicate that the cases reported in this study occurred prior to 2009–10, and thus are unlikely to involve H1N1 vaccination or the H1N1 pandemic previously involved in selected cases. Indeed, the H1N1 pandemic reached Italy only in May 2009 and none of our cases occurred after H1N1 vaccination. Rather, increased diagnosis in our Sleep Disorders Center may reflect increased awareness of narcolepsy with cataplexy linked to a media campaign by the Italian association of narcoleptic patients. Group A β-haemolytic streptococcus infections have been reported as possible environmental triggers for narcolepsy with cataplexy by several studies. In this context, childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy could be therefore considered related to brain autoimmune post-streptococcal diseases such as Sydenham's chorea, obsessive-compulsive disorder, tics and PANDAS. All these conditions share an episodic course, a childhood-onset with acute presentation, and coexistence of motor and behavioural symptoms. It is also notable that when narcolepsy with cataplexy is misdiagnosed, a choreiform movement disorder is often proposed as the cause: PANDAS and Sydenham's chorea were previous diagnoses in our case series and an initial diagnosis of Huntington's chorea was reported in the first paediatric case series. Moreover, typical characteristics of narcolepsy with cataplexy are reported in Sydenham's chorea, such as being 'clumsy', 'withdrawn', 'troubled', 'day-dreaming', 'transient intellectual impairment' and 'having nightmares'. Strikingly, motor impersistence demonstrated by ptosis or tongue protrusion is a common sign in Sydenham's chorea, a condition also frequently associated with grimacing and hypotonia, and recurs in 'cataplectic facies'. Finally, the motor signs of Sydenham's chorea tend to vanish within a few years from onset in most cases, mirroring our cross-sectional observation in narcolepsy with cataplexy. Whether or not the choreic features of recent-onset narcolepsy genuinely reflect a post-streptococcal disorder deserves additional investigation.
