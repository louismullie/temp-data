## Question

What are potential causes of chest pressure in the supine position?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential causes of chest pressure in the supine position. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about terminology and whether "chest pressure" refers to a symptom or to pleural/intrathoracic pressure. Then, I should review gravitational-hemodynamic shifts that occur when lying flat. Next, I will examine abdominal–diaphragmatic mechanics and their effect on pleural pressure. After that, I should analyze pleural pressure gradients and dependent lung collapse in supine ARDS. I will then consider special populations such as obesity and the impact of trunk inclination in ventilated patients. Finally, I will synthesize these mechanisms clinically and highlight key exceptions and implications for positioning strategies, including prone positioning in ARDS [^113bdgdb].

> Let me first confirm the terminology so we don't talk past each other. "Chest pressure" in the physiologic literature typically means pleural or intrathoracic pressure, not the subjective sensation of heaviness or tightness; that distinction matters because posture directly changes pleural pressure but may not always correlate with perceived symptoms, especially in sedated or ventilated patients; I should also note that respiratory swings and end-expiratory levels need careful interpretation when measuring vascular pressures, since end-expiratory lung volume and expiratory muscle activity can artifactually raise intrathoracic pressures in some states, particularly with obstruction or hyperinflation [^113bdgdb] [^114Yd7KL].

> Now, the primary gravitational-hemodynamic effect: when moving from upright to supine, venous return increases and intrathoracic blood volume rises, which increases intrathoracic (pleural) pressure; this is supported by studies showing increased intrathoracic blood volume and even increased DLCO in healthy subjects supine due to greater alveolar capillary recruitment, a hemodynamic shift that logically elevates pleural pressures in the horizontal position; wait, let me verify — yes, the systematic review explicitly notes increased intrathoracic blood volume supine, consistent with this mechanism [^113bdgdb].

> Next, I will examine abdominal–diaphragmatic mechanics. In supine, the abdominal contents shift cephalad, loading the diaphragm; this reduces diaphragmatic strength and efficiency and increases the work of breathing during inspiration, especially during maximal efforts, and can promote dynamic hyperinflation with higher end-expiratory pleural pressures in susceptible patients; hold on, that might sound contradictory with reports that supine-flat can sometimes improve compliance in ARDS — let me reconcile that: pleural pressure can indeed rise in supine due to abdominal loading, which can lower transpulmonary pressure in nondependent regions and reduce overdistension even as absolute intrathoracic pressure increases, so both observations can be true depending on which pressure (pleural versus transpulmonary) and region we are considering [^113bdgdb] [^117SMXcP].

> I will now examine pleural pressure gradients in the supine position, especially relevant to ARDS. Supine posture establishes a vertical pleural pressure gradient with higher pleural pressures in dependent dorsal regions; these dependent regions are compressed by superimposed weight from the edematous lung, mediastinum, and heart and tend to collapse, while ventral nondependent regions see higher transpulmonary pressures and risk overdistension; this heterogeneity increases airway and plateau pressures and promotes ventilator-induced lung injury, the "sponge model" explaining why proning redistributes mass and pressure more homogeneously to improve oxygenation and lower injurious strain [^114ZFSN6] [^111DsvyB].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with obesity. In critically ill obese patients supine at zero PEEP, expiratory flow limitation is common with substantial auto-PEEP on the order of 10–12.5 cm H2O, reflecting elevated pleural pressures and air trapping from chest wall and abdominal loading; applied PEEP and sitting can reverse flow limitation and reduce intrinsic PEEP; I should confirm the magnitude — yes, the cohort showed markedly higher auto-PEEP in obese patients versus controls, which is a practical example of increased "chest pressure" generation in supine due to load transmission from the abdomen and chest wall [^112QpVFh].

> Hold on, I should also review the paradox reported with trunk inclination in ARDS, because it informs how "chest pressure" and transpulmonary pressure diverge. Several studies in COVID-19 and classical ARDS show that moving from semirecumbent to supine-flat can improve respiratory system and lung compliance and reduce driving and transpulmonary pressures, likely by decreasing end-expiratory lung volume in ventral regions and relieving overdistension; importantly, this improvement does not contradict higher pleural pressures in supine, because increased pleural pressure can lower regional transpulmonary pressure and thus reduce overdistension while the absolute intrathoracic pressure is higher; this nuanced interaction is posture- and phenotype-dependent and more pronounced in obesity [^117SMXcP] [^113eit9Q] [^111iWGD8].

> Next, I should review the interaction with mechanical ventilation and atelectrauma. When pleural pressure in dependent lung exceeds airway pressure, transpulmonary pressure becomes negative locally, predisposing to small airway closure and cyclic opening and closing, driving "atelectrauma"; esophageal manometry–guided strategies target nonnegative end-expiratory transpulmonary pressures to mitigate this, emphasizing that in supine, dorsal pleural pressures can be sufficiently high to require PEEP adjustments to maintain patency; wait, I need to check if this has been shown across asymmetric injuries — yes, both experimental and translational data support vertical pleural pressure gradients and the value of transpulmonary pressure guidance in heterogenous lungs [^113qTyW9].

> But wait, what about conditions primarily driven by upper airway mechanics rather than pleural pressure. In obstructive sleep apnea, the supine position worsens airway collapse and raises the supine AHI relative to nonsupine, an effect largely due to upper airway geometry and collapsibility rather than intrathoracic pressure per se; positional therapy and CPAP are guideline-supported in positional OSA, and this positional dependence is also observed in infants, though etiologies differ with age, reminding me not to conflate airway and pleural pressure mechanisms when interpreting "chest pressure" in supine sleepers [^114mYWBp] [^1141cLMa] [^1121jdgj].

> I should double-check clinical implications for ARDS since they hinge on these pressure distributions. Prone positioning is recommended in moderate-to-severe ARDS to reduce mortality and improve oxygenation by reversing the supine pleural pressure gradient, unloading dorsal lung, improving ventilation–perfusion matching, and homogenizing stress and strain; early trials showed physiologic oxygenation benefits, and subsequent high-quality RCTs demonstrated survival advantages in severe ARDS, aligning with guideline recommendations that prefer prone over supine in that context [^1121VZjA] [^111ob81x] [^111d46W7] [^111DsvyB].

> Pulling this together, the potential causes of increased chest pressure in the supine position include the following interlocking mechanisms: 1) gravitational hemodynamics increasing intrathoracic blood volume and thereby pleural pressure; 2) cephalad displacement of abdominal contents loading the diaphragm, diminishing diaphragmatic strength, and elevating pleural pressure especially at end expiration; 3) establishment of a vertical pleural pressure gradient with dependent dorsal compression, collapse, and regional heterogeneity that raises measured airway and plateau pressures; 4) in obesity, pronounced chest wall and abdominal load causing expiratory flow limitation and auto-PEEP; and 5) during mechanical ventilation, high dependent pleural pressures can render transpulmonary pressure negative and promote atelectrauma, necessitating posture- and PEEP-adjusted strategies; importantly, while supine often raises pleural pressure, it can simultaneously lower regional transpulmonary pressure and reduce overdistension in selected ARDS phenotypes, which explains reports of improved compliance in supine-flat and underscores the need for individualized assessment of pleural versus transpulmonary pressures when interpreting "chest pressure" in clinical practice [^113bdgdb] [^114ZFSN6] [^112QpVFh] [^113qTyW9] [^117SMXcP].

Chest pressure when lying flat is most often due to **heart failure** (orthopnea from pulmonary congestion), **obstructive sleep apnea** (supine airway collapse) [^114mYWBp], or **gastroesophageal reflux** (supine acid reflux). Other causes include obesity [^112QpVFh], anxiety, and less commonly pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, or mediastinal masses. Supine positioning increases **venous return** and intrathoracic blood volume [^113bdgdb], reduces lung volumes [^113bdgdb], and promotes reflux, all of which can cause or worsen chest pressure. Evaluation should include **history, exam, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography, and sleep studies** as indicated [^114mYWBp]; management targets the underlying cause and may include head-of-bed elevation, weight loss, CPAP, or medications.

## Physiological mechanisms

Several **physiological mechanisms** contribute to chest pressure in the supine position:

- **Increased venous return**: Supine positioning increases venous return and intrathoracic blood volume, potentially causing pulmonary congestion and chest pressure, especially in heart failure [^113bdgdb].

- **Reduced lung volumes**: Supine positioning reduces lung volumes and functional residual capacity, increasing airway resistance and work of breathing, contributing to chest discomfort [^113bdgdb].

- **Diaphragmatic displacement**: Abdominal contents shift cephalad in supine position, reducing diaphragmatic excursion and increasing respiratory effort, particularly in obesity or diaphragmatic weakness [^113bdgdb].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux**: Supine positioning facilitates acid reflux, causing esophageal irritation and chest pressure.

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough **diagnostic evaluation** is essential to identify the underlying cause:

- **Clinical history and physical examination**: Detailed history and examination to identify risk factors and clinical signs.

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To assess for cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias.

- **Chest X-ray**: To evaluate for pulmonary congestion, pleural effusion, or mediastinal masses.

- **Echocardiography**: To assess cardiac function and detect pericardial effusion.

- **Polysomnography**: Sleep study to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea [^114mYWBp].

- **Esophageal pH monitoring**: To diagnose gastroesophageal reflux disease.

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Heart failure**: Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, lifestyle modifications, and head-of-bed elevation.

- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), weight loss, positional therapy [^114mYWBp] [^1141cLMa].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease**: Proton pump inhibitors, lifestyle modifications, head-of-bed elevation.

- **Obesity**: Weight loss, dietary modifications, exercise.

- **Anxiety disorders**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, anxiolytic medications.

- **Pericardial or pleural effusion**: Medical management or surgical intervention as indicated.

Chest pressure when lying flat is commonly due to heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea [^114mYWBp], gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115XXNJ4], obesity [^113bdgdb], anxiety disorders, and less frequently pericardial or pleural effusion, or mediastinal masses. Supine positioning increases venous return, reduces lung volumes [^113bdgdb], and facilitates acid reflux, contributing to chest pressure. Accurate **diagnosis** and targeted **management** are essential for symptom relief [^1126FLaz].

### The effect of body position on pulmonary function: A systematic review [^113bdgdb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Diaphragmatic strength is negatively affected by the supine position, and intrathoracic blood volume is increased. These factors lead to decreased PEmax and PEF in the supine position.

In side-lying positions (RSL or LSL), when the bed is flat, the abdominal contents fall forward. The dependent hemi-diaphragm is stretched to a good length for tension generation, while the nondependent hemi-diaphragm is more flattened. Changes in lung volumes may thus balance themselves out due to a better diaphragmatic contraction but decreased space in the thorax.

The decreased PImax observed in the supine position could be related to diaphragm overload by abdominal content displacement during maximal inspiratory effort, which could offset improved diaphragm position on the length-tension curve. In addition, the length of all other inspiratory muscles may become less optimal in the supine position.

In patients with cervical spinal cord injury and high tetraplegia, PEF was found to be higher in the supine vs. sitting position, corresponding to the increase in FVC and FEV1 in the supine position.

In healthy subjects, most studies showed an increase in DLCO in the supine vs. sitting position. This improvement is attributed to the moderate increase in alveolar blood volume in the supine position due to recruitment of the lung capillary bed on transition from upright to supine. Age may attenuate this increase, which may explain why a study that included participants with a mean age of 61 found no difference in DLCO between sitting and supine.

In side-lying positions, the heart weighs on one lung, compressing both of its sections.

### The influence of postural changes on gastroesophageal reflux and barrier pressure in nonfasting individuals [^115XXNJ4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

There is controversy regarding optimal body positioning (i.e. head-up, head-down) in awake nonfasting individuals to minimize the risk for pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents as a result of gastroesophageal reflux (GER). In the present study, we investigated GER and intragastric-esophageal barrier pressure by means of multichannel intraluminal impedance measurement and intragastric-esophageal manometry in awake, nonfasting volunteers randomly positioned in a 20 degrees head-up position, the supine position, and a 20 degrees head-down position. No significant difference among positions was found with respect to the number of GER episodes per person (0/1/1) or intragastric-esophageal barrier pressure (15.6/19.6/19.4 mm Hg). We conclude that specific body positioning is useless in the prophylaxis of GER in awake nonfasting individuals.

- **Implications**: Tilting of nonfasting individuals to the head-up or head-down position recommended for prevention of regurgitation of gastric contents does not influence the frequency of gastroesophageal reflux.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to positional therapy, the ERS 2021 guidelines recommend considering offering either positional therapy using vibratory devices or CPAP in adult patients with mild or moderate position-dependent OSA. This is defined by a supine apnea-hypopnea index at least twice as high as the nonsupine apnea-hypopnea index, and no relevant nonsupine apnea-hypopnea index (< 15 events/hour).

Regarding preventative measures for pressure ulcers, specifically in relation to repositioning, the WHS 2024 guidelines recommend adjusting the repositioning and turning frequency for patients receiving palliative care. This adjustment should be based on the patient's goals, comfort, and tolerance, adopting a flexible, individualized schedule. It is important to recognize that many patients may prefer maintaining a single position for comfort, particularly during the active dying phase.

### Prone positioning in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111ob81x]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The study PROSEVA, published by Guerin C and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med, is related to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The trial question was: what is the role of prone positioning in patients with severe ARDS? This study utilized a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. It involved 466 patients (148 female, 318 male), with inclusion criteria being patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for severe ARDS. Key exclusion criteria were contraindications for prone positioning, lung transplantation, underlying disease with a life expectancy of less than one year, or an end-of-life decision before inclusion.

- **Interventions**:
	- Patients were divided into two groups: 237 performed prone-positioning sessions (within the first hour after randomization for at least 16 consecutive hours), while 229 remained in a standard semirecumbent supine position.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- There was a significant decrease in death at 28 days (16% vs. 32.8%; HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.63).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in death at 90 days (23.6% vs. 41%; HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.67).
	- Significant decrease in successful extubation at 90 days (80.5% vs. 65%; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.7).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- There were no significant differences in the overall incidence of complications, except for cardiac arrest, which was more common in the supine group.

The conclusion of the PROSEVA study was that in patients undergoing prone positioning for severe ARDS, the intervention significantly improved outcomes compared to standard treatment.

### Transpulmonary pressure-guided ventilation to attenuate atelectrauma and hyperinflation in acute lung injury [^113qTyW9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The inherent appeal of using esophageal manometry to guide positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration lies in its ability to distinguish lung from chest wall mechanics. Transpulmonary pressure is calculated as the pressure measured at the airway opening minus the pleural pressure, which is typically estimated via esophageal manometry. Lung injury termed "atelectrauma" may occur from high regional forces generated repeatedly during cyclic closure and reopening of small airways during tidal ventilation. Negative transpulmonary pressure values, where pleural pressure exceeds airway pressure, predispose to small airways closure and cause lung injury. In preclinical models, this is attenuated with higher PEEP.

In this issue of the Journal, Bastia and colleagues highlight the potential for esophageal manometry to estimate transpulmonary pressure even in asymmetric lung injury. In their study, invasively ventilated pigs were subjected to unilateral lung injury via surfactant lavage and high tidal stretch, instituted with temporary endobronchial blockade occluding the contralateral lung. After injury was established, the bronchial blocker was removed, and respiratory mechanics were assessed in both hemithoraces at different levels of PEEP. Pleural pressure was measured directly using air-filled balloon catheters inserted into the ventral and dorsal pleural spaces of the left and right hemithoraces. It was also estimated with esophageal manometry. Electrical impedance tomography was used to evaluate heterogeneous insufflation.

Vertical pleural pressure gradients were observed as previously described.

### Effects of sitting position and applied positive end-expiratory pressure on respiratory mechanics of critically ill obese patients receiving mechanical ventilation [^112QpVFh]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the extent to which sitting position and applied positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improve the respiratory mechanics of severely obese patients under mechanical ventilation.

- **Design**: Prospective cohort study.

- **Settings**: A 15-bed ICU of a tertiary hospital.

- **Participants**: Fifteen consecutive critically ill patients with a body mass index (BMI — the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) above 35 were compared to 15 controls with a BMI less than 30.

- **Interventions**: Respiratory mechanics were first assessed in the supine position at zero end-expiratory pressure and then at positive end-expiratory pressure set at the level of auto-positive end-expiratory pressure. All measures were then repeated in the sitting position.

- **Measurements and main results**: Assessment of respiratory mechanics included plateau pressure, auto-positive end-expiratory pressure, and flow-limited volume during manual compression of the abdomen. These were expressed as a percentage of tidal volume to evaluate expiratory flow limitation. In the supine position at zero end-expiratory pressure, all critically ill obese patients demonstrated expiratory flow limitation (flow-limited volume, 59.4% [51.3–81.4%] vs. 0% [0–0%] in controls; p < 0.0001) and greater auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (10 [5–12.5] vs. 0.7 [0.4–1.25] cm H2O in controls; p < 0.0001). Applied positive end-expiratory pressure reverses expiratory flow limitation (flow-limited volume, 0% [0–21%] vs. 59.4% [51–81.4%] at zero end-expiratory pressure; p < 0.001) in almost all the obese patients.

### Manual versus mechanical chest compressions on surfaces of varying softness with or without backboards: A randomized, crossover manikin study [^114c76eL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Chest compression quality is decisive for the overall outcome after cardiac arrest. Chest compression depth may decrease when cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is performed on a mattress, and the use of a backboard does not necessarily improve compression depth. Mechanical chest compression devices may overcome this problem.

- **Objectives**: We sought to investigate the effectiveness of manual chest compressions both with and without a backboard compared to mechanical CPR performed on surfaces of different softness.

- **Methods**: Twenty-four advanced life support (ALS)-certified rescuers were enrolled. The LUCAS2 (Physio-Control, Redmond, WA) delivers 52 ± 2 mm deep chest compressions and active decompressions back to the neutral position (frequency 102 min(-1); duty cycle, 50%). This simulated CPR scenario was performed on a Resusci-Anne manikin (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) that was lying on three different surfaces: 1) a concrete floor, 2) a firm standard mattress, and 3) a pressure-relieving mattress. Data were recorded by the Laerdal Skill Reporting System.

- **Results**: Manual chest compression with or without a backboard was performed correctly less often than mechanical chest compressions (floor: 33% [interquartile range {IQR}, 27–48%] vs. 90% [IQR, 86–94%], p < 0.001; standard mattress: 32% [IQR, 20–45%] vs. 27% [IQR, 14–46%] vs. 91% [IQR, 51–94%], p < 0.001; and pressure-relieving mattress 29% [IQR, 17–49%] vs. 30% [IQR, 17–52%] vs. 91% [IQR, 87–95%], p < 0.001). The mean compression depth on both mattresses was deeper with mechanical chest compressions.

### Positioning for acute respiratory distress in hospitalised infants and children [^114w1SZJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Because of the association of prone positioning with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), it is recommended that young infants be placed on their backs (supine). However, the prone position may be a non-invasive method of increasing oxygenation in participants with acute respiratory distress. Due to substantial differences in respiratory mechanics between adults and children, and the risk of SIDS in young infants, a specific review of positioning for infants and young children with acute respiratory distress is warranted.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of different body positions in hospitalised infants and children with acute respiratory distress.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 3), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (1966 to April week 1, 2012), EMBASE (2004 to April 2012), and CINAHL (2004 to April 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or pseudo-RCTs comparing two or more positions in the management of infants and children hospitalised with acute respiratory distress.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data from each study. We resolved differences by consensus or referral to a third review author. We analysed bivariate outcomes using an odds ratio and a 95% confidence interval (CI). We analysed continuous outcomes using a mean difference and a 95% CI. We used a fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was significant, in which case we used a random-effects model.

### Northera [^111nLbg1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

**Warning: Supine hypertension**: Monitor supine blood pressure prior to and during treatment, and more frequently when increasing doses. Elevating the head of the bed lessens the risk of supine hypertension, and blood pressure should be measured in this position. If supine hypertension cannot be managed by elevation of the head of the bed, reduce or discontinue Northera [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Body position changes redistribute lung computed-tomographic density in patients with acute respiratory failure: impact and clinical fallout through the following 20 years [^114ZFSN6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while in the supine position, there is a decrease of inflation along the sternum-vertebral axis, leading to lung collapse. In 1991, a report was published showing that in ARDS patients, shifting from supine to prone position led immediately to the inversion of the inflation gradient and to a redistribution of densities from dorsal to ventral lung regions. This resulted in the development of a "sponge model", where a wet sponge, similar to a heavy edematous lung, squeezes out the gas in the most dependent regions due to the weight-related increase of the compressive forces.

The sponge model accounts for density distribution in the prone position. In this model, the unloaded dorsal regions are recruited, while the loaded ventral region collapses. Additionally, the sponge model explains the mechanism through which positive end-expiratory pressure acts as a counterforce to oppose collapsing and compressive forces. The final result of proning was the inversion of gravitational forces, combined with other factors such as lung-chest wall shape-matching and the heart's weight, leading to a more homogeneous distribution of inflation throughout the lung parenchyma. This is associated with improved oxygenation, as dorsal recruitment, for anatomical reasons, prevails over ventral de-recruitment. The more homogeneous distribution of inflation (i.e. of stress and strain) decreases or prevents ventilator-induced lung injury, as consistently shown in animal experiments. A series of clinical trials subsequently led to the conclusion that in patients with severe ARDS…

### A comprehensive review of prone position in ARDS [^111DsvyB]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Prone position (PP) has been used since the 1970s to treat severe hypoxemia in patients with ARDS because of its effectiveness at improving gas exchange. Compared with the supine position (SP), placing patients in PP results in a more even tidal volume distribution, in part by reversing the vertical pleural pressure gradient, which becomes more negative in the dorsal regions. PP also improves resting lung volume in the dorsocaudal regions by reducing the superimposed pressure of both the heart and the abdomen. In contrast, pulmonary perfusion remains preferentially distributed to the dorsal lung regions, thus improving overall alveolar ventilation/perfusion relationships.

Moreover, the larger tissue mass suspended from a wider dorsal chest wall results in a more homogeneous distribution of pleural pressures throughout the lung, which reduces abnormal strain and stress development. This is believed to ameliorate the severity or development of ventilator-induced lung injury and may partly explain why PP reduces mortality in severe ARDS. Over 40 years of clinical trials have consistently reported improved oxygenation in approximately 70% of subjects with ARDS. Early initiation of PP is more likely to improve oxygenation than initiation during the subacute phase. Maximal oxygenation improvement occurs over a wide time frame ranging from several hours to several days.

Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials suggest that PP provides a survival advantage only in patients with relatively severe ARDS (PaO2/FIO2 < 150 mm Hg). Moreover, survival is enhanced when patients are managed w…

### Changes in respiratory mechanics with trunk inclination differs between patients with ARDS with and without obesity [^113eit9Q]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

Studies investigating the effect of trunk inclination on respiratory mechanics in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS have reported postural differences in partition respiratory mechanics. Compared with more upright positions, the supine-flat position provided lower lung and chest wall elastance, allowing reduced driving pressures and end-inspiratory transpulmonary pressure. However, the effect of trunk inclination on respiratory mechanics in patients with obesity and ARDS is uncertain.

- **Research question**: Does the effect of change in posture on partition respiratory mechanics differ between patients with ARDS with and without obesity?

- **Study design and methods**: In this single-center study, patients with ARDS with and without obesity were randomized into two 15-minute steps in which trunk inclination was changed from semi-recumbent (40° head up) to supine-flat (0°), or vice versa. At the end of each step, partition respiratory mechanics, airway opening pressure, and arterial blood gases were measured. A paired t-test was used to examine respiratory mechanics and blood gas variables in each group.

- **Results**: Forty consecutive patients were enrolled. Twenty were obese (BMI, 38.4 [34.5–42.3]) and 20 were non-obese (BMI, 26.6 [25.2–28.5]). In the patients with obesity, lung and chest wall elastance, driving pressure, inspiratory transpulmonary pressure, PaCO2, and ventilatory ratio were lower supine than semi-recumbent (P < .001). Airways resistance was greater supine (P = .006). In the patients without obesity, only chest wall elastance was lower in the supine position compared with the semi-recumbent position.

### Reply to Oppersma [^115jegu1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

We thank Dr. Oppersma and colleagues for their interest in our study, in which we described the effects of changes in trunk inclination on respiratory mechanics in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Reducing trunk inclination from semi-recumbent (40° head-of-bed elevation) to supine-flat (0° head-of-bed elevation) markedly (and reversibly) increased the compliance of the respiratory system due to an increase in both chest wall and lung compliance. We did not measure changes in lung aeration (end-expiratory lung volume [EELV]); however, we think the most relevant underlying mechanism is the decrease in EELV in the supine-flat position, favoring a reduction of overdistension in some, most likely ventral non-dependent, lung regions. Notably, similar observations regarding changes in respiratory mechanics have been made in patients with "classical" ARDS. Moreover, a reduction in EELV caused by a change in trunk inclination from semi-recumbent to supine-flat position has been described in "classical" ARDS, in mechanically ventilated patients with normal lungs, and in spontaneously breathing subjects.

Dr. Oppersma and colleagues developed a mathematical model aimed at simulating the changes in lung aeration due to variations in trunk inclination. The model consisted of 15 blocks of homogeneous material, with specific properties of either edematous, fibrotic, or emphysematous lung tissue. In addition, the simulated pressure applied to the diaphragm (intra-abdominal pressure) changed according to body position.

### Effects of the beach chair position on respiratory mechanics in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalized in intensive care unit [^11213Dxf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), known for its high morbidity and mortality rates, is a respiratory illness associated with persistent airflow obstruction. This study aimed to examine the effects of the beach chair position on respiratory mechanics in individuals with COPD hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) to assess its effectiveness compared to the supine position.

- **Methods**: Forty-six participants with COPD, admitted to the ICU and receiving either invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, were included in this prospective study. The subjects were initially placed in the supine position. After a few hours, the patients were positioned to spend at least 16 hours a day in the beach chair position. Mechanical ventilator data were recorded every hour in each position. The primary outcome of this study included a comparison of compliance, elastance, and peak airway resistance, time constant, airway resistance, pH, pCO2, and pO2 data in supine and beach chair positions.

- **Results**: Compared with supine positioning, beach chair positioning resulted in a significant enhancement in compliance (35.98 ± 17.51 mL/cmH₂O vs. 44.69 ± 28.74 mL/cmH₂O, p-value = 0.009) and elastance (29.59 ± 11.87 cmH₂O/L vs. 39.86 ± 41.55 cmH₂O/L, p-value = 0.009), whereas peak airway pressure, time constant, airway resistance, pH, pCO2, and pO2 did not significantly differ between supine and beach chair position.

- **Conclusions**: Beach chair positioning improves lung compliance and elastance in individuals with COPD in ICU when compared to supine positioning. This study suggests that the beach chair position may be beneficial for such patients.

### Gas exchange in the prone posture [^113y8htH]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

The prone posture is known to have numerous effects on gas exchange, both under normal conditions and in patients with ARDS. Clinical studies have consistently demonstrated improvements in oxygenation, and a multi-center randomized trial found that, when implemented within 48 hours of moderate-to-severe ARDS, placing subjects in the prone posture decreased mortality. Improvements in gas exchange occur via several mechanisms: alterations in the distribution of alveolar ventilation, redistribution of blood flow, improved matching of local ventilation and perfusion, and reduction in regions of low ventilation/perfusion ratios. Ventilation heterogeneity is reduced in the prone posture due to more uniform alveolar size secondary to a more uniform vertical pleural pressure gradient.

The prone posture results in more uniform pulmonary blood flow when compared with the supine posture, due to an anatomical bias for greater blood flow to dorsal lung regions. Because both ventilation and perfusion heterogeneity decrease in the prone posture, gas exchange improves. Other benefits include a more uniform distribution of alveolar stress, relief of left-lower-lobe lung compression by the heart, enhanced secretion clearance, and favorable right-ventricular and systemic hemodynamics.

### Choking on a foreign body: A physiological study of the effectiveness of abdominal thrust manoeuvres to increase thoracic pressure [^115zqXAK]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Abdominal thrusts caused a sharp rise in abdominal and thoracic pressures, exceeding or equaling those produced by these and alternative manoeuvres in previous studies.

In 12 supine cadavers, the mean airway pressure was 40.8 cm H2O for chest thrusts and 26.4 cm H2O for abdominal thrusts. In six anaesthetised and intubated healthy adult male volunteers, airway pressures from abdominal, low-chest, and mid-chest thrusts in the horizontal lateral and sitting positions were compared. Low-chest thrusts in the horizontal lateral position (34.0 cm H2O) and mid-chest thrusts in the sitting position (46.2 cm H2O) produced the highest pressures. In eight intubated and anaesthetised pigs, anterior chest thrusts and Heimlich manoeuvres, both performed in a seated position, produced airway pressures of 6.5 and 13.8 cm H2O, respectively, with lateral chest thrusts in the side-lying position producing 18.0 cm H2O. Day et al. compared alveolar pressure change for back blows (17.7 cm H2O) and the Heimlich manoeuvre (36.7 cm H2O).

### Head position for opening the upper airway [^115j11eR]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Inexperienced rescuers may encounter severe problems in an unconscious patient with opening and maintaining a patent upper airway. Designing a ventilating device that could indicate how to open an upper airway correctly may be beneficial. The heads of 102 volunteers were randomly placed in different head positions by one investigator. A pocket mask was then pressed gently on the volunteer's face, followed by the measurement of the head position angles. Mean (SD) flexion was -4 degrees (8 degrees) (95% CI -5.9 to -2.9); the mean neutral position was 21 degrees (6 degrees) (95% CI, 19.9 to 22.3); extension was 42 degrees (6 degrees) (95% CI 40.8 to 43.0 degrees) and differed significantly between each position (p < 0.001). The flexion and neutral position angles were significantly greater in men than in women: -2 (7 degrees) vs. -8 (7 degrees) and 22 (7 degrees) vs 20 (5 degrees); p < 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively. Maximum extension of the head in both supine men and women was 42 degrees, which could be utilised to optimise assisted ventilation of an unprotected upper airway.

### Respiratory function in ventilated newborn infants nursed prone and supine [^113wDReg]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

We have demonstrated that ventilated newborn infants nursed in the prone position exhibited significantly improved ventilation to perfusion matching, lower intrapulmonary shunting, and lower alveolar dead space compared to those nursed in a supine position.

Although the quantified effect of proning on composite respiratory function parameters has not been previously reported in the neonatal population, our results are in agreement with previous studies that have reported enhanced oxygenation in the prone compared to the supine position. In a smaller study of a similar population of ventilated infants with gestational ages ranging from 25 to 36 weeks and studied within 7 days from birth, the authors reported that the prone position was associated with a higher SpO₂ and fewer episodes of oxygen desaturation. The latest Cochrane analysis on the position of ventilated neonates reported that the prone position was associated with an increase in arterial oxygen tension (PaO₂) and SpO₂ improvement compared to the supine position. Similarly, enhanced oxygenation has been reported in premature infants receiving continuous positive airway pressure, showing higher SpO₂ and improved thoraco-abdominal synchrony, measured by respiratory inductive plethysmography, in the prone compared to the supine position.

We have also previously reported a lower work of breathing, measured by the diaphragmatic pressure-time product, in convalescent preterm infants when measured in the prone compared to the supine position. Our results from this study agree with the aforementioned studies and complement the literature by quantifying the potential benefits of the prone position.

### Infant position in neonates receiving mechanical ventilation [^111C7nkH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

In patients of various ages undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV), it has been observed that positions other than the standard supine position, such as the prone position, may improve respiratory parameters. However, the benefits of these positions have not been clearly defined for critically ill newborns receiving MV. This article is an update of a review first published in 2005 and last updated in 2013.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective is to assess the effects of different positioning of newborn infants receiving MV (supine vs prone, lateral decubitus, or quarter turn from prone) in improving short-term respiratory outcomes. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of different positioning on mortality, neuromotor, and developmental outcomes over the long term, along with other complications of prematurity.

- **Search methods**: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 22 August 2016), Embase (1980 to 22 August 2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 22 August 2016). Additionally, clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles were searched for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing different positions in newborns receiving mechanical ventilation were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three unblinded review authors independently assessed trial data.

### Static pressure volume curves and body posture in acute respiratory failure [^1179jESG]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the effects of body posture on pressure-volume (PV) curves remain unclear. This study examined the impact of prone positioning on inflation PV curves and their potential relationships with postural alterations in gas exchange.

- **Design and setting**: This was a prospective study where patients served as their own controls, conducted in a university-affiliated 30-bed intensive care unit.

- **Patients and participants**: Thirteen anesthetized, paralyzed, semirecumbent, mechanically ventilated patients with early, severe, diffuse ARDS were involved.

- **Interventions**: The study involved sequential body posture changes: preprone semirecumbent, prone, and postprone semirecumbent.

- **Measurements and results**: In each posture, hemodynamics, gas exchange, and lung volumes were determined before, during removal, and after restoration of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP = 10.2 ± 0.6 cmH2O). At zero PEEP, PV curves of the respiratory system, lung, and chest wall were constructed. The prone position compared to preprone semirecumbent resulted in significantly reduced pressure at the lower inflection point of the lung PV curve (2.2 ± 0.2 vs. 3.7 ± 0.5 cmH2O) and increased volume at the upper inflection point (0.87 ± 0.03 vs. 0.69 ± 0.05 l). Postural reduction in the lower inflection point pressure of the lung PV curve was the sole independent predictor of pronation-induced increases in PaO2/FIO2 (R² = 0.76). PaO2/FIO2 increases were also significantly related to increases in functional residual capacity (R² = 0.60).

- **Conclusions**: In early, severe, diffuse ARDS, prone positioning reduces the lower inflection point pressure and increases the upper inflection point.

### Paradoxical positioning: Does "head up" always improve mechanics and lung protection [^114Vi5SF]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Chest wall loading**: Manual loading of the chest wall was performed before and after bed inclination. In the supine position, loading was accomplished by placing a hand over the patient's umbilicus, perpendicular to the axis between the xiphoid process and the pubis. In the prone position, the hand was placed at the approximate midpoint between the inferior costal margin and the iliac crest, perpendicular to the lumbar spine. To gauge load adequacy, an end-inspiratory hold was performed, and manual pressure applied until there was an upward deflection of the pressure-time waveform greater than or equal to 2 cm H2O, at which point chest wall loading was considered sufficient to influence PL during tidal breathing. The inspiratory hold on the ventilator was then released, while sustained manual pressure continued to be applied to the abdomen or lumbar region. After five breaths were delivered, measurements of tidal airway pressure were repeated, and manual pressure was then released.

- **Statistical analysis**: The paired t test was used to compare the values of P plat, ΔP, and C in both the baseline and inclined positions, and before and after chest wall loading. Differences at the level of a two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

### Effects of trunk inclination on respiratory mechanics in patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome: Let's always report the angle [^117SMXcP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Twenty patients were enrolled (11 male; 67 [59–70] years; body mass index, 30 [28–35] kg/m²; Simplified Acute Physiology Score-II, 36 [32–45]). ARDS was mild in 1 patient, moderate in 9, and severe in 10 patients. Patients were studied 2.5 (2.0–4.5) days after intubation. Tidal volume was 5.9 (5.7–6.3) ml/kg of predicted body weight, and PEEP was 14 (12–14) cm H₂O.

After changing trunk inclination from 40° to 0°, driving pressure decreased from 13 (12–15) to 10 (9–11) cm H₂O (P < 0.0001), and respiratory system compliance (C RS) increased from 29 (24–35) to 38 (33–48) ml/cm H₂O (P < 0.0001). Compared with the values obtained at baseline (semirecumbent), the supine-flat position was associated with increased chest wall compliance (C CW) (131 [101–170] vs. 215 [175–300] ml/cm H₂O; P < 0.01) and increased lung compliance (C Lung) (38 [30–46] vs. 46 [40–62] ml/cm H₂O; P < 0.01).

### Ropinirole [^114BbaWY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Decrease in blood pressure**: Ropinirole tablets can decrease your blood pressure (hypotension), especially when you start taking the tablets or when your dose is changed. If you faint or feel dizzy, nauseated, or sweaty when you stand up from sitting or lying down (orthostatic hypotension), this may mean that your blood pressure is decreased. When changing position from lying down or sitting to standing up, you should do so carefully and slowly. Call your healthcare provider if you have any of the symptoms of decreased blood pressure listed above.

- **Hallucinations and other psychotic-like behavior**: Ropinirole tablets can cause or worsen psychotic-like behavior, including hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real), confusion, excessive suspicion, aggressive behavior, agitation, delusional beliefs (believing things that are not real), and disorganized thinking. If you experience hallucinations or any of these other psychotic-like changes, talk with your healthcare provider.

- **Unusual urges**: Some patients taking ropinirole tablets experience urges to behave in ways that are unusual for them. Examples include an unusual urge to gamble, increased sexual urges and behaviors, or an uncontrollable urge to shop, spend money, or eat. If you or your family notice that you are developing any unusual behaviors, consult your healthcare provider.

### Lateral versus anterior thoracic thrusts in the generation of airway pressure in anaesthetised pigs [^116R2YyE]. Resuscitation (2013). Low credibility.

The anterior chest thrusts, applied with the subject sitting or standing and directed to the lower sternum, are recommended by the Australian Resuscitation Council for clearing upper airway obstructions caused by foreign bodies. In contrast, lateral chest thrusts, where the victim lies on their side, are no longer advised due to insufficient evidence. This study compared anterior, lateral chest, and abdominal thrust techniques in generating airway pressures using an appropriate animal model.

- **Methods**: This was a repeated-measures, crossover clinical trial conducted on eight anesthetized, intubated, adult pigs. Each animal underwent ten trials of each technique with the upper airway obstructed. A chest/abdominal pressure transducer, pneumotachograph, and intra-oesophageal balloon catheter were used to record thrust pressures, expiratory airflows, and airway and intrapleural pressures, respectively.

- **Results**: The mean (SD) thrust pressures generated for the anterior, lateral, and abdominal techniques were 120.9 (11.0), 135.2 (20.0), and 142.4 (27.3) cmH₂O, respectively (p < 0.0001). The mean (SD) peak expiratory airway pressures were 6.5 (3.0), 18.0 (5.5), and 13.8 (6.7) cmH₂O, respectively (p < 0.0001). The mean (SD) peak expiratory intrapleural pressures were 5.4 (2.7), 13.5 (6.2), and 10.3 (8.5) cmH₂O, respectively (p < 0.0001). Autopsy revealed no rib, intra-abdominal, or intra-thoracic injuries.

- **Conclusion**: Lateral chest and abdominal thrust techniques produced significantly greater airway and pleural pressures compared to the anterior thrust technique. Further research is recommended to explore these findings.

### Reading pulmonary vascular pressure tracings. How to handle the problems of zero leveling and respiratory swings [^114Yd7KL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The accuracy of pulmonary vascular pressure measurements is of great diagnostic and prognostic relevance. However, there is variability in zero leveling procedures, and the recommendation of end-expiratory reading may not always be adequate. A review of physiological and anatomical data, supported by recent imaging, leads to the practical recommendation of zero leveling at the cross-section of three transthoracic planes: midchest frontal, transverse through the fourth intercostal space, and midsagittal.

- **Respiratory pressure swings**: End-expiratory reading at functional residual capacity allows for minimal influence of elastic lung recoil on pulmonary pressure reading. However, hyperventilation is associated with changes in end-expiratory lung volume and increased intrathoracic pressure, potentially exacerbated by expiratory muscle contraction and dynamic hyperinflation, all of which increase pulmonary vascular pressures. This problem is amplified in patients with obstructed airways.

With the exception of dynamic hyperinflation states, it is reasonable to assume that negative inspiratory and positive expiratory intrathoracic pressures cancel each other out, so averaging pulmonary vascular pressures over several respiratory cycles is most often preferable. This recommendation may be generalized for the purpose of consistency, as pulmonary blood flow measurements are not corrected for phasic inspiratory and expiratory changes in clinical practice.

### Assessment of awake prone positioning in hospitalized adults with COVID-19: A nonrandomized controlled trial [^1142xSaA]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In this pragmatic nonrandomized controlled trial of patients with hypoxemia and COVID-19 who had not received mechanical ventilation, a practitioner recommendation of awake prone positioning provided no observed clinical benefit. It was highly probable that prone positioning worsened patient outcomes at study day 5. Many health care professionals have adopted the recommendation of prone positioning to improve oxygenation and potentially prevent the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, with the hope of increasing survival among patients with COVID-19. However, while awake prone positioning may improve refractory hypoxemia, the data from this study suggest that a universal recommendation of awake prone positioning for the care of patients with COVID-19–associated hypoxemia who are not yet receiving mechanical ventilation may worsen clinical outcomes and cause harm. There are several potential explanations for these findings. A higher proportion of patients were discharged to home within 5 days in the usual care group compared with the intervention group. For patients receiving oxygen via standard nasal cannula, prone positioning may have had little or no relevance to clinical status but prompted practitioners to determine that the patient was less ready for discharge to home because the patient was receiving an intervention to maintain oxygen saturation. This explanation would not account for the higher probability of worse clinical outcomes on study day 5 observed in the intervention group.

Airway management is more challenging in obese patients. Compared with the supine position, the sitting position can decrease the collapsibility of the upper airway and improve respiratory mechanics.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the 25° semi-sitting position on the effectiveness of mask ventilation in anaesthetised, paralysed obese patients. This randomised, cross-over study was conducted at a medical centre managed by a university tertiary hospital. It involved thirty-eight obese adults scheduled for general anaesthesia.

After anaesthesia and paralysis, two-handed mask ventilation was performed in both the supine and 25° semi-sitting positions in a randomised order. During mask ventilation, mechanical ventilation was delivered using a pressure-controlled mode with a peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, a respiratory rate of 15 bpm, and no positive end-expiratory pressure. Ventilatory outcomes were based on lean body weight. Key outcomes measured were exhaled tidal volume (ml/kg), respiratory minute volume (ml/kg/min), and the occurrence of inadequate ventilation, which was defined as an exhaled tidal volume less than 4 ml/kg, or an absence of end-tidal CO2 recording.

Results indicated that exhaled tidal volume (mean ± SD) in the 25° semi-sitting position was higher than in the supine position, at 9.3 ± 2.7 vs. 7.6 ± 2.4 ml/kg; P < 0.001. Respiratory minute volume was also improved in the 25° semi-sitting position compared with the supine position, 139.6 ± 40.7 vs. 113.4 ± 35.7 ml/kg/min; P < 0.001.

In conclusion, the 25° semi-sitting position improved mask ventilation outcomes in this patient group.

### Effects of prone positioning on transpulmonary pressures and end-expiratory volumes in patients without lung disease [^113yy6Wf]. Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

The effects of prone positioning on esophageal pressures have not been investigated in mechanically ventilated patients. Our objective was to characterize the effects of prone positioning on esophageal pressures, transpulmonary pressure, and lung volume, thereby assessing the potential utility of esophageal pressure measurements in setting positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in prone patients.

- **Methods**: We studied 16 patients undergoing spine surgery during general anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade. We measured airway pressure, esophageal pressures, airflow, and volume, and calculated the expiratory reserve volume and the elastances of the lung and chest wall in supine and prone positions.

- **Results**: Esophageal pressures at end expiration with 0 cm H2O PEEP decreased from supine to prone by 5.64 cm H2O (95% CI, 3.37 to 7.90; P < 0.0001). Expiratory reserve volume measured at relaxation volume increased from supine to prone by 0.15 L (interquartile range, 0.25, 0.10; P = 0.003). Chest wall elastance increased from supine to prone by 7.32 (95% CI, 4.77 to 9.87) cm H2O/L at PEEP 0 (P < 0.0001) and 6.66 cm H2O/L (95% CI, 3.91 to 9.41) at PEEP 7 (P = 0.0002). Median driving pressure, the change in airway pressure from end expiration to end-inspiratory plateau, increased in the prone position at PEEP 0 (3.70 cm H2O; 95% CI, 1.74 to 5.66; P = 0.001) and PEEP 7 (3.90 cm H2O; 95% CI, 2.72 to 5.09; P < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: End-expiratory esophageal pressure decreases, and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure and expiratory reserve volume increase when patients are moved from the supine to prone position.

### Paradoxical positioning: Does "head up" always improve mechanics and lung protection [^113AVBNd]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

As the data reported here and in previous work indicate, chest wall loading is an informative diagnostic maneuver, and the presence of a paradoxical response should prompt reevaluation of both positioning and ventilatory prescription. However, while chest wall loading may be effective for modifying P L even when sustained over hours (e.g. by abdominal binding, weighting, or by pressure-regulated mechanical devices), its effects on the regional distribution of ventilation and pulmonary blood flow, its optimal duration, and its ultimate clinical value or adverse consequences remain largely undefined.

Our study focused selectively on immediate changes in tidal mechanics of the passive respiratory system in late-stage ARDS and consequently has several clear limitations. The effects of bed inclination on gas exchange were not evaluated. For safety concerns, patients were held in the inclined position for only brief periods of time. Apart from ongoing electrocardiographic and blood pressure monitoring, the hemodynamic response to inclination was not systematically monitored; we did, however, note a clinically significant decrease in systemic blood pressure in multiple patients following inclination, which returned to baseline immediately once inclination was decreased. Any regional alterations of lung volume, ventilation, or perfusion were not evaluated. Additionally, we did not evaluate for the presence of complete airway closure, which can result in falsely elevated calculations of DP and C. However, we would expect that if complete airway closure was present to a significant degree, it would have influenced our findings to a greater extent.

### 2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^1126FLaz]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically in the evaluation of stable chest pain in low-risk patients, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing as first-line testing. This is for excluding calcified plaque and identifying patients with a low likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease in those with stable chest pain and no known coronary artery disease categorized as low risk.

### Effects of the beach chair position on respiratory mechanics in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalized in intensive care unit [^113JRwqE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which exhibits high morbidity and mortality rates, is a respiratory illness associated with persistent airflow obstruction. This study aimed to examine the effects of the beach chair position on respiratory mechanics in individuals with COPD hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) to assess its effectiveness compared to the supine position.

- **Methods**: Forty-six participants with COPD, admitted to the ICU and receiving either invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, were included in this prospective study. The subjects were initially placed in the supine position. After a few hours, the patients were positioned to spend at least 16 hours a day in the beach chair position. Mechanical ventilator data were recorded every hour in each position. The primary outcome of this study included the comparison of compliance, elastance, peak airway resistance, time constant, airway resistance, pH, pCO2, and pO2 data in supine and beach chair positions.

- **Results**: When compared with supine positioning, beach chair positioning resulted in significant enhancement in compliance (35.98 ± 17.51 mL/cmH₂O vs. 44.69 ± 28.74 mL/cmH₂O, p-value = 0.009) and elastance (29.59 ± 11.87 cmH₂O/L vs. 39.86 ± 41.55 cmH₂O/L, p-value = 0.009), whereas peak airway pressure, time constant, airway resistance, pH, pCO2, and pO2 did not significantly differ between supine and beach chair positions.

- **Conclusions**: Beach chair positioning improves lung compliance and elastance in individuals with COPD in the ICU when compared to supine positioning.

### Targeted lateral positioning decreases lung collapse and overdistension in COVID-19-associated ARDS [^111Rgt4v]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Most critically ill patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), require mechanical ventilation for prolonged periods, and exhibit high mortality. In a large cohort study with critically ill patients with COVID-19 referred for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels were higher than those reported for the management of moderate-to-severe ARDS in the pre–COVID-19 era. Along with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) and a low partial pressure of arterial oxygen ratio (PaO2/FIO2) at ICU admission, these were independent factors associated with high mortality. Lung heterogeneity, hypoxemia disproportionate to mechanics, right-left lung aeration/ventilation asymmetry, and poorly recruitable lungs with increased recruitability with alternating body positions between supine and prone have been reported. However, the real-time effects of changing body position and PEEP on regional overdistension and collapse in individual patients remain largely unknown and not timely monitored.

Lung collapse usually predominates within the most dependent units, where the transpulmonary pressure (PL = airways pressure - pleural pressure) is the lowest, while lung overdistension predominates within the most nondependent ones, where the PL is the highest. When there is right-left lung heterogeneity of collapse and overdistension, as seen in many patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS, a targeted lateral positioning strategy is conceivable. By utilizing a one-sided lateral position, the lung with more collapse may benefit.

### Effect of lateral versus supine positioning on hypoxaemia in sedated adults: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^1157kUKg]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

Our results are both built upon and differ from those reported in previous studies. Earlier studies implemented in the post-anaesthesia care unit suggested a roughly 8% incidence of hypoxaemia in sedated patients managed in the supine position. Accordingly, we hypothesised that lateral positioning might noticeably reduce this risk (to ~4%) based on evidence from procedures requiring sedation, where lateral positioning reduced hypoxaemia by about 50% relative to supine positioning. In our trial, incidence in the supine group was higher (15.0%), and in the lateral group (5.4%) it exceeded initial projections. This discrepancy is likely explained by the broader range of surgical patients and risk factors included in our study.

We enrolled patients undergoing high-risk procedures that are known independent contributors to respiratory complications — notably thoracic, lung, and major abdominal surgeries, as well as emergency procedures. In contrast, the literature informing our power calculation mostly examined elective, lower-risk populations (excluding thoracic surgery, otorhinolaryngological surgery, and patients with difficult airways). As a result, the inclusion of higher-risk surgeries and patients in our trial increased the overall incidence of hypoxaemia compared with previous reports. Importantly, despite the higher baseline risk, lateral positioning consistently showed benefit, reaffirming findings from smaller studies that found lateral positioning improved oxygenation during deep sedation.

### Management of pulmonary contusion and flail chest: an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^115HUWnQ]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for blunt chest trauma, particularly in the context of pulmonary contusion, the EAST 2012 guidelines recommend considering the administration of diuretics in cases of hydrostatic fluid overload. This is evidenced by elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressures in hemodynamically stable patients or in the presence of known congestive heart failure.

### Paradoxical positioning: Does "head up" always improve mechanics and lung protection [^114DvodE]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

We, along with others, have observed that passively ventilated patients with advanced ARDS frequently demonstrate "paradoxical" improvement of respiratory compliance (Cin) in response to manual compression or loading of the chest wall, in both supine and prone body postures. In such "responders", compliance reproducibly returns to its lower value immediately upon off-loading of the chest wall. We ascribed these unanticipated behaviors to end-tidal overdistension in response to greater transpulmonary pressure (P L) in the unloaded state.

Because standard head-upright positioning also raises the transpulmonary pressure with respect to the fully recumbent (0°) position, we reasoned that more horizontal body positioning than customary might also improve compliance in advanced-stage ARDS. Consequently, it may lower the plateau pressure and driving pressure (DP) that clinicians currently target in lung protective strategies.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of upright positioning on the bedside respiratory mechanics of patients with moderate to severe ARDS. We secondarily sought to evaluate the effects of chest wall loading in the upright position. We tested the hypothesis that increasing bed inclination adversely influences plateau pressure (P plat), DP, and that these changes are reversed with chest wall loading.

### Supine chest compression: Alternative to prone ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113mAzM6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Prone ventilation is usually used for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. We applied an alternative method to the prone position. We described two cases of trauma where the prone position could not be used. Chest wall compression was performed using a 2-kg weight placed bilaterally on the chest wall while the patient was in a supine position. Respiratory mechanics work to improve oxygenation almost as effectively as the mechanism proposed for the prone position, without any major adverse effects or serious complications. We suggest a larger randomized study to determine the efficacy and to find out the optimum weight required for chest compression.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^111RwECf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

- **Guideline statements**:

- **What key clinical features should lead to the diagnosis of SIH being considered**: SIH should be considered in any patient presenting with orthostatic headache (other than following iatrogenic dural puncture or major trauma), 'end of the day' or 'second half of the day' headache with improvement when lying flat, thunderclap headache followed by orthostatic headache, and new daily persistent headache with an initial orthostatic quality. The presence of associated symptoms should increase the suspicion of SIH.

- **Commonly associated symptoms and rare presentations of SIH**: We recommend a working definition of orthostatic headache as headache meeting the following criteria: absent or only mild (1–3/10 on the verbal rating scale) on waking or after prolonged lying flat, onset within 2 hours of becoming upright, and 'good' improvement in severity (over 50% on the verbal rating scale) within 2 hours after lying flat. The timing of headache onset and offset should be consistent.

- **What differential diagnoses of SIH should be considered and how should the diagnoses be confirmed**: Differential diagnoses of SIH include postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), orthostatic hypotension, cervicogenic headache, and migraine. PoTS and orthostatic hypotension are diagnosed from a detailed autonomic history and haemodynamic autonomic responses to formal standing tests to document objective evidence of postural tachycardia (increase in heart rate by more than 30 beats per minute) or orthostatic hypotension.

### The effect of body position on pulmonary function: A systematic review [^117VWCJo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

When performing pulmonary function tests, body position plays a significant role in influencing test results. This review highlights that a change in body position may have varying implications depending on patient populations. According to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) should be performed in the sitting or standing position, with a preference for the sitting position. The norms of these functions, categorized by gender and age, were established from tests performed in this position. The review suggests that sitting is generally the preferred position for most subjects; however, clinicians should consider alternative positions for certain patients.

In patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), testing in the supine position may provide valuable information. Similarly, for patients with neuromuscular disorders, performing PFTs in the supine position can aid in assessing diaphragmatic function. Positioning is crucial in maximizing respiratory function when treating patients with various problems and diseases. Understanding the implications of each position on a specific patient's respiratory system can equip healthcare professionals with the knowledge to determine optimal positions for patients with different conditions.

### Obstructive sleep apnea is position dependent in young infants [^1121jdgj]. Pediatric Research (2023). High credibility.

In children and adults, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often dependent on sleep position, despite upper airway narrowing and an increased tendency for upper airway collapse having an underlying structural cause. OSA is more severe in the supine than in the side- or prone-sleeping positions. This dependency on sleep position is true for young infants with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) and a small chin, but also, as shown in our study, is true for most infants with OSA even in the absence of clear predisposing structural deficits. The anatomical sites of upper airway obstruction in young infants are similar to those in adults with OSA.

OSA during the first three months seems to have its own characteristics and may appear without any noticeable anatomical abnormalities, as observed in our study cohort. OSA is particularly evident in young infants with gastroesophageal reflux, in premature infants, and in infants with a history of apparent life-threatening events. Regardless of the underlying condition, infant OSA appears to resolve by the age of four to eight months.

A study by Pereira et al. involving 50 infants aged 8 to 12 months with mild OSA showed no significant effect of sleep position on OSA. In children with normal facial structure older than six months, OSA is most closely related to adenoidal or tonsillar hypertrophy. This difference in OSA etiology is likely to explain the differing findings between younger and older infants. In our study group, clinical and polysomnography (PSG) follow-ups showed the resolution of obstructive sleep apnea in most infants before they reached four to eight months.

### Finite element modeling of pulmonary mechanics in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: Explaining the inclination angle [^116nLYY6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

With great interest, we read the research letter by Marazzo and colleagues in which the effect of changing trunk inclination on respiratory function in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome is described. In our clinical practice, we repeatedly observed such rapid improvement of Vs upon changing the trunk position from semirecumbent to supine flat. The rapidity of altered respiratory mechanics does not, in our view, favor a major role for alveolar recruitment but rather suggests a varying distention of different lung areas compatible with a patchy pathomorphological manifestation of COVID-19. This clinical observation led us to hypothesize that different configurations of, for example, fibrotic and emphysematous pulmonary parenchyma differentially influence lung aeration depending on the inclination of the individual patient's trunk.

Therefore, we set out to model diseased COVID-19 lungs using a finite element method–based mathematical pulmonary model via Ansys (2020 R2 ANSYS, Inc.), allowing simulation of distinct geometrical configurations of heterogeneously distributed parenchymal pathomorphology and its related local tissue mechanics (Figure 1). The model consists of five rows and three columns of rectangular blocks, representing a single lung, surrounded by a rigid supporting structure representing the thoracic cage. Each of the 15 blocks is composed of homogeneous material with mechanical properties described as elastic moduli, density, and yield strength derived from the pathoanatomical literature.

### Effects of trunk inclination on respiratory mechanics in patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome: Let's always report the angle [^113BZtUH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Our results regarding changes in respiratory mechanics align with previous studies conducted on patients with typical ARDS. Collectively, these studies convey a clear clinical and methodological message: trunk inclination should be measured and reported when assessing respiratory mechanics. From a clinical perspective, standardizing trunk inclination is crucial when evaluating patients' respiratory mechanics. Although there may not be an optimal angle, stating trunk inclination in the methods section is critical for improving the reliability and reproducibility of clinical studies on respiratory mechanics. Another significant clinical implication of our study is that simple interventions, such as placing the patient supine-flat, significantly reduce driving pressure and lung stress (transpulmonary pressure). Furthermore, improved CO2 clearance may allow for a reduction in the respiratory rate, subsequently lowering the mechanical power delivered to the lungs and reducing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury.

As the study steps were relatively short, we cannot draw conclusions on the long-term effects on gas exchange and ventilator-induced lung injury. Additional limitations of our study include the absence of gastric pressure measurement and the high and relatively homogenous PEEP levels.

The change in body position from semirecumbent to supine-flat improved respiratory mechanics and CO2 clearance and did not worsen oxygenation in C-ARDS. Given the remarkable effect of this intervention, further investigation is warranted.

### Forteo [^114fcx6F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Forteo should be administered initially under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur. In short-term clinical pharmacology studies of Forteo in healthy volunteers, transient episodes of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension were observed in 5% of volunteers. Typically, these events began within 4 hours of dosing and resolved (without treatment) within a few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the first several doses, it was relieved by placing the person in a reclining position, and it did not preclude continued treatment.

- **Risk of digoxin toxicity**: Hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity because Forteo transiently increases serum calcium. Consider the potential onset of signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity when Forteo is used in patients receiving digoxin [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Under pressure - association of the arm position and leading circulatory structure behind the pressure point in cardiopulmonary resuscitation patients [^114y3jj9]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Thoracic computed tomography scans (CT) are used by several study groups to investigate the circulatory structures (heart and vessels) located behind the pressure point for chest compressions. Yet, it remains unclear how the positioning of these structures is influenced by factors such as intubation, the respiratory cycle, and arm positioning.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed data of adult patients with in- or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who underwent thoracic CT imaging within one year before or up to six months after arrest. A region of interest (ROI) behind the pressure point was defined. The largest structure within this region was defined as the "leading circulatory structure", which was the primary outcome. Airway status (intubated versus spontaneous breathing), respiratory cycle (inspiration, expiration, resting expiratory position), and arm position (up over the head versus down beside the trunk) served as covariates in an ordinal regression model.

- **Results**: Among 500 initially screened patients, 411 (82.2%) were included in the analysis. There was a significant association between the arm position and the leading circulatory structure behind the pressure point. However, no association was found with airway status or respiratory cycle. The most frequently identified leading circulatory structure was the left atrium (arms up: 41.8%, down: 50.7%), followed by the ascending aorta (up: 23.8% vs. down: 16.7%). The left ventricle was the leading structure in only one case (0.2%, arms down).

- **Conclusion**: This study shows that arm position is significant.

### Paradoxical positioning: Does "head up" always improve mechanics and lung protection [^111iWGD8]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Key points**:

- **Question**: In moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), how does bed inclination toward vertical affect respiratory system mechanics and the tidal airway pressures targeted in lung-protective ventilation strategies?

- **Findings**: Unexpectedly, in such patients, bed inclination towards vertical tends to decrease respiratory system compliance and increase tidal driving pressures. These changes are fully reversed with manual loading of the chest wall, suggesting end-tidal overdistension in the upright position as the underlying mechanism.

- **Meaning**: Body inclination should be considered a modifiable determinant of transpulmonary pressure and lung protection, similar to tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure.

There is near-universal agreement among providers that head-upright positioning is beneficial for mechanically ventilated patients, and in most ICUs, a semi-recumbent position (in which the head of the bed is elevated 30–45°) is a standard of care, except when absolutely contraindicated. While this practice is driven in large part by published evidence suggesting its decreased incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, a physiologic rationale supporting head-upright positioning also exists: in more upright positions, the vector of abdominal weight shifts caudally (away from the diaphragm), increasing resting lung volume and reducing the tendency for basilar atelectasis to form. In many patients, this caudal shift improves tidal compliance of the respiratory system as well.

For ARDS, however, the benefits of upright positioning remain unclear.
