## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether doxycycline can cause Clostridioides difficile infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labeling and pharmacovigilance data say about doxycycline and CDI. Then, I should verify how major guidelines classify antibiotic-associated CDI risk across drug classes. Next, I will examine primary clinical studies quantifying doxycycline's risk signal, including meta-analyses and large cohorts. After that, I need to reconcile any apparent contradictions between regulatory warnings and epidemiologic data. Finally, I will consider plausible mechanisms, quantify risk in practical terms, and outline clinical implications for antibiotic selection and monitoring in patients at risk of CDI [^113Lfe7f] [^117HhFmH] [^114payei] [^112JAd7j] [^111xH5Ye].

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. The FDA labeling for multiple doxycycline products (oral and IV) explicitly warns that C. difficile–associated diarrhea has been linked to doxycycline, ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis; this establishes a nonzero absolute risk and mandates clinical vigilance [^113Lfe7f] [^116Zxswr] [^112TQ2pJ] [^114kPiEq] [^115HtFvn].

> Next, I should review how guidelines and authoritative reviews stratify antibiotic risk for CDI. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether tetracyclines are grouped with high-risk classes or not. Major summaries consistently emphasize cephalosporins, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and piperacillin-tazobactam as high-risk antibiotics, whereas tetracyclines are not highlighted among the highest-risk agents, supporting a comparatively lower relative risk signal for doxycycline within stewardship frameworks [^117HhFmH] [^115kWmSC].

> I will now examine primary data. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that tetracyclines overall were associated with a reduced risk of CDI compared with other antibiotics, and importantly, the doxycycline subgroup showed an odds ratio around 0.55, suggesting substantially lower relative risk versus comparators; I should double-check that the confidence intervals excluded unity, which they did [^114payei].

> Let me verify whether this signal holds in specific high-risk contexts. In a cohort of hospitalized patients receiving ceftriaxone, adding doxycycline was associated with a 27% lower CDI hazard per day of doxycycline exposure, with markedly lower incidence rates compared with ceftriaxone without doxycycline; this suggests a protective association in the setting of a high-risk β-lactam backbone [^112JAd7j].

> I need to check for generalizability in broader real-world pneumonia care. In a large VA cohort of community-acquired pneumonia, regimens using doxycycline (with ceftriaxone) had a significantly lower CDI risk versus those using azithromycin, with an even larger benefit among patients with prior CDI; this replicates the directionality of the reduced-risk association in another clinically relevant scenario [^111xH5Ye].

> Hmm, wait a minute — my initial instinct was to equate the FDA warning with a high-risk designation, but that would be a mistake; I should correct that by separating absolute from relative risk. The labeling confirms a nonzero absolute risk based on postmarketing safety data, whereas guideline summaries and comparative studies show that doxycycline's relative CDI risk is substantially lower than many broad-spectrum alternatives, especially cephalosporins, clindamycin, and fluoroquinolones, resolving the apparent paradox between a mandated warning and favorable comparative epidemiology [^113Lfe7f] [^117HhFmH] [^114payei].

> Next, I should review mechanistic plausibility. Let me consider that doxycycline's narrower spectrum likely spares key components of the gut microbiota implicated in colonization resistance, whereas β-lactams disproportionately perturb taxa like Ruminococcus, Blautia, and Bifidobacterium and enrich Enterococcus, patterns linked to CDI susceptibility; this microbiota-sparing effect offers a biologically credible explanation for the reduced epidemiologic risk observed with doxycycline [^113CP91A] [^117HhFmH]. But wait, what if pathogen-directed effects also matter; while details of direct anti–C. difficile activity are variable, contemporary work underscores that agents with strong off-target disruption and weak anti–C. difficile activity are the primary antibiotic drivers of CDI, again positioning tetracyclines as relatively safer from a mechanistic standpoint [^115mgpG2].

> I should quantify the risk signal practically. Compared with other antibiotics, doxycycline shows about a 45% lower odds of CDI in pooled analyses, a roughly 27% reduction in hazard when layered onto ceftriaxone, and approximately a 17% lower risk than azithromycin for atypical coverage in hospitalized CAP, with larger benefit among patients with prior CDI; these are relative reductions, and absolute risk remains low but nonzero, particularly modulated by patient-level factors such as age and comorbidity [^114payei] [^112JAd7j] [^111xH5Ye] [^113VzHFj].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are clear. For patients at elevated CDI risk, when clinically appropriate for the infection being treated, choosing doxycycline instead of higher-risk alternatives can meaningfully reduce CDI risk as part of stewardship, while still maintaining vigilance for diarrhea and promptly discontinuing the inciting antibiotic if CDI is suspected, consistent with guideline principles to stop the offending agent and monitor closely in non-severe presentations [^117HhFmH] [^115aVZ4B] [^114jgARP]. Hold on, I should verify management steps if CDI occurs during doxycycline therapy; labels and guidelines advise stopping non–C. difficile–directed antibiotics when possible and initiating recommended CDI therapy, with oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin as first-line for initial episodes per contemporary guidance [^116v235L] [^11327cUR] [^117X1dF1] [^112hFwfJ].

> Final answer, integrating all of the above: Yes, doxycycline can cause C. difficile infection because any systemic antibiotic exposure can disrupt the gut microbiota, and this is explicitly warned in FDA labeling; however, across guidelines and comparative studies, doxycycline is associated with a substantially lower relative CDI risk than many broad-spectrum agents and may even be protective when combined with higher-risk regimens like ceftriaxone, so clinicians should consider it a relatively CDI-sparing option when appropriate while maintaining standard vigilance for CDI symptoms and prompt management if they arise [^113Lfe7f] [^117HhFmH] [^114payei] [^112JAd7j] [^111xH5Ye].

---

Yes, doxycycline can cause C. difficile infection (CDI) [^113Lfe7f], but the risk is **low compared to other antibiotics** [^114payei]. CDI has been reported with doxycycline in **FDA labeling** [^113Lfe7f], ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis [^116v235L]. Clinicians should **monitor for CDI symptoms** [^113Lfe7f] during and after doxycycline, especially in high-risk patients, and stop the drug if CDI is suspected or confirmed [^114kPiEq] [^115aVZ4B].

---

## Evidence linking doxycycline to CDI

According to **FDA labeling** [^113Lfe7f], doxycycline is associated with CDI, including severe cases [^114kPiEq]. In **clinical reports**, CDI has also been reported with doxycycline [^117TnYJc], albeit less often than with higher-risk antibiotics [^114payei].

---

## Comparative risk of CDI with doxycycline

**Tetracyclines**, including doxycycline, carry a lower CDI risk than many other antibiotics [^114payei] (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.47–0.81). A protective signal has also been observed [^112JAd7j], with doxycycline associated with a **lower CDI risk than azithromycin** in CAP regimens [^111xH5Ye].

---

## Mechanisms by which doxycycline may contribute to CDI

**Microbiota disruption** can occur even with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, altering gut flora and enabling C. difficile overgrowth [^113CP91A]. **Selective pressure** from doxycycline may suppress susceptible bacteria, allowing resistant C. difficile to proliferate [^115mgpG2].

---

## Clinical factors influencing CDI risk with doxycycline

Several factors can increase **CDI risk** during doxycycline therapy:

| **Clinical factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older adults have higher CDI risk [^113VzHFj] |
| Comorbidities | Multiple comorbidities increase risk [^113VzHFj] |
| Immunosuppression | Higher risk in immunocompromised patients [^117HhFmH] |
| Hospitalization | Recent or prolonged hospitalization increases risk [^116wRtSn] |
| Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) | PPI use is associated with higher CDI risk [^115i6sCG] |
| Prior CDI | History of CDI increases recurrence risk [^1161ph4B] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Monitor for CDI**: Watch for diarrhea and colitis during and after doxycycline [^113Lfe7f] [^114kPiEq].

- **Discontinue if suspected**: Stop doxycycline if CDI is suspected or confirmed [^114kPiEq] [^115aVZ4B].

- **Treat appropriately**: Use standard CDI therapy (e.g. vancomycin or fidaxomicin) if CDI occurs [^112hFwfJ].

---

## Preventive measures and monitoring strategies

- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Use doxycycline only when indicated and for the shortest effective duration [^114jgARP].

- **Patient education**: Instruct patients to report persistent diarrhea or abdominal pain promptly [^114EVHok].

- **Infection control**: Use hand hygiene and contact precautions to prevent CDI transmission [^116xoMdY].

---

## Clinical implications and patient management

- **Risk-benefit assessment**: Weigh CDI risk against therapeutic benefit, especially in high-risk patients [^117HhFmH].

- **Alternative antibiotics**: Consider alternatives in patients with prior CDI or multiple risk factors [^114payei].

- **Close monitoring**: Monitor for CDI symptoms during and after therapy, particularly in high-risk patients [^112TQ2pJ].

---

## Conclusion

**Doxycycline can cause CDI** [^113Lfe7f], but its risk is lower than many other antibiotics [^114payei]. Clinicians should monitor for CDI, discontinue doxycycline if it is suspected, and use standard CDI therapy when needed [^112hFwfJ].

Clostridioides difficile infection is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections with significant morbidity and mortality. For the past decade, the bulk of infection prevention and epidemiological surveillance efforts have been directed toward mitigating hospital-acquired C. difficile. However, the incidence of community-associated infection is on the rise. Patients with community-associated C. difficile tend to be younger and have a lower mortality rate. Although rates of recurrent C. difficile infection overall have decreased in the United States, future research and public health endeavors are needed to standardize and improve disease detection. It is necessary to stratify risk factors in large-scale population studies and identify regional and local variations in strain types, reservoirs, and transmission routes to help characterize and combat the changing epidemiology of C. difficile.

### Is there a causal relationship between trehalose consumption and Clostridioides difficile infection [^116diEvv]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

The purpose of review: Trehalose metabolism appears to play a role in the pathogenicity of some microbes. It has been claimed that trehalose consumption may be a risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but the evidence for a causal link is contentious.

- **Recent findings**: Epidemic ribotypes of C. difficile harbor mutations or have acquired extra genes that mean these strains can utilize lower concentrations of bioavailable trehalose, providing a competitive metabolic advantage in some CDI animal models. By contrast, evidence has emerged to show that trehalose-induced microbiota changes can help protect/reduce CDI in other models. In addition, C. difficile trehalose metabolic variants are widespread among epidemic and non-epidemic ribotypes alike, and the occurrence of these trehalose variants was not associated with increased disease severity or mortality.

- **Summary**: Currently, there is no proven causal association between the incidence or severity of human CDI and the presence of trehalose metabolism variants. Furthermore, microbial metabolism reduces trehalose bioavailability, potentially removing this competitive advantage for C. difficile trehalose metabolism variants. Taken together, trehalose consumed as part of a normal diet has no increased risk of CDI.

### Critical care management of the patient with Clostridioides difficile [^117HhFmH]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

To review published clinical evidence on the management of Clostridioides difficile infection in critically ill patients, we conducted a comprehensive review of relevant studies sourced from PubMed literature and bibliographies of reviewed articles. This review focuses on high-quality clinical evidence related to C. difficile infection, targeting aspects relevant to critical care clinicians, including epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

- **Data extraction**: We reviewed potentially relevant studies and abstracted information on study design, methods, patient selection, and results of relevant studies, conducting a synthetic (i.e. not systematic) review.

- **Data synthesis**: C. difficile infection stands as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States. Antibiotics, particularly cephalosporins, clindamycin, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin-tazobactam, constitute the most significant risk factor for C. difficile infection. Additional risk factors include age, diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, and end-stage renal disease, which contribute to the development and increased mortality of C. difficile infection.

- **Diagnosis and treatment**: Diagnosis of C. difficile infection involves testing appropriately selected patients presenting with diarrhea or clinical suspicion for patients with ileus. In cases of fulminant disease, characterized by hypotension, shock, ileus, or megacolon, treatment should include oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole, with the addition of rectal vancomycin if ileus is present.

Patients who do not respond to initial therapy require further assessment to determine alternative therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes in critical care settings.

### Clostridioides difficile in Covid-19 patients, Detroit, Michigan, USA, March-April 2020 [^117DAGVY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which is caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), predominantly includes pulmonary symptoms. However, less than 10% of cases also include gastrointestinal events, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. During the Covid-19 pandemic, clinicians must be vigilant of co-infections in patients with Covid-19.

Several studies have collected data on concomitant antibiotic use in patients with Covid-19. A single-center study of 52 critically ill patients cited hospital-acquired infection in only 7 (13.5%) patients, yet 49 (94%) patients received antibiotic therapy. Another study, which analyzed 113 deceased patients from a cohort of 799 moderate-to-severely ill Covid-19 patients during January 13–February 12, 2020, reported that 105 (93%) deceased patients and 144 (89%) survivors had received empiric antibacterial therapy with either moxifloxacin, cefoperazone, or azithromycin. These antibiotics are strongly associated with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). We report an observation of CDI as a co-occurrence or sequelae of overuse of antibiotics in Covid-19 patients.

We conducted a clinical surveillance review of CDI for all laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 patients treated at any of the hospitals belonging to Detroit Medical Center (Detroit, Michigan, USA). We screened patients using TheraDoc software during March 11–April 22, 2020. We abstracted data regarding baseline demographics, medical history, symptoms, laboratory values, microbiologic findings, concomitant antibiotic use, and treatment.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^1135Evte]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

As the causative agent of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the bacterium C. difficile is a Gram-positive, anaerobic spore-forming pathogen of the gastrointestinal tract. As a toxin-mediated disease, CDI poses a significant burden to patients and healthcare systems globally. CDI causes a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild self-limiting diarrhea to life-threatening complications such as pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. Antibiotic treatment can fail to fully resolve the primary infection, resulting in the relapse of disease in up to 20% of cases. C. difficile has been listed as an urgent threat by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA), with an estimated 500,000 cases per year and 12,800 deaths, along with $1 billion in attributable costs in the United States. The economic impact of CDI also represents a significant burden in Europe, with costs to healthcare systems estimated at €3,000 million per year. Risk factors for the development of primary CDI include age ≥ 65 years, antibiotic use, with an increased risk for each additional antibiotic prescribed, and prior hospital admission.

### A contemporary review of Clostridioides difficile infections in patients with haematologic diseases [^113JqRua]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile (C. difficile) infection is one of the most common causes of increased morbidity and mortality. Approximately 500,000 C. difficile infections (CDIs) occur each year in the United States, resulting in more than 29,000 deaths. Patients with haematologic diseases are at a higher risk for this infection due to frequent hospitalization and exposure to treatment-associated risk factors. While several currently available antimicrobial agents offer resolution, recurrence of infection remains a major concern. Recent advancements in deciphering C. difficile virulence mechanisms and identifying its allies contributing to the infection have led to the development of alternative treatment strategies.

- **Major risk factors**: Here, we provide a contemporary discussion of how major risk factors in haematologic diseases, such as immunosuppression, chemoradiation, use of antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and opioids, as well as deficiencies in butyrate and antimicrobial peptides, contribute to C. difficile infection.

- **Control and mitigation approaches**: Next, we highlight different approaches to control and mitigate this infection, such as antibiotic stewardship and fecal microbiota transplantation.

- **Emerging treatments**: Finally, we explore several emerging treatments, including the use of pre- and probiotics, immunotherapy, and microbiome-sparing agents.

### SPL drug information for doxycycline hyclate [^113Lfe7f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of doxycycline hyclate PO (also known as Doxy 100, Acticlate):

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as C. difficile-associated diarrhea has been linked to the use of doxycycline. Symptoms may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.

- **Dental enamel hypoplasia and tooth abnormalities**: Use caution during tooth development periods (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years), as use may lead to abnormal permanent discoloration. It should only be used in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less when the potential benefits outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions.

- **Hepatic and renal dysfunction, and blood dyscrasias**: Maintain a high level of suspicion in long-term therapy; monitoring of various organ systems is warranted.

- **Increased BUN**: Maintain a high level of suspicion for an increase in BUN due to its antianabolic action.

- **Increased ICP**: Exercise caution in women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of intracranial hypertension. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted due to the possibility of permanent visual loss.

- **Malaria infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion for the transmission of malaria to mosquitoes in non-endemic regions, as the prophylactic use of doxycycline does not fully suppress the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium strains.

- **Photosensitivity of skin**: Use caution in patients with excessive sunlight/artificial UV light exposure, as exposure can exacerbate this condition.

### Clostridioides difficile infection evaluation and management in the emergency department [^112UE5on]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), characterized primarily by diffuse diarrhea in the setting of recent healthcare and antibiotic exposure, maintains significantly high rates of diagnosis in the US, even in the emergency department (ED). Recent updates in the literature concerning CDI should be considered for effective clinical practice in the ED setting.

- **Objective**: This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of data for the ED-based evaluation and management of CDI.

- **Discussion**: Substantial literature on the risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and treatment regimens has recently been published concerning CDI. These studies include evaluation of risks associated with specific antibiotic classes, demonstrating that even single doses of antibiotics pose a significant risk of CDI. Disproportional increases in elderly CDI rates show particular vulnerability in this population. Updated literature reveals presenting symptoms with broad ranges in rates of diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and nausea with vomiting. In some patients, diarrhea may be altogether absent, clouding clinical suspicion. Classification primarily centers on a non-severe/severe division from the IDSA. Treatment has largely shifted away from metronidazole as a first-line antibiotic, instead focusing on oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin, even for an initial episode of CDI in an uncomplicated patient. Attention to hand hygiene and adherence to contact precautions are key to infection prevention.

- **Conclusions**: CDI causes significant illness throughout the U.S. Successful CDI diagnosis…

### Clostridium difficile infection: a review of current and emerging therapies [^116wRtSn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection is associated with several clinical manifestations and risk factors. These include an increased white blood cell (WBC) count, recent hospitalization, abdominal cramps, and sepsis. The infection is often seen in individuals with immunocompromising conditions and can lead to complications such as pseudomembranous colitis, positive stool C. difficile toxin A/B genes, and tachycardia. Other symptoms are abdominal tenderness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or antibiotics.

The condition can escalate to severe states such as shock, megacolon, and fever, and may involve symptoms like nausea, increased serum creatinine, hypotension, vomiting, altered mental status, mucus in stools, and the use of H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs). Further clinical signs include distended bowel loops, positive stool glutamate dehydrogenase, dehydration, ileus, decreased bowel sounds, hematochezia, and associations with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

### Pain killers: The interplay between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Clostridioides difficile infection [^115EN1i4]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile is one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections worldwide. Increases in incidence, severity, and healthcare costs associated with C. difficile infection (CDI) have made this pathogen an urgent public health threat worldwide. The factors shaping the evolving epidemiology of CDI and impacting clinical outcomes of infection are not well understood but involve tripartite interactions between the host, microbiota, and C. difficile.

Emerging data suggests an underappreciated role for environmental factors, such as diet and pharmaceutical drugs, in CDI. In this review, we discuss the role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and eicosanoids in CDI.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management of infection [^115xdFfF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States, imposing a significant burden on our healthcare system and affecting approximately 365,000 people annually. The financial burden of managing this infection is considerable, with estimates indicating that all-cause direct medical costs for a population aged 18–64 are approximately US$72,000 for those with no recurrence and approximately US$200,000 for those with three or more recurrences. Given these considerations, optimizing therapies with data-driven recommendations by experts in the field can be most beneficial to minimize the burden of this disease on our patients, lessen the frequency of recurrence, and improve overall outcomes. Clinical guideline recommendations are an essential tool guiding treatment as they summarize data for a disease and provide algorithms to manage patients based on data that has been critically validated.

The CDI epidemic essentially began in the mid-1990s and continues to this day. As this epidemic has extended, there have been more reports and studies considering this infection. When searching "C. difficile" in PubMed, there were 68 references in 1995. In 2020, there were 726. With this influx of new studies, there have been surprisingly few well-performed prospective randomized controlled trials comparing treatments head-to-head. As a result, we rely on smaller studies or non-standard designs to guide our treatments for CDI.

### Does doxycycline protect against development of Clostridium difficile infection [^112JAd7j]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Receipt of antibiotics is a major risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Doxycycline has been associated with a lower risk for CDI than other antibiotics. We investigated whether doxycycline protected against the development of CDI in hospitalized patients receiving ceftriaxone, a high-risk antibiotic for CDI.

- **Methods**: We studied adults admitted to an academic county hospital between 1 June 2005 and 31 December 2010, who received ceftriaxone to determine whether the additional receipt of doxycycline decreased the risk of CDI. Patients were followed from the first administration of ceftriaxone to the occurrence of CDI or administrative closure 30 days later.

- **Results**: Two thousand three hundred five unique patients comprising 2734 hospitalizations were studied. Overall, 43 patients developed CDI within 30 days of ceftriaxone receipt, an incidence of 5.60 cases per 10,000 patient-days. The incidence of CDI was 1.67 cases per 10,000 patient-days in those receiving doxycycline, compared to 8.11 per 10,000 patient-days in those who did not receive doxycycline. In a multivariable model adjusted for age, gender, race, comorbidities, hospital duration, pneumonia diagnosis, surgical admission, and duration of ceftriaxone and other antibiotics, for each day of doxycycline receipt, the rate of CDI was 27% lower than in patients who did not receive doxycycline (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.96).

- **Conclusions**: In this cohort of patients receiving ceftriaxone, doxycycline was associated with a lower risk of CDI. Guidelines recommend this combination…

### Advances in the medical treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^111r1xjw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile medical management has changed significantly over the past decade, with an emphasis on preventing reinfection. This review compares guidelines on the treatment of initial, recurrent, fulminant, and pediatric C. difficile infection (CDI) and evaluates the mechanisms and clinical use of available antibiotics for CDI. C. difficile has complex resistance mechanisms to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole, which may play a role in treatment outcomes. Antibiotics such as tigecycline and rifaximin, as well as monoclonal antibodies against toxin B, may play a role in adjunctive therapy. Additional therapies under development include new narrow therapeutic antibiotics.

### A unique class of Zn-binding serine-based PBPs underlies cephalosporin resistance and sporogenesis in Clostridioides difficile [^115mgpG2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a condition where the anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium C. difficile infects the large intestine, producing symptoms that range from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. As the most common hospital-acquired infection, the pathogenesis of CDI is well-understood. Initially, antibiotics are administered for an unrelated infection or prophylaxis, causing the gut flora diversity to diminish. Without competition in the large intestine, C. difficile can easily proliferate, secreting toxins that cause cell death.

The primary risk factor for CDI is broad-spectrum antibiotics, specifically those with weak activity against C. difficile and strong activity against other gut bacteria. Currently, 3rd generation cephalosporins and clindamycin present the highest odds ratio for CDI (3.20, 2.86), followed by 2nd and 4th generation cephalosporins (2.23, 2.14). Other risk factors include treatment duration, age, overall health, and diet. Specifically, recent studies have found Zn 2+-rich diets increase the likelihood and severity of CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: The role of infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship [^115kWmSC]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Low credibility.

There are two primary approaches to prevent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in children: preventing transmission and acquisition of the organism, and preventing the progression from colonization to disease. The most important interventions to reduce the risk of transmission include contact precautions, hand hygiene, and environmental disinfection. Glove use minimizes contamination of the hands by spores and is associated with reductions in CDI incidence. Hand hygiene with soap and water and disinfection with a sporicidal agent are recommended as the best approaches in hyperendemic settings.

Because antibiotic exposure is the most important modifiable risk factor for CDI, antimicrobial stewardship focused on identified high-risk antibiotic classes (including clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins) is critical to preventing progression from colonization to infection. Despite clear evidence that antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are associated with reduced CDI rates in adults, data demonstrating the ASP impact on pediatric CDI are lacking.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to management of recurrence, the ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend performing fecal microbiota transplantation after standard-of-care antibiotic pretreatment. Alternatively, administering bezlotoxumab in addition to standard-of-care antibiotic treatment is suggested as options for a second or further CDI recurrence. This decision should be based on patient characteristics, previous treatment, local regulations, availability, and feasibility. It is crucial to obtain an adequate multidisciplinary risk assessment for fecal microbiota transplantation and to ensure that fecal microbiota transplantation products are available with standardized preparation and screening.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^112L9jjm]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile is the most significant infectious cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea worldwide and a leading cause of healthcare-associated infection in the United States. The incidence of C. difficile infection (CDI) in children has increased, with 20,000 cases now reported annually, also posing indirect educational and economic consequences. In contrast to infection in adults, CDI in children is more frequently community-associated, accounting for three-quarters of all cases. A wide spectrum of disease severity ranges from asymptomatic carriage to severe diarrhea, varying by age. Fulminant disease, although rare in children, is associated with high morbidity and even fatality.

Diagnosis of CDI can be challenging, as currently available tests detect either the presence of an organism or disease-causing toxin but cannot distinguish colonization from infection. Since colonization can be high in specific pediatric groups, such as infants and young children, biomarkers to aid in accurate diagnosis are urgently needed. Similar to the disease in adults, recurrence of CDI in children is common, affecting 20% to 30% of incident cases. Metronidazole has long been considered the mainstay therapy for CDI in children. However, new evidence supports the safety and efficacy of oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin as additional treatment options, whereas fecal microbiota transplantation is gaining popularity for reinfection. Recent advancements in our understanding of emerging epidemiologic trends and management of CDI unique to children are highlighted.

### Low risk of primary Clostridium difficile infection with tetracyclines: A systematic review and metaanalysis [^114payei]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The choice of antibiotics for systemic infections in patients with a high risk of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) remains a clinical practice dilemma. Although some studies suggest that tetracyclines may be associated with a lower risk of CDI than other antibiotics, other results are conflicting. We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of studies that assessed the risk of CDI with tetracyclines compared to other antibiotics.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Web of Science from January 1978 through December 2016 to include studies that assessed the association between tetracycline use and risk of CDI. Weighted summary estimates were calculated using generalized inverse variance with a random-effects model using RevMan 5.3. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

- **Results**: Six studies (4 case-control, 2 cohort) with patient recruitment between 1993 and 2012 were included. Metaanalysis using a random-effects model demonstrated that tetracyclines were associated with a decreased risk of CDI (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.47–0.81; P < .001). There was significant heterogeneity, with an I² of 53% with no publication bias. Subgroup analysis of studies that evaluated the risk of CDI with doxycycline alone also demonstrated a decreased risk of CDI (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.40–0.75; P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Metaanalyses of existing studies suggest that tetracyclines may be associated with a decreased risk of CDI compared with other antimicrobials.

### Impact of doxycycline on Clostridioides difficile infection in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [^111xH5Ye]. American Journal of Infection Control (2024). High credibility.

Antibiotic use is a significant risk factor associated with Clostridioides difficile (C difficile) infection (CDI). Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common infection leading to hospital admission and the use of antibiotics that are highly associated with CDI. It has been proposed that doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, may be protective against CDI.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted in hospitalized patients in Veterans Affairs Hospitals across the United States to determine if doxycycline was associated with a decreased risk of CDI. The primary outcome was the development of CDI within 30 days of initiation of doxycycline or azithromycin, as part of a standard pneumonia regimen.

- **Results**: Approximately 156,107 hospitalized patients who received care at a Veterans Affairs Hospital and were diagnosed with CAP during the study timeframe were included. A 17% decreased risk of CDI was identified with doxycycline compared to azithromycin when used with ceftriaxone for the treatment of pneumonia (P = .03). In patients who had a prior history of CDI, doxycycline decreased the incidence of CDI by 45% (odds ratio 0.55; p = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: Doxycycline is associated with a lower risk of CDI compared to azithromycin when used for atypical coverage in CAP. Thus, patients who are at such risk may benefit from doxycycline as a first-line agent for atypical coverage, rather than the use of a macrolide antibiotic, if Legionella is not of concern.

### Microbiota-based markers predictive of development of Clostridioides difficile infection [^113CP91A]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Antibiotic-induced modulation of the intestinal microbiota can lead to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), which is associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs globally. Therefore, identification of markers predictive of CDI could substantially contribute to guiding therapy and decreasing the infection burden. Here, we analyze the intestinal microbiota of hospitalized patients at increased CDI risk in a prospective, 90-day cohort study before and after antibiotic treatment and at diarrhea onset.

We show that patients developing CDI already exhibit significantly lower diversity before antibiotic treatment and a distinct microbiota enriched in Enterococcus and depleted of Ruminococcus, Blautia, Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium compared to non-CDI patients. We find that antibiotic treatment-induced dysbiosis is class-specific, with beta-lactams further increasing enterococcal abundance. Our findings, validated in an independent prospective patient cohort developing CDI, can be exploited to enrich for high-risk patients in prospective clinical trials and to develop predictive microbiota-based diagnostics for management of patients at risk for CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: Update on management [^115WwQeP]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. This infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B or nucleic acid amplification testing. In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors.

Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial infection or a reinfection and on the severity based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of non-severe C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple recurrences and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three episodes. Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection.

### Prevention of infection due to Clostridium (Clostridioides) difficile [^114EVHok]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Clostridium (Clostridioides) difficile infection (CDI) causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States every year. Prevention of CDI is difficult because of spore durability and requires implementation of multipronged strategies.

- **Infection control and prevention**: Hand hygiene, contact precautions, patient isolation, and environmental decontamination are cornerstones of infection control and prevention.

- **Risk factor reduction**: Risk factor reduction should focus on antibiotic stewardship to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

If CDI incidence remains higher than the institution's goal despite these measures, then special measures should be considered.

### Diverse sources and latent reservoirs of community-associated Clostridioides difficile infection [^111c8c3V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile is a spore-forming, toxin-producing, anaerobic bacterium that infects the human gastrointestinal tract, causing diarrhea and life-threatening colitis. The epidemiology of C. difficile continues to evolve, and it is recognized as a major community-associated (CA) pathogen in addition to its established role in causing healthcare-associated (HA) infections. While surveillance and prevention measures mainly focus on healthcare-associated C. difficile infections (HA-CDI), much less is known about the factors that drive CA-CDI.

This review highlights the potential contribution of reservoirs, including asymptomatic carriers, to CA C. difficile transmission. The reservoirs discussed in this review provide potential avenues for research to better understand and reduce CA transmission of C. difficile.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of doxycycline hyclate IV (also known as Doxy 100, Acticlate) include the following:

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as C. difficile-associated diarrhea has been associated with the use of doxycycline. Symptoms may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.

- **Dental enamel hypoplasia, tooth abnormalities**: Use caution for the use of doxycycline during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years), which may lead to abnormal permanent discoloration. Use in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions.

- **Increased BUN**: Use caution in patients with impaired renal function, as doxycycline can cause an increase in BUN due to its antianabolic action.

- **Increased ICP**: Use caution in women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of intracranial hypertension.

- **Photosensitivity of skin**: Use caution in patients with excessive sunlight or artificial UV light exposure.

- **Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme**: Maintain a high level of suspicion for skin sensitivity reactions. Discontinue doxycycline immediately if present.

### Doxycycline [^116v235L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

If Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

- **Severe skin reactions**: Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with doxycycline and have been associated with worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption. If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue doxycycline immediately and institute appropriate therapy.

- **Intracranial hypertension (IH)**: Intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines, including doxycycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.

Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted.

### Tigecycline [^115atigZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea**: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including tigecycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. A careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

- **Sepsis/septic shock in patients with intestinal perforation**: Monotherapy with tigecycline should be avoided in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) secondary to clinically apparent intestinal perforation. In cIAI studies (n = 1642), 6 patients treated with tigecycline and 2 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin presented with intestinal perforations and developed sepsis/septic shock.

### Prognostic factors for severe and recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: A systematic review [^1161ph4B]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), along with its subsequent recurrences (rCDIs) and severe cases (sCDI), poses a significant burden on both patients and the healthcare system. Identifying patients diagnosed with an initial CDI who are at increased risk of developing sCDI or rCDI is crucial for aiding more cost-effective therapeutic decisions. This systematic review aimed to identify clinical prognostic factors associated with an increased risk of developing sCDI or rCDI.

PubMed, Embase, Emcare, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases were comprehensively searched from their inception until March 2021. The study included cohort and case-control studies, with participants being patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with CDI. Data were analyzed to predict sCDI or rCDI based on clinical or laboratory factors. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Research (QUIPS) tool and a version of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool modified for prognostic studies. Study selection was executed by two independent reviewers. Overview tables of prognostic factors were created to evaluate the number of studies, the direction of the effect, and the statistical significance of associations.

A total of 136 studies were included in the final analysis. For sCDI, greater age and the presence of multiple comorbidities were significant prognostic factors. Identified risk factors for rCDI included greater age, healthcare-associated CDI, prior hospitalization, the initiation of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) during or after CDI diagnosis, and a history of previous rCDI.

### Epidemiology of community-acquired and recurrent infection [^113GSzbg]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections with significant morbidity and mortality. For the past decade, efforts in infection prevention and epidemiologic surveillance have largely focused on mitigating hospital-acquired C. difficile. However, the incidence of community-associated infection is on the rise. Patients with community-associated C. difficile tend to be younger and have a lower mortality rate.

Rates of recurrent C. difficile infection overall have decreased in the United States, but future research and public health endeavors are needed to standardize and improve disease detection. It is also essential to stratify risk factors in large-scale population studies, and identify regional and local variations in strain types, reservoirs, and transmission routes. These steps are crucial to help characterize and combat the changing epidemiology of C. difficile.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^115rzSJH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection occurs when the bacterium produces toxin that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of adults with C. difficile infection and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not the only, approach to clinical scenarios.

### The impact of diet on Clostridioides difficile infection: A review [^117BZSdv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile poses a significant public health challenge as it is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The metabolism and pathogenesis of Clostridioides difficile are strongly influenced by nutrient availability from the host and gut commensals. This has led to increasing interest in the role of dietary intake and diet-derived metabolites in C. difficile infection (CDI). Although much of the data currently originates from animal models, there is growing evidence of the ability of diet to impact CDI-related outcomes. This review aims to enhance the understanding of dietary components that impact C. difficile metabolism and pathogenesis, as well as highlight limitations in the current science to support future inquiry. Without a better understanding of the influence of diet on CDI in humans, we lack a nonpharmacologic approach to prevent and treat this important condition.

### Clostridium difficile infection: A review of current and emerging therapies [^116p4RYa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Although the efficacy of metronidazole is declining, it remains the initial therapy for the majority of patients who have mild-to-moderate infection and as the treatment of choice for the first recurrence of CDI. Vancomycin continues to be recommended as initial therapy for severe CDI. Early surgical consultation is required in the event of severe complicated CDI.

The treatment of multiple recurrences of CDI is challenging. The use of FMT presents an enormous breakthrough as a therapy for recurrent CDI; however, multicenter RCTs with long-term follow-up are essential to assess the efficacy and safety of FMT.

There are many novel treatment strategies emerging involving the use of non-antibiotics, which appear promising. They provide optimistic approaches to future therapy. However, there is limited knowledge about the safety and efficacy of these treatments. Further research should be conducted to enable these treatment modalities to be widely accepted.

Clostridium difficile infection is a major health care challenge in terms of patient and economic consequences. For patients, it is a morbid and sometimes life-threatening iatrogenic complication of antibiotic treatment. In the United States, the provider's institution may face financial penalties because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention views this as an iatrogenic health care-associated complication that may not be reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This has resulted in substantial incentives for new approaches to prevention and treatment.
