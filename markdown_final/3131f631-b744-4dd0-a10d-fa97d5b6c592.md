## Question

Does barium cure sbo

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether barium cures small-bowel obstruction (SBO). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanism of barium sulfate. Then, I should verify what the evidence shows about any therapeutic effect of barium in SBO. Next, I will compare this with the evidence for water-soluble contrast agents, which are sometimes used therapeutically. After that, I need to check guideline positions and safety considerations that would preclude barium use in SBO. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and practical recommendation, making sure I don't conflate diagnostic versus therapeutic roles of contrast agents [^117GoLQL] [^112o6KZE] [^115iJ7vo].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and intended use of barium sulfate. Barium sulfate is a radiopaque, biologically inert compound used as a positive contrast agent for gastrointestinal imaging; it has no known pharmacological effects and passes through the GI tract unchanged, which means it cannot mechanically relieve an obstruction or pharmacologically alter motility to "cure" SBO [^117GoLQL] [^1177vhto].

> Wait, let me verify whether any guideline or high-quality evidence supports barium as a treatment for SBO. I need to check the Bologna guidelines and contemporary reviews; they consistently describe barium as a diagnostic tool and emphasize water-soluble contrast agents for potential therapeutic use in adhesive SBO, not barium, and they do not list barium as a therapeutic modality for SBO resolution [^112o6KZE] [^116ws9Fc] [^113Ewzaq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the evidence base for water-soluble contrast agents (WSCA) like Gastrografin, because some might conflate "contrast" with "barium". Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that WSCA can shorten hospital stay and may reduce the need for surgery in some contexts, though results vary across studies; importantly, this pertains to hyperosmolar water-soluble agents, not barium, which lacks osmotic or pro-motility effects [^113fLBRs] [^116rC5AJ] [^115D5w7m] [^115iJ7vo].

> I should double-check safety considerations that would make barium particularly inappropriate in suspected SBO. FDA labeling for barium products lists known or suspected GI obstruction as a contraindication due to risks of barium impaction, barolith formation, and worsening obstruction; barium leakage in the setting of occult perforation can cause chemical peritonitis and granulomatous reactions, which are additional reasons to avoid barium in this setting [^113siprw] [^114ptog5] [^1159yv7N] [^114xGT6X] [^112MWpTj].

> Let me consider real-world complications that reinforce this risk. Case reports and series document baroliths causing large-bowel obstruction after barium studies, and contemporary reports continue to highlight this rare but serious sequela; these complications arise because barium can inspissate and form firm concretions that themselves obstruct the bowel, which is the opposite of a therapeutic effect in SBO [^115Fi3XF] [^113aUVwD].

> Next, I should review what guidelines actually recommend for conservative SBO management. Authoritative guidelines endorse nonoperative care with nasogastric decompression, fluid resuscitation, and selective use of WSCA to both stratify likelihood of resolution and potentially hasten it; they do not recommend barium for treatment, and they caution against barium in obstruction due to safety concerns [^112o6KZE] [^116U7Dsr] [^1138bjgk].

> But wait, what if someone argues that barium could theoretically "push through" a partial obstruction? Hmm, wait a minute, that would be misleading; barium has no osmotic or pharmacologic pro-motility action and carries a meaningful risk of impaction proximal to a stricture or adhesion, so using barium therapeutically risks converting a partial obstruction into a complete one or creating a barolith, which is why it is contraindicated in known or suspected obstruction on safety grounds [^117GoLQL] [^113siprw] [^114ptog5].

> I will now examine the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating. There is no evidence that barium cures SBO, and multiple safety labels list obstruction as a contraindication to barium use; by contrast, water-soluble contrast agents have modest but real benefits in adhesive SBO and are the agents of choice when contrast is used therapeutically or diagnostically in this context, underscoring that barium should be avoided as a treatment for SBO [^114ptog5] [^115iJ7vo] [^113fLBRs] [^116rC5AJ].

> Final answer: No, barium does not cure small-bowel obstruction; it is a diagnostic contrast agent with no therapeutic effect in SBO and is contraindicated in obstruction due to risks of impaction, barolith formation, and complications from potential leakage, whereas water-soluble contrast agents may reduce length of stay and, in some studies, operative rates, and are the preferred agents when contrast is used in SBO management [^117GoLQL] [^113siprw] [^112o6KZE] [^115iJ7vo].

Barium does not cure small bowel obstruction (SBO) [^117GoLQL]. It is a **diagnostic contrast agent** with no therapeutic effect and is contraindicated in suspected or known obstruction due to risks of impaction, perforation, and barium peritonitis [^117GoLQL] [^113siprw] [^111fzA4U]. Barium can worsen obstruction by forming baroliths and causing **impaction** [^115Fi3XF] [^113aUVwD]. Water-soluble contrast agents (e.g. Gastrografin) are preferred for both diagnostic and potential therapeutic use in partial SBO, as they are safer and may reduce the need for surgery and shorten hospital stay [^112o6KZE] [^115iJ7vo] [^113fLBRs]. Barium should be avoided in SBO; use water-soluble contrast or CT instead [^113siprw] [^116wWtZ6].

---

## Pharmacological properties of barium sulfate

Barium sulfate is a **radiopaque contrast agent** that is biologically inert and not absorbed or metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract [^117GoLQL]. It is used primarily for diagnostic imaging because it provides clear delineation of the gastrointestinal lumen on radiographs [^1177vhto]. It has **no pharmacological effects** that would promote bowel movement or relieve obstruction [^117GoLQL].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding barium in SBO

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting the therapeutic use of barium sulfate in the management of SBO [^notfound]. Barium is not recommended for therapeutic intervention in SBO because it lacks any pharmacological properties that would facilitate resolution of obstruction [^117GoLQL]. Its role is limited to diagnostic imaging, and even then, it is contraindicated in patients with suspected or confirmed obstruction [^113siprw].

---

## Risks and complications associated with barium in SBO

Using barium sulfate in patients with SBO carries **significant risks and complications**, including:

- **Impaction and barolith formation**: Barium can accumulate proximal to the obstruction, forming hard concretions known as baroliths, which can exacerbate the obstruction and necessitate surgical intervention [^115Fi3XF] [^113aUVwD].

- **Perforation and peritonitis**: If a perforation occurs, barium can leak into the peritoneal cavity, causing chemical peritonitis, granuloma formation, and severe inflammatory reactions [^1159yv7N] [^117PSvM5].

- **Aspiration pneumonitis**: Barium aspiration can occur, particularly in patients with impaired swallowing or vomiting, leading to severe respiratory complications [^111fzA4U] [^114xGT6X].

Given these risks, barium sulfate is **contraindicated** in patients with suspected or confirmed gastrointestinal obstruction [^113siprw] [^114ptog5].

---

## Alternative contrast agents: water-soluble contrast media

Water-soluble contrast agents, such as Gastrografin (diatrizoate meglumine), are **preferred in the management of SBO** [^112o6KZE]. These agents have hyperosmolar properties that draw water into the intestinal lumen, potentially softening impacted material and promoting bowel movement [^112biUPa]. Clinical studies have demonstrated that water-soluble contrast agents can:

- **Predict resolution**: The appearance of contrast in the colon within 24 hours of administration strongly predicts successful non-operative resolution of adhesive SBO, with high sensitivity and specificity [^113fLBRs] [^116rC5AJ].

- **Reduce need for surgery**: Some studies suggest that water-soluble contrast agents may reduce the need for surgical intervention, although this finding is not universally consistent across all studies [^111nzMBF] [^115iJ7vo].

- **Shorten hospital stay**: Water-soluble contrast agents have been shown to significantly reduce hospital length of stay, even if they do not consistently reduce the need for surgery [^113fLBRs] [^116rC5AJ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) **recommend against the use of barium sulfate** in patients with suspected or confirmed SBO [^112o6KZE] [^116U7Dsr]. Instead, they recommend the use of water-soluble contrast agents or computed tomography (CT) imaging for diagnostic evaluation and management of SBO [^113Ewzaq] [^116U7Dsr].

---

## Clinical scenarios where barium may be considered

Barium sulfate may be considered in specific clinical scenarios where obstruction has been excluded and the diagnostic benefits outweigh the risks, such as:

- **Evaluation of chronic gastrointestinal conditions**: Barium studies may be useful in evaluating chronic gastrointestinal conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease or structural abnormalities, where obstruction is not suspected [^1119Pk97].

- **Lower gastrointestinal tract imaging**: Barium enemas may be used for lower gastrointestinal tract imaging when obstruction has been excluded and other diagnostic modalities are unavailable or contraindicated [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Barium sulfate **does not cure small bowel obstruction** and is contraindicated in patients with suspected or confirmed obstruction due to significant risks, including impaction, perforation, and aspiration [^113siprw] [^114ptog5]. Water-soluble contrast agents are preferred for both diagnostic and potential therapeutic use in SBO, as they are safer and may facilitate resolution of partial obstructions [^112o6KZE] [^115iJ7vo]. Clinicians should adhere to current clinical guidelines and avoid the use of barium sulfate in the management of SBO [^113Ewzaq].

### ACR appropriateness criteria on suspected small-bowel obstruction [^116wWtZ6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

With no one generally accepted approach to evaluate patients with suspected small-bowel obstruction (SBO), standard CT has emerged as the preeminent imaging modality and should be considered in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected high-grade SBO. Playing less significant roles in the diagnosis of acute SBO are barium enemas and the small-bowel examination.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^112o6KZE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and has a great value in all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high grade SBO. However CT-scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis. CT can confirm the presence of complete obstruction and allow the diagnosis of the cause of SBO, it can also exclude a non-adhesional pathology and assess the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and a NPV of nearly 100%.

IV contrast is necessary. Oral is not

Water-soluble contrast follow-through is valuable in patients undergoing initial non operative conservative management in order to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery.

This investigation is safer than barium in cases of perforation and peritoneal spread and has possible therapeutic value in the case of adhesive small intestine obstruction.

MRI use should be restricted to those patients having CT or iodine contrast contraindications.

- Conservative treatment and timing for surgery

The management of small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions is controversial because surgery can induce new adhesions, whereas conservative treatment does not remove the cause of the obstruction. Conservative treatment involves nasogastric intubation, intravenous fluid administration, and clinical observation. Strangulation of the bowel requires immediate surgery, but intestinal ischemia can be difficult to determine clinically. Several issues are raised when managing patients with ASBO.

The first question is whether to operate or not to operate

Patients without the signs of strangulation or peritonitis or history of persistent vomiting or combination of CT scan signs (free fluid, mesenteric oedema, lack of faeces signa, devascularized bowel) and partial ASBO can safely undergo non-operative management (LoE 1a GoR A)

In the absence of any signs of strangulation, patients with an adhesive SBO can be managed safely with non-operative treatment and tube decompression should be attempted (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A)

Patients who had surgery within the six weeks before the episode of small bowel obstruction, patients with signs of strangulation or peritonitis (fever, tachycardia and leucocytosis, metabolic acidosis and continuous pain), patients with irreducible hernia and patients who started to have signs of resolution at the time of admission are NOT candidate for conservative treatment ± WSCA administration (Level of Evidence 1a GoR A)

Initial evaluation

After an accurate physical examination and the evaluation of WBC, Lactate, Electrolytes, BUN/Creat; first step of diagnostic work up for ASBO is supine and erect plain abdominal X-ray which can show multiple air-fluid levels, distension of small bowel loops and the absence of gas in the colonic section.

All patients being evaluated for small bowel obstruction should have plain films (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C).

Secondary evaluation

CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and has a great value in all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high grade SBO. However CT-scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis (Level of Evidence 2b GoR B).

CT scan often allows to confirm the presence of complete obstruction, to reach the diagnosis of the cause of SBO, it also exclude a non-adhesional pathology and assess the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and a NPV of nearly 100%.

The association of CT scan signs of bowel ischemia should lead a low threshold for surgical intervention (Level of Evidence 2a GoR B).

Ultrasound has a limited value in bowel obstruction or in patients with distended bowel, because the air may obscure the underlying findings. Usual US findings are: distention, peristalsis (differential diagnosis of ileus vs. mechanical SBO), differences in mucosal folds around transition point, free fluid (sign of ischemia).

MRI use should be restricted to those patients having CT or iodine contrast contraindications (Level of Evidence 2c GoR C).

Water-soluble contrast follow-through is valuable in patients undergoing initial non operative conservative management in order to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A). Water-soluble contrast administration has both diagnostic and therapeutic value.

This investigation is safer than barium in cases of perforation and peritoneal spread and has possible therapeutic value in the case of adhesive small intestine obstruction.

### Current concepts in imaging of small bowel obstruction [^114w5RkU]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction continue to evolve. The imaging approach in the work-up of patients with known or suspected small bowel obstruction and the timing of surgical intervention in this disease have undergone considerable changes over the past two decades. This article examines the current concepts related to the use of imaging technology in the diagnosis and management of patients with small bowel obstruction. The meaning of frequently used but poorly defined terms in describing intestinal obstruction is clarified and illustrated.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^116cMkPD]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

However, the study's strengths lie in its modern, prospective, and multicentre nature, which is necessary for capturing variations in practice. This approach has generated testable hypotheses and provided valuable insights into how surgeons have translated data from clinical trials into real-world practice. Although sites were provided with general guidance, contrast administration and follow-up protocols were not strictly standardized, which may have introduced variability in practice. Furthermore, the data collected were unable to fully capture factors such as the presence of a hostile abdomen, which may have influenced treatment decisions. A recent survey of surgeons examining their beliefs and rationale for WSCA use found considerable divergence in opinions about its primary mode of action — whether diagnostic, therapeutic, or both. These findings highlight the need for greater standardization in contrast use protocols and a clearer understanding of when and why WSCA is employed in clinical practice. Future research should explore patient-reported outcomes and alternative contrast agents to further optimize the management of aSBO.

### Intraperitoneal barium from gastrointestinal perforations: reassessment of the prognosis and long-term effects [^1163uGe8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to reassess the outcome and potential consequences of intraperitoneal barium leakage during radiologic evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included 18 patients who had significant intraperitoneal leakage of barium from gastrointestinal perforations that were not suspected or diagnosed before the radiologic procedures. This complication occurred during a barium enema examination in nine patients, an upper gastrointestinal study in seven, and a small bowel series in two patients. All patients underwent urgent laparotomy for repair of perforation, with vigorous peritoneal lavage and antibiotic therapy. RESULTS. All patients had an uneventful recovery and were followed for 4–17 years (mean, 8.5 years). Radiographs obtained during this interval showed that a significant amount of residual barium was retained in the abdominal cavity. Six patients had a total of 10 subsequent abdominal operations for unrelated conditions, and some had developed barium granulomas and peritoneal adhesions. However, none of the patients in this series experienced intestinal obstruction or any clinical symptoms related to barium deposits in the abdominal cavity. CONCLUSION. Intraperitoneal leakage of barium is a rare complication of radiologic gastrointestinal examinations, and this series of 18 cases reflects 3 decades of experience at two major medical centers. The presented data indicate that the commonly held and perpetuated concept about the high rate of morbidity and mortality of this complication would not be valid in the modern era of medical and surgical management.

### Can small bowel obstruction during pregnancy be treated with conservative management? A review [^113Qv9QA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is present in more than 85% of pregnant women with SBIO. Due to the nature of pregnancy, abdominal pain can be confused with gastroenteritis or premature labour, whereas vomiting might be treated as hyperemesis gravidarum. Constant and nonremitting abdominal pain should alert practitioners to rule out the possibility of intestinal obstruction, particularly closed-loop obstructions, as the abdominal pain caused by gastroenteritis or uterine contractions is usually associated with periods of remission. Nausea and vomiting persisting into or starting in the third trimester should warrant further investigations to rule out intestinal obstruction.

Physical examination in pregnant women can be challenging and nonspecific due to the gravid uterus. The enlarged gravid uterus might mask abdominal distension caused by SBIO. Intermittent colicky pain caused by the obstructed bowel might be misinterpreted as labour pain. As the obstruction progresses, the uterus may contract due to the underlying irritation. This might confuse obstetricians, who incorrectly diagnose SBIO as early labour with contraction pain. Other clinical signs, such as fever, tachypnoea, hypotension, and tachycardia, usually appear later as secondary manifestations of severe acidosis and infection. Unfortunately, at this stage, this usually means that the bowel is compromised, and it might be too late to offer surgical intervention. All these challenges highlight the clinical difficulties in diagnosing SBIO in pregnant women.

Laboratory tests yield little information besides electrolyte imbalances and impaired renal function in dehydrated patients. Leucocytosis is common during pregnancy, especially in late pregnancy and during labour. However, an increasing trend of leucocytosis over several hours is significant in gravid patients with suspected obstruction and should alert obstetricians to consider other causes.

Radiological imaging, such as X-rays of the abdomen, is used to aid in diagnosing SBIO. Diagnosis may be delayed due to apprehension about using X-ray imaging and exposing the foetus to radiation. However, significant maternal and foetal mortalities associated with acute abdominal emergencies outweigh the potential risk of radiation exposure to the foetus. Sometimes, in the early stage of obstruction, a single film might not be sufficient to diagnose SBIO. However, progressive bowel dilatation or air-fluid levels in serial films obtained at 4–6 h intervals are indicative of SBIO. Previous literature described using contrast studies such as gastrografin or barium studies to diagnose SBIO. This has been gradually phased out in recent years, especially with the widespread availability of advanced imaging modalities such as CT and MRI scans.

### Small bowel obstruction: what to look for… [^112EdT5A]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical syndrome for which effective treatment depends on a rapid and accurate diagnosis. Despite advances in imaging and a better understanding of small bowel pathophysiology, SBO is often diagnosed late or misdiagnosed, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive approach that includes clinical findings, patient history, and triage examinations such as plain abdominal radiography will help the clinician develop an individualized treatment plan. When an SBO is accompanied by signs of strangulation, emergent surgical treatment is advised. If surgery cannot be performed immediately or if a partial obstruction is suspected, then a more detailed radiologic work-up is needed. The imaging techniques used subsequently vary according to the initial findings. If a low-grade partial obstruction is suspected, volume-challenge enteral examinations such as enteroclysis and computed tomographic (CT) enteroclysis are preferred. If a complete or high-grade obstruction is suspected, cross-sectional studies such as ultrasonography or multidetector CT are used to exclude strangulation. An algorithmic approach to imaging is proposed for the management of SBO to achieve accurate diagnosis of the obstruction; determine its severity, site, and cause; and assess the presence of strangulation. Radiologists have a pivotal role in clinical decision making in cases of SBO by providing answers to specific questions that significantly affect management.

Small-bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical condition with signs and symptoms similar to other acute abdominal disorders. The radiologic investigation of patients with SBO as well as the indications and timing of surgical intervention have changed over the past 2 decades. This review focuses on modern imaging techniques and their role in both the diagnosis and treatment of patients with SBO.

### Use of barium for diagnosis of colonic perforation leads to challenging barium peritonitis [^117PSvM5]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

This case demonstrates two major clinical challenges. The first challenge is selecting contrast to evaluate possible gastrointestinal abnormality. Benefits and drawbacks to both water-soluble contrast and barium are outlined in table 1. Although our center was not involved in the initial decision making, an evaluation for perforation demands a stepwise approach using water-soluble contrast or no enteral contrast. A CT scan with no contrast or intravenous contrast only would likely have sufficed in diagnosing perforation due to presence of pneumoperitoneum and/or free fluid. If no perforation is identified with water-soluble contrast, but clinical suspicion remains high, then barium (or water-soluble and barium mixture) may be used to rule out more subtle perforations, depending on the clinical scenario.

Table 1
Benefits and drawbacks of using barium and water-soluble contrast

An additional challenge in this case rests in how to surgically decontaminate the peritoneal cavity. The current limited literature demonstrates that early laparotomy and washout/removal of barium from the peritoneum is beneficial as it can cause chemical peritonitis that can lead to fluid sequestration and hypovolemia. The optimal management strategy for removal of barium is unclear. Irrigation with normal saline is of some benefit, but due to barium's adherent and accumulative nature, it is unlikely to be successful. Direct peritoneal lavage as part of temporary abdominal closure has not yet been described in the literature for barium peritonitis but could be considered and may have benefit. Furthermore, mechanical debridement risks injuring the serosal layer of the bowel and causing chemical irritation that can function similarly to leaving barium on the bowel. Long-term concerns include formation of adhesions due to barium residue on the intestinal serosa leading to recurrent bowel obstructions. Some authors advocate for omentectomy if necessary due to barium saturation to reduce risk of adhesions. The Closed Or Open after Laparotomy Trial seeks to clarify indications for a staged second-look surgery in the case of severe intra-abdominal sepsis using a prospective, randomized study design.

### Posttraumatic small bowel obstruction in children [^111gT4Hb]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of intestinal injuries in children after blunt abdominal trauma can be difficult and delayed. Most children who suffer blunt abdominal trauma are managed nonoperatively, making the diagnosis of intestinal injuries more difficult. We sought to gain information about children who develop intestinal obstruction after blunt abdominal trauma by reviewing our experience.

Methods

Review of records from a pediatric tertiary care center over an 11.5-year period revealed 5 patients who developed small bowel obstruction after blunt trauma to the abdomen. The details of these patients were studied.

Results

All patients were previously managed nonoperatively for blunt abdominal trauma. Intestinal obstruction developed 2 weeks to 1 year (median, 21 days) after the trauma. Abdominal x-ray, computerized tomography scan, or barium meal studies were used to establish the diagnosis. The pathology was either a stricture, an old perforation, or adhesions causing the intestinal obstruction. Laparotomy with resection and anastomosis was curative.

Conclusions

Posttraumatic small bowel obstruction is a clinical entity that needs to be watched for in all patients managed nonoperatively for blunt abdominal trauma.

### Evaluation and management of small-bowel obstruction: an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^116U7Dsr]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small bowel obstruction, more specifically with respect to abdominal CT, EAST 2012 guidelines recommend to consider a water-soluble contrast study in patients who fail to improve after 48 hours of nonoperative management, because a normal contrast study can rule out SBO requiring surgical intervention.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^114D3jt5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The median time to GI recovery was shorter in the no-contrast group at 1 day (i.q.r. 1–2) versus 2 days (i.q.r. 1–5) for the contrast group (P < 0.001). The median hospital length of stay was 4 days (i.q.r. 2–7) for the non-contrast group versus 6 days (i.q.r. 3–12) for the contrast group (P < 0.001). Similarly, among patients who underwent surgery, those who received a contrast challenge had a longer median hospital length of stay (13 days, i.q.r. 9–24 versus 7 days, i.q.r. 6–15, P = 0.033, q = 0.4; Supplementary Material S7).

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: a WSES position paper [^114Dd6Qf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a narrative review with scoping aspects. A formal systematic review and meta-analysis were not feasible due to the many aspects of diagnosis and management of SBO-VA we would like to cover. Moreover, because of the paucity of literature, we will also discuss papers that might not meet strict inclusion criteria as applied in a systematic review.

Therefore, a scooping review search framework was found more appropriate to guide our position paper. In contrast to systematic reviews, where a focused research question with narrow parameter should be chosen, a scoping search allows for a broad research question, adjusting the inclusion and exclusion criteria according to available literature, and the quality of the chosen studies is not a priority. Data might be extracted mainly for qualitative assessment; the quality of the studies found and the data extracted are used to identify gaps in the literature.

Our scooping study followed the 5-step pathway as described by Arksey and O'Malley framework:
Main questions What is the etiology of SBO-VA? What are the outcomes of operative management of SBO-VA? Is a non-operative trial appropriate in patients with SBO-VA?

2 Search strategy for relevant topics

PubMed, the Cochrane database, EMBASE database, and Google Scholar were searched to March 2020 without date restrictions. PubMed studies were identified using the following MeSH terms: "intestinal obstruction", "small intestine", "ileum", "jejunum", and "aged" and keywords "small bowel obstruction", "Virgin abdomen", "non-operative management", "water-soluble contrast agents", and "Gastrografin". Similar search strategies were performed in Embase and Google scholar. The Cochrane database was searched for all articles relating to small bowel obstruction. After performing the different searches, duplicates were identified and deleted.

### Intestinal obstruction from inspissated barium (barolith): a systematic review of all cases from 1950 to 2006 [^115Fi3XF]. Colorectal Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Having encountered a case of large bowel obstruction secondary to a barolith and successfully treated it using colonoscopic dissolution, we systematically reviewed all cases of barolith obstruction to appreciate its incidence and explore its methods of treatment.

Method

A literature search was carried out in the databases British Nursing Index, Cinahal, Embase, Medline, and Pub Med. There was no restriction placed on language of publication in the search.

Results

There were 22 reports describing a total of 31 cases. About one third of the reported cases were successfully treated with conservative measures including the use of laxatives. Significantly, surgery was performed in nearly half of the patients. Interestingly, endoscopic dissolution was attempted in only 3 cases and it was successful in all of them.

Conclusion

This systematic review reveals several reported cases of barolith obstruction from 1950–2006. Only three case reports described colonoscopic dissolution. In our institute, we have recently encountered a case of large bowel obstruction secondary to a barolith and we successfully treated it using colonoscopic dissolution. Given the absence of guidelines to treat barolith induced obstruction, we are of the opinion that should a barolith obstruction occur, in the absence of perforation or ischaemic bowel, endoscopic dissolution by an experienced endoscopist under general anaesthetic offers a safe, effective, and minimally invasive method of relieving the obstruction. Should this fail surgery is indicated.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small bowel obstruction, more specifically with respect to abdominal CT, WSES 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain an abdominal CT scan with oral water-soluble contrast as part of the initial workup of patients with SBO.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^112biUPa]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bowel obstruction is a common condition, accounting for 12–16% of acute surgical admissions. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is the most frequent site, comprising half of all emergency laparotomies performed in England and Wales between 2019 and 2020. The leading cause of SBO is intra-abdominal adhesions, with adhesional small bowel obstruction (aSBO) accounting for approximately 60% of cases. Optimal management of aSBO remains a subject of ongoing debate.

Non-operative management (NOM) for aSBO can be successful in over 70% of patients, with lower rates of short-term morbidity and mortality compared to early surgical intervention. However, it is crucial to promptly identify patients unsuitable for NOM and ensure timely surgical intervention when necessary, as delays exceeding 72 h significantly increase perioperative morbidity. CT imaging is important in decision-making, helping to detect bowel compromise, which usually contraindicates NOM.

Patients without clinical or radiological evidence of bowel compromise can safely undergo initial NOM, which includes gastrointestinal (GI) decompression with a nasogastric tube, fluid and electrolyte replacement, and early administration of water-soluble contrast agents (WSCA). WSCAs have a hyperosmolar effect on the bowel, which is thought to promote the resolution of aSBO by drawing water into the intestinal lumen. Although direct animal studies evaluating this effect are lacking, clinical observations and prior studies suggest that WSCAs may have a therapeutic role in addition to their established function as a diagnostic stratification tool. Although opinions on their administration approach and therapeutic effects vary, they play a key role in assessing the likelihood of success for NOM. Gastrografin (diatrizoate) is the most common WSCA used for aSBO. Although alternative contrast agents such as Omnipaque (iohexol) and Urografin (amidotrizoate) are widely used diagnostically and have excellent safety profiles, there is limited evidence supporting their use as treatment options for aSBO.

A shortage of Gastrografin due to supply chain challenges, raised concerns about the impact on treatment and outcomes for NOM patients. This study aimed to assess the management and outcomes of patients presenting with aSBO in the context of a shortage of Gastrografin.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^114uFw8F]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The physiological rationale for WSCA use in aSBO extends beyond its established diagnostic role. However, although these effects are frequently cited in clinical practice, there is a paucity of direct experimental evidence supporting a consistent therapeutic benefit. The first round of contrast challenges was associated with a two-thirds rate of resolution. For subsequent challenges, this drops to one-third. This suggests that any potential osmotic effects may be limited to initial administration rather than cumulative impact. Repeat challenges may delay further decision-making and increase the risk of adverse events. Interestingly, among patients who did not achieve resolution after repeated challenges, around half proceeded to surgery, whereas the other half continued with NOM. This pattern suggests that WSCA may often be used to defer or avoid surgery, rather than to stratify patients effectively based on the initial challenge outcome. The impact of repeated challenges remains unexplored in trials, but the relatively consistent resolution rate of approximately 30% after subsequent attempts suggests limited benefit. Therefore, a 'one and done' approach might be advocated, wherein a single WSCA challenge is performed, followed by timely progression to definitive management if resolution is not achieved.

Modelling revealed a positive association between the use of WSCA and the likelihood of undergoing surgery. This may mean that early contrast is deployed to facilitate early identification of those at high risk of NOM failure. Another suggestion is that it may be employed as a strategy to defer or potentially avoid an operation, as evidenced by its use in patients who were ultimately palliated following a failed challenge. Notably, patients who had previous episodes of aSBO demonstrated lower rates of surgery. This observation may reflect the effective resolution of obstruction through non-operative means in selected cases. Although the regression model adjusted for key baseline clinical factors, the potential for selection bias remains.

Alternative contrast agents are widely used diagnostically. Low-osmolar WSCA such as Omnipaque are often recommended for patients at higher aspiration risk due to their reduced potential to induce an inflammatory response in the lungs. Previous cohorts investigating the use of Omnipaque as aSBO treatment indicate its safety and efficacy, similar to observed in the present study. However, the limited number of patients receiving alternative contrast agents in this study limits definitive conclusions, and further research is needed to directly compare the clinical outcomes of different contrast agents in aSBO.

### Oral water soluble contrast for the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction [^113fLBRs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesions are the leading cause of small bowel obstruction. Most adhesive small bowel obstructions resolve following conservative treatment but there is no consensus as to when conservative treatment should be considered unsuccessful and the patient should undergo surgery. Studies have shown that failure of an oral water-soluble contrast to reach the colon after a designated time indicates complete intestinal obstruction that is unlikely to resolve with conservative treatment. Other studies have suggested that the administration of water-soluble contrast is therapeutic in resolving the obstruction.

Objectives

The aims of this review are:1. To determine the reliability of water-soluble contrast media and serial abdominal radiographs in predicting the success of conservative treatment in patients admitted with adhesive small bowel obstruction.2. To determine the efficacy and safety of water-soluble contrast media in reducing the need for surgical intervention and reducing hospital stay in adhesive small bowel obstruction.

Search Strategy

The search was conducted using MeSH terms: "Intestinal obstruction", "water-soluble contrast", "Adhesions" and "Gastrografin", and combined with the Cochrane Collaboration highly sensitive search strategy for identifying randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

1. Prospective studies (to evaluate the diagnostic potential of water-soluble contrast in adhesive small bowel obstruction);2. Randomised clinical trials (to evaluate the therapeutic role).

Data Collection and Analysis

1. Studies addressing the diagnostic role of water-soluble contrast were critically appraised and data presented as sensitivities, specificities and positive and negative likelihood ratios. Results were pooled and summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed. 2. A meta-analysis of the data from therapeutic studies was performed using the Mantel -Haenszel test using both the fixed effect and random effects model.

Main Results

The appearance of water-soluble contrast in the caecum on an abdominal radiograph within 24 hours of its administration predicts resolution of an adhesive small bowel obstruction with a pooled sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.96. The area under the curve of the summary ROC was 0.98. Four randomised studies dealing with the therapeutic role of Gastrografin were included in the review, water-soluble contrast did not reduce the need for surgical intervention (odds ratio 1.29, P = 0.36). Meta-analysis of two studies showed that water-soluble contrast reduced hospital stay compared with placebo (weighted mean difference = - 2.58) P = 0.004.

Authors' Conclusions

Published literature strongly supports the use of water-soluble contrast as a predictive test for non-operative resolution of adhesive small bowel obstruction. Although Gastrografin does not cause resolution of small bowel obstruction, it does appear to reduce hospital stay.

### Oral water soluble contrast for the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction [^116rC5AJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesions are the leading cause of small bowel obstruction. Gastrografin transit time may allow for the selection of appropriate patients for non-operative management. Some studies have shown when the contrast does not reach the colon after a designated time it indicates complete intestinal obstruction that is unlikely to resolve with conservative treatment. When the contrast does reach the large bowel, it indicates partial obstruction and patients are likely to respond to conservative treatment. Other studies have suggested that the administration of water-soluble contrast is therapeutic in resolving the obstruction.

Objectives

To determine the reliability of water-soluble contrast media and serial abdominal radiographs in predicting the success of conservative treatment in patients admitted with adhesive small bowel obstruction. Furthermore, to determine the efficacy and safety of water-soluble contrast media in reducing the need for surgical intervention and reducing hospital stay in adhesive small bowel obstruction.

Search Strategy

The search was conducted using MESH terms: "Intestinal obstruction", "water-soluble contrast", "Adhesions" and "Gastrografin". The later combined with the Cochrane Collaboration highly sensitive search strategy for identifying randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

1. Prospective studies were included to evaluate the diagnostic potential of water-soluble contrast in adhesive small bowel obstruction.2. Randomised clinical trials were selected to evaluate the therapeutic role.

Data Collection and Analysis

1. Studies that addressed the diagnostic role of water-soluble contrast were critically appraised and data presented as sensitivities, specificities and positive and negative likelihood ratios. Results were pooled and summary ROC curve was constructed.2. A meta-analysis of the data from therapeutic studies was performed using the Mantel -Henszel test using both the fixed effect and random effect models.

Main Results

The appearance of water-soluble contrast in the colon on an abdominal X ray within 24 hours of its administration predicts resolution of an adhesive small bowel obstruction with a pooled sensitivity of 0.97, specificity of 0.96. The area under the curve of the summary ROC curve is 0.98. Six randomised studies dealing with the therapeutic role of gastrografin were included in the review, water-soluble contrast did not reduce the need for surgical intervention (OR 0.81, p = 0.3). Meta-analysis of four of the included studies showed that water-soluble contrast did reduce hospital stay compared with placebo (WMD = - 1.83) P < 0.001.

Authors' Conclusions

Published literature strongly supports the use of water-soluble contrast as a predictive test for non-operative resolution of adhesive small bowel obstruction. Although Gastrografin does not cause resolution of small bowel obstruction there is strong evidence that it reduces hospital stay in those not requiring surgery.

### Imaging of acute small-bowel obstruction [^114YwPcc]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this pictorial essay is to review the different imaging techniques used for diagnosing small-bowel obstruction.

Conclusion

Small-bowel obstruction is a common presentation, for which safe and effective management depends on a rapid and accurate diagnosis. Conventional radiographs remain the first line of imaging. CT is used increasingly more because it provides essential diagnostic information not apparent from radiographs. MRI may play a role in the future as technology improves and it becomes more readily available.

Water-soluble contrast administration X-ray

A water-soluble contrast enema has 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity in diagnosing large bowel obstruction but cannot distinguish different large bowel obstruction causes.

A small bowel follow-through with water-soluble contrast is widely used in patients for adhesive small bowel obstruction non-operative management. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have established the utility of water-soluble contrast agents in the diagnostic work-up of adhesive small bowel obstruction. If the contrast has not reached the colon on an abdominal X-ray 24 h after administration, then this is highly indicative of non-operative management failure. Multiple studies have shown that the use of water-soluble contrast agents accurately predicts the need for surgery with an active therapeutic role.

The administration of water-soluble contrast agents in adhesive small bowel obstruction is safe in terms of morbidity and mortality, but adverse effects due to their use have been reported. Potential life-threatening complications are aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. To avoid these complications, the contrast medium should be administered when the stomach has been adequately decompressed through a nasogastric tube. Another potential adverse effect is that water-soluble contrast agents, because of higher osmolarity, may further dehydrate a patient with small bowel obstruction, shifting fluids into bowel lumen; in some children and elderly adults, the loss of plasma fluid may be sufficient to cause a shock-like state.

The contrast medium may be administered on the dosage of 50–150 ml, either orally or via nasogastric tube, and can be given both at immediate admission and after an attempt of initial traditional conservative treatment of 48 h. The practice of giving water-soluble contrast at 48 h may reduce both the risk of aspiration pneumonia and of dehydration because the patient should have been adequately rehydrated. In this situation, the contrast material can be diluted with water.

Rare anaphylactoid reactions following the use of oral contrast media have been reported.

Caution in their administration may be warranted in patients at high risk of gastropathy.

Ultrasound

Small bowel obstruction can be diagnosed with ultrasound if there are > 2.5-cm dilated loops of the bowel that are proximal to collapsed loops of bowel and if there is decreased or absent peristalsis activity. Using ultrasound for small bowel obstruction diagnosis has 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity.

Visualization of large bowel obstruction with ultrasound is as good as computed tomography. Computed tomography is clearly superior to ultrasound in terms of the etiologic definition for both small bowel obstruction and large bowel obstruction. Ultrasound performs better than planar abdominal X-ray in large bowel obstruction.

### Multidetector-row helical CT enteroclysis [^1119Pk97]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Currently, CT-E is not recommended as the first-line examination in patients when mucosal detail is required. Double-contrast barium air enteroclysis has advantages in demonstrating small mucosal abnormalities. The authors find CT-E of value in the work-up of patients with symptoms of intermittent small bowel obstruction, particularly those with a history of prior abdominal surgery; in the further work-up of selected patients with high-grade obstruction in whom general surgeons prefer initial conservative management (immediate postoperative small bowel obstruction, patients with history of prior abdominal surgery for malignant tumor, history of radiation treatment, and possible internal extraintestinal fistulae); in looking for complications of small bowel Crohn's disease; and in the patient with unexplained anemia or gastrointestinal bleeding. In a series of patients who had both abdominal CT and barium enteroclysis done, each examination provided unique and complimentary diagnostic information. Because CT-E combines the advantages of both methods of examination, is it the optimum imaging work-up in the investigation of small bowel disease? Further research and clinical experience will define the precise role of CT-E in the investigation of small bowel disease. Experience with this method of examination is limited to a few institutions, performed by investigators with interest in small bowel diseases. The addition of cross-sectional display and multiplanar reformatting made possible by multidetector-row helical CT to enteral volume change and the use of multifunctional nasointestinal catheters make CT-E an important tool in the investigation of small bowel disease. Experience has shown the increased reliability of any method of examining the small bowel that challenges intestinal wall distensibility by fluid enteral volume infusion.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^116bJgr2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Conservative Small Bowel Obstruction management in the Absence of standard ConTrast agents ON outcomes (SBO ACTION) was a national, multicentre, prospective cohort study conducted in the UK from 1 April to 1 July 2024. This study is reported in accordance with the STROBE statement.

As SBO ACTION was a combined audit and service evaluation, ethical approval was not required. Each participating site secured local audit and Caldicott Guardian permissions to participate and were not permitted to collect data without confirmation of approvals.

Study setting

Eligible sites included any National Health Service (NHS) hospital in the UK providing emergency surgical services. Each participating hospital had a local principal investigator, responsible for coordinating and organizing local teams, and up to three local collaborators. Roles are detailed under the heading 'SBO ACTION Collaborative', in line with the guidelines for authorship in collaborative research. To ensure consistency in data collection and management, all participating centres received standardized training via an online presentation delivered by the study steering committee. However, contrast administration protocols were not strictly standardized across sites, as this study aimed to capture real-world variation in practice.

Study population

Consecutive adult patients (aged ≥ 16 years) referred to emergency surgical services with a working diagnosis of SBO were screened for inclusion. Patients were included if they had a positive CT confirming aSBO with the intention to manage conservatively for at least 24 h, as determined by a specialist surgeon (ST3+).

Cases with prior abdominal surgery in the same admission, non-adhesional SBO, pregnant women, those < 16 years old, and those with a hospital length of stay < 24 h were excluded.

### Small bowel diverticular disease: are we clinically aware? [^116TrEnR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

The inpatient hospital database of two tertiary referral centers, from January 2006 through December 2022 was retrospectively screened to identify all patients with small bowel diverticular disease. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Patients diagnosed with small bowel diverticula (SBD), located in the duodenum, ileum or jejunum, (2) Patients with available clinical data, including clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, and subsequent treatment. Patients with incomplete clinical or radiological data were excluded from the study analysis. Eligible patients were categorized into three subgroups based on the anatomical location of the diverticula (duodenal, jejunal, or ileal) to enable comparative analyses of clinical features and management strategies. Relevant clinical and radiological data were obtained for study analysis. Clinical data included clinical presentation of the patient upon admission, which can be classified into the following symptom groups: asymptomatic or incidental finding, pain or discomfort, bleeding, fever, obstruction, and acute abdomen. The patient history and hospital logs were meticulously screened to ensure that the chief complaint reported by the patient was associated with small bowel diverticular (SBD) disease. Patients were classified as asymptomatic if they had no clinical manifestations directly attributable to SBD (e.g. abdominal pain, bleeding, obstruction, or perforation) and no complications observed on imaging or endoscopic evaluation. Symptom relevance was determined through a multidisciplinary review involving gastroenterologists and radiologists, who assessed the temporal and anatomical correlation between reported symptoms and SBD findings. The location and number of diverticula were also recorded. Diagnostic methods used to identify the SBD, included radiological, endoscopic, or intraoperative diagnosis. Radiological diagnosis can be further divided into barium follow-through (BaFT) with X-ray or abdominal computer tomography (CT). While, endoscopic diagnosis was achieved by gastroscopy or duodenoscopy, double balloon enteroscopy (DBE), video capsule endoscopy (VCE) or in combination. All imaging and endoscopic findings were independently reviewed by two radiologists and two gastroenterologists to ensure diagnostic consistency. If more than one diagnostic approach was used, the specific modalities were documented. Treatment received were subsequently collected and can be divided into conservative therapy or surgical intervention. Conservative therapy included dietary modifications (low-residue diet), antibiotics for bacterial overgrowth, and analgesics for pain management. Any treatment associated complication were also detailed.

### Capsule endoscopy retention: is it a complication? [^116MYqE5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Capsule endoscopy has been found superior to barium x-rays and push enteroscopy in the investigation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and in the evaluation of suspected Crohn's disease. Currently, small bowel obstruction and strictures are considered by many physicians to be a contraindication to capsule endoscopy for fear of capsule retention or impaction. The goal of this study was to reassess this conventional wisdom that capsule endoscopy is contraindicated in small bowel obstruction and to determine the safety and efficacy of capsule endoscopy in the evaluation of patients with suspected stricture or small bowel obstruction.

Study

A retrospective chart review was performed using a database of 568 capsule endoscopy cases performed between August 2001 and November 2003. Cases of suspected small bowel obstruction were selected and reviewed.

Results

Nineteen cases were identified in which capsule endoscopy was used in the setting of suspected small bowel obstruction. The diagnosis of suspected small bowel obstruction was based on symptoms alone in 8 cases and on symptoms plus abnormal radiographs in the remaining 11 cases. Capsule endoscopy made a definitive diagnosis in 5 of the 19 cases (26%): 2 Crohn's strictures, 1 radiation induced stricture, 1 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced stricture, and 1 MALT lymphoma. The capsule was retained proximal to a stricture in 4 cases, in which the obstructing lesions were electively resected without complications. There was no case in which administration of the capsule led to an acute small bowel obstruction.

Conclusions

Capsule endoscopy can be safely used to help identify the etiology and site of a small bowel obstruction. Retention of the capsule may indicate the presence of a lesion requiring surgery, but small bowel obstruction or strictures are not in themselves contraindications to the procedure. It is understood, however, that retention may lead to surgery in a patient who otherwise may have been treated medically without surgery for the same illness (eg, Crohn's disease and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathy).

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: systematic review [^116jkG6X]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Our institution does not require ethical permission for secondary research using primary literature. The research is reported according to the Preferred Reporting terms for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA).

Target condition, search strategy, and study selection

We wrote a protocol and then developed and piloted a search string to identify imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables (including existing models) potentially predictive of SBO resolution without operative management (Online supplementary material 1). We used terms to identify studies of bowel obstruction/ileus. We included terms to identify prognostic research. We limited to adults and excluded narrative reviews, editorials, letters, etc. We searched the US National Library of Medicine PUBMED journal citation database from 2001 to 2021 inclusive. This search was supplemented by a subsequent review of references cited by included studies. The search was performed in September 2021 by two radiologists (VE, DB), one of whom had > 10 years of experience in systematic review design, data extraction, and analysis.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

We included studies investigating imaging variables potentially predictive of SBO resolution without the need for operative management (or, depending on how the research was framed, factors that predicted surgical intervention). We excluded studies limited to colonic obstruction; solely paediatric studies; studies solely of malignant obstruction; studies limited to early post-operative obstruction (a separate entity with different aetiology); studies limited to inflammatory bowel disease or chronic functional obstruction. We did not specifically set out to exclude studies that did not include intravenous contrast for CT scanning because we anticipated that the large majority would administer contrast, and contrast only influences one potential predictor variable, mucosal enhancement. We also anticipated that any representative consecutive series would include some patients in whom IV contrast is contraindicated but from whom other potential predictors could be extracted. We excluded studies reporting less than five patients in either operative or conservative groups, since these are underpowered.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^112ove2g]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis using radiographic techniques — recommendations state: "Barium studies should not be performed in the evaluation of small bowel bleeding (strong recommendation, high level of evidence)". For negative capsule endoscopy, "CTE should be performed in patients with suspected small bowel bleeding and negative capsule endoscopy because of higher sensitivity for the detection of mural-based small bowel masses, superior capability to locate small bowel masses, and ability to guide subsequent deep enteroscopy. (strong recommendation, low level of evidence)". Additionally, "CT is preferred over MR imaging for the evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding. MR can be considered in patients with contraindications for CT or to avoid radiation exposure in younger patients (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence)". "CTE could be considered before VCE in the setting of established inflammatory bowel disease, prior radiation therapy, previous small bowel surgery, and/or suspected small bowel stenosis (strong recommendation, very low level of evidence)". Finally, "In patients with suspected small bowel bleeding and negative VCE examination, CTE should be performed if there is high clinical suspicion for a small bowel source despite the performance of a prior standard CT of the abdomen (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence)".

### Barium sulfate for suspension (vanilla silQ HD) [^113siprw]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

This product should not be used in patients with known or suspected gastric or intestinal perforation, patients with conditions that may increase the risk of perforation; hypersensitivity to barium sulfate products; suspected tracheoesophageal fistula; obstructing lesions of the small intestine; pyloric stenosis; inflammation or neoplastic lesions of the rectum; or in patients who have had a recent rectal biopsy.

Barium sulfate suspensions should not be used for infants with swallowing disorders or for newborns with complete duodenal or jejunal obstruction or when distal small bowel or colon obstruction is suspected. Barium sulfate suspension is not recommended for very small preterm infants and young babies requiring small volumes of contrast media or for infants and young children when there is a possibility of leakage from the gastrointestinal tract, such as nectrotizing enterocolitis, unexplained pneumoperitoneum, gasless abdomen, other bowel perforation, esophageal perforation or post operative anastomosis.

### Characterization of megapouch in patients with restorative proctocolectomy [^115ETdCW]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Megapouch is a rare functional complication of restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis characterized by pouch ± small bowel dilatation with no evidence of obstruction on endoscopy and imaging. Little is known about clinical characteristics and outcomes of this entity.

Methods

We included all patients diagnosed with megapouch at our institution, identified from a pouch database. Data on baseline characteristics, management, and outcomes were documented and analyzed from electronic medical records. Appropriate statistical measures were used. p < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

Twenty-three patients with megapouch were identified. The mean age was 40.7 years; 95.6% had underlying ulcerative colitis; most common indication for colectomy was medically refractory disease (56.5%). Abdominal pain (82.6%) and bloating (52.2%) were most common presenting symptoms. Most common finding on pouchoscopy was pouch dilatation (81.8%), while barium or gastrografin enemas and MRI/CT mostly revealed dilatation of pouch and/or small bowel. Fourteen (66.7%) patients required some forms of surgery-six patients required pouch excision and three required either pouch redo or revision. Rates of pouch failure and IBD-related 1-year hospitalization were higher among patients managed surgically versus those managed medically (p = 0.007 and 0.024, respectively), while need for escalation of IBD-therapy was comparable between the groups (p = 0.133). No deaths were reported and no patient had recurrence of megapouch. IPAA revision or redo did not lead to more IBD-related morbidity.

Conclusions

Majority of our patients with megapouch required surgery. In selected patients, redo pouch offered cure. Rates of pouch failure and IBD-related 1-year hospitalization were higher among patients managed surgically.

### Oral water soluble contrast for malignant bowel obstruction [^115uDsnq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a common problem in patients with intra-abdominal cancer. Oral water soluble contrast (OWSC) has been shown to be useful in the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction in identifying patients who will recover with conservative management alone and also in reducing the length of hospital stay. It is not clear whether the benefits of OWSC in adhesive small bowel obstruction are also seen in patients with MBO.

Objectives

To determine the reliability of OWSC media and follow-up abdominal radiographs in predicting the success of conservative treatment in resolving inoperable MBO with conservative management. To determine the efficacy and safety of OWSC media in reducing the duration of obstruction and reducing hospital stay in people with MBO.

Search Methods

We identified studies from searching Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in Process, Embase, CINAHL, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (Web of Science). We also searched registries of clinical trials and the CareSearch Grey Literature database. The date of the search was the 6 June 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or prospective controlled studies, that evaluated the diagnostic potential of OWSC in predicting which malignant bowel obstructions will resolve with conservative treatment.RCTs, or prospective controlled studies, that assessed the therapeutic potential of OWSC in managing MBO at any level compared with placebo, no intervention or usual treatment or supportive care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias and assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We found only one RCT meeting the selection criteria for the second objective (therapeutic potential) of this review. This study recruited nine participants. It compared the use of gastrografin versus placebo in adult patients with MBO with no indication for further intervention (surgery, endoscopy) apart from standardised conservative management. The overall risk of bias for the study was high due to issues with low numbers of participants, selective reporting of outcomes and a high attrition rate for the intervention arm. Primary outcomesThe included trial was a pilot study whose primary outcome was to test the feasibility for a large study. The authors reported specifically on the number of patients screened, the number recruited and reasons for exclusion; this was not the focus of our review. Due to the low number of participants, the authors of the study decided not to report on our primary outcome of assessing the ability of OWSC to predict the likelihood of malignant small bowel obstruction resolving with conservative treatment alone (diagnostic effect). It also did not report on our primary outcome of rate of resolution of MBO in patients receiving OWSC compared with those not receiving it (therapeutic effect). The study reported that no issues regarding safety or tolerability of either gastrografin or placebo were identified. The overall quality of the evidence for the incidence of adverse events with OWSC was very low, downgraded twice for serious limitations to study quality (high risk of selective reporting and attrition bias) and downgraded once for imprecision (sparse data). Secondary outcomesThe study planned to report on this review's secondary outcome measures of length of hospital stay and time from administration of OWSC to resolution of MBO. However the authors of the study decided not to do so due to the low numbers of patients recruited. The study did not report on our secondary outcome measure of survival times from onset of inoperable MBO until death.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to determine the place of OWSC in predicting which patients with inoperable MBO will respond with conservative treatment alone. There is also insufficient evidence from RCTs to determine the therapeutic effects and safety of OWSC in patients with malignant small bowel obstruction.

### Frequency and relevance of the "small-bowel feces" sign on CT in patients with small-bowel obstruction [^111gNzt8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine the incidence of the "small-bowel feces" sign (SBFS) in patients with small-bowel obstruction (SBO) and whether it can be used to accurately locate the point of obstruction.

Subjects and Methods

From November 2002 until March 2003, 34 consecutive adult patients with CT findings of small-bowel obstruction were prospectively evaluated. The CT findings used to diagnose small-bowel obstruction were a dilated proximal small bowel and a collapsed distal small bowel and colon. CT scans were evaluated to determine the degree of obstruction (mild, moderate, or high-grade), the presence or absence of the SBFS (defined as particulate-type material in the dilated small bowel), the location of the SBFS in relation to the transition zone, and the cause of the obstruction. Mild obstruction was defined as a slight discrepancy between the caliber of the proximal and that of the distal small bowel; moderate SBO was defined as a discrepancy of 50% or more between the calibers of the proximal and the distal small bowel; and high-grade SBO was considered to be present if the distal small bowel and the colon had collapsed. The cause of the obstruction was determined from surgical findings or a combination of CT findings, follow-up barium studies, and clinical assessment.

Results

The SBFS was present in 19 (55.9%) of 34 patients with SBO. The degree of SBO was mild in six, moderate in 11, and high-grade in 17 of the patients. The SBFS was present in one of the six patients (16.6%) with mild, eight (72.7%) of the 11 with moderate, and 10 (58.8%) of the 17 with high-grade SBO. In all patients in whom the SBFS was present, the particulate material could be traced to the point of transition and was most conspicuous in the transition zone. The length of fecallike material ranged from 2 to 25 cm and was longer in moderate and high-grade SBO than in mild SBO. The cause of the SBO was an adhesion in 20 patients, a hernia in four patients, Crohn's disease in four patients, a tumor in three patients, and other miscellaneous causes in three patients.

Conclusion

When present on CT, the SBFS can be used to help locate the transition zone in patients with SBO. The sign is present more frequently in patients with moderate and high degrees of SBO.

### Meta-analysis of oral water-soluble contrast agent in the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction [^115D5w7m]. The British Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesions are the leading cause of small bowel obstruction. Identification of patients who require surgery is difficult. This review analyses the role of Gastrografin as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent in the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction.

Methods

A systematic search of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases was performed to identify studies of the use of Gastrografin in adhesive small bowel obstruction. Studies that addressed the diagnostic role of water-soluble contrast agent were appraised, and data presented as sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios. Results were pooled and a summary receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed. A meta-analysis of the data from six therapeutic studies was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel test and both fixed- and random-effect models.

Results

The appearance of water-soluble contrast agent in the colon on an abdominal radiograph within 24 h of its administration predicted resolution of obstruction with a pooled sensitivity of 97 per cent and specificity of 96 per cent. The area under the summary ROC curve was 0.98. Water-soluble contrast agent did not reduce the need for surgical intervention (odds ratio 0.81, P = 0.300), but it did reduce the length of hospital stay for patients who did not require surgery compared with placebo (weighted mean difference — 1.84 days; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Published data strongly support the use of water-soluble contrast medium as a predictive test for non-operative resolution of adhesive small bowel obstruction. Although Gastrografin does not reduce the need for operation, it appears to shorten the hospital stay for those who do not require surgery.

### Rectal perforations after barium enema: a review [^112G8XsY]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Rectal injuries during barium enema are rare but life-threatening complications. The last review about this subject was published more than ten years ago. In the present review, we present an overview on the subject and especially focus on changes in treatment strategies and developments of less risky visualization techniques.

Methods

A literature search was performed in the PubMed library using the key words-barium enema, complications, peritonitis, and rectal perforation-as well as related articles and other references obtained from these articles.

Results

The most frequent cause of perforation is iatrogenic and catheter-related. Other causes are related to weakness of the colorectal wall or obstruction. Five types of perforations have been described: 1) perforations of the anal canal below the levator; 2) incomplete perforations; 3) perforations into the retroperitoneum; 4) transmural perforations into adjacent viscera; 5) perforations into the free intraperitoneal cavity. Most incomplete perforations and one-half of the retroperitoneal perforations have minimal clinical signs. Intraperitoneal perforations lead to the most catastrophic course, starting with rectal bleeding and mild abdominal complaints. This is rapidly followed by progressive sepsis and peritonitis, and leads to a high mortality rate. Surgery is not always required for intramural or small retroperitoneal perforations. These can be treated conservatively and require surgical debridement only in case of large amounts of extravasation or abscesses. Surgical repair of large rectal mucosal lesions or anal sphincter lesions is advised. Perirectal abscesses require drainage. Intraperitoneal perforations with gross extravasation need immediate aggressive surgical treatment in a critical care setting, because the threat of shock is high. Intraperitoneal perforations, neglected perforations, gross barium extravasation, poorly prepared colon, and venous intravasation of barium are prognostically unfavorable. The severest late complication in intraperitoneal perforations is ileus. Meticulous technical performance of the barium enema is the most important factor in prevention.

Conclusions

Rectal perforations after barium enema are rare. The overall mortality rate decreased in recent decades from approximately 50 to 35 percent as the result of advances in supportive and intensive care. Because of these advances, more aggressive surgical strategies were undertaken. With the advent of endoscopy, less barium enemas are performed. Consequently, the absolute incidence of complications has decreased. It is expected that in the future barium enemas will be replaced by more sensitive and less risky techniques, such as CT colonography and magnetic resonance colonography.

### Imaging of small bowel disease: comparison of capsule endoscopy, standard endoscopy, barium examination, and CT [^1167u4wN]. Radiographics (2005). Low credibility.

Capsule endoscopy is a revolutionary new diagnostic tool for the detection of small bowel disease. As the name implies, capsule endoscopy makes use of a swallowable video capsule; as such, it is the only technique that allows noninvasive endoscopic examination of the entire small bowel without sedation. Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common indication for capsule endoscopy, which commonly depicts arteriovenous malformations, small bowel tumors, and ulcers missed at standard endoscopy and imaging examinations. However, capsule endoscopy is not optimal for the localization of small bowel lesions. In addition, lesions can be missed due to poor bowel preparation, rapid or delayed small bowel transit, or orientation of the camera away from a lesion. Computed tomography and barium examinations are useful for detecting these missed lesions and for localizing lesions detected at capsule endoscopy. Other limitations of capsule endoscopy are the inability to treat lesions and its limited use in patients with small bowel strictures or obstruction. Nevertheless, this new technique is easy to perform, is well tolerated by patients, and, for the first time, allows noninvasive endoscopic evaluation of the entire small bowel.

### Small bowel obstruction [^114kRHNP]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Identifying patients with small bowel obstruction who need operative intervention and those who will fail nonoperative management is a challenge. Without indications for urgent intervention, a computed tomography scan with/without intravenous contrast should be obtained to identify location, grade, and etiology of the obstruction. Most small bowel obstructions resolve with nonoperative management. Open and laparoscopic operative management are acceptable approaches. Malnutrition needs to be identified early and managed, especially if the patient is to undergo operative management. Confounding conditions include age greater than 65, post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, virgin abdomen, pregnancy, hernia, and early postoperative state.

### Barium sulfate (ENTERO Vu 24%) [^111fzA4U]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity
Reactions

Barium sulfate preparations contain a number of excipients, including
natural and artificial flavors and may induce serious hypersensitivity
reactions. The manifestations include hypotension, bronchospasm and
other respiratory impairments, and dermal reactions including rashes,
urticaria and itching. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, food
allergies, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent may increase
the risk for hypersensitivity reactions. Emergency equipment and
trained personnel should be immediately available for treatment of
a hypersensitivity reaction.

5.2 Intra-abdominal
Barium Leakage

The use of ENTERO VU 24% is contraindicated in patients at high risk
of perforation of the GI tract [see Contraindications (4)]. Administration of ENTERO VU
24% may result in leakage of barium from the GI tract in the presence
of conditions that increase the risk of perforation such as known
carcinomas, GI fistula, inflammatory bowel disease, gastric or duodenal
ulcer, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and in patients with a severe
stenosis at any level of the GI tract, especially if it is distal
to the stomach. Barium leakage has been associated with peritonitis
and granuloma formation.

5.3 Delayed Gastrointestinal
Transit and Obstruction

Orally administered barium sulfate may accumulate
proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon, causing obstruction
or impaction with development of baroliths (inspissated barium associated
with feces) and may cause abdominal pain, appendicitis, bowel obstruction,
or perforation. Patients with the following conditions are at higher
risk for developing obstruction or baroliths: severe stenosis at
any level of the GI tract, impaired GI motility, electrolyte imbalance,
dehydration, on a low residue diet, on medications that delay GI motility,
constipation, and the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations
(8.5)]. To reduce the risk
of delayed GI transit and obstruction, patients should maintain adequate
hydration after the barium sulfate procedure.

5.4 Aspiration Pneumonitis

The use of ENTERO VU 24% is
contraindicated in patients with trachea-esophageal fistula [see Contraindications (4)]. Oral administration of barium is associated with aspiration pneumonitis,
especially in patients with a history of food aspiration or with compromised
swallowing mechanism. Vomiting following oral administration of barium
sulfate may lead to aspiration pneumonitis. In patients at risk for
aspiration, begin the procedure with a small ingested volume of ENTERO
VU 24%. Monitor the patient closely for aspiration, discontinue administration
of ENTERO VU 24% if aspiration is suspected, and monitor for development
of aspiration pneumonitis.

### Therapeutic value of gastrografin in adhesive small bowel obstruction after unsuccessful conservative treatment: a prospective randomized trial [^117AZ1La]. Annals of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the therapeutic value of Gastrografin in the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction after unsuccessful conservative treatment.

Summary Background Data

Gastrografin is a hyperosmolar water-soluble contrast medium. Besides its predictive value for the need for surgery, there is probably a therapeutic role of this contrast medium in adhesive small bowel obstruction.

Methods

Patients with clinical evidence of adhesive small bowel obstruction were given trial conservative treatment unless there was suspicion of strangulation. Those who responded in the initial 48 hours had conservative treatment continued. Patients showing no clinical and radiologic improvement in the initial 48 hours were randomized to undergo either Gastrografin meal and follow-through study or surgery. Contrast that appeared in the large bowel within 24 hours was regarded as a partial obstruction, and conservative treatment was continued. Patients in whom contrast failed to reach the large bowel within 24 hours were considered to have complete obstruction, and laparotomy was performed. For patients who had conservative treatment for more than 48 hours with or without Gastrografin, surgery was performed when there was no continuing improvement.

Results

One hundred twenty-four patients with a total of 139 episodes of adhesive obstruction were included. Three patients underwent surgery soon after admission for suspected bowel strangulation. Strangulating obstruction was confirmed in two patients. One hundred one obstructive episodes showed improvement in the initial 48 hours and conservative treatment was continued. Only one patient required surgical treatment subsequently after conservative treatment for 6 days. Thirty-five patients showed no improvement within 48 hours. Nineteen patients were randomized to undergo Gastrografin meal and follow-through study and 16 patients to surgery. Gastrografin study revealed partial obstruction in 14 patients. Obstruction resolved subsequently in all of them after a mean of 41 hours. The other five patients underwent laparotomy because the contrast study showed complete obstruction. The use of Gastrografin significantly reduced the need for surgery by 74%. There was no complication that could be attributed to the use of Gastrografin. No strangulation of bowel occurred in either group.

Conclusions

The use of Gastrografin in adhesive small bowel obstruction is safe and reduces the need for surgery when conservative treatment fails.

Transmural migration of a retained surgical sponge causing small bowel obstruction is a rare occurrence. We report a case which demonstrates both the associated foreign body reaction seen on computed tomography months in advance of the onset of symptoms and confirms the subsequent fistulous decompression into the duodenum on both computed tomography and barium meal studies. To the best of the author's knowledge, a retained surgical swab causing small bowel obstruction has not been previously described with imaging both pre and post transluminal decompression.

electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, on a low residue diet, taking
medications that delay GI motility, constipation, pediatric patients
with cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease, and the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. To reduce the
risk of delayed GI transit and obstruction, patients should maintain
adequate hydration during and in the days following a barium sulfate
procedure. Consider the administration of laxatives.

5.4 Aspiration Pneumonitis

The use of E-Z-HD is contraindicated
in patients at high risk of aspiration [see Contraindications
(4)]. Oral administration
of barium is associated with aspiration pneumonitis, especially in
patients with a history of food aspiration or with compromised swallowing
mechanism. Vomiting following oral administration of barium sulfate
may lead to aspiration pneumonitis. In patients at risk for aspiration,

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^113RA4MJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

A key risk of NOM is the potential for bowel ischaemia. In the present cohort, 25.3% of patients who underwent surgery after an initial trial of NOM had intraoperative evidence of ischaemia, reinforcing the importance of careful patient selection and close monitoring. Emergent surgery is necessary for patients with clinical or radiological signs suggestive of bowel ischemia. Although delaying surgery may allow resolution in select cases, prolonged NOM in the presence of ongoing obstruction increases the risk of irreversible bowel injury. Notably, the rate of ischaemia did not significantly differ between those who received WSCA and those who did not, suggesting that contrast administration itself does not exacerbate this risk. However, the longer time to surgery observed in the WSCA group highlights the need for a clear threshold for when NOM should be considered unsuccessful.

The study is not without limitations. Its observational design means the findings are of association only, and not causation. Patients selected for WSCA challenges did not have lower CCI, and experienced higher rates of surgery and longer times to operation. This means surgeons are potentially deferring surgery in cases where it is ultimately anticipated, introducing selection bias. Time to GI-2 was recorded in days rather than hours. Although this provides a practical estimate, this may limit precision in assessing subtle differences in recovery time. The 30-day follow-up period is relatively short, and the absence of patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) limits insight into the impact of treatment strategies from the patient's perspective. Additionally, data on operative details and ischaemia were poorly reported, as was the documentation of CFS data. The impact of aSBO and its management on quality of life, symptom burden, and post-discharge recovery remains underexplored in the current literature. The PRO-diGI PROM for gastrointestinal recovery has been developed for use in this population, and might be utilized in future studies.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^112P1uUM]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study provides prospective multicentre 'real-life' data on the NOM of patients presenting with aSBO. The overall success of NOM was 81.6%. The use of WSCA was widespread despite a reported shortage, with 62.3% of patients receiving a contrast challenge. However, repeated contrast challenges showed diminishing resolution rates, suggesting limited therapeutic benefit beyond initial administration.

A comparison of this cohort to previous UK reports provides an interesting contrast. The NASBO (National Audit of Small Bowel Obstruction) report showed that 31.0% of patients with aSBO received WSCAcompared to 62.3% in the present study, reflecting a broader adoption of WSCA in aSBO management. This finding underscores the pragmatic and adaptable nature of clinical practice, where hospitals and clinicians likely implemented local strategies to maintain access to contrast agents despite reported supply chain challenges. Although it is difficult to determine the precise impact of the perceived shortage on decision-making, this study highlights how real-world data collection can provide unexpected insights into resource utilization and the resilience of clinical workflows during periods of uncertainty. However, one finding that has remained constant is the high rate of plain abdominal radiography prior to CT, contrary to recommendations from the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death and the American College of Radiology, which advocate for early CT as the preferred diagnostic modality.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^117PDD4A]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A further update of this series including 127 patients not only confirmed the same findings in terms of reduction of resolution of the obstruction and of the hospital stay [mean time to first stool 6.2 hours vs 23.5 (p < .0001) and mean hospital stay for unoperated patients 2.7 vs 5.5 days, (p < .0001)], but also showed as well that significantly fewer episodes in the trial group required operation, 10.4% vs 26.7% (p < 0.013).

Further evidence has been showed that the use of hyperosmolar Water-soluble contrast medium (Gastrografin) in ASBO is safe and reduces the need for surgery when conservative treatment fails (after 48 hrs) and in patients showing partial SBO. In the prospective RCT from Choi et al. the patients showing no clinical and radiologic improvement in the initial 48 hours of conservative treatment for non complicated ASBO were randomized to undergo either Gastrografin meal and follow-through study or surgery. Nineteen patients were randomized to undergo Gastrografin meal and follow-through study and 16 patients to surgery.

Gastrografin study revealed partial obstruction in 14 patients. Obstruction resolved subsequently in all of them after a mean of 41 hours. The other five patients underwent laparotomy because the contrast study showed complete obstruction. The use of Gastrografin significantly reduced the need for surgery by 74%. Therefore the use of Gastrografin in ASBO is safe and reduces the need for surgery when conservative treatment fails.

These results have been validated in a further study where 44 episodes of ASBO showing no improvement after 48 hours of conservative management received Gastrografin and out of them 7 underwent becuase of finding of complete obstruction whereas Partial obstruction was demonstrated in 37 other cases, obstruction resolved subsequently in all of them except one patient who required laparotomy because of persistent obstruction.

Biondo et al. demonstrated that water-soluble contrast reduces the hospital stay but does not reduce the need for surgery. After randomizing 83 patients with 90 episodes of ASBO to either 100 mL of Gastrografin or control, conservative treatment was successful in 77 episodes (85.6 per cent), among patients treated conservatively hospital stay was shorter in the Gastrografin group (P < 0.001) and all patients in whom contrast medium reached the colon tolerated an early oral diet; however Gastrografin did not reduce the need for operation (P = 1.000).

Contrast challenge

Of the 408 patients who underwent an initial trial of NOM, 254 (62.3%) received a WSCA challenge and 154 (37.7%) did not. Gastrografin was the most common WSCA used (n = 229, 90.5%), at 100 mL dose (96.9%) (Supplementary Material S2). Other agents used were Omnipaque (n = 7, 2.8%) and Gastromiro (n = 17, 6.7%).

Patients receiving WSCA had lower CCIs compared to those who did not (3.0 versus 4.0, P = 0.041); however, this did not remain statistically significant after multiple testing correction (q = 0.3). There were no other differences in patient characteristics observed. The median time from admission to WSCA administration was 1.0 day (i.q.r. 0.0–1.3).

Of those who had a WSCA challenge, 58.1% had a follow-up AXR within 8 h (n = 147) (Supplementary Material S3). Following the first WSCA challenge, 163 cases (64.2%) of aSBO resolved, with contrast observed in the colon in 119 cases (83.8%). SBO persisted in 91 cases (35.8%), of which 39 (42.9%) progressed to surgery and 46 (50.5%) continued with NOM. There were radiographic findings of contrast in the colon in 24.2% (n = 8) of those progressing to operative management and in 20.5% (n = 8) of those with continued NOM (Fig. 2, Supplementary Material S4).

A second WSCA challenge was performed in 26 patients (26.8%), with resolution in 8 (30.8%) and ongoing aSBO in 18 (69.2%). Twelve patients (66.7%) progressed to surgery at this point and six (33.3%) continued with NOM. A third contrast challenge was performed in three patients (16.7%), with resolution in one and ongoing aSBO in the remaining two. All repeat WSCA challenges were performed with Gastrografin and showed significantly lower rates of resolution (P < 0.001).

### Barolith precipitation: an uncommon sequela following barium imaging [^113aUVwD]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We present the case of a young male in his mid-30s who developed baroliths, a rare complication, following a barium contrast study. The patient initially presented with abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation. Imaging revealed two large masses of retained contrast material within the sigmoid colon and rectum, consistent with baroliths. Despite initial conservative management, including enema and electrolyte correction, the patient required surgical intervention due to persistent symptoms. An exploratory laparotomy and rigid sigmoidoscopy were performed to remove the impacted stool, leading to symptom resolution. This case highlights the need for vigilance in keeping baroliths as a differential in patients presenting with signs of gastrointestinal obstruction with a history of recent barium studies and emphasises the importance of preventive measures, early recognition and tailored management to prevent severe complications.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^114CQ9eq]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

This increased use of WSCA versus NASBOis accompanied by notable variations in clinical practice. This includes differences in the use of AXR post-contrast, as highlighted here. Other variations, such as the management of nasogastric drainage and the spigotting of nasogastric tubes, have been highlighted in previous trials. The impact of these variations on the therapeutic or stratifying efficacy of WSCA remains unclear and may reflect concerns about perceived risks, such as aspiration pneumonia.

Additionally, there is inconsistency in the timing and utility of follow-up AXRs. If contrast fails to reach the colon within 24 h, this is highly indicative of NOM failure. However, the optimal timing for follow-up imaging remains debated. Delaying AXR to 12 h post-WSCA administration may offer limited additional sensitivity and specificity while potentially delaying necessary surgical intervention. An earlier AXR (6–8 h) might be advisable to balance this, by minimizing delays without compromising diagnostic value. Among patients who had resolved aSBO following a WSCA challenge, 83.8% demonstrated radiographic evidence of contrast in the colon. However, radiographic evidence of contrast in the colon was also observed in one-fifth of those with ongoing aSBO, highlighting a mismatch between radiographic and clinical findings. This raises concern about the reliability of AXR as a tool to guide decision-making. The sensitivity and specificity of contrast in the colon in the prediction of resolution of aSBO is much lower than that reported in the 2007 Cochrane review. Given these inconsistencies and potential delays, there is a strong case for moving away from routine follow-up AXRs in favour of clinical decision-making guided by patient symptoms and clinical progression.

Success of non-operative management and operative intervention

Of the 408 patients initially managed with NOM for aSBO, 81.6% (n = 333/408) successfully resolved with NOM, and 18.4% (n = 75/408) ultimately required surgery. The success rate of NOM was higher in those managed without a WSCA challenge compared to those who received one (83.8% versus 73.2%, P = 0.014). Additionally, the operative rates were higher in NOM patients who received a WSCA challenge compared to those who did not (22.4% versus 11.7%, P = 0.007; Table 2). Of the 220 patients undergoing active NOM with contrast challenge, contrast in the colon predicted resolution with a sensitivity of 66.5% (95% c.i. 59.0 to 73.3%), and a specificity of 56.1% (95% c.i. 39.7% to 71.5%).

Table 2
Comparison of clinical outcomes of non-operative management in patients with and without a contrast challenge

The most common operative approach was open (n = 44/75, 58.7%) and level of obstruction was at the ileum (n = 40/75, 53.3%). Patients who received a contrast challenge had a median longer time to operation (3.0 days, i.q.r. 2.0–5.0 versus 1.0 day, i.q.r. 1.0–1.0, P < 0.001). Overall reported rates of intraoperative bowel ischaemia were 19/75 (25.3%); however, there was no significant difference in rates of ischaemia or small bowel resection between the contrast and non-contrast groups (Supplementary Material S5).

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^115TRrFT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Usage of radiographic examinations for small bowel bleeding indicates that barium studies should not be performed in the evaluation of small bowel bleeding. CTE is preferred over magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for the evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding, and MR can be considered in patients with contraindications for CT or to avoid radiation exposure in younger patients. CTE could be considered before VCE in the setting of established inflammatory bowel disease, prior radiation therapy, previously small bowel surgery, and/or suspected small bowel stenosis. In patients with suspected small bowel bleeding and negative VCE examination, CTE should be performed if there is high clinical suspicion for a small bowel neoplasm despite performance of a prior standard CT of the abdomen.

### Small bowel obstruction outcomes according to compliance with the World Society of Emergency Surgery bologna guidelines [^1139H5gR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Adhesive SBO has a high recurrence rate and remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality that increases healthcare cost. Clinical guidelines are generally derived using two principal approaches: using evidence synthesized from prospective RCTs or using expert consensus groups that integrate physiology, existing data, and experience to craft recommendations. The WSES Bologna guidelines for adhesive SBO exemplify the latter, providing a pragmatic diagnostic and management framework. Bologna guideline adherence offers the potential to improve morbidity and mortality metrics, reduce healthcare resource utilization, and decrease recurrence of obstruction by promoting consistent and timely interventions. However, such opportunities rely on guideline adoption and utilization.

Other guidelines address patient-specific factors, rather than management approaches. Elderly patients with multi-morbidity, with or without frailty, benefit from individualized risk stratification and goals-of-care determinations that may direct early intervention, NOM, or comfort care. Of note, geriatric patient outcomes are not often comprehensively assessed, leaving occurrence rates uncertain. Despite care advances, gaps remain in ensuring goal-concordant care for elderly patients across the panoply of interventions for adhesive SBO. Evidence-informed — as opposed to evidence-based — recommendations, in concert with knowledge and process gaps, underscore the complexity of managing patients with adhesive SBO; surgeons must balance recommendations against individualized and patient-centred care.

### Acute small bowel obstruction secondary to intestinal endometriosis, an elusive condition: a case report [^1139oTdt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Acute bowel obstruction is a rare event occurring in less than one per cent of intestinal endometriosis and usually affects the rectosigmoid colon. The case presented is rarely seen as small bowel obstruction only accounts for only 0.7% of all surgical interventions for endometriosis. As our case serves to highlight, in an acute presentation the patient's history is unlikely to aid the diagnosis and thus it is unlikely for patients to be diagnosed pre-operatively. It is a challenging condition to diagnose as small bowel endometriosis can manifest with acute and chronic symptoms that can mimic many different pathologies such as malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, ischaemic colitis, infectious diseases and IBS. Colicky abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom of enteric endometriosis and is common to many other conditions such as Crohn's and is non-specific in cases of bowel obstruction. Similarly, other common symptoms such as loose motions, constipation, nausea, emesis, pyrexia, anorexia and weight loss in isolation will not be diagnostic. Haematochesia, such as was seen in our case is an uncommon symptom due to the low incidence of mucosal involvement. The chronic symptoms of endometriosis tend to be 'pelvic pain, infertility, dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia'. Furthermore, the symptoms of bowel endometriosis can be associated with the patients' menstrual cycle in 18–40% of cases. However, without a high index of suspicion these symptoms may not be elucidated or considered important particularly in an acute setting. This was clearly seen in our case, where the patient's symptoms had commenced following her menses and could have indeed aided our diagnosis. Laboratory tests such as CA125 are not sensitive enough for diagnostic use. Contrast studies such as barium enemas may be helpful although they are falling out of favour and may not be specific. As was evident in our case, cross-sectional imaging may not be helpful as it can be difficult to discern between ileal Crohn's and endometriosis. Multislice CT with enteroclysis protocols can be useful in diagnosis as it may demonstrate focal or constricting bowel lesions. MRI is currently the best imaging modality for enteric endometriosis with a sensitivity of between 77–93%. If the condition is suspected then the urinary tract should be imaged, as an Urologist may be required. Our case demonstrates that it is rare to be able to be solely reliant on imaging for the diagnosis of intestinal endometriosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^111cEwbS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Abdominal imaging usage in suspected small bowel bleeding — barium examinations have low diagnostic yield and are not advised, while optimized CT or MR techniques are more commonly used. Specifically, "barium examinations of the small bowel have had low yields (3–17%)… and therefore are not recommended in the evaluation of patients with suspected small bowel bleeding". Also, "These optimized small bowel techniques can be performed using CT or MR. CT is more widely used in the setting of GI bleeding because of the superior temporal and spatial resolution compared with MR and is more widely available".

### Comparison of multidetector CT and barium studies of the small bowel: inflammatory bowel disease in children [^114Fpukd]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

We compared barium studies of the small bowel with multidetector CT (MDCT) in the evaluation of the small bowel during the initial presentation of inflammatory bowel disease in a pediatric population.

Subjects and Methods

This was a prospective study. Eighteen children undergoing workup for inflammatory bowel disease underwent MDCT, colonoscopy, and barium studies of the small bowel before commencement of therapy. Examinations were independently reviewed. The patients and their guardians completed a questionnaire assessing the acceptability of each study.

Results

In 13 of 18 children, the findings of MDCT and barium studies of the small bowel concurred in the evaluation of terminal ileum disease. In three of these children, MDCT detected skip segments of small-bowel disease not detected on barium studies of the small bowel. In two of 18 children, the terminal ileum was not visualized on barium studies of the small bowel, whereas MDCT showed substantial terminal ileum disease in both children. In three of 18 children, there was discordance between the two tests regarding terminal ileum disease. However, these discordant imaging findings were all subtle. In addition, MDCT revealed extraenteric abnormalities, clinically relevant in two children (ureteric obstruction and perirectal abscess), and showed the colon in all children, seven of whom had incomplete colonoscopy. The questionnaire revealed that 16 of 18 patients preferred MDCT to small-bowel barium studies. The reasons given were poor tolerance of oral barium and the long duration of barium studies of the small bowel.

Conclusion

MDCT can be an alternative to barium studies of the small bowel for evaluation of the small bowel in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. MDCT also offers additional, clinically relevant information not obtained by small-bowel barium studies.

### Radiological diagnosis of large-bowel obstruction: neoplastic etiology [^111aTkiB]. Emergency Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Large-bowel obstruction (LBO) is a relatively common abdominal emergency. The CT exam has become the most important imaging modality for the diagnosis of LBO, following abdominal ultrasound and plain radiography. The recent multi-detector CT (MD-CT) is able to clarify the etiology of LBO and to help in deciding how to treat LBO. Therefore, it is important for the radiologists to become familiar with the imaging findings of LBO, including plain radiograph and CT, due to various causes. In this article, we have shown the characteristics of the radiological findings including plain radiograph, barium study, and CT as well as their correlations with pathologic findings of LBO. The etiology of LBO is usually divided into neoplastic diseases and nonneoplastic diseases. However, the most common cause is the neoplastic etiology. Now, we can afford the critical information concerning the level of obstruction, its cause, the viability of the involved bowel loops, and a decision-making regarding the therapy for patients with LBO, using MD-CT high technology.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^111eugSV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Even the 2007 EAST guidelines on SBO management stated that there is no significant difference with regard to the decompression achieved, the success of nonoperative treatment, or the morbidity rate after surgical intervention comparing long tube decompression with the use of nasogastric tubes.

Nevertheless, in conservative treatment for challenging cases of ASBO, the long tube should be placed as soon as possible.

Early tube decompression, either with long intestinal tube or just a naso-gastric tube, is therefore advisable in the initial management of non strangulating ASBO, in adjunct with fluid resuscitation and electrolytes imbalances correction.

The first evidence of safety and efficacy of Water-soluble contrast medium (Gastrografin) use in ASBO was from Assalia et al. in the 90s. The first prospective RCT randomised 99 patients with partial ASBO either to 100 mL of Gastrografin administered through the nasogastric tube or conventional treatment. Mean timing of the first stool was 23.3 hours in the control group and 6.2 hours in the patients receiving Gastrografin (p < 0.00001). Ten obstructive episodes (21%) in the control group required operative treatment compared with six (10%) in the trial group (p = 0.12). Mean hospital stay for the patients who responded to conservative treatment was 4.4 days and 2.2 days in the control and trial groups, respectively (p < 0.00001). One patient in each group died after operation. No Gastrografin-related complications were observed.

### Small bowel obstruction: computed tomography features and pitfalls [^111kdrKV]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) has become established as an ideal form of imaging in small bowel obstruction (SBO), especially with modern day multiplanar imaging that is now widely available. CT can confirm the presence of SBO; show the site, level, and cause of obstruction accurately; and detect strangulation. It is important to recognize the common and unusual causes, but also conditions that mimic SBO. This review illustrates a spectrum of causes and discusses conditions that mimic SBO and their differentiation and the limitations of CT in the assessment of suspected SBO.

### Barium sulfate (varibar thin liquid) [^1177j7Cj]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity
Reactions

Barium sulfate preparations contain a number of excipients, including
natural and artificial flavors and may induce serious hypersensitivity
reactions. The manifestations include hypotension, bronchospasm and
other respiratory impairments, and dermal reactions including rashes,
urticaria and itching. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, food
allergies, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent may increase
the risk for hypersensitivity reactions. Emergency equipment and trained
personnel should be immediately available for treatment of a hypersensitivity
reaction.

5.2 Intra-abdominal
Barium Leakage

The use of VARIBAR THIN LIQUID is contraindicated in patients at
high risk of perforation of the GI tract [see Contraindications
(4)]. Administration of VARIBAR
THIN LIQUID may result in leakage of barium from the GI tract in the
presence of conditions such as carcinomas, GI fistula, inflammatory
bowel disease, gastric or duodenal ulcer, appendicitis, or diverticulitis.
and in patients with a severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract,
especially if it is distal to the stomach. The barium leakage has
been associated with peritonitis and granuloma formation.

5.3 Delayed
Gastrointestinal Transit and Obstruction

Orally administered barium sulfate may accumulate
proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon, causing obstruction
or impaction with development of baroliths (inspissated barium associated
with feces) and may lead to abdominal pain, appendicitis, bowel obstruction,
or rarely perforation. Patients with the following conditions are
at higher risk for developing obstruction or baroliths: severe stenosis
at any level of the GI tract, impaired GI motility, electrolyte imbalance,
dehydration, on a low residue diet, taking medications that delay
GI motility, constipation, pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis
or Hirschsprung disease, and the elderly [see Use in Specific
Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. To reduce the risk of delayed
GI transit and obstruction, patients should maintain adequate hydration
after the barium sulfate procedure.

5.4 Aspiration
Pneumonitis

The use of VARIBAR THIN LIQUID is contraindicated in patients with
trachea-esophageal fistula [see Contraindications (4)]. Oral administration of barium
is associated with aspiration pneumonitis, especially in patients
with a history of food aspiration or with compromised swallowing mechanism.
Vomiting following oral administration of barium sulfate may lead
to aspiration pneumonitis.

In patients at risk for aspiration, begin
the procedure with a small ingested volume of VARIBAR THIN LIQUID.
Monitor the patient closely for aspiration, discontinue administration
of VARIBAR THIN LIQUID if aspiration is suspected, and monitor for
development of aspiration pneumonitis.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^116Kvuu2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy

The role of colonoscopy is limited to the diagnosis of large bowel obstruction. The goal is to exclude other causes for obstruction. Biopsy should be performed in cases of suspected malignancy when emergency surgery has not been indicated or endoscopic stent placement can be expected. In this case, carbon dioxide insufflation may be an acceptable alternative to conventional air insufflation to avoid prolonged abdominal bloating, excessive abdominal pain, and discomfort during colonoscopy. Besides, CO₂ is absorbed from the colon 150 times faster than nitrogen and reduces the risk of the bowel ischemia resulting in reduced spasm and pain.

Therapy

Conservative (non-surgical) therapy

Conservative treatment is the cornerstone of non-operative management in all patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction unless there are signs of intestinal ischemia/perforation. Evidence for the ideal duration of non-operative is lacking, but most authors consider a 72-h cutoff safe and appropriate. The mainstay of non-operative management is nil per os and decompression with naso-gastric suction or long intestinal tube. There has been some discussion in the literature about the use in adhesive small bowel obstruction of long intestinal tubes: long trilumen naso-intestinal tubes are more effective than naso-gastric tubes, but they require endoscopic insertion.

Water-soluble contrast administration is a valid and safe treatment that correlates with a significant reduction in the need for surgery in patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction with also a significant reduction in the time to resolution and length of stay. The administration of water-soluble contrast is a secure treatment with no significant differences in complications or mortality. Adhesive small bowel obstruction recurrence is possible after non-operative management: 12% of non-operatively treated patients are readmitted within 1 year, and this value increases to 20% after 5 years.

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: a WSES position paper [^113NZbQj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency, accounting for almost 50% of all emergency laparotomies with significant in-hospital morbidity and costs. Most patients with SBO have undergone previous abdominal operations (80%), with adhesions as the single most common cause (60–75%) of SBO. However, SBO also occurs in patients who had no prior abdominal surgery, referred to as a virgin abdomen.

In the past decade, a paradigm shift in the treatment of SBO in patients with previous abdominal surgery has been implemented. Today, the majority of small bowel obstructions are managed non-operatively, treatment comprising bowel decompression, water-soluble contrast agents, and fluid resuscitation. Non-operative management has been found safe and efficacious in 70% of SBOs caused by adhesions (ASBO). Many authors, however, suggest that surgical exploration is still mandatory in the case of SBO in the virgin abdomen (SBO-VA), based on the assumption that SBO-VA is usually caused by other etiologies than adhesions, such as malignancy, internal hernia, and bezoars as the most prominent causes.

On the other hand, recent studies suggest a high incidence of adhesions also in patients with SBO-VA. The origin of adhesions in the virgin abdomen can be congenital, or the results of (unrecognized) abdominal inflammation in the patients' history. The observation that most SBO-VA are caused by adhesions could have important implications for treatment, signifying that guidelines on the management of ASBO might also apply to the majority of patients with SBO-VA.

The present paper aims to provide an overview of the literature on the etiology and management of SBO-VA and to generate recommendations for clinical management and future research.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^111kFYjL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

- Consensus Development

In the Consensus Conference on July 2 nd 2010, the expert panel had two meetings and a further plenary session. The aim was to focus and clarify the diagnostic and therapeutic issues of the complex management of ASBO, leading to new clinical guidelines, updated and including a wide range of recommendations, for diagnosis, non operative management, timing for surgery, type of surgery and prevention strategies of peritoneal post-operative adhesions causing small bowel obstruction. Based on the review of the current literature, a panel of worldwide experts were invited to participate in the development of the new guidelines. All members of the expert panel were asked to define ASBO. For each step of diagnosis, treatment (conservative and surgical) and prevention of ASBO, one expert summarized the current state of the art. From the evidence based presentations and the reported statements as well as from the results of the relevant literature review, a preliminary document with the resume of the Consensus Statements and Recommendations was compiled. For every key statement, the discussion within the expert panel with the involvement of the audience, took place until a 100% consensus within the group and the audience was achieved. Comments from the audience were collected and partly included in the manuscript. In September 2010 the expert panel had further contacts for discussing and finalize the final version of the text of the guidelines recommendations. The final version of the guidelines was approved by all experts in the panel as well as the experts from the audience who played an active role in the discussion during the Consensus Conference. Each "chapter" consists of a key statement with a grade of recommendation (GoR) followed by a commentary to explain the rationale and evidence behind the statement.

- Literature Searches and Appraisal

We have used the Oxford hierarchy for grading clinical studies according to levels of evidence. Literature searches were aimed at finding randomized (i.e. level 1b evidence) or nonrandomized controlled clinical trials (i.e. level 2b evidence). Alternatively, low-level evidence (mainly case series and case reports; i.e. level 4 evidence) was reviewed. Studies containing severe methodological flaws were downgraded. For each intervention, we considered the validity and homogeneity of study results, effect sizes, safety, and economic consequences.

Systematic literature searches were conducted on Medline and the Cochrane Library until December 2010. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. We also paid attention to studies that were referenced in systematic reviews or previous guidelines.

In another RCT 45 patients with ASBO were randomized to receive either Gastrografin or placebo and 4 patients in each group required surgery but those who received Gastrografin had complete resolution of their ASBO significantly earlier than placebo patients (12 vs 21 h, P = 0.009) and this translated into a median of a 1-day saving in time in hospital (3 vs 4 days, P = 0.03).

A multicenter RCT from Di Saverio et al. was the first which clearly demonstrated a significant reduction of the operative rate in patients with ASBO conservatively managed with adjunct of hyperosmolar Water-soluble contrast medium (Gastrografin), where has been showed a significant reduction of the operative rate and the time to resolution of obstruction, as well as the hospital stay.

Seventy-six patients were randomised to receiving traditional treatment or 150 mL Gastrografin meal via NGT and follow-through study immediately. In the Gastrografin group obstruction resolved subsequently in 31 of 38 cases (81.5%) after a mean time of 6.4 hours. The remaining seven patients were submitted to surgery, and one of them needed bowel resection for strangulation. In the control group, 21 patients were not submitted to surgery (55%), whereas 17 showed persistent untreatable obstruction and required laparotomy: 2 of them underwent bowel resection for strangulation. The difference in operative rate between the groups reached statistical significance (p = 0.013). The time from the hospital admission for obstruction to resolution of symptoms was significantly lower in the Gastrografin group (6.4 vs. 43 hours; p < 0.01). The length of hospital stay revealed a significant reduction in the Gastrografin group (4.7 vs. 7.8 days; p < 0.05). This reduction was more evident in the subset of patients who did not require surgery (3 vs. 5.1 days; p < 0.01).

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^1174ztR7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis: summary

Recommendations can be found in Table 5. In summary, CT scan with oral water-soluble contrast is the preferred technique of imaging in the initial evaluation. Progress of the contrast should be monitored after 24 h of non-operative treatment by X-ray. If the diagnosis of ASBO is certain (e.g. because other causes have been excluded with recent imaging), and there are no signs that immediate surgery might be warranted, only a water-soluble contrast study is considered sufficient. Ultrasound and MRI can be useful in specific situations, such as pregnancy or (in low income countries) when CT scan is unavailable.

Table 5
Overview of conclusions and recommendation

Management

Initial decision making

Non-operative management should always be tried in patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction, unless there are signs of peritonitis, strangulation, or bowel ischemia. Although the risk of recurrence is slightly lower after operative treatment, this is not a reason to opt for a primary surgical approach. Morbidity from emergency surgical exploration is high; there is a considerable risk for bowel injury, and surgical treatment may significantly reduce post-operative quality of life.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^112u7VZ6]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

8.2 Radiological tests

The diagnosis is usually first suspected after plain abdominal radiographs have shown a dilated small and large bowel. Once suspected, investigations aim to confirm that there is impaired transit of luminal contents, to identify the region of the bowel affected, ideally to identify the propulsive abnormality and to show a specific pathology. Investigations help establish the presence of intestinal pseudo-obstruction and may delineate an underlying cause. In practice the diagnosis is often presumed after several laparotomies have excluded a physical obstruction, although CT/barium follow-through/MR enterography excluding a transition point in a diffusely distended small bowel suggests CIPO and may prevent unnecessary laparotomy. CT may also help distinguish severe dysmotility from functional bloating due to abdomino-phrenic dysinergia. Dynamic MRI of the small bowel is becoming increasingly helpful, though is less established. MRI brain can be helpful in the diagnosis of MNGIE.

The measurement of whole gut time can be measured by serial X-rays of ingested radio-opaque markers (small lengths of barium-impregnated polyvinyl tubing).

Small bowel transit using a barium follow-through examination will usually give some indication of accelerated or delayed transit and a dilated duodenal loop (megaduodenum) may be one of the earliest signs of visceral myopathy. In addition, in HVM there may be oesophageal aperistalsis and variable dilatation of the small and large bowel.

8.3 Radioisotopic investigations

Gastric emptying can be measured using gamma scintigraphy to obtain serial images of labelled solid (scrambled eggs, liver or pancake), semi-solid (thick soup) or liquid (orange juice) meals in the stomach. Gastric emptying measurements may be helpful in determining whether the stomach is involved in a generalised disorder of propulsion or a localised one (eg, Chagas' disease). These isotopic meals can be extended to measuring the transit of the meal through the small bowel and, if the isotope has a long half-life, orocaecal and colonic transit may be determined. Liquid meals may not clearly demonstrate an abnormality.

### Hyperirritable stomach as a cause of obstructive symptoms after sleeve gastrectomy: clinical and radiographic findings [^113GBNKp]. Clinical Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To characterize clinical and radiographic features of a hyperirritable stomach after sleeve gastrectomy.

Materials/Methods

Radiology reports revealed that 10/76 patients (13%) with obstructive symptoms after sleeve gastrectomy had a hyperirritable stomach.

Results

All 10 patients presented with nausea, vomiting, and/or regurgitation. All 10 had emesis on barium studies in the absence of gastric outlet obstruction, gastroparesis, or small bowel obstruction/ileus. Five had extraintestinal causes of nausea/vomiting. Eight had improvement/resolution of symptoms on medical treatment.

Conclusion

In 13% of patients with nausea/vomiting after sleeve gastrectomy, barium studies revealed a hyperirritable stomach, which likely is multifactorial and self-limited in most patients.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^115hiSvL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Notes on the use of the guidelines

The Guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation also based on the evidence. The Guidelines present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for optimal management and prevention of ASBO.

The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

Definition

Abdominal adhesions, which can begin forming within a few hours after an operation, represent the most common cause of intestinal obstruction being responsible for 60% to 70% of SBO. Adhesional postoperative small bowel obstruction is characterized by the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and obstipation, in conjunction of confirmatory imaging.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic and therapeutic role of water-soluble contrast agent in adhesive small bowel obstruction [^111nzMBF]. The British Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

This meta-analysis assessed the diagnostic and therapeutic role of water-soluble contrast agent (WSCA) in adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO).

Methods

PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched systematically. The primary outcome in the diagnostic role of WSCA was its ability to predict the need for surgery. In the therapeutic role, the following were evaluated: resolution of SBO without surgery, time from admission to resolution, duration of hospital stay, complications and mortality. To assess the diagnostic role of WSCA, pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios were derived. For the therapeutic role of WSCA, weighted odds ratio (OR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) were obtained.

Results

Fourteen prospective studies were included. The appearance of contrast in the colon within 4–24 h after administration had a sensitivity of 96 per cent and specificity of 98 per cent in predicting resolution of SBO. WSCA administration was effective in reducing the need for surgery (OR 0.62; P = 0.007) and shortening hospital stay (WMD -1.87 days; P < 0.001) compared with conventional treatment.

Conclusion

Water-soluble contrast was effective in predicting the need for surgery in patients with adhesive SBO. In addition, it reduced the need for operation and shortened hospital stay.

### Clinical significance of small bowel manometry patterns suggestive of intestinal obstruction [^117KS2Xh]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Two small bowel manometry patterns, the minute rhythm and the prolonged simultaneous contractions patterns, have historically been considered suggestive of mechanical intestinal obstruction.
We have found that currently, the most frequent origin of these patterns is intestinal neuropathy, while a previously undetected mechanical obstruction is rare.
Colonic fecal retention may also generate occlusive patterns in the small bowel, since in some patients with pooling of solid stools in the colon, manometry normalized after colonic cleansing.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Due to its high atomic number, barium (the
active ingredient in ENTERO VU 24%) is opaque to x-rays and therefore
acts as a positive contrast agent for radiographic studies.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Barium sulfate is biologically inert and
has no known pharmacological effects.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Under physiological conditions, barium sulfate
passes through the gastrointestinal tract in an unchanged form and
is absorbed only in small, pharmacologically insignificant amounts.

Discussion

The management of complicated ASBO is straightforward, as surgery is required. There is, however, an ongoing debate concerning the surgical management of uncomplicated ASBO. The main points are to avoid surgery if it is unnecessary and to avoid delaying surgery if it is necessary. A recent propensity score analysis of 27,904 patients showed a lower risk of recurrence than with conservative management (13.0% vs 21.3%, p < 0.01). Another study of 6,191 patients confirmed these outcomes (19% vs 25.6%, p < 0.005). However the authors noted a higher mortality rate in the operative group (3.7% vs 2.6%, p = 0.025). The debate is still ongoing and conservative treatment remains the standard of care whenever possible.

Currently, there are no robust criteria for objectively determining the failure of non-surgical treatment or establishing the indications for surgery in acute ASBO. Soluble contrast medium (such as gastrografin) is still used in a number of centers as a diagnostic test for the resolution of small bowel obstruction when it is observed in the cecum by abdominal X-ray. The therapeutic effect of water-soluble contrast medium is due to a side effect based on the stimulation of bowel peristalsis. However, the efficacy of water-soluble contrast medium in this setting is also subject to debate, as data from a recent randomized clinical trial that included 242 patients (ABOD study), combined with a meta-analysis in 2015 that included 990 patients, failed to demonstrate any value of gastrografin to reduce the surgery rate and length of stay. In the ABOD study, the operative intervention rate was 24% in the gastrografin arm and 20% in the control arm (p = NS) and the bowel resection rate was 8% in the gastrografin arm and 4% in the control arm (p = NS). These results, combined with those of a meta-analysis based on 10 published studies, suggest that gastrografin did not decrease either the operative intervention rate (26% in the gastrografin arm versus 21% in the control arm) or the number of days from initial CT to discharge (3.5 versus 3.5, p = NS for both).

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^116xhTnt]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

A regression model was developed to explore the impact of frailty, co-morbidities, prior SBO, and use of contrast on rates of surgery (Fig. 3). The final model AIC was 327.7. It demonstrated that increased frailty and CCI had a non-significant trend to reduced rates of surgery. Previous episodes of SBO were associated with lower rates of surgery (OR 0.35 (95% c.i. 0.17 to 0.66), P = 0.002), and use of contrast was associated with increased rates of surgery (OR 2.41 (95% c.i. 1.29 to 4.76), P = 0.008).

Clinical outcomes

A summary of outcomes in NOM patients is displayed in Table 2, with outcomes stratified by type of contrast agent in Supplementary Material S6.

The overall in-hospital mortality rate in this cohort was 5.4% (n = 22/408). Following an initial WSCA challenge, six of the patients were subsequently palliated and two of the patients who died received a further second WSCA challenge. Of the patients who died, 18.2% (n = 4/22) had an operation. There were no significant differences in in-hospital death between those who received and did not receive a WSCA challenge, both for all NOM patients (5.1% versus 5.8%, P = 0.8) and those who went on to receive an operation (3.5% versus 11.1%, P = 0.2).

### Small bowel obstruction: a practical step-by-step evidence-based approach to evaluation, decision making, and management [^116ks8Ue]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The initial goal of evaluating a patient with SBO is to immediately identify strangulation and need for urgent operative intervention, concurrent with rapid resuscitation. This relies on a combination of traditional clinical signs and CT findings. In patients without signs of strangulation, a protocol for administration of Gastrografin immediately in the emergency department efficiently sorts patients into those who will resolve their obstructions and those who will fail nonoperative management. Furthermore, because of the unique ability of Gastrografin to draw water into the bowel lumen, it expedites resolution of partial obstructions, shortening time to removal of nasogastric tube liberalization of diet, and discharge from the hospital. Implementation of such a protocol is a complex, multidisciplinary, and time-consuming endeavor. As such, we cannot over emphasize the importance of clear, open communication with everyone involved. If surgical management is warranted, we encourage an initial laparoscopic approach with open access. Even if this results in immediate conversion to laparotomy after assessment of the intra-abdominal status, we encourage this approach with a goal of 30% conversion rate or higher. This will attest that patients will have been given the highest likelihood of a successful laparoscopic LOA.

### Water-soluble contrast medium (gastrografin) value in adhesive small intestine obstruction (ASIO): a prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial [^112Re91j]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with adhesive small intestine obstruction (ASIO) are difficult to evaluate and to manage and their treatment is still controversial. The diagnostic and therapeutic role of water-soluble contrast medium (Gastrografin) in ASIO is still debated. This study was designed to determine the therapeutic role of Gastrografin in patients with ASIO.

Methods

The study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled investigation. The primary end points were the evaluation of the operative rate reduction and shortening the hospital stay after the use of Gastrografin. A total of 76 patients were randomized into two groups: the control group received traditional treatment (TT), whereas the study group (GG) received in addition a Gastrografin meal and follow-through study immediately. Patients with Gastrografin in the colon within 36 hours were considered to be partially obstructed and submitted to nonoperative management. If after 36 hours, the Gastrografin had not entered the colon, the subjects were submitted to laparotomy.

Results

No significant differences were found in age, sex, intravenous administration of prokinetics, incidence and characteristics of the previous procedures in surgical history of the patients, previous episodes of ASIO and surgery for adhesiolysis, or duration of symptoms before admission. In the GG group obstruction resolved subsequently in 31 of 38 cases (81.5%) after a mean time of 6.4 hours. The remaining seven patients were submitted to surgery, and one of them needed bowel resection for strangulation. In the control group, 21 patients were not submitted to surgery (55%), whereas 17 showed persistent untreatable obstruction and required laparotomy: 2 of them underwent bowel resection for strangulation. The difference in the operative rate between the two treatment groups reached statistical significance (p = 0.013). The time from the hospital admission for obstruction to resolution of symptoms was significantly lower in the GG group (6.4 vs. 43 hours; p < 0.01). The length of hospital stay revealed a significant reduction in the GG group (4.7 vs. 7.8 days; p < 0.05). This reduction was more evident in the subset of patients who did not require surgery (3 vs. 5.1 days; p < 0.01). No GG-related complications or significant differences in major complications and the relapse rate were found (relapse rate, 34.2% after a mean time to relapse of 6.3 months in the GG group vs. 42.1% after 7.6 months in the TT; p = not significant).

Conclusions

Data showed that the use of Gastrografin in ASIO is safe and reduces the operative rate and the time to resolution of obstruction, as well as the hospital stay.

### The effect of hyperosmolar water-soluble contrast for the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115iJ7vo]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To better understand the efficacy of water-soluble contrast (WSC) in the treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO).

Background

Guidelines recommend using WSC to treat adhesive SBO nonoperatively by acting as a cathartic agent. The evidence supporting this practice is mixed.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of published articles describing the effect of WSC compared with control treatments was performed for the period of January 1, 1990 to November 1, 2021. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias and the Newcastle-Ottawa tools. The therapeutic effect of WSC was assessed by operative rates and hospital length of stay (HLOS) in nonsurgical patients.

Results

The initial search yielded 4879 articles, of which, 28 were selected for full text review. We identified 11 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which included 817 patients and 9 observational studies of 3944 patients. HLOS in nonsurgical patients decreased by 1.95 days (95% confidence interval: 0.56–3.3) in the RCTs and could not be assessed in the observational studies. WSC did not significantly affect operative rates in the RCTs (19.8% vs. 21.4%) but did reduce rates in the observational studies (11% vs. 16%, risk ratio: 0.56, 95% confidence interval: 0.39–0.82).

Conclusion

WSC studies may reduce HLOS for patients who have SBO and do not require surgery. However, the current literature is heterogenous with considerable design limitations. High-quality RCTs are needed using standardized protocols to determine the full benefit of WSC for the management of SBO.

### Barium sulfate (varibar thin honey) [^112MWpTj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Barium sulfate preparations contain a number
of excipients, including natural and artificial flavors and may induce
serious hypersensitivity reactions. The manifestations include hypotension,
bronchospasm and other respiratory impairments, and dermal reactions
including rashes, urticaria and itching. A history of bronchial asthma,
atopy, food allergies, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent
may increase the risk for hypersensitivity reactions. Emergency equipment
and trained personnel should be immediately available for treatment
of a hypersensitivity reaction.

5.2 Intra-abdominal Barium Leakage

The use of VARIBAR THIN HONEY is contraindicated
in patients at high risk of perforation of the GI tract [see
Contraindications (4)]. Administration
of VARIBAR THIN HONEY may result in leakage of barium from the GI
tract in the presence of conditions such as carcinomas, GI fistula,
inflammatory bowel disease, gastric or duodenal ulcer, appendicitis,
or diverticulitis, and in patients with a severe stenosis at any level
of the GI tract, especially if it is distal to the stomach. The barium
leakage has been associated with peritonitis and granuloma formation.

5.3 Delayed Gastrointestinal Transit and Obstruction

Orally administered barium sulfate
may accumulate proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon, causing
obstruction or impaction with development of baroliths (inspissated
barium associated with feces) and may lead to abdominal pain, appendicitis,
bowel obstruction, or rarely perforation. Patients with the following
conditions are at higher risk for developing obstruction or baroliths:
severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract, impaired GI motility,
electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, on a low residue diet, taking
medications that delay GI motility, constipation, pediatric patients
with cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease, and the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. To reduce the
risk of delayed GI transit and obstruction, patients should maintain
adequate hydration after the barium sulfate procedure.

5.4 Aspiration Pneumonitis

The use of VARIBAR THIN HONEY is contraindicated
in patients with trachea-esophageal fistula [see Contraindications
(4)]. Oral administration
of barium is associated with aspiration pneumonitis, especially in
patients with a history of food aspiration or with compromised swallowing
mechanism. Vomiting following oral administration of barium sulfate
may lead to aspiration pneumonitis.

In patients at risk for aspiration, begin
the procedure with a small ingested volume of VARIBAR THIN HONEY.
Monitor the patient closely for aspiration, discontinue administration
of VARIBAR THIN HONEY if aspiration is suspected, and monitor for
development of aspiration pneumonitis.

### Computed tomography of small bowel obstruction [^114sUnNp]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Multidetector computed tomography (CT) is a powerful tool for the assessment of patients with small bowel obstruction (SBO). CT can provide important information about the cause and site of obstruction and the presence of a closed-loop obstruction or ischemia. Under investigation is the ability of CT to accurately identify patients without clear indications for urgent surgery who may benefit from earlier intervention. This article reviews the appropriate CT technique for assessment of SBO, common causes for obstruction, imaging findings in SBO, and the significance of those findings for determining whether a patient is likely to require surgical management for SBO.

### Intraluminal causes of mechanical small bowel obstruction: CT findings and diagnostic approach [^116br6zV]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Intraluminal causes of small bowel obstruction (SBO) are less common than mural or extrinsic etiologies. This review categorizes intraluminal causes of SBO into four broad categories to provide a diagnostic framework for radiologic interpretation: 1) ingested contents, 2) bowel stasis, 3) inflammatory causes, and 4) neoplasms. Ingested materials can result in SBO when individual or accumulated contents are too large to pass, such as in the case of foreign bodies or bezoars. Bowel stasis causing SBO can be secondary to abnormal bowel function, such as in cystic fibrosis, reduced transit of contents at sites of narrowing such as surgical anastomoses, or the formation of enteroliths in diverticula which may subsequently dislodge and result in luminal obstruction. Inflammatory causes of SBO include strictures or fistulas that allow foreign bodies (such as gallstones) formed outside the bowel to enter the bowel lumen and cause obstruction. Finally, neoplasms can present as endophytic masses that occlude the bowel lumen through a ball-valve mechanism or serve as a lead point for intussusception. Recognizing the imaging features that are suggestive of intraluminal SBO is critical for accurate diagnosis and timely patient care.

### An apricot story: view through a keyhole [^113hfZXt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 75 years old lady was admitted via the Accident and Emergency to the surgical ward with a three-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting. The pain had started suddenly in the evening three days ago accompanied with vomiting three to four times. The vomitus consisted of dark brown fluid. The pain was initially in the left hypochondrial region and had lately become more generalised, constant, and increased in intensity. Her General Practioner, who had prescribed antiemetics for her symptoms, initially saw the patient. She had appendicectomy in the past, and had been diagnosed with diverticular disease on Barium enema and colonoscopy.

On examination, her vital parameters were normal. She had abdominal distension with generalised tenderness, abdomen was resonant on percussion, and she had decreased bowel sounds. Her routine blood tests were normal, and urine analysis showed increased ketones.

X-rays of the abdomen and chest were suggestive of dilated loops of small bowel (figure 1). A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed dilated fluid filled small bowel loops with a point of abrupt change in calibre and angulation of bowel loop in the central abdomen. The small bowel beyond that point was collapsed. There was a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The CT scan was suggestive of adhesive small bowel obstruction, probably affecting a distal jejunal loop, with diverticular disease in sigmoid colon without any overt signs of active inflammation, and no free intraperitoneal air (figure 2).

### Active treatment for partial small bowel obstruction… [^117K9bxX]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Does oral therapy with magnesium oxide, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and simethicone improve outcomes in patients with partial small bowel obstruction. Setting: Inpatient Study Design: Randomized controlled trial Allocation: Concealed. Synopsis: Partial small bowel obstruction is a relatively common long-term complication of intra-abdominal and pelvic surgery, with up to one third of patients requiring surgical decompression. In this study, the researchers identified 128 Taiwanese adults with a history of abdominal surgery more than four weeks before the study began, symptoms consistent with partial small bowel obstruction, and a confirmatory radiograph showing air-fluid levels in the small bowel but only air in the large bowel. Allocation was concealed, and an attempt was made to blind the attending surgeon who made the decisions about treatment and length of stay.

Groups were balanced at the start of the study, and no patients were lost to follow-up. All patients received intravenous hydration and nasogastric tube decompression. Those in the control group received nothing by mouth, whereas those in the treatment group received water and 500 mg magnesium oxide, 0. 3 g of L. acidophilus, and 40 mg simethicone three times daily followed by clamping of the tube for one hour. Patients in the active treatment group were less likely to require surgery and had a shorter length of stay. There was no difference between groups in the likelihood of serious complications or recurrence within six months. The main limitations of the study were the failure to blind patients and caregivers and the difficulty in blinding the attending surgeon. Bottom Line: The combination of magnesium oxide, L.

acidophilus, and simethicone appears to reduce length of stay and the need for surgery in patients with partial small bowel obstruction, although this study was limited by a failure to completely blind patients and their caregivers.
