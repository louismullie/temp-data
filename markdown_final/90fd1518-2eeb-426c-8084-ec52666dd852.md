## Question

zosyn use in esbl

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and how to use piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) for infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales, including dosing, PK/PD considerations, site-specific guidance, and stewardship implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the resistance mechanisms and how they affect piperacillin-tazobactam activity. Then, I should verify the highest-quality clinical evidence, especially randomized trials and guideline positions. Next, I will stratify by infection site and severity, including urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and intra-abdominal infections. After that, I need to check dosing strategies, including extended infusion and renal adjustments. Finally, I will integrate safety, stewardship, and a practical decision framework with clear recommendations and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the microbiology and mechanism issues. ESBLs (class A, e.g. CTX-M, TEM, SHV) hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, and tazobactam can inhibit many ESBLs, but activity is variable and undermined by co-produced beta-lactamases like AmpC, porin loss, and efflux, which can raise MICs and blunt clinical efficacy; importantly, tazobactam does not reliably inhibit AmpC, so Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia with inducible AmpC remain problematic for piperacillin-tazobactam [^115GceKr] [^112d2hpi] [^111maHSV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the highest-quality evidence. The MERINO randomized trial in ESBL bloodstream infection showed piperacillin-tazobactam was not noninferior to meropenem and had markedly higher 30-day mortality (12.3% vs 3.7%), establishing that piperacillin-tazobactam should not be used for ESBL bacteremia when alternatives exist [^112BoJV8]. Observational data also associate empiric piperacillin-tazobactam with higher mortality in ESBL bacteremia, reinforcing caution outside the urinary tract [^113h8EBp].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. IDSA 2023–2024 recommends carbapenems as first-line for ESBL infections outside the urinary tract and advises against piperacillin-tazobactam for invasive ESBL infections, including bloodstream infection and pneumonia; for urinary infections, the panel prefers carbapenems or active oral agents but acknowledges that piperacillin-tazobactam may be reasonable in select cases with close monitoring, especially if already started and the patient is improving [^115rp3Xo] [^112qCGNZ] [^113u3k1t] [^115SPMPY].

> I will now examine urinary tract infections, where the signal differs. A randomized trial in ESBL pyelonephritis/cUTI suggested similar clinical success between piperacillin-tazobactam and ertapenem, and a propensity-weighted observational study found no differences in clinical outcomes with piperacillin-tazobactam versus carbapenems, with a signal toward less emergence of carbapenem resistance; however, IDSA still prefers carbapenems or active oral agents and notes theoretical microbiologic failure risk with piperacillin-tazobactam, so if used, it should be in clinically stable patients with low MICs and careful follow-up [^113u3k1t] [^112wumTy] [^112NYRSw] [^112qCGNZ].

> Wait, let me verify the intra-abdominal infection context. For IAIs with ESBL risk, carbapenems remain standard when ESBL coverage is needed; however, if the isolate is piperacillin-tazobactam susceptible, source control is adequate, and the patient is clinically stable, step-down to piperacillin-tazobactam may be considered, ideally with extended infusion to optimize PK/PD; surgical society guidance supports considering ceftolozane-tazobactam empirically when ESBL risk is high, reflecting evolving options beyond carbapenems [^117NaStw] [^113QqYWi] [^117N3FFx].

> I need to ensure dosing is optimized if piperacillin-tazobactam is used. Extended infusion improves PK/PD target attainment for higher MICs; regimens such as 4.5 g every 8 hours infused over 3–4 hours are reasonable in adults, with attention to renal function and augmented clearance in critical illness; for severe infections or higher MICs, continuous infusion can be considered where feasible, acknowledging that definitive outcome data are limited and PK/PD targets remain debated for ESBL producers [^116gYFKN] [^112LMVrw] [^117XW44D] [^112qwKu6].

> Let me consider special populations and safety. In renal impairment, dose adjustments are required, with extended intervals at low GFR and vigilance for neurotoxicity; piperacillin-tazobactam is associated with nephrotoxicity in critically ill patients, particularly with concomitant vancomycin, so alternatives should be favored when possible; monitor for CNS excitability and seizures in renal dysfunction and consider sodium load in heart failure or fluid-restricted patients [^113PocEW] [^111pdpLN] [^117U7qwn].

> But wait, what about susceptibility testing and breakpoints; I should double-check that. CLSI and EUCAST have lowered piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints for Enterobacterales, and USCAST argues that current breakpoints may overcall susceptibility for 3GC-nonsusceptible isolates; moreover, the MERINO trial's susceptibility testing used methods that may have misclassified some OXA-1–producing isolates as susceptible, highlighting the disconnect between in vitro results and clinical outcomes in ESBL infections [^113L9Jv2] [^117XW44D] [^116NhJ5m].

> Next, I should review stewardship and resistance implications. Restricting piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems has been associated with reduced acquisition of ESBL-producing organisms, supporting careful empiric use and timely de-escalation; when ESBL is confirmed outside the urinary tract, step up to a carbapenem or an appropriate alternative, and reserve newer beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors for carbapenem-resistant organisms or complex polymicrobial scenarios per IDSA guidance [^114sNkEj] [^115rp3Xo] [^117TnyzY].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I should confirm it aligns with the evidence. Do not use piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL bloodstream infection or other invasive non-urinary infections given MERINO and guideline recommendations; for ESBL pyelonephritis/cUTI, carbapenems or active oral agents are preferred, but piperacillin-tazobactam may be acceptable if the MIC is low (ideally ≤ 8/4 mg/L), the patient is stable, and close follow-up is planned; for IAIs, use carbapenems when ESBL coverage is needed, with step-down to piperacillin-tazobactam only if the isolate is susceptible, source control is achieved, and the patient is improving; avoid piperacillin-tazobactam for organisms with moderate-to-high risk of inducible AmpC, and consider extended or continuous infusion if it is used for susceptible isolates [^112BoJV8] [^115rp3Xo] [^112qCGNZ] [^117NaStw] [^117XW44D].

> Finally, I should confirm key caveats and close with a clear bottom line. The inoculum effect and co-resistance mechanisms can undermine piperacillin-tazobactam even when MICs appear "susceptible", so clinical context and infection source matter; piperacillin-tazobactam is not appropriate for ESBL bacteremia, is not first-line for ESBL pneumonia or other invasive non-urinary infections, and should be reserved for select urinary infections or carefully chosen step-down scenarios with optimized dosing and vigilant monitoring [^112D1jmw] [^115GceKr] [^115rp3Xo].

Zosyn (piperacillin-tazobactam) is **not recommended for ESBL infections** because of inferior outcomes compared with carbapenems, especially in bloodstream infections [^112BoJV8] [^113tN5kt]. It may be considered only for **uncomplicated UTIs** caused by ESBL-producing organisms when no alternatives are available, but not for pyelonephritis, complicated UTIs, or invasive infections [^112qCGNZ] [^113u3k1t]. If used, employ **extended infusions** (4.5 g over 3–4 hours) and ensure MIC ≤ 8/4 mg/L; avoid in critically ill patients or those with high bacterial loads due to the inoculum effect [^112xr5cx] [^113L9Jv2] [^112D1jmw]. Carbapenems remain first-line for serious ESBL infections [^115rp3Xo].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **MERINO trial**: In ESBL bloodstream infections, piperacillin-tazobactam was inferior to meropenem (30-day mortality 12.3% vs 3.7%; risk difference 8.6%) [^112BoJV8].

- **IDSA 2023/2024**: Recommends carbapenems as first-line for serious ESBL infections; piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for invasive ESBL infections, even if susceptible [^115rp3Xo] [^112qCGNZ].

- **UTI exception**: For uncomplicated ESBL UTIs, piperacillin-tazobactam may be considered if no alternatives exist, but not for pyelonephritis or complicated UTIs [^112qCGNZ] [^115SPMPY].

---

## Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations

- **PK/PD targets**: Piperacillin-tazobactam requires high %fT > MIC; extended infusion (3–4 hours) improves target attainment but may still be inadequate for high MICs or high inoculum [^117XW44D].

- **Inoculum effect**: High bacterial loads can overwhelm tazobactam, leading to treatment failure [^112D1jmw].

- **MIC thresholds**: Susceptibility at ≤ 8/4 mg/L is required; higher MICs predict failure [^113L9Jv2].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety

Clinical outcomes include **higher mortality and microbiologic failure** with piperacillin-tazobactam versus carbapenems in ESBL bloodstream infections [^112BoJV8] [^113h8EBp]. Safety is **generally favorable**, but nephrotoxicity and CNS effects can occur, especially in renal impairment or high doses [^111pdpLN] [^117U7qwn].

---

## Current clinical recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended therapy** | **Role of piperacillin-tazobactam** |
|-|-|-|
| ESBL bloodstream infection | Carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem, ertapenem) | Not recommended |
| ESBL pneumonia | Carbapenems | Not recommended |
| ESBL intra-abdominal infection | Carbapenems | Not recommended |
| Uncomplicated ESBL UTI | - Oral agents (nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, TMP-SMX) if susceptible <br/> - Carbapenems if oral agents not feasible | Consider only if no alternatives and MIC ≤ 8/4 mg/L |
| Complicated ESBL UTI | Carbapenems | Not recommended |

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **renal impairment**, which requires dose adjustment and monitoring for neurotoxicity [^113PocEW], and **pediatric use**, where data are limited; use only when clearly indicated and with caution [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Carbapenems**: First-line for serious ESBL infections due to superior outcomes [^115rp3Xo].

- **Zosyn**: Reserve for uncomplicated ESBL UTIs when no alternatives exist, with MIC ≤ 8/4 mg/L and extended infusion [^112qCGNZ] [^117XW44D].

- **Avoid**: Invasive ESBL infections, critically ill patients, or high bacterial loads [^112BoJV8] [^112D1jmw].

---

Zosyn is **not appropriate for most ESBL infections**; use carbapenems for serious disease and restrict piperacillin-tazobactam to select uncomplicated UTIs when no better options are available.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Piperacillin sodium exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting septum formation and cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. In vitro, piperacillin is active against a variety of gram‑positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitro activity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity to penicillin‑binding proteins. It is, however, a beta-lactamase inhibitor of the Molecular class A enzymes, including Richmond-Sykes class III (Bush class 2b & 2b') penicillinases and cephalosporinases. It varies in its ability to inhibit class II and IV (2a & 4) penicillinases. Tazobactam does not induce chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases at tazobactam concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage regimen.

Antimicrobial Activity

ZOSYN has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]:

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for piperacillin and tazobactam against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of ZOSYN in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

†These are not beta-lactamase producing bacteria and, therefore, are susceptible to piperacillin alone.

Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients

Clinical studies of ZOSYN in pediatric patients suggest a similar safety profile to that seen in adults.

In a prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label clinical trial of pediatric patients, 2 to 12 years of age, with intra-abdominal infections (including appendicitis and/or peritonitis), 273 patients were treated with ZOSYN 112.5 mg/kg given IV every 8 hours and 269 patients were treated with cefotaxime (50 mg/kg) plus metronidazole (7.5 mg/kg) every 8 hours. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 146 patients, 73 (26.7%) in the ZOSYN group and 73 (27.1%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group. Six patients (2.2%) in the ZOSYN group and 5 patients (1.9%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group discontinued due to an adverse event.

In a retrospective, cohort study, 140 pediatric patients 2 months to less than 18 years of age with nosocomial pneumonia were treated with ZOSYN and 267 patients were treated with comparators (which included ticarcillin-clavulanate, carbapenems, ceftazidime, cefepime, or ciprofloxacin). The rates of serious adverse reactions were generally similar between the ZOSYN and comparator groups, including patients aged 2 months to 9 months treated with ZOSYN 90 mg/kg IV every 6 hours and patients older than 9 months and less than 18 years of age treated with ZOSYN 112.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours.

### Antibiotic policy and prescribing strategies for therapy of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: the role of piperacillin-tazobactam [^112Nbivm]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Therapy of infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria with an antimicrobial to which they are resistant results in treatment failure, higher cost and increased mortality. The CLSI recommends reporting ESBL-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. as resistant to all penicillin, true cephalosporin and monobactam antimicrobials, but as susceptible to beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, including piperacillin-tazobactam, when they test as such. Current literature supports the action of piperacillin-tazobactam against susceptible strains of ESBL-producing bacteria based on the structure-activity relationship between inhibitors and the ESBLs, as well as on recent clinical outcome studies.

Purpose Of Review

The widespread diffusion of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Enterobacteriales currently represents a major threat for public health worldwide. Carbapenems are currently considered the first-line choice for serious ESBL infections. However, the dramatic global increase in ESBL prevalence has led to a significant overuse of carbapenems that has promoted the selection and spread of carbapenemases, which might further prejudicated our ability to treat infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, strategies to limit the use of carbapenems should be implemented.

Recent Findings

Although piperacillin-tazobactam should no longer be considered an alternative to carbapenems for definitive treatment of bloodstream infections due to ESBL-producing strains, it might still represent an alternative for step-down therapy or for low-to-moderate severity infection originating from urinary or biliary sources and when piperacillin-tazobactam minimum inhibitory concentration of 4mg/l or less. Ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam are both carbapenem sparing agents that appear interesting alternatives for treatment of serious ESBL infections. New β-lactams/β-lactamase inhibitors (BL/BLI), including cefepime-enmetazobactam, ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam, aztreonam-avibactam and cefepime-zidebactam, are also promising agents for treatment of ESBL infections, but further clinical data are needed to establish their efficacy relative to carbapenems. The role of carbapenems/β-lactamase inhibitors remain to be clarified.

Summary

New BL/BLI have distinctive specificities and limitations that require further investigations. Future randomized clinical trials are required to define the best strategy for their administering for ESBL infections.

5.6	Nephrotoxicity in Critically Ill Patients

The use of ZOSYN was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with ZOSYN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Combined use of piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin may be associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

5.7	Electrolyte Effects

ZOSYN contains a total of 2.84 mEq (65 mg) of Na+(sodium) per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. This should be considered when treating patients requiring restricted salt intake. Periodic electrolyte determinations should be performed in patients with low potassium reserves, and the possibility of hypokalemia should be kept in mind with patients who have potentially low potassium reserves and who are receiving cytotoxic therapy or diuretics.

5.8 Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ZOSYN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.9	Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing ZOSYN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of development of drug-resistant bacteria.

A systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards on PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Central through July 2024.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies providing efficacy data associated with PTZ in patients ≥ 18 years old experiencing an ESBL-PE UTI that documented clinical and microbiological cure data were included.

Data Synthesis

A total of 577 articles were obtained for screening. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 7 studies comparing PTZ with carbapenems comprised of 1156 patient cases were analyzed. Piperacillin/tazobactam was found to be noninferior to carbapenems in the treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTI's caused by ESBL-PE. The observed noninferiority encompassed clinical response, clinical cure, and microbiological cure outcome metrics. Although not specifically evaluated in this systematic review, adverse effects associated with PTZ were found to be minimal and lesser in incidence than with the carbapenem comparators in aggregate.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

While a definitive dosing strategy remains elusive, a PTZ total daily dose of 13.5 g infused over 3 to 4 hours may be appropriate for this indication.

Conclusion

Piperacillin/tazobactam may be an effective carbapenem-sparing agent for the treatment of ESBL-PE UTIs that show in-vitro susceptibility to PTZ. However, additional robust randomized clinical trials are still needed to validate the findings of this review and determine the best dosage regimen of PTZ for ESBL-PE UTIs.

### Controversies over the management of infections caused by amp-C-and ESBL-producing enterobacterales: what questions remain for future studies? [^1165Ah31]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The continuous rise in infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- or AmpC-producing Enterobacterales) is a major health concern. Carbapenems are regarded as the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of these infections. However, their indiscriminant use is not without consequences, and has contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. In this review, we discuss the available evidence supporting the use of other betalactams, nonbetalactams and the new betalactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (BLA/BLI) to treat these infections. We also analyze unresolved issues in this field.

Recent Findings

Piperacillin tazobactam (PTZ) was classically recommended as a carbapenem-sparing agent. However, data have emerged against its use and it is now a controversial recommendation. IDSA, European and British guidelines reject the empirical use of PTZ for these pathogens, reserving its use for rare clinical situations. Other issues that continue to generate debate are the use of extended infusion (3h) PTZ, the use of older antibiotics, a shortened course of carbapenems and reserving the new BLA/BLI for these infections.

Summary

New treatment strategies should be based on clinical evidence, local epidemiology and the microbiological activity of these drugs.

5.6 Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions

As with other penicillins, ZOSYN may cause neuromuscular excitability or seizures. Patients receiving higher doses, especially patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for central nervous system adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment or seizure disorders for signs and symptoms of neuromuscular excitability or seizures [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Nephrotoxicity in Critically Ill Patients

The use of ZOSYN was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with ZOSYN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Combined use of piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin may be associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

5.8 Electrolyte Effects

ZOSYN contains a total of 2.84 mEq (65 mg) of Na+(sodium) per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. This should be considered when treating patients requiring restricted salt intake. Periodic electrolyte determinations should be performed in patients with low potassium reserves, and the possibility of hypokalemia should be kept in mind with patients who have potentially low potassium reserves and who are receiving cytotoxic therapy or diuretics.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for enterobacterales: recommendations from the United States committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^115GceKr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

(See the Editorial Commentary by Humphries on pages 1363–5.)

Piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) is recommended as a first-line treatment for Enterobacterales infections. Despite its wide-scale use, there has been considerable debate on its role for infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC-producing Enterobacterales. Data indicate that 15%–20% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. in the United States are third-generation cephalosporin-nonsusceptible (3GC-NS), a phenotypic marker of ESBL expression, and that a majority of these isolates harbor CTX-M enzymes. Although tazobactam is a potent inhibitor of most CTX-M enzymes, TZP has variable in vitro activity against ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. The reduced TZP susceptibility against ESBL-producing Enterobacterales is multifactorial but driven in large part by the copresence of other β-lactamases. Concerns have also been raised regarding the use of TZP for Enterobacterales (eg, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Klebsiella aerogenes) that have a moderate to high likelihood of clinically significant AmpC production, given that tazobactam does not efficiently inhibit these enzymes.

The in vitro susceptibility testing interpretive criteria (STIC) for TZP against Enterobacterales were recently updated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (Tables 1 and 2). The United States Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (USCAST) also recently convened to review TZP STIC for Enterobacterales. While USCAST appreciates the expertise of these organizations, USCAST arrived at different TZP STIC for Enterobacterales. Here, we explain our recommendations (Table 1), the rationale behind them, and the future research that is needed to further inform these STIC. Of note, USCAST did not discuss the optimal method for incorporating their proposed TZP STIC across clinical microbiologic laboratories in their deliberations. USCAST recognizes that many laboratories use obsolete breakpoints for a variety of reasons and recommends that clinicians work with their microbiologic departments to ensure the most clinically appropriate STIC are used for interpreting TZP susceptibility results.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for enterobacterales: recommendations from the United States committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^112xr5cx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The USCAST recommendation was not unanimous, and 1 dissenting voter was concerned the available data were predominately related to patients with bloodstream infections and did not rule out the potential role of TZP for the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) due to 3GC-NS Enterobacterales as there is some evidence that supports TZP usage in this setting. However, there are significant limitations to the observational studies that have addressed the role of TZP for cUTIs, most notably confounding by indication, and the lone cUTI randomized clinical trial had a small sample size, limiting interpretation. Additionally, the tazobactam PK/PD concerns previously described remain relevant to cUTIs. While USCAST acknowledges that the role of TZP for 3GC-NS Enterobacterales in cUTIs remains unresolved, USCAST believed the most prudent recommendation at this time was not to have a TZP susceptibility breakpoint for 3GC-NS Enterobacterales given the uncertainties regarding the effectiveness of TZP in these patients.

The USCAST members were in full agreement that additional preclinical PK/PD studies with a more diverse group of 3GC-NS Enterobacterales isolates are needed to better understand the PK/PD of TZP against 3GC-NS Enterobacterales. If TZP use is supported by additional preclinical evidence, further randomized clinical trials would then be warranted to better quantify the efficacy of TZP for patients with 3GC-NS Enterobacterales infections. As part of these proposed studies, TZP should be evaluated in patients with less invasive 3GC-NS Enterobacterales infections, such as cUTIs, given the commonality of these infections and uncertainty of TZP's role for these patients. Of note, PETERPEN is an ongoing, open-label, randomized clinical trial comparing extended-infusion TZP and meropenem for ESBL Enterobacterales bloodstream infections, and results of this study will help inform this conversation.

Recommendation 3

USCAST recommends that the STIC for TZP against 3GC-S Enterobacterales that do not have a moderate to high likelihood of clinically significant AmpC production due to an inducible chromosomal AmpC gene are susceptible at MIC values ≤ 16/4 mg/L and resistant at MIC values > 16/4 mg/L. This recommendation is based on TZP dosing regimens administered as an extended infusion (4.5 g infused over 3 hours every 6 hours or 4.5 g infused over 4 hours every 8 hours).

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^117NaStw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The role of piperacillin/tazobactam in treating patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales has been debated. Gram-negative bacteria may express multiple ESBLs as well as AmpC beta-lactamases concomitantly, and can manifest other mechanisms of resistance, limiting the activity of piperacillin/tazobactam. On the other hand, the activity of beta-lactam agents, including piperacillin/tazobactam, is influenced by the "inoculum effect", an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic when the inoculum size is larger. A RCT conducted in patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales blood stream infections showed inferior results of piperacillin/tazobactam compared to carbapenems. Although piperacillin/tazobactam is not considered the first-choice antibiotic to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, it may be an option for IAIs with adequate source control when bacteria are susceptible (MIC ≤ 4 mg/L). A high dose or prolonged/continuous infusion should be prescribed to optimise pharmacokinetics (PK) targeting in critically ill patients.

Piperacillin–tazobactam dosing ratios and susceptibility breakpoints — In a 4.5 g dose of piperacillin-tazobactam there is an 8:1 ratio of piperacillin to tazobactam (ie, 4 grams of piperacillin and 0.5 grams of tazobactam), whereas in a 3 g dose of cefotolozane there is a 2:1 ratio of cefotolozane to tazobactam. The piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoint for Enterobacterales has been based on PK/PD considerations and a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL of tazobactam in testing wells. In 2022, the CLSI lowered the piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints for Enterobacterales: MICs of ≤ 8/4 μg/mL are considered susceptible and a MIC of 16 μg/mL is considered susceptible, dose-dependent; in the clinical trial mentioned in Question 1.3, 94% of isolates would have been considered susceptible or susceptible dose-dependent under the revised breakpoints, indicating that in the presence of ESBL production, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam may not correlate with clinical success.

Piperacillin-tazobactam for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: Piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of invasive infections caused by Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant inducible AmpC production. Tazobactam is less effective at protecting β-lactams from AmpC hydrolysis than newer β-lactamase inhibitors such as avibactam, relebactam, and vaborbactam, and the role of piperacillin-tazobactam in treating Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production remains uncertain. A 2019 meta-analysis of observational studies did not identify a difference in mortality between patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for bacteremia caused by Enterobacter spp. Citrobacter spp., or Serratia spp., though significant heterogeneity and confounding by indication likely existed. A pilot unblinded clinical trial randomized 72 patients with bloodstream infections to piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 grams IV every 6 hours as a standard infusion) or meropenem (1 gram IV every 8 hours as a standard infusion) and found no significant differences in the primary composite outcome, with notable and seemingly conflicting findings among individual components.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical Trials in Adult Patients

During the initial clinical investigations, 2621 patients worldwide were treated with ZOSYN in phase 3 trials. In the key North American monotherapy clinical trials (n = 830 patients), 90% of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. However, in 3.2% of the patients treated worldwide, ZOSYN was discontinued because of adverse events primarily involving the skin (1.3%), including rash and pruritus; the gastrointestinal system (0.9%), including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; and allergic reactions (0.5%).

Nosocomial Pneumonia Trials

Two trials of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections were conducted. In one study, 222 patients were treated with ZOSYN in a dosing regimen of 4.5 g every 6 hours in combination with an aminoglycoside and 215 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg/500 mg every 6 hours) in combination with an aminoglycoside. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 402 patients, 204 (91.9%) in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 198 (92.1%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Twenty-five (11.0%) patients in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 14 (6.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group (p > 0.05) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

### Point-counterpoint: piperacillin-tazobactam should be used to treat infections with extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-positive organisms [^116uAx7D]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTIONBeta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination antimicrobials (BLBLIs) are among the most controversial classes of antibiotic agents available for the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria (ESBL-GNR). Piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) is one of the most frequently utilized antibiotic agents for empirical Gram-negative bacterial coverage and remains active against a large proportion of ESBL-GNR strains. Furthermore, good antimicrobial stewardship practices encourage the use of carbapenem-sparing treatment regimens for infections due to ESBL-GNR. As rapid diagnostics are increasingly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory and have the capability of detecting CTX-M type or other ESBL resistance mechanisms, this issue continues to be pertinent. Some data imply reduced efficacy of PTZ against ESBLs. Several factors may affect a clinician's choice to use BLBLIs, including the isolate's MIC, the site and severity of infection, and the type of resistance mechanism. These factors are explored in this review of the pros and cons of BLBLI treatment of invasive infections due to ESBL-producing bacteria, as well as how laboratories should report results for BLBLIs for these organisms as they relate to antimicrobial stewardship. In this Point-Counterpoint, Audrey Schuetz provides the pro point of view and Sergio Reyes and Pranita Tamma provide the con, counterpoint view.

### Is piperacillin-tazobactam effective for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms? [^112wumTy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist regarding the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) for the management of nonbacteremic pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter observational study comparing clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized with ESBL-producing pyelonephritis who were receiving TZP versus carbapenems, using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Patients were eligible for inclusion if all of the following criteria were met: (1) urine cultures growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, or Proteus mirabilis at ≥ 50 000 colony-forming units/mL; (2) identification of an ESBL gene; (3) pyuria (≥ 10 white blood cells per high powered field in the urine); and (4) dysuria and fever plus at least 1 of the following symptoms: emesis, rigors, hypotension, or flank pain.

Results

There were 186 patients included in the propensity score-weighted cohort; 45 (24%) received TZP and 141 (76%) received a carbapenem. Of these 186 patients, 27% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 48% were immunocompromised, and 45% had underlying urologic abnormalities. There were no differences between the 2 groups in the proportion of patients (20% vs 25%) with recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis with the same ESBL-producing organism within 30 days (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, .31–1.81; p = 0.52). There were no differences in the resolution of clinical symptoms by Day 7 or in 30-day mortality. There was 1 (2%) patient in the TZP arm and 11 (8%) patients in the carbapenem arm who had incident carbapenem-resistant organisms isolated within 30 days (P = 0.09).

Conclusions

TZP may be a reasonable alternative to carbapenems for the management of ESBL-producing pyelonephritis and may mitigate the risk of emergence of carbapenem-resistant organisms, compared with carbapenem therapy.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infection — carbapenem preference and extrapolation: In those with clinical isolates available for retesting, 30-day mortality occurred in 9% vs 4% in the piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem arms, respectively, and although the 95% confidence interval ranged from −1% to 11%, the panel still suggests carbapenem therapy as the preferred treatment of ESBL-producing bloodstream infections. Comparable clinical trial data are not available for ESBL-E infections from other body sites, but the panel suggests extrapolating evidence for ESBL-E bloodstream infections to other common sites of infection, and suggests extending the findings to imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem, with the latter limited to patients with normal serum albumin and patients who are not critically ill.

The panel suggests TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI, and piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam is demonstrated.

### Effect of piperacillin-tazobactam vs meropenem on 30-day mortality for patients with E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance: a randomized clinical trial [^112BoJV8]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases mediate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Significant infections caused by these strains are usually treated with carbapenems, potentially selecting for carbapenem resistance. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be an effective "carbapenem-sparing" option to treat extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers.

Objectives

To determine whether definitive therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam is noninferior to meropenem (a carbapenem) in patients with bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or K pneumoniae.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Noninferiority, parallel group, randomized clinical trial included hospitalized patients enrolled from 26 sites in 9 countries from February 2014 to July 2017. Adult patients were eligible if they had at least 1 positive blood culture with E coli or Klebsiella spp testing nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone but susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Of 1646 patients screened, 391 were included in the study.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, 4.5 g, every 6 hours (n = 188 participants) or meropenem, 1 g, every 8 hours (n = 191 participants) for a minimum of 4 days, up to a maximum of 14 days, with the total duration determined by the treating clinician.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days after randomization. A noninferiority margin of 5% was used.

Results

Among 379 patients (mean age, 66.5 years; 47.8% women) who were randomized appropriately, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and were included in the primary analysis population, 378 (99.7%) completed the trial and were assessed for the primary outcome. A total of 23 of 187 patients (12.3%) randomized to piperacillin-tazobactam met the primary outcome of mortality at 30 days compared with 7 of 191 (3.7%) randomized to meropenem (risk difference, 8.6% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 14.5%]; p = 0.90 for noninferiority). Effects were consistent in an analysis of the per-protocol population. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 5 of 188 patients (2.7%) in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 3 of 191 (1.6%) in the meropenem group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with E coli or K pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance, definitive treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam compared with meropenem did not result in a noninferior 30-day mortality. These findings do not support use of piperacillin-tazobactam in this setting.

5.9 Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ZOSYN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.10 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing ZOSYN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

During the initial clinical investigations, 2621 patients worldwide were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in phase 3 trials. In the key North American monotherapy clinical trials (n = 830 patients), 90% of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. However, in 3.2% of the patients treated worldwide, piperacillin and tazobactam for injection was discontinued because of adverse events primarily involving the skin (1.3%), including rash and pruritus; the gastrointestinal system (0.9%), including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; and allergic reactions (0.5%).

Nosocomial Pneumonia Trials

Two trials of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections were conducted. In one study, 222 patients were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in a dosing regimen of 4.5 g every 6 hours in combination with an aminoglycoside and 215 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg/500 mg q6h) in combination with an aminoglycoside. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 402 patients, 204 (91.9%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group and 198 (92.1%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Twenty-five (11.0%) patients in the piperacillin/tazobactam group and 14 (6.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group (p > 0.05) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

### Β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae: time for a reappraisal in the era of few antibiotic options? [^116vNZeZ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

The spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes in Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp is a major challenge to modern medical practice. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections caused by ESBL producers; however, carbapenem resistance has increased globally. ESBL producers might be susceptible to β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combination antibiotics such piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate. These drugs are frequently avoided in serious infections caused by ESBL producers because of the inoculum effect in-vitro (especially for piperacillin-tazobactam), animal data suggesting inferior efficacy when compared with carbapenems, concerns about pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic drug target attainment with standard doses, and poor outcomes shown in some observational studies. Prospective cohort data and a meta-analysis suggest that BLBLIs are non-inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by ESBL producers. We examine why BLBLIs are perceived as inferior in the treatment of infection with ESBL producers, and discuss data that suggest these concerns might not be strongly supported by clinical evidence.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for enterobacterales: recommendations from the United States committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^117XW44D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Available preclinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data suggest that currently approved TZP dosing schemes are inadequate against the range of MIC values currently considered susceptible for 3GC-NS Enterobacterales. Using a piperacillin 50% free time above the MIC (piperacillin 50% f T > MIC) as the PK/PD target associated with efficacy for TZP, most studies demonstrate that the probability of achieving this PK/PD target with TZP administered as a 0.5-hour intermittent infusion or ≥ 3-hour extended infusion is > 90% for pathogens with MIC values ≤ 8/4 mg/L and ≤ 16/4 mg/L, respectively. Although organizations have used this as part of their STIC justifications, there are 2 main issues with limiting the PK/PD assessment to this target. First, while generally accepted, data to support this f T > MIC target for piperacillin are lacking. Second, in addition to the piperacillin probabilty of target attainment profile, tazobactam exposures are a critical determinant in defining the PK/PD profile of TZP against 3GC-NS Enterobacterales as piperacillin is readily hydrolyzed by ESBLs. Data from hollow fiber infection models of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections indicate tazobactam exposures associated with intermittent-infusion or extended-infusion TZP regimens are insufficient for restoring the activity of piperacillin against 3GC-NS E. coli and Klebsiella spp. within the range of TZP MIC values currently considered susceptible by the FDA, CLSI, and EUCAST.

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (BLBLI), including ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, have an in vitro activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobe organisms. However, increasing antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae including community-acquired isolates, during the last decade, has compromised clinical utility of these agents for empirical therapy of serious Gram-negative infections. This is likely due to excessive use of amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate in both children and adults, particularly in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection. The combination of over use of these oral antibiotics in the community and potential for household transmission of resistant E. coli strains among family members make ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate resistance unpredictable. Fortunately, most isolates remain susceptible to other beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors such as piperacillin/tazobactam. Broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam, including anti-pseudomonal and anaerobic coverage, still make it an attractive option in the management of severe IAIs.

A meta-analysis of PubMed and Scopus databases providing data for mortality among patients treated with carbapenems, BLBLI or non- BLBLI (mainly cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones), preferably as monotherapy was published in 2013. The study reported no statistically significant difference in mortality between carbapenems and BLBLI administered as either empiric or definitive therapy. The authors concluded that the role of BLBLI should be further evaluated for definitive treatment. In a recent study of 331 unique patients with ESBL bacteremia, piperacillin/tazobactam appeared inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of ESBL bacteremia; the use of piperacillin/tazobactam in ESBLs infections is still controversial.

### Is It time to rethink the notion of carbapenem-sparing therapy against extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections? A critical review [^1112gfwx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To present systematic recommendations for carbapenem-sparing therapy against extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections (BSIs) derived from a critical review of clinical data.

Data Sources

A systematic literature search using PubMed and MEDLINE databases (January 1, 2012, to June 30, 2017) was performed using key MESH terms: ESBL or extended-spectrum β-lactamases and bacteremia or bloodstream infection with piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, cefepime, cephamycins, carbapenem, doripenem, meropenem, and ertapenem. References within articles of interest were also evaluated.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English language trials were considered, and results were limited to clinical efficacy trials. Articles were screened by title and abstract for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

Studies comparing noncarbapenem versus carbapenem therapy for ESBL BSIs were critically analyzed to identify heterogeneity among studies. Data abstracted included empirical or definitive therapy, patient population, dosing, source of infection and severity, infectious etiology, and outcome.

Conclusions

Completely sparing carbapenem therapy cannot be justified among patients with ESBL BSIs. Determining the source of infection is critical to identify patients for whom carbapenem-sparing therapy is appropriate.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, ESBL-producing, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to do not change or extend antibiotic therapy if clinical improvement occurs with piperacillin/tazobactam initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Consider administering TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs, recognizing that the risk of clinical failure with piperacillin/tazobactam may be low. Avoid using piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, even if susceptibility to piperacillin/tazobactam is demonstrated.

### Carbapenems versus piperacillin-tazobactam for bloodstream infections of nonurinary source caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^115irFDa]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Low credibility.

A recent, frequently quoted study has suggested that for bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL) Escherichia coli, treatment with β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLIs) might be equivalent to treatment with carbapenems. However, the majority of BSIs originate from the urinary tract. A multicenter, multinational efficacy analysis was conducted from 2010 to 2012 to compare outcomes of patients with non-urinary ESBL BSIs who received a carbapenem (69 patients) vs those treated with piperacillin-tazobactam (10 patients). In multivariate analysis, therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with increased 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 7.9, P = 0.03). For ESBL BSIs of a non-urinary origin, carbapenems should be considered a superior treatment to BLBLIs.

### The use of noncarbapenem β-lactams for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase infections [^111dXfjN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The continued rise in infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens is recognized globally as one of the most pressing concerns facing the healthcare community. Carbapenems are widely regarded as the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of ESBL-producing infections, even when in vitro activity to other β-lactams has been demonstrated. However, indiscriminant carbapenem use is not without consequence, and carbapenem overuse has contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The use of non-carbapenem β-lactams for the treatment of ESBL infections has yielded conflicting results. In this review, we discuss the available data for the use of cephamycins, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and ceftazidime-avibactam for the treatment of ESBL infections.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^116NhJ5m]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Carbapenems are generally considered the empiric agents of choice for treating patients with the most common ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. To avoid excessive carbapenem use, however, de-escalation to other agents, such as piperacillin-tazobactam when a MIC ≤ 8 mg/L (according to the EUCAST breakpoint) is detected, can be considered. Several studies compared piperacillin-tazobactam with carbapenems in the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. In the MERINO trial, the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam versus meropenem in the treatment of BSIs caused by ceftriaxone-resistant E. coli or K. pneumoniae was compared, showing an overall 30-day mortality rate threefold higher in the piperacillin-tazobactam arm than in the meropenem one (12.3% versus 3.7%, p = 0.90). Since the low mortality rate in the meropenem group was an unexpected finding, the results of this study have been debated and several issues may have influenced the outcomes of this trial. Among the debated biases, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment of piperacillin-tazobactam was not optimized, as the trial favoured intermittent 1-h infusion over a prolonged infusion protocol. Also, from a microbiological point of view, the use of the E-test to determine piperacillin/tazobactam susceptibility led to an elevated percentage of OXA-1-producing pathogens being incorrectly identified as piperacillin-tazobactam susceptible (E-test method cannot detect OXA-1). In a second comparative study (MERINO-2 trial), 72 patients with BSIs due to chromosomal AmpC producers were enrolled in a multicenter randomized controlled trial, where they were assigned 1:1 to receive piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem. Piperacillin-tazobactam led to more microbiological failures, although fewer microbiological relapses were observed. Despite several pieces of evidence coming from observational studies showed no significant difference in efficacy and mortality rate between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems among patients with ESBL-producing BSIs, the use of a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) for severe infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales is generally recommended in critically ill patients.

### Evolution and clinical importance of extended-spectrum β-lactamases [^117S3Eg3]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

In the process of evolution, bacteria have acquired well-developed mechanisms of resistance to an extensive array of hostile substances. This time-tempered system of defense is so intricate and adaptable that contemporary medicine has been hard-pressed to maintain an advantage. In this article, the processes responsible for bacterial resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases that have emerged to provide bacteria with formidable resistance to modern drugs. Avoidance of this problem requires limitations on extended-spectrum cephalosporin usage. While carbapenems are clearly the treatment of choice for infections caused by these pathogens, empirical use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors such as piperacillin/tazobactam has been associated with reduction in the prevalence of cephalosporin resistance.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^115WGiXP]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Since the reviews by Jacoby and Munoz-Price and by Paterson and Bonomo listing carbapenems as drugs of choice for infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria, this class of antibiotics has been considered first-line therapy for such infections. This recommendation is influenced by the fact that ESBL-producing pathogens are often resistant to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides since resistance mechanisms for these classes of antibiotics are often carried on the same large plasmids that contain the genetic elements for ESBL production. Paradoxically, even though carbapenems are β-lactam agents, they are stable in the presence of ESBLs. More recently and in response to a large volume of infections in Spain caused by ESBL-producing bacteria, a group of investigators from that country conducted a post hoc analysis of patients with bloodstream infections due to ESBL-producing E. coli from six published prospective cohorts. In this trial, mortality and length of hospital stay were compared in patients treated with either amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (AMC) or piperacillin–tazobactam (PTZ) versus those receiving a carbapenem. In this analysis, the infection source was the urinary or biliary tract in two-thirds of the patients. The results suggest that AMC and PTZ are suitable alternatives to carbapenems for treating patients with bloodstream infections due to ESBL-producing E. coli if there is in vitro activity. However, the variable in vitro susceptibility of ESBL-producing bacteria to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations warrants consideration before these agents are used as empiric therapy for serious infections.

8.1 Pregnancy

Teratogenic effects — Pregnancy Category B

Piperacillin/tazobactam

Teratology studies have been performed in mice and rats and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus when piperacillin/tazobactam is administered intravenously up to a dose of 3000/750 mg/kg piperacillin/tazobactam which is 1 to 2 times and 2 to 3 times the human dose of piperacillin and tazobactam, respectively, based on body-surface area (mg/m²).

Piperacillin and tazobactam cross the placenta in humans.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies with the piperacillin/tazobactam combination or with piperacillin or tazobactam alone in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Piperacillin is excreted in low concentrations in human milk; tazobactam concentrations in human milk have not been studied. Caution should be exercised when piperacillin and tazobactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Use of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in pediatric patients 2 months of age or older with appendicitis and/or peritonitis is supported by evidence from well-controlled studies and pharmacokinetic studies in adults and in pediatric patients. This includes a prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label clinical trial with 542 pediatric patients 2–12 years of age with complicated intra-abdominal infections, in which 273 pediatric patients received piperacillin/tazobactam. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients less than 2 months of age have not been established [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) and Dosage and Administration (2)].

It has not been determined how to adjust piperacillin and tazobactam for injection dosage in pediatric patients with renal impairment.

### Current evidence for therapy of ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacteremia [^115ee7JW]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article aims to give a state-of-the-art assessment of treatment options for bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, especially those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. In particular, this review assesses whether current data support 'carbapenem-sparing options' for treatment of these serious infections.

Recent Findings

The MERINO trial refuted earlier observational studies some of which showed equivalence in outcomes between beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and carbapenems for treatment of bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. Although numerous factors influence mortality following bloodstream infection, the variability in piperacillin/tazobactam MICs observed in the MERINO trial make this a less secure option than meropenem. However, the search for carbapenem-sparing options continues with four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in progress and a number of other options in clinical development.

Summary

Hard outcomes from RCTs are still needed before intravenous carbapenems can be displaced as the treatment of choice for ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

### Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^1121bwaS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Group 2 (classes A and D) represent the largest group of beta-lactamases, it includes ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenemases (class A) and OXA beta-lactamases (class D).

ESBL are enzymes capable of hydrolyzing and inactivating a wide variety of beta-lactams, including third-generation cephalosporins, penicillins, and aztreonam. Most ESBLs of clinical interest are encoded by genes located on plasmids. These plasmids may also carry genes encoding resistance to other multiple drug classes including aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

The main ESBL enzymes imparting antibiotic resistance are TEM-, SHV-, and CTX-M.

Although hyperproduction of beta-lactamases or additional resistance mechanisms may hamper the antibiotic effectiveness, most TEM, SHV and CTX-M variants remain susceptible in vitro to beta-lactam/beta-lactam inhibitor combinations (BLBLI) such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or piperacillin-tazobactam. However, the efficacy of BLBLI for treating serious ESBL infections is controversial. For example, the increase in piperacillin/tazobactam MICs when bacterial inocula reach 10 7 colony forming units/mL is concerning, and may indicate the presence of other mechanisms of resistance. Furthermore, in critically ill patients the pharmacokinetic properties of beta-lactams are modified and these patients may have adverse outcomes as a result of sub-optimal antibiotic exposure.

### Carbapenem therapy is associated with improved survival compared with piperacillin-tazobactam for patients with extended-spectrum β-lactamase bacteremia [^113h8EBp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) bacteremia is controversial. We compared 14-day mortality of PTZ vs carbapenems as empiric therapy in a cohort of patients with ESBL bacteremia who all received definitive therapy with a carbapenem.

Methods

Patients hospitalized between January 2007 and April 2014 with monomicrobial ESBL bacteremia were included. A decrease of > 3 doubling dilutions in the minimum inhibitory concentration for third-generation cephalosporins tested in combination with 4 µg/mL of clavulanic acid was used to confirm ESBL status. The primary exposure was empiric therapy, defined as antibiotic therapy administered to a patient before ESBL status was known. Patients were excluded if they did not receive a carbapenem after ESBL production was identified. The primary outcome was time to death from the first day of bacteremia. Propensity scores using inverse probability of exposure weighting (IPW) were used to estimate the probability that a patient would receive PTZ vs carbapenems empirically. We calculated overall hazard ratios for mortality censored at 14 days using Cox proportional hazards models on an IPW-adjusted cohort.

Results

A total of 331 unique patients with ESBL bacteremia were identified. One hundred three (48%) patients received PTZ empirically and 110 (52%) received carbapenems empirically. The adjusted risk of death was 1.92 times higher for patients receiving empiric PTZ compared with empiric carbapenem therapy (95% confidence interval, 1.07–3.45).

Conclusions

PTZ appears inferior to carbapenems for the treatment of ESBL bacteremia. For patients at high risk of invasive ESBL infections, early carbapenem therapy should be considered. Our findings should not be extended to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in development, as limited clinical data are available for these agents.

### Overview of changes in the clinical and laboratory standards institute performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing: M100 32nd and 33rd editions [^114wTf5y]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2010, CLSI lowered the Enterobacterales cephalosporin and carbapenem breakpoints, eliminating the requirement to perform specific resistance mechanism identification for ESBLs or carbapenemase producers for laboratories that adopted the lower breakpoints. At the time, the lower breakpoints were considered sufficient to accurately detect wild-type organisms lacking acquired resistance mechanisms. However, with the publication of the MERINO trial data that focused on infections caused by ESBL-producing isolates of Enterobacterales and the development of new antimicrobials that target specific mechanisms of resistance, the need to identify the mechanism of certain types of resistance has resurfaced. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated its treatment guidelines to reflect these newer developments and made therapeutic recommendations based on the known presence of a specific resistance mechanism. The M100 33rd edition provides a comment in Table 2A, pointing the laboratory user to consult with ASP when deciding whether to perform phenotypic or genotypic testing for ESBLs to guide therapeutic management. Laboratories may still choose to report ESBLs for infection control or epidemiological purposes but may also report for therapeutic decisions. A similar comment concerning carbapenemase producers was also added to the carbapenem section of M100 Table 2A.

There are several factors that need to be taken into consideration before implementing these new testing and reporting recommendations. One such consideration is whether the laboratory has the workflow and methodology capabilities to assess ESBL and carbapenem resistance mechanisms — either by phenotypic or genotypic methods. False-negative results of phenotypic ESBL testing have been observed due to the coproduction of AmpC beta-lactamases, and false-positive results have occurred among isolates with multiple mechanisms of resistance. Phenotypic testing may require additional setup and incubation times and lead to a longer time to results compared to genotypic testing. Certain tests are limited to select species of Enterobacterales, and laboratories using commercial systems may have additional reporting limitations. One must also consider how to report the resistance mechanism accurately and clearly in the laboratory report so that it conveys the correct message to the clinician treating the patient. It is important to note that CLSI M100 does not include specific treatment recommendations. The IDSA treatment guidelines recommend that piperacillin-tazobactam should not be used for ESBL-producing isolates of Enterobacterales, even if the antimicrobial tests are susceptible; however, there is no guidance in the M100 33rd edition that recommends hiding susceptible piperacillin-tazobactam results or changing the interpretation to resistant when an ESBL is detected. These decisions are institution-specific and are to be discussed in collaboration with the laboratory and relevant stakeholders.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^116dyLM8]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Further addressing the question of whether PTZ is clinically as efficacious as carbapenems in the treatment of bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing organisms, investigators compared 14-day mortality when PTZ versus a carbapenem was used as empiric therapy (defined in this trial as antibiotic therapy administered to a patient before their ESBL status was known) in a cohort of 331 patients with ESBL bacteremia who received definitive therapy with a carbapenem. The adjusted risk of death was 1.9 times higher for patients receiving empiric PTZ compared with empiric carbapenem (95% confidence interval 1.07–3.45).

It is important to acknowledge that the data regarding the role of PTZ in the treatment of ESBL-producing bacteria may not be an accurate predictor of how new β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. avibactam or relebactam) or new combinations (e.g. ceftolozane/tazobactam) may perform in the treatment of these infections. Ceftolozane/tazobactam in combination with metronidazole was shown to be noninferior to meropenem in a multinational, double-blind randomized phase 3 trial of adult patients hospitalized with complicated intraabdominal infections. Of the isolated pathogens, 7.2% were ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and for this group of patients clinical cure rates were 95.8% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 88.5% in the meropenem group. Similar findings were reported from a randomized trial of adult patients hospitalized with complicated lower urinary tract infections or pyelonephritis, in which 7.6% of the isolated pathogens were ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

### Impact of a restrictive antibiotic policy on the acquisition of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in an endemic region: a before-and-after, propensity-matched cohort study in a caribbean intensive care unit [^114sNkEj]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study provides interesting data from a restrictive antibiotic stewardship program in the ICU, with a particular emphasis on ESBL-E acquisition. An important finding was a reduction in ESBL-E acquisition with no excess in the mortality rate in the context of high prevalence in an endemic region, such as the French West Indies. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing a significant reduction of the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including in the ICU setting, following the implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs. The lower acquisition rate in our ICU was associated with a significant reduction of the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, mainly piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenem and, more generally, antibiotics targeting anaerobic microbiota. Several authors have reported the role of antibiotic therapies with activity against anaerobic microbiota, as well as the beta-lactamase inhibitor, in the acquisition of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including ESBL-E. Furthermore, preserving the microbiota against antibiotics is one of the key strategies against ESBL-E acquisition.

The reluctance of ICU physicians to rationalize antibiotic use is often a major limitation in stewardship programs. We were able to overcome this unwillingness in our ICU, resulting in a significant reduction in global antibiotic consumption, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, a shorter duration of therapy and an increased use of narrow-spectrum molecules. Interestingly, we observed a decrease in the consumption of carbapenems in the RSP, even though the prevalence of ESBL-E was high. The precise cause of the lower incidence of ESBL-E acquisition in the RSP is difficult to determine, but the decrease in the use of piperacillin/tazobactam may have played a role, as well as the choice of alternative antibiotics, such as cefoxitin. In the RSP, antibiotic duration was reduced by one day, although the baseline duration was already short. This is consistent with the current trend of a shorter treatment duration for infections such as VAP, intra-abdominal infections or bacteremia. Discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in the case of negative microbiological cultures could also explain the short treatment duration, especially in VAP. Antibiotic duration is frequently longer than recommended in clinical practice, despite no better outcome and the likely promotion of bacterial or fungal superinfections. Indeed, Daneman and colleagues showed that up to two-thirds of ICU patients with bacteremia did not receive a short course as recommended.

### In vitro and in vivo activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem at different inoculum sizes of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [^112D1jmw]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The inoculum effect is a laboratory phenomenon in which the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic is increased when a large number of organisms are exposed. Due to the emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kpn) infections, the inoculum effect of ESBL-Kpn on β-lactams was studied in vitro and in vivo using an experimental model of pneumonia. The in vitro inoculum effect of 45 clinical ESBL-Kpn isolates on β-lactams was evaluated at standard (10⁵ CFU/mL) and high (10⁷ CFU/mL) organism concentrations. The MIC50 of piperacillin-tazobactam, cefotaxime and cefepime was increased eight-fold or more and that of meropenem was increased two-fold. The in vivo inoculum effect was evaluated in an ESBL-Kpn pneumonia mouse model treated with bacteriostatic effect-adjusted doses of piperacillin-tazobactam (1000 mg/kg four times daily, %T > MIC; 32.60%) or meropenem (100 mg/kg twice daily, %T > MIC; 28.65%) at low/standard (10⁴ CFU/mouse) and high (10⁶ CFU/mouse) inocula. In mice administered a low inoculum, no mice died after treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem, whereas all the control mice died. In contrast, in the high inoculum model, all mice in the piperacillin-tazobactam-treated group died, whereas all meropenem-treated mice survived and had a decreased bacterial load in the lungs and no invasion into the blood. In conclusion, meropenem was more resistant to the inoculum effect of ESBL-Kpn than piperacillin-tazobactam both in vitro and in vivo. In the management of severe pneumonia caused by ESBL-Kpn, carbapenems may be the drugs of choice to achieve a successful outcome.

### What contributes to the minimum inhibitory concentration? Beyond β-lactamase gene detection in Klebsiella pneumoniae [^111maHSV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Against ceftolozane-tazobactam, factors important for resistant MICs included pAmpC production regardless of porin status, ESBL production in the setting of porin loss, and elevated expression of the chromosomal SHV. Against piperacillin-tazobactam, resistance patterns were variable in the clinical isolates with no one mechanism clearly contributing to the MIC. However, piperacillin-tazobactam MICs for the clones deficient in porin production but producing an ESBL resulted in a resistant phenotype. To date, few studies have directly examined the contribution of CMY-2 or DHA to ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance. A survey of British isolates revealed 51% susceptibility to ceftolozane-tazobactam among K pneumoniae with a PCR-identified pAmpC β-lactamase, 24 of 26 of which were DHA. A more recent survey of ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance in the United States focused largely on ESBL-producing isolates, but did note ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance in a DHA-producing Enterobacter sp. Nonsusceptibility to ceftolozane-tazobactam in these species has concerning implications for use of the β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination in treating pAmpC-producing organisms.

Survey of ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance in the United States has repeatedly demonstrated the involvement of ESBLs in ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance, with no difference in the porin protein sequences among susceptible and nonsusceptible isolates. The data presented in this study indicate that piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance only occurs in ESBL-producing isolates when outer membrane porins are lost. Studies using isogenic clones have supported the combination of CTX-M-15 and decreased permeability (porin loss and efflux) associated with ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance. While phenotypic testing would identify a susceptible or resistant phenotype, molecular screening alone could not correctly identify resistant isolates as testing for porin loss in clinical laboratories is unavailable. The other β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations tested remained active against these isolates, suggesting that these antibiotics would be a better choice in treating ESBL-producing K pneumoniae.

The findings from this study suggest that an even more sophisticated method of optimization may be necessary in selected patients - patient-tailored antibiotic therapy - which is the adaptation of antibiotic therapy to the need of the individual patient in order to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity through therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adaptation. Unfortunately, TDM of β-lactam antibiotics is currently challenging with long turnaround times, expensive equipment, logistical problems related to the instability of the antibiotics in the samples and the need for well-trained personnel. Efforts to overcome these limitations, and clinical studies to assess utility in the clinical setting are urgently needed.

### Role of new antibiotics in extended-spectrum β-lactamase-, ampC-infections [^115r43rh]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)- and ampicillinase class C (AmpC)-producing Enterobacterales represent one of the major public threats of the current era. As a consequence, during the last decades there have been great efforts to develop new therapeutic agents against these microorganisms. The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical features associated with novel antibiotics with activity against ESBL- and AmpC-producing isolates.

Recent Findings

There a number of therapeutic agents with activity against ESBL and AmpC than have been introduced and approved over the past few years. Ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam are both carbapenem sparing agents that appear interesting alternatives for treatment of serious Gram-negative infections. Other new β-lactams/ β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. cefepime-enmetazobactam; ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam; aztreonam-avibactam and cefepime-zidebactam) as well as eravacycline, omadacycline, and plazomicin are also promising agents for treatment of ESBL- and AmpC- infections, but further clinical data are needed to establish their efficacy in comparison to carbapenems. The role of carbapenems/ β-lactamase inhibitors remains to be clarified.

Summary

New therapeutic agents against ESBL- and AmpC-producing Enterobacterales have distinctive specificities and limitations that require further investigations. Future randomized clinical trials are required to define the best strategy for their use in patients with serious infections due to ESBL- and/or AmpC- infections.

Ticarcillin–clavulanic acid — evidence and availability for intra-abdominal infection (IAI): Since 2000, only one small randomized controlled trial (RCT) has evaluated this agent, showing no significant difference versus ertapenem but with only 11 clinically evaluable patients receiving ticarcillin–clavulanic acid. Contemporary activity data are limited; in vitro susceptibility of P. aeruginosa has declined, and activity against MDR organisms such as A. baumannii and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is less than ampicillin/sulbactam and piperacillin–tazobactam, respectively. Ticarcillin–clavulanic acid is no longer available in the United States. The task force concluded it was acceptable for empiric treatment of patients with IAI, although other agents would be preferable because of the lack of contemporary efficacy data, and this is moot unless production resumes.

### WSES / GAIS / SIS-E / WSIS / AAST global clinical pathways for patients with intra-abdominal infections [^113QqYWi]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Among Gram-positive bacteria, enterococci may play a significant role in IAIs. Some studies have demonstrated poor outcomes among patients with documented enterococcal infections, particularly in those with post-operative IAIs where enterococci coverage should be always considered.

The acquisition of glycopeptide resistance by enterococci has seriously affected the treatment and control of these organisms. Affected patients usually have multiple and relevant co-morbidities, with prolonged hospital stay and received long courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

IAIs may be managed by either single or multiple antibiotic regimens. Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, including, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, have an in vitro activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. Increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae worldwide, during the last decade, has compromised the clinical utility of this agent for empiric therapy of serious Gram-negative infections and therefore should be used based on local rates of resistance. Broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam, including anti-pseudomonal and anaerobic coverage, still make it an attractive option in the management of severe IAIs.

Most isolates of E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae remain susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins and in combination with metronidazole and may be options for empiric therapy of non-severe IAIs. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) have been widely used in the treatment of IAIs because of their excellent activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and tissue penetration. In recent years, the resistance of E. coli to FQ has risen over time. The worldwide increase in FQ resistance among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae has limited the use of FQ for empirical treatment of IAIs.

For decades, carbapenems have been the antibiotics of first choice for ESBLs. The best option for targeting ESBLs (although lacking coverage of P. aeruginosa) is ertapenem, a once-daily administered carbapenem that otherwise shares the activity of imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem against most species, including ESBL producing pathogens. Imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, and doripenem provide coverage for Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). The use of carbapenems should be limited to preserve the activity of this class of antibiotics because of the concern of emerging carbapenem resistance.

### The management of multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae [^114vyj9X]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae are often related to the production of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and represent an increasing global threat. Recommendations for the therapeutic management of MDR-related infections, however, are mainly derived from retrospective and nonrandomized prospective studies. The aim of this review is to discuss the challenges in the treatment of patients with infections because of MDR Enterobacteriaceae and provide an expert opinion while awaiting for more definitive data.

Recent Findings

To avoid the selection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-sparing strategies should be considered. B-lactams/b-lactamase inhibitors, mainly piperacillin-tazobactam, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 16/4mg/ml or less represents the best alternative to carbapenems for the treatment of ESBL-producing strains. Overall, combination therapy may be preferred over monotherapy for CRE. The combination of a carbapenem-containing regimen with colistin or high-dose tigecycline or aminoglycoside can be administered at high-dose prolonged infusion with therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of CRE with MIC for meropenem 8–16 mg/l or less. For MIC higher than 8–16 mg/l, the use of meropenem should be avoided and various combination therapies based on the in-vitro susceptibility of antimicrobials (e.g., colistin, high-dose tigecycline, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides) should be selected.

Summary

Carbapenem-sparing strategies should be used, when feasible, for ESBL infections. The majority of available nonrandomized studies highlight that combination for CRE seem to offer some therapeutic advantage over monotherapy. Strict infection control measures toward MDR Gram-negative pathogens remain necessary while awaiting for new treatment options.

### The ideal patient profile for new β-lactam / β-lactamase inhibitors [^112M6sS8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The worldwide spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria, the overuse of carbapenems, the emergence of carbapenemase-producing organisms and the growing importance of multidrug-resistant and/or extended drug-resistant strains have totally changed prescribers' habits, leading to very few treatment options in many cases. Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combinations should be considered as an alternative to carbapenems for treating ESBL-producing bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. The purpose of this study was to provide insight concerning the patients who would constitute ideal candidates to receive these new BLBLI combinations.

Recent Findings

Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are the first drugs constituting the use of new beta-lactamase inhibitors. Ceftolozane/tazobactam is the drug of choice for treating MDR/XDR P. aeruginosa infections. Ceftazidime/avibactam is the best drug available for treating KPC and OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are both carbapenem-sparing agents for treating ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The role of carbapenem/inhibitors remains to be clarified.

Summary

Each BLBLI combination has distinctive specificities and limitations that need to be investigated cautiously. Randomized trials will play a key role in defining the best strategies. Infection control measures and prompt diagnosis remain fundamental to prevent dissemination of MDR pathogens in healthcare settings and to optimize early antimicrobial treatment.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection

Question

What is the appropriate treatment of CAUTI in the critically ill patient?

Recommendation

Treatment for CAUTI should be targeted to the likely causative organisms, local antibiograms, and patient risk factors. In complicated UTI, 7 days of piperacillin-tazobactam, or meropenem if the risk of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers is high. Seldom are longer courses needed unless there is no symptomatic improvement within the first few days (then 10–14 days are required). The catheter should be removed or exchanged wherever possible.

Discussion

Note that the diagnosis of CAUTI should not be made on urinalysis alone and a positive urinalysis without symptoms or sepsis (per sepsis-3 guidelines) should not trigger treatment. Upper urinary tract symptoms include flank pain, costophrenic angle tenderness, shaking fever or chills, severe systemic symptoms. Choice of antibiotic will depend on clinical severity, previous antibiotic use, risk of resistant organisms, and clinical risk of deterioration, and local antibiograms. De-escalation of antibiotic treatment should also occur based on culture data. The catheter should be removed or exchanged wherever possible at the time infection is first suspected. Note that protocolized urine sampling, such as requiring a culture via new urine catheter or straight catheterization, has reduced the rate of CAUTI infection diagnosis by reducing the risk of contamination by colonization, however, it is unlikely that this practice completely eliminates colonization from the urinary specimen. There has been no update to the IDSA guidelines or significant new data since 2009.

### Is carbapenem therapy necessary for the treatment of non-CTX-M extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales bloodstream infections? [^116kBG74]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Investigations into antibiotics for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infections (BSIs) have focused on blaCTX-M genes. Patient outcomes from non-CTX-M-producing ESBL-E BSIs and optimal treatment are unknown.

Methods

A multicenter observational study investigating 500 consecutive patients with ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacterales BSIs during 2018–2022 was conducted. Broth microdilution and whole-genome sequencing confirmed antibiotic susceptibilities and ESBL gene presence, respectively. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) using propensity scores ensured patients with non-CTX-M and CTX-M ESBL-E BSIs were similar before outcome evaluation.

Results

396 patients (79.2%) were confirmed to have an ESBL-E BSI. ESBL gene family prevalence was as follows: blaCTX-M (n = 370), blaSHV (n = 16), blaOXY (n = 12), and blaVEB (n = 5). ESBL gene identification was not limited to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. In the IPW cohort, there was no difference in 30-day mortality or ESBL-E infection recurrence between the non-CTX-M and CTX-M groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval, .87–1.11; p = 0.83 and OR, 1.10; 95% CI, .85–1.42; p = 0.47, respectively). In an exploratory analysis limited to the non-CTX-M group, 86% of the 21 patients who received meropenem were alive on day 30; none of the 5 patients who received piperacillin-tazobactam were alive on day 30.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that non-CTX-M and CTX-M ESBL-E BSIs are equally concerning and associated with similar clinical outcomes. Meropenem may be associated with improved survival in patients with non-CTX-M ESBL-E BSIs, underscoring the potential benefit of comprehensive molecular diagnostics to enable early antibiotic optimization for ESBL-E BSIs beyond just blaCTX-M genes.

### Evaluation of piperacillin-tazobactam disks using contemporary enterobacterales isolates suggests the need for disk potency optimization [^116gzgD1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The 100 µg piperacillin CLSI disk potency was established shortly after the introduction of the antimicrobial in a 1979 study, where 100, 150, and 200 µg disk potencies were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus isolates. At the time, a 100 µg carbenicillin disk was standard for testing Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas, which prompted studies to assess susceptibility testing methods for novel, extended-spectrum penicillins in the same potency range. The subsequent TZP disk optimized the tazobactam content relative to a fixed potency of 100 µg piperacillin. Both piperacillin and TZP disk potencies were optimized prior to the widespread prevalence of ESBLs. Given today's drastically different epidemiological landscape of resistance mechanisms, there is a dire need for the piperacillin and TZP disk potency to be re-evaluated against a diverse, contemporary collection of clinical isolates.

### Β-lactam / β-lactam inhibitor combinations for the treatment of bacteremia due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli: a post hoc analysis of prospective cohorts [^1133TdVc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Extended-spectrum ß-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) is an important cause of invasive infections. Alternatives to carbapenems — considered the drugs of choice — are needed because of the emergence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteria. The efficacy of ß-lactam/ß-lactam inhibitors (BLBLI) in such infections is controversial.

Methods

The authors performed a post hoc analysis of patients with bloodstream infections due to ESBL-EC from 6 published prospective cohorts. Mortality and length of hospital stay in patients treated with an active BLBLI (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [AMC] and piperacillin-tazobactam [PTZ]) or carbapenem were compared in 2 cohorts: the empirical therapy cohort (ETC) and the definitive therapy cohort (DTC). Confounding was controlled by multivariate analysis; for patients in the ETC, a propensity score for receiving carbapenem was also used.

Results

The ETC included 103 patients (BLBLI, 72; carbapenem, 31), and the DTC included 174 (BLBLI, 54; carbapenem, 120). Mortality rates at day 30 for those treated with BLBLI versus carbapenems were 9.7% versus 19.4% for the ETC and 9.3% versus 16.7% for the DTC, respectively (P > .2, log-rank test). After adjustment for confounders, no association was found between either empirical therapy with BLBLI (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval, .29–4.40; p = 0.84) or definitive therapy (adjusted HR, 0.76; 95% CI, .28–2.07; p = 0.5) and increased mortality. Furthermore, BLBLI therapy, with respect to carbapenem, was not found to influence length of hospital stay.

Conclusions

These results suggest that AMC and PTZ are suitable alternatives to carbapenems for treating patients with bloodstream infections due to ESBL-EC if active in vitro and would be particularly useful as definitive therapy.

### Tazobactam selects for multidrug resistance [^113rVfaA]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Piperacillin-tazobactam is one of the most prescribed antibiotic treatments in hospital medicine and is on the WHO list of essential medicines. The combination is used to treat a wide range of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections and skin and soft tissue infections. Beta-lactam antibiotics such as piperacillin disrupt peptidoglycan synthesis, an essential component of the bacterial cell envelope. Piperacillin is a ureidopenicillin and resistance to this class of antibiotic can be conferred by genes coding for β-lactamases, which cleave the β-lactam ring, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. To prevent the activity of β-lactamases, β-lactam antibiotics can be given in conjunction with a β-lactamase inhibitor, such as tazobactam. These inhibit β-lactamase enzymes so that the activity of the antibiotic is protected. Extensive research has been conducted on how the cell responds to treatment with β-lactam antibiotics, including piperacillin. However, relatively little work has focussed on how bacteria respond to β-lactamase inhibitors, including tazobactam, and whether these compounds have any significant activity beyond their interactions with β-lactamases.

Large-scale genomic screens have previously been used to identify the extended complement of genes and pathways that affect susceptibility to various antibiotics, and this work has often identified many genes that influence susceptibility beyond the principal target. We have developed one such method, TraDIS- Xpress, where massively dense transposon mutant libraries investigate bacterial loci involved in responses to stress. These libraries make use of a transposon-encoded outward-transcribing inducible promoter, which allows changes in gene expression as well as gene disruption to be assayed for roles in survival under a given stress. This provides information about essential genes, which are often targets for antibiotics. We have recently used this approach to identify known and unknown mechanisms of action and resistance to triclosan, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones, meropenem, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole.

### A multicenter study on optimizing piperacillin-tazobactam use: lessons on why interventions fail [^111gdruY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

We examined interventions to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam use at 4 hospitals. Interventions for rotating house staff did not affect use. We could target empiric therapy in only 35% of cases. Because prescribing practices seemed to be institution specific, interventions should address attitudes of local prescribers. Interventions should target empiric therapy and ordering of appropriate cultures.

Piperacillin–tazobactam — evidence base for intra-abdominal infection (IAI): Piperacillin–tazobactam is a commonly used agent for treating patients with IAI and has been recommended in previous guidelines for higher-risk patients or those with higher severity infections. Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing this agent with other regimens for IAI have been published since 2000, and there were no significant differences in clinical success rates versus various comparators; eight other trials were reviewed previously, including one in severely ill patients comparing piperacillin–tazobactam with the combination of this agent plus an aminoglycoside.

### Efficacy of carbapenems compared with noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial antibiotic therapy against sepsis: a nationwide observational study [^112f2Nh3]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. Despite the progress made in medical management over the past few decades, sepsis remains an important global health problem causing millions of deaths around the world. One essential facet of sepsis management is the administration of appropriate antimicrobials. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that failure or delay in the administration of appropriate antimicrobials is associated with substantial increases in the mortality of sepsis. On the basis of the evidence, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommended empiric broad-spectrum therapy to cover all likely pathogens as soon as possible after sepsis is recognized.

Broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics are commonly used as empiric therapy for sepsis. Among them, carbapenems offer an exceptionally broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. The existing evidence suggests that carbapenems are associated with relatively low mortality in several infectious diseases, especially those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens. For these reasons, carbapenems are the preferably used antibiotics for the initial treatment of sepsis, and consumption of carbapenem has been reported to be increasing in different parts of the world. However, indiscriminate use of carbapenems against sepsis should be avoided because it has contributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, updating knowledge on the efficacy of alternative empiric regimens for sepsis is required.

The fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime and cefpirome, and piperacillin/tazobactam are nearly equal to carbapenems in antimicrobial activity and thus are considered alternative therapies against sepsis. Previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of carbapenems compared with these antibiotics against several specific pathogens, such as Acinetobacter species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. However, there is little evidence of the efficacy of carbapenems against unidentified mixed pathogens. Causative pathogens are not usually identified at the time of initiating antibiotics in sepsis because of the strong recommendation to initiate immediate treatment, ideally within 1 hour after sepsis is first suspected. Thus, there is a significant need to comprehensively evaluate differences in mortality and morbidities between carbapenems versus noncarbapenem broad-spectrum antibiotics as initial treatment of sepsis, including various underlying infectious diseases and causative pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate mortality and morbidities in patients with community-acquired sepsis treated with carbapenems as initial antibiotic therapy compared with those treated with noncarbapenem antibiotics.

### The role of early use of carbapenems perioperatively for urolithiasis with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli [^1125k61s]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

As seen in Tables 3 and 4, under the premise of preoperative regular use for 72 h of non-Carbapenem antibiotics, the rate of adverse reaction for Group I was higher than that of Group II, regardless of the incidence of sepsis or qSOFA score. Therefore, the selection of reasonable antibiotics during the perioperative period is especially important for ESBL-producing E. coli infections. It has been reported that compared to non-β-lactamase/β-lactamase inhibitors, Carbapenems are only considered the drugs of choice for serious infections with ESBL-producing E. coli organisms. A recent study showed that Carbapenem was not significantly superior to Cefepime or Piperacillin-Tazobactam for ESBL-producing E. coli infections in patients with hematological malignancy, but the sample size was relatively low. Based on the incidence of urosepsis and susceptibility test, the results of the current study revealed that Carbapenems were significantly better than β-lactamase inhibitors in the treatment of urolithiasis patients with urinary tract ESBL-producing E. coli infections.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam versus carbapenems in non-bacteremic UTI due to-ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae (CAPITIS) [^111hPdn9]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Overview This study evaluates the efficacy in achieving clinical cure in non-bacteremic urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae producers of extended-spectrum β-lactamases in adult patients. Half of participants will receive Piperacillin/Tazobactam as treatment, while the other half will receive Carbapenems. Currently the appropriate treatment of UTI is a growing concern in the medical community because Gram-negative, specifically Enterobacteriaceae, bacteria have acquired genes encoding antibiotic resistance mechanisms. The β-lactamase spread spectrum are documented with increasing frequency among microorganisms causing UTI. Current treatment options for ESBL bacteria include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides.

The investigators will compare between piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems the effectiveness in achieving clinical cure for non-bacteremic UTI caused by ESBL microorganisms. Researchers principal hypothesis is that Piperacillin/tazobactam is not inferior to carbapenems in achieving clinical cure in the targeted treatment of UTI caused by non-bacteremic due to E. coli or K. pneumoniae ESBL in adults requiring hospitalization.
- Adults with hospital admission for non-bacteremic UTI caused by E. coli or K. pneumoniae ESBL susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems.
- **Presence of any risk factor associated with UTI due to ESBL germs**: older age 64 years, diabetes mellitus, bladder catheter, previous antibiotics in the last 6 months, hospitalization in the last 6 months, urological surgery in the last 30 days, infections recurrent urinary.
- **Diagnosis of UTI confirmed by**: 1) fever, 2) urine culture > 100000 CFU with isolation E. coli or K.

pneumoniae ESBL susceptible to piperacillin / tazobactam and carbapenems, and 3) lumbar and / or abdominal pain with or without low urinary symptoms, and 4) no other cause that explains the patient's symptoms.
- Empirical active treatment against bacteria isolated by urine cultures other than E. coli or K. pneumoniae BLEE.
- Participation in another clinical trial for infections.
- Hypersensitivity to amide-type local anesthetics.
