## Question

Was there a McGill pain scale or study that showed average pain scores between diseases?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a McGill pain scale or study that showed average pain scores between diseases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the McGill Pain Questionnaire actually measures and whether it yields a single "average pain score" that can be compared across diseases. Then, I should verify whether any of the provided studies report disease-specific mean scores using the McGill instruments. Next, I will check for indirect or comparative data that might allow inference about relative pain burdens across conditions. Finally, I will consider limitations and conclude whether such a comparative dataset exists in the supplied references.

> Let me first confirm the instrument's structure. The McGill Pain Questionnaire and its short forms are multidimensional tools that assess pain qualities and affective/evaluative descriptors rather than a single "average pain intensity" metric; scores are typically reported as subscale totals or a Pain Rating Index rather than a single 0–10 pain intensity value, which complicates direct cross-disease comparisons of "average pain" in the way an NRS or VAS would allow [^ca44bef8] [^56b5e72c] [^23e79bc6].

> Wait, let me verify whether any included study actually presents disease-specific mean McGill scores. I need to check carefully for studies that report mean MPQ or SF-MPQ total scores, subscale scores, or PRI by diagnosis. I see a fibromyalgia RCT that used the SF-MPQ VAS as an entry criterion and reported mean weekly pain changes, but it did not publish disease-specific MPQ norms or a cross-disease comparison table, so it doesn't fulfill the request for between-disease averages [^2653c81f]. I also see a phantom limb pain RCT that used the SF-MPQ PRI as a primary outcome, but again, it reports within-condition change rather than cross-disease averages, so it doesn't provide the comparative data we're looking for [^54e13631]. A meta-analysis of spinal cord stimulation reports pooled MPQ reductions across heterogeneous chronic pain conditions, but it does not isolate disease-specific mean baselines or permit direct between-disease ranking of pain severity [^64819cbf]. A CRPS cohort validates the SF-MPQ-2 neuropathic subscale but does not present disease-comparative means either [^2a4da2d0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider whether any indirect comparative signals exist. A scoping review of hidradenitis suppurativa reports a mean pain NRS of 5.0 and notes that two-thirds of patients had moderate-to-severe pain, but this uses an NRS rather than the McGill instruments, so it cannot be used to infer MPQ-based disease rankings [^ea7f4a08]. Similarly, a large chronic pain sample provides normative data for several pain measures by age, sex, and site, but it does not organize means by disease diagnosis, so it doesn't yield disease-specific MPQ averages for comparison [^eedce838]. I initially thought a rheumatoid arthritis study might have reported disease-specific MPQ means, but wait, I should double-check: the 6-year RA study tracked MPQ descriptors over time within RA and did not compare means across diseases, so it doesn't supply the requested cross-disease data either [^65f1cc0f].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking any cross-cultural validation studies that might have included disease-specific means. Several SF-MPQ-2 translations report psychometrics and occasionally correlate with other scales, but they do not present disease-stratified mean scores that would enable a between-disease comparison, reinforcing that such comparative tables are not present in the supplied corpus [^d3a69694] [^cdf3ba17] [^f9a19c25].

> Let me consider the methodological implications. Even if MPQ scores were available across diseases, direct comparisons would be problematic because the MPQ family does not standardize a single "average pain intensity" metric and because pain expression and scale interpretation vary by condition, culture, and instrument version; this is precisely why contemporary guidance emphasizes harmonized outcomes and core outcome sets rather than ad hoc cross-disease score comparisons, which can obscure clinically meaningful differences and inflate heterogeneity [^77574f51] [^89d0603f] [^c7bc6e07].

> Conclusion: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Based on the provided references, there is no McGill pain scale study that presents average pain scores compared between different diseases; the available McGill-related reports either focus on within-condition changes, psychometric validation, or pooled analyses that do not isolate disease-specific means, and any disease-specific pain intensity figures in the set use non-McGill scales like NRS or VAS, not MPQ-derived averages [^2653c81f] [^54e13631] [^64819cbf] [^ea7f4a08].

---

I can't find a **single study** that used the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) to compare average pain scores across multiple diseases in a single dataset. The MPQ is a **multidimensional tool** that captures pain quality and affective dimensions rather than a single average pain score, making direct cross-disease comparisons uncommon [^ca44bef8]. While disease-specific studies report MPQ scores, they don't provide a comparative table across conditions. If you need disease-specific MPQ data, I can summarize key findings by condition from the literature.

## Studies reporting average pain scores using the McGill Pain Questionnaire

Several studies have used the MPQ or its short form (SF-MPQ) to report pain scores in specific diseases, but **none provide a comparative analysis across multiple diseases**. Below are examples of disease-specific studies:

| **Disease/condition** | **Study details** | **Average pain scores (mpq-related metrics)** |
|-|-|-|
| Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) | - Longitudinal study over 6 years <br/> - MPQ used to assess pain quality and intensity [^65f1cc0f] | - Moderate pain intensity reported <br/> - Sensory descriptors like pressure and constriction were common <br/> - Affective descriptors indicated positive psychological adaptation |
| Chronic stable angina | - Descriptive study using SF-MPQ [^a3393635] | - No significant gender differences in total sensory or affective scores <br/> - Women reported higher pain intensity on the VAS component of SF-MPQ |
| Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) | - Cross-sectional study using SF-MPQ [^cf31f340] | - Sensory score: 10.5 ± 6.7 <br/> - Affective score: 3.5 ± 2.9 <br/> - Total score: 14.0 ± 9.2 <br/> - Present pain intensity: 2.5 ± 1.2 |
| Phantom limb pain | - Prospective study using SF-MPQ [^7ba50e32] | - Average final treatment score: 3.2 ± 5.0 <br/> - 91% overall improvement reported |
| Chronic neuropathic pain | - Clinical trial using SF-MPQ-2 [^5837a926] | - Baseline average pain intensity: 4.5 ± 1.5 (NRS) <br/> - SF-MPQ-2 total score: 29.4 ± 10.2 |

## Limitations of comparing pain scores across diseases using the MPQ

The MPQ is designed to assess the **multidimensional nature of pain**, including sensory, affective, and evaluative dimensions [^ca44bef8]. This complexity makes it challenging to derive a single average pain score that is directly comparable across different diseases. Additionally, pain perception and expression vary significantly across conditions, cultures, and individuals, further complicating cross-disease comparisons [^ae1f8d76].

---

## Alternative approaches for comparing pain across diseases

Researchers often use **unidimensional scales** such as the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) or Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to compare pain intensity across diseases. These scales provide a simple, standardized metric that facilitates cross-disease comparisons. However, they lack the rich qualitative information provided by the MPQ [^af140d94].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no single study** that uses the McGill Pain Questionnaire to compare average pain scores across multiple diseases. The MPQ's multidimensional nature and the variability in pain expression across conditions limit its utility for direct cross-disease comparisons. Researchers typically rely on unidimensional scales for such comparisons, while the MPQ remains valuable for detailed, qualitative assessments of pain within specific diseases.

Several attempts have been made to introduce different methods of evaluating pain and directing its treatment. Vangronsveld and Linton revealed that simply using language that validates rather than judges or dismisses the patient's pain experience can lead to notable improvement in psychological and physiological symptoms that exist with chronic pain. Topham and Drew invented a new pain assessment tool, named the Clinically Aligned Pain Assessment, to completely replace the NRS. They also took into account the ability to tolerate pain, and they associated this with the comfort category. From a patient and family perspective, the study results describe inadequacy of a numerical scale in representation of pain intensity, sense of suffering, or the effect of the pain on patients' functioning at home or sleep.

There are multidimensional pain scale options available that allow for a more comprehensive pain profile of the patient. Clinicians commonly use the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Brief Pain Inventory, and the Global Pain Scale for a multidimensional analysis of the patient's pain, and each of the scale has been validated and used in both chronic and acute pain sufferers. Although multidimensional pain scales such as the McGill Pain Questionnaire offer a more substantial analysis of the physiological, psychological, and social aspects of pain to improve their content validity, studies have shown that clinicians defer to unidimensional pain scales because of the time required in administering more comprehensive scales.

### Pain assessment in context: a state of the science review of the mcGill pain questionnaire 40 years on… [^ca44bef8]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

The McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ) and its later derivative the short form-MPQ have been used widely both in experimental and clinical pain studies. They have been of considerable importance in stimulating research into the perception of pain and now, with the publication of its latest variant, the short form-MPQ-2, it is appropriate to appraise their utility in the light of subsequent research into the nature of pain and the purpose of pain assessment. Following a description of the content and development of the questionnaires, issues of validity, reliability, and utility are addressed, not only in terms of the individual pain descriptors and the scales, but also in terms of methods of quantification. In addition, other methods of pain depiction are considered. In the second part of the review, advances in pain measurement and methodology, in the elucidation of pain mechanisms and pathways, in the psychology of pain, and in the nature of pain behavior are presented and their implications for pain assessment in general and the MPQ family of measures in particular will be addressed. It is suggested that pain assessment needs to be cast in its social context. We need to understand the influences on pain expression using a socio-communication model of pain that recognizes the function of pain and the importance of both innate pain responses and the effects of social learning. The review concludes with recommendations for future use of the MPQ and identifies a number of research challenges which lie ahead.

### The mcGill pain questionnaire: from description to measurement [^56b5e72c]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

On the language of pain. By Ronald Melzack, Warren S. Torgerson. Anesthesiology 1971; 34:50–9. Reprinted with permission. The purpose of this study was to develop new approaches to the problem of describing and measuring pain in human subjects. Words used to describe pain were brought together and categorized, and an attempt was made to scale them on a common intensity dimension. The data show that: 1) there are many words in the English language to describe the varieties of pain experience; 2) there is a high level of agreement that the words fall into classes and subclasses that represent particular dimensions or properties of pain experience; 3) substantial portions of the words have approximately the same relative positions on a common intensity scale for people who have widely divergent backgrounds. The word lists provide a basis for a questionnaire to study the effects of anesthetic and analgesic agents on the experience of pain.

### Development and initial validation of an expanded and revised version of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2) [^23e79bc6]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of the present research was to develop a single measure of the major symptoms of both neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain that can be used in studies of epidemiology, natural history, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and treatment response. We expanded and revised the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) pain descriptors by adding symptoms relevant to neuropathic pain and by modifying the response format to a 0–10 numerical rating scale to provide increased responsiveness in longitudinal studies and clinical trials. The reliability, validity, and subscale structure of the revised SF-MPQ (SF-MPQ-2) were examined in responses from 882 individuals with diverse chronic pain syndromes and in 226 patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy who participated in a randomized clinical trial. The data suggest that the SF-MPQ-2 has excellent reliability and validity, and the results of both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses provided support for four readily interpretable subscales-continuous pain, intermittent pain, predominantly neuropathic pain, and affective descriptors. These results provide a basis for use of the SF-MPQ-2 in future clinical research, including clinical trials of treatments for neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain conditions.

### Pain measurement in painful skin conditions and rheumatoid arthritis randomized controlled trials: a scoping review to inform pain measurement in hidradenitis suppurativa [^ea7f4a08]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic and painful inflammatory skin condition that causes inflamed nodules, skin tunnels and abscesses affecting the intertriginous areas, and can result in substantial scarring. It is a relatively common condition, affecting approximately 1% of the European population. Several studies have demonstrated the large impact that HS has on quality of life and mental health. Pain was found to be the most frequently reported symptom in HS, with 85% of patients reporting pain as the most bothersome symptom. A global survey showed that two‐thirds of people with HS had experienced moderate‐to‐severe pain over the previous week, with a mean pain numerical rating scale (NRS) score of 5.0. Pain was the highest‐ranked outcome item by the HIdradenitis SuppuraTiva cORe outcomes set International Collaboration (HISTORIC) group and was recommended to form its own domain in the core outcome set. Despite the importance of treating pain, there is little guidance on the management of HS‐related pain in the literature, with substantial variation.

The current scoping review is part of the efforts of the HISTORIC pain workgroup to identify and validate the most preferred instrument with which to measure pain intensity. Functional effects of pain are measured in other domains, particularly the HS‐specific quality‐of‐life domain, which can now be measured using the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Quality of Life (HiSQOL) instrument.

There are several validated instruments for the measurement of pain. The instruments can be unidimensional, measuring only the intensity of pain, such as pain NRS, visual analogue scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale. Multidimensional instruments measure the intensity, character and impact of pain, for example, the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The pain VAS comprises a horizontal line with a description of two extremes at either end of the line, usually no pain and worst imaginable pain. For the NRS, respondents select an integer from 0 to 10 (or 0 to 100). It should be noted that a VAS with subdivisions is in essence an NRS. The MPQ contains 78 words that cover the neurophysiological and psychological descriptions of pain from which the patient can choose the most suitable terms. The BPI is comprised of 15 questions on the intensity of pain and the functional impact of pain, which are captured on an NRS.

### Composite pain index: reliability, validity, and sensitivity of a patient-reported outcome for research [^286cdc60]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

A single score that represents the multidimensionality of pain would be an innovation for patient-reported outcomes. Our aim was to determine the reliability, validity, and sensitivity of the Composite Pain Index (CPI).

Design

Methodological analysis of data from a randomized controlled, pretest/post-test education-based intervention study.

Setting

The study was conducted in outpatient oncology clinics.

Subjects

The 176 subjects had pain, were 52 ± 12.5 years on average, 63% were female, and 46% had stage IV cancers.

Methods

We generated the CPI from pain location, intensity, quality, and pattern scores measured with an electronic version of Melzack's McGill Pain Questionnaire.

Results

The internal consistency values for the individual scores comprising the CPI were adequate (0.71 baseline, 0.69 post-test). Principal components analysis extracted one factor with an eigenvalue of 2.17 with explained variance of 54% at baseline and replicated the one factor with an eigenvalue of 2.11 at post-test. The factor loadings for location, intensity, quality, and pattern were 0.65, 0.71, 0.85, and 0.71, respectively (baseline), and 0.59, 0.81, 0.84, and 0.63, respectively (post-test). The CPI was sensitive to an education intervention effect.

Conclusions

Findings support the CPI as a score that integrates the multidimensional pain experience in people with cancer. It could be used as a patient-reported outcome measure to quantify the complexity of pain in clinical research and population studies of cancer pain and studied for relevance in other pain populations.

### Reliability and validity of the global pain scale with chronic pain sufferers [^3d3c31fc]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Many pain scales exist today; however, a comprehensive, easy-to-analyze test has yet to be available to evaluate a patient's pain and understand the sociocultural, cognitive, and affective factors contributing to a patient's overall pain experience. Many scales have attempted to create an all-encompassing pain assessment but remain incomplete in their assessment of pain and the contributing aspects of pain.

Objective

To present the Global Pain Scale (GPS) as an alternative to current pain assessments and evaluate the reliability and construct validity of the GPS.

Methods

Two hundred sixty-two undergraduates with chronic pain at a large midwestern university participated in this survey study. Participants reported in which of 14 specific body regions they have pain, the frequency of pain, and treatment history for their pain. Participants completed 4 scales — GPS, the West Haven Yale Scale (WHY), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the short form McGill (SF-MPQ) — in a randomized order.

Results

The GPS demonstrated high criterion validity and high construct validity (including both convergent and discriminant validity). The total GPS scale and each of the subscales were reliable. The total GPS score was significantly correlated with all other subscales, excluding those for which there is a theoretical reason for them to not be correlated with our participant population.

Limitations

A sample of college students was used, thus decreasing the generalizability of these findings to patients approximating our sample.

Conclusions

The GPS is a valid scale that is concise and easily interpreted. The GPS is a comprehensive assessment of pain evaluating pain, emotions, clinical outcomes, and daily activities. This may be a valuable tool for evaluation and treatment planning for interventional pain management physicians.

### Measuring pain in systemic sclerosis: comparison of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire versus a single-item measure of pain [^5fc8ecdb]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Studies of pain in systemic sclerosis (SSc) have used a variety of measures, including single-item measures and the 15-item short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ-SF). The objective of our study was to compare the performance of the MPQ-SF to a single-item pain numerical rating scale (NRS) and determine whether the MPQ-SF effectively differentiates between sensory and affective components of pain in SSc.

Methods

A cross-sectional, multicenter study of 1091 patients from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group Registry who completed the MPQ-SF and pain NRS. Correlations of MPQ-SF total scores and pain NRS scores with relevant outcome measures (disability, quality of life, depressive symptoms) were compared. To assess whether the MPQ-SF differentiated between sensory and affective factors, confirmatory factor analysis modeling was used, and correlations of sensory and affective factor scores with other outcome measures were compared.

Results

MPQ-SF total score and the pain NRS correlated similarly with other outcome measures, as did the sensory and affective scores. MPQ-SF sensory and affective factors were highly correlated (0.92), and a single-factor model fit as well as a 2-factor (sensory and affective) model.

Conclusion

The substantial overlap between sensory and affective subscales of the MPQ-SF and the similarity of the MPQ-SF and NRS pain measures compared to other patient-reported outcomes suggest that the 15-item MPQ-SF does not provide tangible advantages compared to the single-item pain NRS. These findings support recommendations to use a single-item NRS pain measure in SSc as it is less burdensome to patients than the MPQ-SF.

### Comparison of a pain tolerability question with the numeric rating scale for assessment of self-reported chronic pain [^2dc230cf]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The exclusive focus of the numeric rating scale (NRS) on pain intensity reduces the experience of chronic pain to a single dimension. This drawback minimizes the complex effects of chronic pain on patients' lives and the trade-offs that are often involved in analgesic decision-making. Furthermore, continually asking patients to rate their pain on a scale that is anchored by a pain-free state (ie, 0) implies that being pain free is a readily attainable treatment goal, which may contribute to unrealistic expectations for complete relief. We hypothesized that the incorporation of a standardized pain tolerability question (PTQ) (ie, "is your pain tolerable?") would efficiently augment the information gleaned from the NRS and help to align patients' expectations with realistic treatment goals.

### PRISMA 2020 explanation and elaboration: updated guidance and exemplars for reporting systematic reviews [^c7bc6e07]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Data items

Item 10a. List and define all outcomes for which data were sought. Specify whether all results that were compatible with each outcome domain in each study were sought (for example, for all measures, time points, analyses), and, if not, the methods used to decide which results to collect

Explanation: Defining outcomes in systematic reviews generally involves specifying outcome domains (such as pain, quality of life, adverse events such as nausea) and the time frame of measurement (such as less than six months). Included studies may report multiple results that are eligible for inclusion within the review outcome definition. For example, a study may report results for two measures of pain (such as the McGill Pain Questionnaire and the Brief Pain Inventory), at two time points (such as four weeks and eight weeks), all of which are compatible with a review outcome defined as "pain < 6 months". Multiple results compatible with an outcome domain in a study might also arise when study investigators report results based on multiple analysis populations (such as all participants randomised, all participants receiving a specific amount of treatment), methods for handling missing data (such as multiple imputation, last-observation-carried-forward), or methods for handling confounding (such as adjustment for different covariates).

Reviewers might seek all results that were compatible with each outcome definition from each study or use a process to select a subset of the results. Examples of processes to select results include selecting the outcome definition that (a) was most common across studies, (b) the review authors considered "best" according to a prespecified hierarchy (for example, which prioritises measures included in a core outcome measurement set), or (c) the study investigators considered most important (such as the study's primary outcome). It is important to specify the methods that were used to select the results when multiple results were available so that users are able to judge the appropriateness of those methods and whether there is potential for bias in the selection of results.

Reviewers may make changes to the inclusion or definition of the outcome domains or to the importance given to them in the review (for example, an outcome listed as "important" in the protocol is considered "critical" in the review). Providing a rationale for the change allows readers to assess the legitimacy of the change and whether it has potential to introduce bias in the review process.

### Confirming the theoretical structure of the Japanese version of the mcGill pain questionnaire in chronic pain [^fd0cb095]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Based upon a tripartite theoretical model of pain, the Pain Rating Index of the McGill Pain Questionnaire continues to be one of the most frequently used instruments to measure clinical pain. However, differences in languages and cultural backgrounds have hindered its wide use and standardization in Japan. Although a number of exploratory factor analytic studies have failed to consistently support the theoretical structure of the instrument, a few previous confirmatory factor analytic studies did statistically support the a priori model. The purpose of this study was to test the theoretical structure of a Japanese version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, which followed a format similar to the original questionnaire, through a confirmatory factor analysis.

Design

This study used confirmatory factor analysis on prospectively collected data from consecutive outpatients with chronic pain at a university hospital to test the hypothesis regarding the theoretical structure of the Japanese McGill Pain Questionnaire.

Results and Conclusion

The first 16 Pain Rating Index subclass scores were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis procedures that yielded a well-fitting final model that explained 91% of the covariance in the observed data. The results approximately supported the hypothesis that the sensory, affective, and evaluative subscales of the Pain Rating Index are representative of the multidimensionality of the pain experience with minimal overlap but could not disregard relatively high intercorrelations among those subscales similar to the original McGill Pain Questionnaire. It is suggested that the theoretical structure of the McGill Pain Questionnaire is approximately kept in the Japanese McGill Pain Questionnaire used in this study. Therefore, the translation-based Japanese McGill Pain Questionnaire used in this study adequately permits comparison of studies from English-speaking and non-English-speaking populations, thus facilitating the first step toward international research exchange and communications.

### The measurement of pain, 1945–2000 [^4994ee2e]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

Three strands of activity can be identified in the history of pain measurement. The first, psychophysics, dates back to the nineteenth century and measures the effect of analgesia by quantifying the noxious stimulation required to elicit pain, as well as the maximum stimulation tolerated. The second uses standardized questionnaires for patients, developed to categorize pain according to its emotional impact, distribution, character, and other dimensions. The third asks patients to report on pain intensity using rating scales, and is used in clinical trials where analgesics are evaluated and results can be combined to influence clinical guidelines and protocols. Although all three strands have found a place in modern clinical practice or drug development, it is the reporting of pain by patients undergoing treatment using simple scales of intensity which has emerged as the crucial method by which analgesic therapies can now be evaluated and compared.

### Are pain ratings irrelevant? [^eb71f213]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pain intensity ratings have been the basis of pain diagnosis and a fundamental tool in pain research, but are not always used. Frequent comments by physicians that pain ratings, sometimes called pain scores, are not useful in clinical practice and comments by basic scientists that pain ratings may measure the wrong thing, have been in significant part supported by a short survey conducted among members of American Pain Society (APS). Though limited by small number of respondents, the findings of this survey and additional comments by members of APS raise critical questions about why pain ratings do not serve the clinical communities. These findings send an urgent call to the pain community to reassess the status of currently used pain ratings and to find solutions to this fundamental issue.

### Pain relief that matters to patients: systematic review of empirical studies assessing the minimum clinically important difference in acute pain [^6fcb7c57]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

For each study, we extracted or calculated the MCID for pain relief (absolute and relative change), and noted results of any study-based exploration of causes for variation, e.g. baseline pain.

We then summarised results qualitatively as there was considerable clinical and methodological variation between studies and heterogeneity in their results. To provide an overview, we first reported the range of results for all studies and then the range and median results with inter-quartile ranges (IQR) of studies according to analytical strategy (mean change or threshold approach). To facilitate exploration of reasons for heterogeneity, we then pooled results of studies using mean change approach with inverse-variance meta-analysis using random effects models. We studied the association with baseline pain scores in three different analyses. First, we explored the impact of the average population baseline pain in a mixed-effects meta-regression (acknowledging the limitations of aggregated data-level analysis). Second, we pooled individual patient data to estimate the MCID (absolute and relative changes) using a two-stage individual participant data meta-analysis. In these models, MCIDs were first estimated in each individual study using a mixed model based on all repeated measurements and participant specific random effects to capture the serial correlation within each participant. Results were then pooled using random-effects inverse-variance meta-analysis. Third, we used the same model to derive outcomes measured at different time points in studies with multiple measurements per patients (i.e. the use of a 'moving baseline').

We furthermore used subgroup analyses to explore whether between-study variation was explained by differences in other clinical and methodological factors including clinical condition, type of pain scale (VAS vs. NRS), directionality of global transition scale (one-sided vs. two-sided scale), definition of minimum clinically important change (one category vs. several categories improvement vs. distinction between meaningful and non-meaningful change), number of pain assessments per patients (single vs. multiple assessments adjusted for correlation vs. multiple unadjusted assessments), risk of attrition bias (low vs. high or unclear) and risk of non-representative sample (low vs. high or unclear).

Finally, we used the same analysis strategy for the substantial clinically important difference for pain relief (absolute and relative change) and the minimum and substantial clinically important differences for worsening of pain (absolute and relative change).

All data analyses were done using Stata/IC version 13.

Based on experience with and data collected from these clinical trials, the Peripheral Nerve Society considers a 2 point change on the NIS-LL to correspond to a meaningful change in clinical status. Neuropathy Pain Scale In order to assess and differentiate qualities of pain, Galer and Jensen developed the Neuropathic Pain Scale in 1997. The NPS is composed of 10 items that assess two global pain domains including pain intensity and unpleasantness, and six pain qualities, including sharp, hot, dull, cold, sensitive, and itchy pain, in two dimensions. McGill Pain Questionnaire The McGill Pain Questionnaire is used to specify subjective pain experience using sensory, affective and evaluative word descriptors. The short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire contains 11 questions referring to the sensory dimension of the pain experience and four related to the affective dimension.

Global Impression Scale Global impression scale is also termed global rating of change scales and was developed to assess patients' overall improvement or deterioration in a clinical setting, and has been frequently used in musculoskeletal and chronic pain trials. Height. Height will be measured at baseline with participants standing barefoot with their backs to a wall-mounted stadiometer and heels against the wall, recorded to the nearest 0. 5 cm.

### Making sense of phantom limb pain [^6f511e46]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

A second challenge to PLP research relates to common methodological problems. While these issues, too, are not unique to PLP, their impact on the strength of evidence for PLP research studies is fundamental, starting with how PLP is quantified. In particular, PLP treatment outcomes are measured by self-report, which is known to vary over time and context. Currently, individual studies use a variety of measures to quantify PLP, such as different scales (eg, Numerical Rating Scale; Universal Pain Score; Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); FACES Rating Scale; Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, for a review on pain scales), pain diariesand questionnaires (eg, McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ); 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36); West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory; Groningen Questionnaire Problems after Leg/Arm Amputation; Chronic Pain Grade). Additionally, instructions to participants to assess their pain over various time windows introduces heterogeneity in prevalence estimates because PLP researchers typically are not well-versed in epidemiological methods and so do not distinguish between different prevalence estimates (eg, point prevalence: 'Do you have PLP right now?', period prevalence: 'Have you had PLP in the last X months?' or lifetime prevalence: 'Have you ever had PLP?'). PLP ratings are collected via different platforms (self-administered questionnaires; phone surveys; pain diaries; interviews with experienced clinicians). Further, each of these measures is designed to probe slightly different features of the pain experience. This diversity of methods hinders the collation of evidence across studies. But even more problematic, without careful a priori selection of the most relevant outcome measures for a given study, each study will collect a range of different PLP-related measures, creating opportunities for 'p hacking', when a range of different PLP related measures are administered and the outcome with the best statistical results is reported. Finally, adding the relatively low prevalence of amputation in the general population and high heterogeneity in the PLP experience and amputation-related factors results in too many variables and too few participants for adequate statistical power. Taken together, these methodological and statistical issues make it likely that spurious findings from individual studies may bias and even offset, our understanding of the nature of PLP and, subsequently, its treatment. In the face of these challenges, a crucial first step to developing a better understanding of PLP is characterising the prevalence and heterogeneity of the phenomena, as well as associated amputation-related factors. This fundamental background can help hint at the underlying mechanism(s) of PLP and, consequently, help to scrutinise the rationale for modern PLP treatment approaches. In the next sections, we will address each of these in turn.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^5ca78ead]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Pain Assessment Scales

Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Originally developed for assessment of pain in cancer patients, the BPI has been successfully used in a variety of clinical settings. In the BPI, severity of pain is measured across four grades, and the degree of interference of pain is evaluated across seven parameters: general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relationship with others and sleep. Several modified versions of the BPI have been developed to adapt to the requirements of the target population across different geographical settings. The reliability of the Hindi version of the BPI was demonstrated in a clinical trial in North India by Saxena et al.
McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) Developed by Melzack and Torgerson in 1971, the MPQ is a multidimensional pain assessment tool consisting of three major classes of word descriptors (total of 78 words) reflecting sensory, affective and evaluative components. It also contains a pain intensity scale ranging from one to five to rate the severity of the pain.MPQ and the short-form MPQ (SF-MPQ) are valid and reliable tools to assess chronic pain, particularly cancer pain, in adults.–The MPQ can also be used in the assessment of neuropathic and arthritic pain.–
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) The VAS is a simple, easily administered, single-item tool to assess pain severity, especially in acute pain.VAS consists of a horizontal or vertical rating scale (1–10 cm) with verbal descriptors of "no pain" and "pain as bad as it could be". The patient is asked to mark the level of pain on the numerical scale of 1–10 cm (or 1–100 mm). Several studies have validated the use of VAS in acute and chronic pain.–
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) The NRS consists of a numerical scale similar to the VAS, however, with numbers marked from one to ten, ranging from "no pain" to "worst pain imaginable". The NRS is easy to administer via paper-and-pencil, telephone, fax or any computerized system and has demonstrated superiority over the VAS across different studies, especially in illiterate or elderly populations.–
Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) The VRS scale is composed of a series of adjectives along with numbers to best describe the intensity of the pain. VRS has been reported to be well correlated with the VAS, in terms of simplicity and reliability. However, the VRS scale has been found to be less sensitive to changes in pain intensity and is considered highly subjective.–
Faces Pain Scale (FPS) For the self-reporting of pain severity in children, elderly and other special populations, FPS may be used. In this scale, pain is graded by means of facial expressions. FPS and the revised FPS have demonstrated reliability in predicting the severity of pain in children aged 4–8 years and in patients with cognitive impairment.–
Disease-specific assessment scales Due to the methodological problems faced during the assessment of pain using standard tools, disease-specific pain measurement questionnaires have been developed with an aim to correctly capture the nature and severity of pain in different pathophysiological conditions. Use of Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS), Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) and Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) Pain Scale is recommended to differentiate between nociceptive and neuropathic pain (A).
Cognitive and behavioral assessment scales Pain perception is greatly influenced by the psychological and emotional status of the patient. Chronic pain may induce notable changes in the behavior, cognition and social abilities of a person. Pain is also accompanied by a state of fear, anxiety, depression and negative beliefs. These psychological traits may serve as important predictors of chronic pain and disability and may determine treatment outcomes. Therefore, a comprehensive pain management program should also involve psychological, cognitive and behavioral assessment of the patient. For this purpose, tools such as Pain Beliefs and Perceptions Inventory (PBPI), Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS), Cognitive Evaluation Questionnaire and the Patient Attitude Questionnaire (PAQ) may be used.
Assessment in elderly or cognitively impaired patients Patients' self-reports of pain have been proven to be more reliable tools for accurate diagnosis of pain and treatment of pain. However, obtaining detailed self-reports in both patients with cognitive impairment and the elderly can prove to be a major challenge and, therefore, requires the use of pain assessment tools that are relatively easy and adequately describe the pain experience. For cognitively sound older adults, the VRS, NRS or FPS may be easy and reliable to use (A), whereas in elderly with symptoms of dementia or cognitive impairment, the Abbey's Pain Scale, Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale (PAINAD) and Pain Assessment for the Dementing Elderly (PADE) have demonstrated reliability (A).–

### Nocturnal pain, is the pain different compared with pain during the day? An exploratory cross-sectional study in patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis [^85861a6d]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Nocturnal pain

Participants were asked whether they had complaints of pain in their joint during the night (yes/no) and whether they had been awake from pain during the night (yes/no). More information about nocturnal pain was obtained by a slightly adjusted McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) (Dutch Language Version; MPQ-DLV), where we transformed pain into nocturnal pain (MPQ-N). The MPQ-N contains 4 components: a pain glossary to determine the nature and intensity of the nocturnal pain, questions about the effect of the nocturnal pain on daily life (QOL), the impact visual analogue scales (VAS scales) for nocturnal pain intensity (0–100; higher score is more nocturnal pain; participants were asked to report their pain on 3 different manners (i) nocturnal pain during past week, (ii) the nocturnal pain when it is least, and (iii) the nocturnal pain at its worst, questions about localization (same location, radiating and jumping pain) and the course of nocturnal pain (intermittent/periodic pain, continuous pain, or transient [variable, but never gone]). The MPQ-N also contains a verbal descriptor inventory to discriminate pain dimensions, consisting of 63 descriptive adjectives distributed over 20 groups. Participants were asked to select those adjectives which are most related to their pain experience, with a maximum of 1 adjective per group. The range of number of words chosen (NWC) and pain rating index (PRI) scores differ per dimension, each descriptor is ranked on a 0 ("none") to 3 ("severe") intensity scale. This part discriminates 3 dimensions of the experience of pain: sensory-discriminative dimension (e.g. location, intensity, NWC 0–12; PRI 0–36), affective-emotional (e.g. depression, anxiety, NWC 0–5; PRI 0–15), and cognitive-evaluative (e.g. thoughts of the cause and significance, NWC 0–3; PRI 0–12).

### Development of the mcGill range of motion index [^7654fda2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

We created the McGill Range of Motion Index (McROMI) to allow us to ascribe a score to global limited range of motion (ROM) in patients with polyarthritis. Our goal was to have an easy-to-use index that required only visual estimation of ROM and could be performed by allied health professionals with limited training. The index was created with a range of motion ranking technique involving rheumatologists at McGill University and its validity was tested in patients with early inflammatory arthritis in the McGill Early Arthritis Registry. We hypothesized a valid index would correlate with various process and outcome measures. We found correlations between the McROMI and function (Health Assessment Questionnaire), Health Related Quality of Life (SF-36), pain, a global assessment of inflammatory disease activity (DAS28), and the number of tender and swollen joints. The McROMI demonstrates good validity as a measure of ROM in early inflammatory arthritis. It will prove useful in future research as a means of controlling for ROM as a confounder of various outcomes and in studies of therapeutic maneuvers to improve ROM.

### A cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire-2: Chinese version in patients with chronic visceral pain [^9420b3f2]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) has been used for more than 30 years to evaluate the intensity, sensory, and affective aspects of pain. Its reliability and validity have been extensively documented. The short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) is a simplified version of the MPQ that is less time consuming and includes 15 pain descriptors that have shown favorable reliability and validity. Although the SF-MPQ has been translated into several languages, such as Turkish, Greek, German, and French, the psychometric properties of each translation require further validation. The SF-MPQ has also been used to assess the patients with neuropathic pain; however, several symptoms reflecting mechanisms of neuropathic pain or those common in patients with neuropathic pain have not been included in the SF-MPQ. To address this problem, Dworkin et aldeveloped the SF-MPQ-2 that included 22 descriptors of pain, thereby taking additional symptoms of neuropathic pain into account. Furthermore, a 4-point rating scale of the original SF-MPQ has been converted into a 0–10 numerical scale in the SF-MPQ-2, a modification that could provide better responsiveness. The SF-MPQ-2 has also been translated into Persianand Japanese.

Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. In addition, the American Pain Society has introduced the phrase "pain as the fifth vital sign". It is usually associated with impaired daily function and quality of life. Similarly, pain has been a common burden of disease in China. Pain is reportedly a comorbid symptom of emotional and cognitive problems that can exacerbate the clinical condition of patients. Although a Chinese version of the Brief Pain Inventory has been recommended for pain assessment, and some small sample studies have been reported,–generally, the studies on pain in China have not been effectively conducted because of a lack of validated methods and tools. Thus, we attempted to develop a culturally appropriate and functional Chinese version of the SF-MPQ-2 and to evaluate its reliability and validity to measure chronic pain in Chinese patients.

### Words that describe chronic musculoskeletal pain: implications for assessing pain quality across cultures [^ae1f8d76]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is a significant problem worldwide that is associated with tremendous personal and societal costs. In order to address this problem, valid and reliable measures of pain are required. One pain domain that is commonly assessed in clinical and research settings is pain quality. Whereas pain intensity can be defined as the magnitude or intensity of felt pain, pain quality refers to how the pain feels. The most commonly used pain quality measures in research with patients with a variety of chronic pain conditions are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ)and its modifications, the Pain Quality Assessment Scale (PQAS), and the Revised Pain Quality Assessment Scale (PQAS-R). Two of these, the PQAS and the PQAS-R, have demonstrated content validity as measures of pain quality in the US chronic pain populations. However, even though the PQAS has been directly translated into 17 different languages, to our knowledge, the content validity of the PQAS – or any existing pain quality measure that was developed in Western countries – has been evaluated only in English-speaking patients in the USA. Although the results of this research support the content validity of the PQAS in patients from the USA, this does not ensure its content validity in patients from other countries, including patients from Asian countries.

A number of guidelines for translation of patient-reported outcome measures to different languages highlight the important contribution of cultural factors that can affect the validity of the translated measure. Therefore, consideration of cultural issues during the translation process is extremely important before we can determine that the translated measure is valid.–

For example, people living in Nepal differ from individuals living in the USA on a number of important factors, including socioeconomic status, culture, ethnicity, and education status. They may also differ with respect to their beliefs about their cause of pain. These factors could in turn influence how people in Nepal describe their pain. Thus, before existing measures of pain quality can be recommended for use in non-English-speaking populations – in particular, perhaps in populations who differ culturally from individuals in the USA – research is needed to evaluate their content validity in the new populations.

### Effect of an interdisciplinary inpatient program for patients with complex regional pain syndrome in reducing disease activity-a single-center prospective cohort study [^7cf25343]. Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2

The Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2) captures neuropathic pain qualities using six neuropathic items. Each item is rated based on a 0–10 scale with higher scores indicating more neuropathic pain (range 0–60). Based on the results of a Rasch analysis, the Neuropathic Qualities subscale of the SF-MPQ-2 may be used as a standalone measure for neuropathic features in CRPS.

EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level instrument

The EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level instrument (EQ-5D-5L) is a generic health-related quality-of-life measure that consists of two parts: The descriptive system and the Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive system consists of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each with five response levels, and a total of 3125 health states are defined. Health states are converted into a single index "utility" score using a scoring algorithm. The EQ-VAS provides a single global rating of self-perceived health and is scored on a 0 to 100 mm scale representing "the worst… " and "the best health you can imagine", respectively. The EQ-5D-5L has been translated and validated in multiple languages and cultural settings, making it suitable for international comparisons of health-related quality of life.

Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire

The Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) assesses the confidence people with ongoing pain have in performing activities while in pain. The questionnaire includes 10 items, and each item is rated on a 0 to 6 scale, with higher scores indicating more confidence (range 0–60). An investigation specifically related to CRPS is lacking; however, a systematic review identified good validity, reliability, and responsiveness for patients with musculoskeletal disorders.

### Can the assessment of the circadian rhythm of pain Be shortened? A study of community-dwelling participants with chronic pain [^48e5c0bd]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Measures

The Neuropathic Pain Diagnostic Questionnaire (DN4) was used to identify neuropathic pain, whereas the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SFMPQ2) was used to comprehensively evaluate pain intensity. The Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) was used to determine the severity of neuropathic pain, and the Michigan Body Map (MBM) was used to identify the location of pain.

Neuropathic Pain Diagnostic Questionnaire

The DN4 rating scale, which comprises 10 questions, is used to distinguish between neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain. The DN4 rating scale has questions regarding symptoms, such as burning sensations and electric shock-like pain, that specifically target neuropathic pain. The pain was classified as neuropathic if at least four of the items on the scale were applicable.

Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2

The SFMPQ2 questionnaire comprises 22 questions that can be categorized into four subdomains: continuous pain, intermittent pain, affective descriptors, and neuropathic pain. Each item is rated on an 11-point numerical scale, with higher scores indicating greater pain severity. The internal consistency of the SFMPQ2 was found to be good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86 for SFMPQ2 total). Significant associations were observed between the total score of SFMPQ2 and other functional assessments (ρ = 0.54 for VAS and ρ = 0.79 for SFMPQ-total).

Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory

The NPSI is a questionnaire comprising 10 questions that assess neuropathic pain, including the presence of spontaneous burning pain. The questions were further divided into the following sub-items: pain attacks, provoked pain, and abnormal sensations. The severity of these symptoms was rated on an 11-point NRS based on the average pain experienced in the previous 24 hours, ranging from 0–10, with higher scores indicating greater pain severity. The total score on the NPSI questionnaire was used to determine the severity of neuropathic pain symptoms.

Michigan Body Map

The MBM is a self-reported measurement tool used to assess current pain in various body regions. The MBM is a visual representation comprising 35 boxes. The severity of pain was directly proportional to the number of boxes marked on the image.

### Description of stable pain in rheumatoid arthritis: a 6 year study [^65f1cc0f]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To study pain quality and variability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

Pain, disease activity, and functional status were assessed 3 times over 6 years in an initial cohort of 120 clinic patients with chronic pain from RA. A pain visual analog scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) were used to record pain intensity and quality. RA disease activity and function were measured.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in any measure over the 3 assessments. RA pain intensity was moderate. The MPQ showed that sensory components of the pain were described in terms of pressure and constriction. Pain related affect was described with adjectives suggesting positive psychological adaptation to pain.

Conclusion

The results indicate a general profile of no change in pain sensation, affect, and emotional quality in clinic monitored patients with ongoing RA and ongoing, moderate levels of disease activity and function. The MPQ provides qualitative detail to patient's report of pain severity that could be a useful addition to longterm documentation of RA outcome. Regular MPQ documentation of current pain in outpatients could indicate whether any significant change in pain levels is reflected in altered word selection that reflects physiological or psychological change, and could assist clinicians to select the most appropriate form of therapy for RA pain.

### Exploring the role of pictograms in the comprehension of pain [^57f80d8c]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage". Despite being universal, pain is an individual and subjective experience in which patient perceptions of their pain can influence clinician interpretation and treatment. Diagnosing the causes of pain requires the clinician to fully understand specific qualities and characteristics of how the pain is subjectively interpreted by the individuals. However, those suffering from pain such as neuropathic or affective pain can have difficulties verbally describing the nuances of their pain experience, which can result in delays in diagnosis and undue suffering.

Indeed, approximately 20% of adults in North America, and 19% of adults in Europe, are suffering from chronic pain indicating a public health need for tools to help patients better communicate their pain experience. Not only do millions of people around the world suffer directly from inadequate pain management, health care providers working with chronic pain patients also experience high levels of emotional dissatisfaction and burnout due to the complexity of pain that renders many pain treatment plans ineffective.

The quality of pain may be assessed using various pain assessment scales.but these scales have known limitations such as the lack of specificity and sensitivity. The multidimensional McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) is a pain assessment tool that assesses major symptoms of neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain. A short-form version of the MPQ, the short form-MPQ version 2 (SF-MPQ-2) has been widely applied in the clinical management of pain in North America where patients rate 22 pain qualities on an 10-point scale to assess sensory and affective qualities, including continuous, intermittent, and neuropathic pain.

Written information directed at patients often uses language that is difficult to interpret. Pictograms, which are symbols or drawings that represent a concept or idea, have the potential to aid in the assessment of pain when verbal description proves difficult for the patient. Although there are no comprehensive sets of pictograms that has been rigorously tested to depict common pain qualities, there are a small number of graphical tools/pictograms that have already been developed and tested in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Given the comprehensive nature of the SF-MPQ-2, with its inclusion of neuropathic pain qualities, and the long history of use of the MPQ and SF-MPQ in research and clinical settings, the SF-MPQ-2 was chosen for development of pictograms to illustrate each of its 22 pain descriptors.

### Mesotherapy in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in rehabilitation: the state of the art [^761ce515]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Seven articles (N = 7) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were considered in the review: 2 articles treated osteoarthritis of the knee, and 5 articles treated spine diseases 2 on neck pain,2 on low back pain, and 1 on chronic spinal pain. The PEDro scores in these studies ranged from 5 to 8 (Table 1). A total of 643 patients were studied, comprising 517 females and 126 males, with an average age of 45.43 ± 15.48 years.

Table 1
Summary of articles

Regarding the primary outcome, pain was evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)in most studies,–except for Chel et al, which only presented The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores to quantify pain and recovery of function of the knee. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument usually used in clinical research to measure the intensity of musculoskeletal pain while WOMAC is a scale used to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. Paolucci et alused the Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), a 5-category verbal scale with which pain is assessed by asking patients to indicate which of 5 words best describe their current pain.

Moreover, Ferrara et alquantified pain with the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire to control the effects of therapies and pain relief in patients along the treatment time.

With respect to the assessment of pain and function of the spine, the authors used specific scales and, specifically, the Neck Disability Index (NDI), a valid and sensitive tool for measuring changes in pain and disability in patients with musculoskeletal neck pain, and the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), a patient-specific outcome measure that examines the functional status of the spine. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is used to quantify short-term and long-term symptoms and function in subjects with knee injury and osteoarthritis.

Finally, to evaluate the increase in quality of life that is perceived by patients, the Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12), a 12-item questionnaire that assesses generic health outcomes from the patient's perspective, was administered. The self-reported Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale quantifies how the patients' health change in painful condition.

### Moving beyond pain intensity as the primary outcome measure: the INTEGRATE pain framework and beyond [^8936385f]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In clinical trials as well as routine clinical care, pain intensity is currently the primary research outcome that is used to identify the impact of pain management treatments. However, assessment of this domain alone hinders the understanding of the impact of pain and pain-related symptoms for patients. To advance the management of pain, we need to (1) measure bio-psycho-social outcomes that are important to all stakeholders, including to those with lived pain experience, (2) ensure harmonization of outcome assessment by implementing core outcome sets, (3) use assessment tools that have been validated and have content validity, (4) use the same questionnaires in both research and clinical practice so that research informs clinical practice and vice versa, and (5) consider tailoring questionnaires to the person with lived pain experience, eg, by moving toward an idiographic approach. The pain management field is moving toward a personalized approach to care and the use of harmonized/standardized patient-reported outcomes, and patient-reported outcome measures can help advance the pain management field and make care more patient-centered.

### A nutritional intervention for diabetic neuropathy (WCCR-DN2) [^710b48c6]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

- Sensation Sensation will be measured follow the baseline and 20 week score using the following assessment tools: Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire Neuropathy Impairment Score
- Lower Limbs Neuropathy Total Symptom Score 6. General status, symptoms, and medication accounting. Participants will be asked to report changes in their health and medication use. Disease Activity. The following assessments will be used to measure pain and changes in sensory perception related to diabetic neuropathy: Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. The MNSI questionnaire consists of 15 questions followed by a single 8-point clinical examination involving inspection of the foot, assessment of ankle reflexes, and semi-quantitative determination of vibration perception.

Neuropathy Impairment Score for Lower Limbs The NIS-LL is the lower limb component of the full Neuropathy Impairment Score and has 3 domains including: muscle weakness, reflexes, and sensation. The maximum score is 88 points. Based on experience with and data collected from these clinical trials, the Peripheral Nerve Society considers a 2 point change on the NIS-LL to correspond to a meaningful change in clinical status. Neuropathy Pain Scale In order to assess and differentiate qualities of pain, Galer and Jensen developed the Neuropathic Pain Scale in 1997. The NPS is composed of 10 items that assess two global pain domains including pain intensity and unpleasantness, and six pain qualities, including sharp, hot, dull, cold, sensitive, and itchy pain, in two dimensions. McGill Pain Questionnaire The McGill Pain Questionnaire is used to specify subjective pain experience using sensory, affective and evaluative word descriptors.

The short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire contains 11 questions referring to the sensory dimension of the pain experience and four related to the affective dimension. Global Impression Scale Global impression scale is also termed global rating of change scales and was developed to assess patients' overall improvement or deterioration in a clinical setting, and has been frequently used in musculoskeletal and chronic pain trials. Height. Height will be measured at baseline with participants standing barefoot with their backs to a wall-mounted stadiometer and heels against the wall, recorded to the nearest 0. 5 cm.

### Burst spinal cord stimulation: a systematic review and pooled analysis of real-world evidence and outcomes data [^63ddf4fe]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

For a pooled analysis of pain scores, VAS and NRS were considered equivalent and were analyzed together. If multiple pain scores were reported in an article (e.g. overall pain, back pain, and leg pain), the most comprehensive option (overall pain) was used. Scores were transformed, if necessary, from a 0–10 scale to a 0–100 scale for consistency. Mean pain scores in each article for baseline, burst SCS treatment, and tonic SCS treatment conditions were identified and weighted by the study N. Then, a single pooled mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) were calculated for all studies.

For preference scores (for burst SCS vs tonic) and the most common PROs (that is, those reported in at least three articles), similar methods were used to calculate pooled means. As comparisons, population norms, based on nonpain respondents, were identified from the literature (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], Pain Catastrophizing Scale [PCS], Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire [PVAQ]).

Because the same PROs were not used consistently across the 15 articles and therefore could not be analyzed individually, all reported PRO outcomes were normalized and pooled. The mean PRO scores reported in each study for baseline and during burst SCS treatment were transformed to the proportion of the highest (worst) possible score for the relevant instrument. As above, these proportions were then weighted by each study N, and a single pooled mean and SEM were calculated. For comparison, population norms, based on nonpain respondents, were identified from the literature (as above, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI], McGill Pain Questionnaire number of words chosen [MPQ NWC], McGill Pain Questionnaire pain rating index [MPQ PRI], McGill Pain Questionnaire, Short Form, total and sensory and affective domains [MPQSF T/S/A], Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]). To convert the population norms to a similar metric, they were transformed (as above) to proportions of the worst possible score for that instrument and weighted according to the sample size of each burst SCS article employing that PRO. The converted population norms were then expressed as a single pooled weighted mean and SEM, for a comparison.

Safety data (adverse events [AEs] and complications) were collated across the articles and presented in a narrative format.

### World endometriosis research foundation endometriosis phenome and biobanking harmonization project: II. clinical and covariate phenotype data collection in endometriosis research [^fcc88a0d]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

The three main mechanisms generating pain are [1] nociceptive, [2] inflammatory, and [3] neuropathic or centrally generated pain, although it is likely that a combination of these processes occurs in many patients. It is plausible that these phenotypes may be characterized by different biomarker profiles or may be responsive to specific treatments only, and therefore a failure to correctly characterize the pain symptoms may obscure a significant result in such studies. Furthermore, both psychological and cognitive factors can modulate–in either a facilitatory or inhibitory manner–the pain experience, and they may also need to be considered (Fig. 3).

Recommendations have been published for standard endometriosis–associated pain data collection techniques. Using these guidelines, the EPHect Working Group agreed that pain intensity will be measured on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) anchored with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst imaginable pain. Pain affect is captured on the EPHect EPQ with the short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Though the original version of the SF-MPQ is included on the EPHect EPQ in Supplemental Appendix 1, we strongly recommend as standard the use of the most recent SF-MPQ-2, as ratings are given on an 11-point scale, similar to the measures of pain intensity, and seven additional questions allow for the calculation of four separate domains (continuous pain, intermittent pain, neuropathic pain, and affective) and a total score as opposed to the original version which only calculates two domains (sensory and affective) and a total score. Use of the SF-MPQ-2 requires investigators to sign a user agreement, which is why we have not reproduced it in our questionnaire.

### Pain and recovery after robotic vs. uniportal lobectomy for lung cancer: a comparative analysis [^1a743dbd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Study design and data collection

Data collection employed two standardized pain assessment instruments. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) in its validated Czech version allowed patients to characterize pain using descriptive adjectives with intensity ratings (0 = no pain, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe), supplemented with a Visual Analog Scale (VAS, 1–10).

The Daily Activity Pain Interference Questionnaire (DAPIQ) assessed pain's functional impact on routine activities using a six-point scale (0 = no pain, 5 = pain preventing activity). This author-modified tool was selected for its brevity, functional focus, and suitability for acute care settings compared to more extensive instruments like the Brief Pain Inventory, Pain Disability Index, PROMIS, or Multidimensional Pain Inventory (Table 1).

Following ethics committee approval (No. 180/2024), patients were recruited during outpatient surgical consultations. After providing informed consent, participants completed the first questionnaire part on postoperative day 3 during hospitalization and the second part during the follow-up visit on day 14, returning completed forms in sealed envelopes for analysis. This observational cohort study was conducted and reported in accordance with the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for cohort studies.

### The measurement of postoperative pain: a comparison of intensity scales in younger and older surgical patients [^2cb76906]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

The psychometric properties of pain intensity scales for the assessment of postoperative pain across the adult lifespan have not been reported. The objective of this study was to compare the feasibility and validity of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Verbal Descriptor Scale (VDS), and Visual Analog Scale (horizontal (VAS-H) and vertical (VAS-V) line orientation) for the assessment of pain intensity in younger and older surgical patients. At 24h following surgery, 504 patients, who were receiving i.v. morphine via patient-controlled analgesia, completed the pain intensity measures and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) in a randomized order. They were asked which scale was easiest to complete, the most accurate measure, and which they would most prefer to complete in the future, as an index of face validity. The amount of opioid self-administered was recorded. Age differences in postoperative pain intensity were not found. However, elderly patients obtained lower MPQ scores and self-administered less morphine than younger people. Psychometric analyses suggested that the NRS was the preferred pain intensity scale. It had low error rates, and higher face, convergent, divergent and criterion validity than the other scales. Most importantly, its properties were not age-related. The VDS also had a favourable profile with low error rates and good face, convergent and criterion validity. Finally, difficulties with VAS use among the elderly were identified, including high rates of unscorable data and low face validity. Its use with elderly postoperative patients should be discouraged.

### Pain relief that matters to patients: systematic review of empirical studies assessing the minimum clinically important difference in acute pain [^6fe20d0f]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Eligibility criteria

We included prospective studies of patients with acute pain, regardless of age, clinical condition, and intervention, in which pain intensity was assessed on a one-dimensional scale, e.g. a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) or a 0–10 point numerical rating scale (NRS), and in which the MCID was determined using an anchor-based method using patients' perception of change to determine clinical importance. Pain was considered acute when its duration was less than 1 month or, if duration was not indicated, when it was described as such in a study report.

Studies were excluded if they were not clinical (i.e. used healthy volunteers) or determined the MCID from objective criteria (e.g. return to work), the distribution of data (e.g. the minimum detectable difference) or expert consensus.

A typical eligible study would ask patients to score their pain intensity, e.g. using a VAS, at baseline and follow-up. At follow-up, patients were also asked to categorise their change in pain intensity using response options such as 'no change', 'a little better'/'somewhat better', and 'a lot better'/'much better'. The MCID was then determined from the change in scores on the pain scale among patients having categorised their change as 'a little better' (or a similar expression indicating a minimum clinically important improvement).

We included studies with two types of analytical approaches (1) the 'mean change approach', i.e. the mean difference in pain scores among patients who reported a minimum degree of pain relief; or (2) the 'threshold approach', i.e. the threshold value for pain score change which most accurately (yield﻿i﻿ng best sensitivity and specificity) identified patients experiencing relevant pain relief in analogy with a diagnostic test where the gold standard is patients' perception of change.

### A cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire-2: Chinese version in patients with chronic visceral pain [^3cb5a3be]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Instrument

The SF-MPQ-2

The SF-MPQ-2, a scale that was self-rated by subjects according to the intensity of pain perceived on a 0–10 numeric scale (0 = no pain and 10 = the worst pain), is composed of 22 pain descriptors and four subscales. It included six continuous pain descriptors (throbbing, cramping, gnawing, aching, heavy pain, and tender), six intermittent pain descriptors (shooting, stabbing, sharp, splitting, electric-shock pain, and piercing), six predominantly non-neuropathic pain descriptors (hot-burning and cold-freezing pain, pain caused by light touch, itching, tingling or pins and needles, and numbness), and four affective descriptors (tiring–exhausting, sickening, fearful, and punishing–cruel). The four subscale scores were calculated by summating the numerical values of each item, and the total scores represented the sum of values for all 22 items. Higher subscale or total scale scores indicated patients with more intense symptoms.

### Electronic pain questionnaires: a randomized, crossover comparison with paper questionnaires for chronic pain assessment [^11799f80]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

Electronic questionnaires for pain assessment are becoming increasingly popular. There have been no published reports to establish the equivalence or psychometric properties of common pain questionnaires administered via desktop computers. This study compared responses to paper (P) and touch screen electronic (E) versions of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and Pain Disability Index (PDI), while examining the role of computer anxiety and experience, and evaluating patient acceptance. In a randomized, crossover design 189 chronic pain patients completed P and E versions of the SF-MPQ and PDI, and self-ratings of anxiety, experience, relative ease and preference. Psychometric properties were highly similar for P and E questionnaires. For the SF-MPQ, 60% or more of subjects gave equivalent responses on individual descriptors and PPI scale, with 80% rating within ± 1 point for an 11-point VAS. Correlations for the SF-MPQ scales ranged from 0.68 to 0.84. For the PDI, 60% or more of subjects responded within ± 1 point on individual questions, and the total score correlation was 0.67. Comparison of mean difference scores revealed no significant differences between modes for any of the questionnaire items or scores. Anxiety and experience scores showed no significant associations through correlations and high/low comparisons. Although nearly half of subjects reported no computer training, anxiety ratings were low, and considerably more subjects rated the E questionnaires as easier and preferred. Findings are consistent with test-retest reliability data, and support the validity and acceptance of electronic versions of the SF-MPQ and PDI.

### Clinical importance of changes in chronic pain intensity measured on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale [^f7590413]. Pain (2001). Low credibility.

Pain intensity is frequently measured on an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale (PI-NRS), where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain. However, it is difficult to interpret the clinical importance of changes from baseline on this scale (such as a 1- or 2-point change). To date, there are no data driven estimates for clinically important differences in pain intensity scales used for chronic pain studies. We have estimated a clinically important difference on this scale by relating it to global assessments of change in multiple studies of chronic pain. Data on 2724 subjects from 10 recently completed placebo-controlled clinical trials of pregabalin in diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis were used. The studies had similar designs and measurement instruments, including the PI-NRS, collected in a daily diary, and the standard seven-point patient global impression of change (PGIC), collected at the endpoint. The changes in the PI-NRS from baseline to the endpoint were compared to the PGIC for each subject. Categories of "much improved" and "very much improved" were used as determinants of a clinically important difference and the relationship to the PI-NRS was explored using graphs, box plots, and sensitivity/specificity analyses. A consistent relationship between the change in PI-NRS and the PGIC was demonstrated regardless of study, disease type, age, sex, study result, or treatment group. On average, a reduction of approximately two points or a reduction of approximately 30% in the PI-NRS represented a clinically important difference. The relationship between percent change and the PGIC was also consistent regardless of baseline pain, while higher baseline scores required larger raw changes to represent a clinically important difference. The application of these results to future studies may provide a standard definition of clinically important improvement in clinical trials of chronic pain therapies. Use of a standard outcome across chronic pain studies would greatly enhance the comparability, validity, and clinical applicability of these studies.

### Pain measurement in the older people: evaluation of the psychometric properties of the geriatric pain measure (GPM-24)-polish version [^5e720dac]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pain in older people is of particular importance not only with regard to negative subjective experience but also as an indicator of the quality of medical care. Brief scales to assess pain may help health professionals with early recognition and treatment to avoid patient suffering. However, these scales should be adapted to the cultural context to provide valid assessments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Polish translation of the Geriatric Pain Measure - 24 (GPM-24) in older people.

Methods

The study was conducted among 181 people aged 65 and over with chronic (noncancer) pain of varying intensity lasting more than 6 months. Construct validity was assessed using the principal component analysis (PCA) method with oblimin rotation. Criterion validity was evaluated by correlating the scores of the GPM-24 with the scores of the McGill-Melzack questionnaire (MPQ). The reliability of the GPM-24 was estimated in terms of internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha coefficients.

Results

The PCA revealed a 6- component structure of the set of items that constituted the GPM-24. Most of these components were defined by items included in the same subscale, similar to the result obtained by the original scale's authors. There were significant correlations between the GPM-24 and some dimensions of MPQ: affective (rho = 0.25, p = 0.001), present pain intensity (rho = 0.44, p < 0.001), pain rating index total (rho = 0.31, p < 0.001), and number of words chosen (rho = 0.26, p < 0.001). The value of the standardized Cronbach's alpha equalled 0.89 and thus confirmed the high reliability of the GPM-24.

Conclusions

The Geriatric Pain Measure -24 is a reliable and valid tool that is recommended for the monitoring and multidimensional assessment of chronic pain in older people in daily practice as well as in clinical trials.

### Developing consensus on core outcome sets of domains for acute, the transition from acute to chronic, recurrent / episodic, and chronic pain: results of the INTEGRATE-pain Delphi process [^77574f51]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and negatively impacts individuals' well-being and carries significant financial burden. The United Nations and international medical societies view access to effective pain management as a fundamental right. Yet, pain is grossly undertreated, causing public health challenges and ethical problems. Like the causes of pain themselves, reasons for its undertreatment are multifactorial. One contributing factor is the lack of rigorous tools to synthesize data across research and clinical practice, especially data encompassing the biopsychosocial nature of pain. Core outcome sets (COS) hold promise for improving data synthesis and subsequently identifying clinically meaningful, biopsychosocial treatment outcome measures.

COS of domains provide researchers with standardized outcome domains that should be assessed and reported in all clinical trials, studies and practices, in specific areas of health or health care.COS development entails a consensus process, which first identifies what to measure (i.e. domains/subdomains) and then identifies how they should be measured (i.e. patient-reported outcome measures; PROMs).COS can be used with additional outcome domains and offer the potential to boost rigor and generalizability by improving data harmonization across studies, facilitating meta-analyses, improving systematic reviews, reducing risks of bias in reporting, and using stakeholder consensus to increase the likelihood that measured outcomes are meaningful. Numerous COS have been developed for specific pain conditions. However, pain categories (i.e. acute, transition from acute to chronic, episodic/recurrent, and chronic), which can differ in their biopsychosocial mechanisms and treatment approaches, are often not captured separately.

### Gender differences in pain characteristics of chronic stable angina and perceived physical limitation in patients with coronary artery disease [^a3393635]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic stable angina pectoris, the chest pain associated with reversible myocardial ischemia has detrimental effects on health-related quality of life, particularly in women. The limited research on gender differences in chronic stable angina suggests that angina may be experienced differently in women and that women report greater functional disability related to angina symptoms. No studies have examined gender differences in chronic stable angina from a multidimensional pain perspective or have included reliable and valid measures of pain that would facilitate comparing chronic angina patients with other chronic pain populations. The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine gender differences in characteristics of chronic stable angina using the short-form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and to explore relationships among these pain characteristics and perceived limitation in performing physical activities in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (physical limitation subscale of the Seattle angina questionnaire). One hundred and twenty-eight subjects (30.5% women) with stable CAD and angina pectoris documented by a cardiologist completed study questionnaires in an outpatient cardiology clinic. Results of the study suggest that men and women with chronic stable angina had more similarities than differences in chest pain characteristics. No significant gender differences were demonstrated in total sensory or affective intensity scores, the present pain intensity index, or the number of pain words chosen. However, women did report significantly greater pain intensity on the SF-MPQ visual analogue scale. Women were also significantly more likely to describe their chronic angina as 'hot-burning' and 'tender' and to have greater intensity of pain for these two descriptors. Despite the similarities in pain characteristics, women reported greater physical limitation related to anginal pain. The variables of social status and years diagnosed with CAD significantly interacted with gender in predicting physical limitation suggesting that gender-specific models of physical limitation in angina patients need to be explored. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that has assessed chronic anginal pain using a reliable and valid generic pain instrument. More research is needed to better understand the nature of gender differences in functional limitation secondary to anginal pain and the physiologic, cognitive-perceptual and psychosocial mechanisms that lead to angina-related functional disability.

### What do the numbers mean? Normative data in chronic pain measures [^eedce838]. Pain (2008). Low credibility.

Although self-reported measures play a central role in the assessment of pain and its treatment, it has long been recognized that interpretation of these measures is severely limited by the absence of normative data. Despite that, relatively few of the measures used in pain clinics or research studies have normative data for reference. Using a pain centre sample (n = 6124), this paper describes the development of a normative dataset on a number of commonly used pain-related measures. The measures cover many of the key dimensions in pain assessment, including pain severity/quality, disability (physical functioning), and mood (emotional functioning). Measures of different cognitive and coping constructs are also included. Mean scores are reported for each measure according to age group, gender, pain site, as well as percentiles for different scores for patients with chronic low back pain. The potential uses for datasets of this type include the assessment and evaluation of individual cases, as well as the interpretation of published clinical trials. It is also argued that future systematic reviews of pain treatments should include consideration of such patient characteristics as pain levels, disability and mood in the studies reviewed rather than pain site and chronicity alone.

### Assessment of pain [^af140d94]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Valid and reliable assessment of pain is essential for both clinical trials and effective pain management. The nature of pain makes objective measurement impossible. Acute pain can be reliably assessed, both at rest (important for comfort) and during movement (important for function and risk of postoperative complications), with one-dimensional tools such as numeric rating scales or visual analogue scales. Both these are more powerful in detecting changes in pain intensity than a verbal categorical rating scale. In acute pain trials, assessment of baseline pain must ensure sufficient pain intensity for the trial to detect meaningful treatment effects. Chronic pain assessment and its impact on physical, emotional, and social functions require multidimensional qualitative tools and health-related quality of life instruments. Several disease- and patient-specific functional scales are useful, such as the Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities for osteoarthritis, and several neuropathic pain screening tools. The Initiative on

Methods

Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials recommendations for outcome measurements of chronic pain trials are also useful for routine assessment. Cancer pain assessment is complicated by a number of other bodily and mental symptoms such as fatigue and depression, all affecting quality of life. It is noteworthy that quality of life reported by chronic pain patients can be as much affected as that of terminal cancer patients. Any assessment of pain must take into account other factors, such as cognitive impairment or dementia, and assessment tools validated in the specific patient groups being studied.

### Assessment of patient-reported outcome instruments to assess chronic low back pain [^41fe5d3b]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments that assess chronic low back pain (cLBP) symptoms (specifically pain qualities) and/or impacts for potential use in cLBP clinical trials to demonstrate treatment benefit and support labeling claims.

Design

Literature review of existing PRO measures.

Methods

Publications detailing existing PRO measures for cLBP were identified, reviewed, and summarized. As recommended by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) PRO development guidance, standard measurement characteristics were reviewed, including development history, psychometric properties (validity and reliability), ability to detect change, and interpretation of observed changes.

Results

Thirteen instruments were selected and reviewed: Low Back Pain Bothersomeness Scale, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, PainDETECT, Pain Quality Assessment Scale Revised, Revised Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Low Back Pain Impact Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Index, Pain Disability Index, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, Brief Pain Inventory and Brief Pain Inventory Short Form, Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management System Spine Module, Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire, and the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory Interference Scale. The instruments varied in the aspects of pain and/or impacts that they assessed, and none of the instruments fulfilled all criteria for use in clinical trials to support labeling claims based on recommendations outlined in the FDA PRO guidance.

Conclusions

There is an unmet need for a validated PRO instrument to evaluate cLBP-related symptoms and impacts for use in clinical trials.

### Pain experiences and intrapersonal change among patients with chronic non-cancer pain after using a pain diary: a mixed-methods study [^17f1bd33]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pain diaries are a valuable self-assessment tool; however, their use in chronic non-cancer pain has received limited attention. In this study, we examined the effect of pain diary use on pain intensity, interference, and intrapersonal change in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.

Method

A convergent mixed-methods design was used to prospectively evaluate a cohort of 72 patients. Daily pain intensity and weekly pain-interference were self-reported using pain diaries for a 4-week period. Outcomes were assessed by examining changes in pain scores (primary outcome) as well as the Brief Pain Inventory and Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2. In addition, qualitative data obtained from pain diary entries and focus-group interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis.

Results

Pain intensity and average pain scores were significantly lower after using the diaries. Participants reported less pain interference in mood, walking ability, normal work, and enjoyment of life. No differences were found in SF-MPQ-2 scores. Qualitative analysis indicated that better pain recognition and more effective communication with care providers led to improved self-management and more effectual treatment plans.

Conclusion

Use of a pain diary in patients with chronic non-cancer pain was associated with reduced pain intensity and improved mood as well as function. Further controlled trials examining the long-term effects of pain diaries are warranted.

### Pain questionnaire development focusing on cross-cultural equivalence to the original questionnaire: the Japanese version of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire [^1d059e9f]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The present study aimed to develop a Japanese version of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-J) that focuses on cross-culturally equivalence to the original English version and to test its reliability and validity.

Design

Cross-sectional design.

Method

In study 1, SF-MPQ was translated and adapted into Japanese. It included construction of response scales equivalent to the original using a variation of the Thurstone method of equal-appearing intervals. A total of 147 undergraduate students and 44 pain patients participated in the development of the Japanese response scales. To measure the equivalence of pain descriptors, 62 pain patients in four diagnostic groups were asked to choose pain descriptors that described their pain. In study 2, chronic pain patients (N = 126) completed the SF-MPQ-J, the Long-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire Japanese version (LF-MPQ-J), and the 11-point numerical rating scale of pain intensity. Correlation analysis examined the construct validity of the SF-MPQ-J.

Results

The results from study 1 were used to develop SF-MPQ-J, which is linguistically equivalent to the original questionnaire. Response scales from SF-MPQ-J represented the original scale values. All pain descriptors, except one, were used by > 33% in at least one of the four diagnostic groups. Study 2 exhibited adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, with the construct validity of SF-MPQ-J comparable to the original.

Conclusion

These findings suggested that SF-MPQ-J is reliable, valid, and cross-culturally equivalent to the original questionnaire. Researchers might consider using this scale in multicenter, multi-ethnical trials or cross-cultural studies that include Japanese-speaking patients.

### Comparison of two psychometric scaling methods for ratings of acute musculoskeletal pain [^5c417987]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

Psychometric theory allows interindividual comparisons by scaling differences among subjects with respect to some psychological attribute. The most widely used psychometric scaling method is classical test theory. The properties of classical test theory pain scores are limited to the observed range of pain scores in a given sample, to the specific conditions in a given sample that are the source of pain (e.g. surgery vs. cancer), and to a particular pain survey. The reliability and meaning of classical test theory scores differ for subjects who have higher or lower amounts of pain, have different painful conditions, or are given a different pain survey. Thus, classical test theory pain scores cannot be used to compare dissimilar patient groups or painful conditions, especially if different pain surveys are used. A different psychometric scaling method, item response theory, produces scores with properties that are not limited to an observed score range, specific conditions, or a particular pain survey, and may thus be better for making such comparisons. To compare the two psychometric methods, data were obtained from 335 subjects who rated their clinical pain using 15 words. The psychometric scaling methods were compared using standardized residuals (data fit), standard errors of measurement (score precision), and a graphical plot of predicted scores against scale scores (bias). The item response theory scores demonstrated better data fit and less bias than did the classical test theory scores. In addition to superior psychometric properties, item response theory scores have several other important theoretical and practical advantages.

### Metabolomics and microbiomics: new potential strategies in chronic pain syndrome [^285a971d]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, chronic pain is increasing proportionally with the age of subjects ranging from 14.3% in 18–25-year-olds to 62% in the over 75 age group. The number of subjects with chronic pain in the USA is calculated to be close to 100 million, with an annual expenditure near to $635 million. These numbers are likely to increase further due to aging people and better treatment of long-term conditions such as stroke and cancer.

Nowadays, it is essential to emphasize that the management of this condition is affected by at least two significant gaps of knowledge: 1) an objective measure of the intensity of pain, 2) a univocal identification of the molecular basis and pathways of chronic pain. The former is still performed by applying standard tools to interview the patient about the intensity, quality, and duration of the sensation. Everyone reacts uniquely to a given painful stimulus, based on experience and what is called his/her own "pain threshold", and each person can assess, according to its parameter, how severe pain is affecting him or herself. Measurement tools in pain medicine range from unidimensional intensity-oriented tools to multidimensional questionnaire, such that they provide useful hints for recognizing the different pain phenotypes and assess therapy.

The most used pain scale is called Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). VAS is a one-dimensional approach that consists of a 10 cm horizontal or vertical line with the two extreme values labelled as "No pain" and "worst possible pain". In this case, the patient is asked to place a mark on the line where the level corresponds to the perceived intensity of pain. The distance in centimeters from the lower end of the line to the patient's sign is used as a numerical index of pain intensity. A more sophisticated evaluation method is the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) which represents a multidimensional feeling that includes different sensations of pain such as quantitative, qualitative, and unpleasantness of pain.

Undoubtedly, the subjectivity of pain experience precludes the possibility of a true measure. For this reason, it is crucial to introduce and develop new methods for identifying molecular and biochemical alterations induced by pain. In this regard, genomics approaches led to the discovery of heritability features, which mainly were characteristic of rare human pain disorders.

### A cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire-2: Chinese version in patients with chronic visceral pain [^bf0ab3f4]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, the EFA was conducted to demonstrate the variability among the 22 items of the SF-MPQ-2-CN. Four components (continuous, intermittent, predominantly neuropathic, and affective) were extracted with a variance of 73.55%, a finding that is consistent with those of the original version of the SF-MPQ-2 (Table 4). Moreover, the RMSEA, a CFA model index for intermittent and affective subscales, showed a poor fit, similar to the results of a previous study on patients with acute low back pain. The reasons for this bias remain unknown and require further analysis.

It was indeed difficult to use the SF-MPQ-2-CN to evaluate the patients with pain countrywide, unless they spoke Mandarin. There was a large variety of dialects across various regions and a wide range of educational levels from urban and rural areas. Further efforts should be made to adapt the SF-MPQ-2-CN by language modification and simplification and to broaden the availability of pain assessment across a larger population in China. Moreover, chronic pain was classified into seven groups in the ICD-11, including primary pain, cancer pain, postsurgical and posttraumatic pain, neuropathic pain, headache and orofacial pain, visceral pain, and musculoskeletal pain. Evaluation of the validity and sensitivity of the SF-MPQ-2-CN in Chinese patients with various classes of chronic pain would be necessary and useful. Because the SF-MPQ-2-CN is not specific for the assessment of neuropathic pain, translation and validation of neuropathic pain assessment tools in Standard Mandarin Chinese language is of critical importance.–

Several limitations existed in the present study. First, the sample size was relatively small and this might have influenced the results. Second, the analyzed sample included only patients with chronic visceral pain. Therefore, comparisons with other types of pain were not possible.

In conclusion, the reliability and validity of the SF-MPQ-2-CN were confirmed in patients with chronic visceral pain in China. The SF-MPQ-2-CN is a promising scale that can be used as a general tool in medical research and routine clinical practice for pain assessment in China. The present study provided new evidence for cross-cultural application of the original SF-MPQ-2.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^4a8374b2]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Guideline Statement 2 — baseline voiding symptoms and pain levels should be obtained in order to measure subsequent treatment effects, and very low voiding frequencies or high voided volumes should prompt a diligent search for an alternate diagnosis. At least a one-day voiding log should be used to establish the presence of a low volume frequency voiding pattern characteristic of IC/BPS, and these values can then be used to determine if a clinically significant response to treatment has occurred. Self-report instruments such as the Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI), ICSI, or ICPI can be used to establish a standardized baseline for later evaluation of treatment response; however, these self-report instruments are only useful to establish baseline symptom values and they are not valid tools for establishing a diagnosis. Validated questionnaires such as the GUPI or the ICSI are useful to gather comprehensive symptom information, a 1 to 10 Likert-style VAS can capture pain intensity, and patients should be queried about pain characteristics or offered a pain adjective checklist (e.g. McGill Pain Questionnaire – Short Form). Patients should be asked if their pain is worsened with bladder filling ("painful bladder filling") and/or if strong urge to urinate was due to pain, pressure, or discomfort ("painful urgency"), since these are characteristic symptoms of IC/BPS.

### Pain relief that matters to patients: systematic review of empirical studies assessing the minimum clinically important difference in acute pain [^b06a422f]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pain intensity was assessed at baseline and a single follow-up measurement in 14 studies, while it was assessed at multiple (from 2 to 16) follow-ups with intervals between 10 and 45 minutes in 23 studies. The latter group then derived their outcome as the summarised mean difference in pain score from the patients' previous pain assessment when they reported minimum relief (i.e. a series of 'moving baselines'). In eight of these studies, the P values of analyses were adjusted for correlation between estimates, for example, with Generalised Estimation Equation, while the remaining studies either made no adjustment or did not report this. Access to individual patient data increased the number of studies with adjusted estimates to 11.

In 10 studies, the MCID was defined as a numeric change for all patients with minimum change, regardless of whether pain had improved or worsened. After contacting authors, separate estimates for pain relief were available from eight of these.

MCID regardless of analytical approach

Standardised to a 100-mm scale, the absolute MCID in 30 studies ranged from 8 to 40 mm, and the relative difference in 15 studies ranged from 13% to 85%.

### Exploring the role of pictograms in the comprehension of pain [^29188d6f]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is both difficult to see and to articulate and this is challenging for both patients and clinicians. The aim of this study was to develop and test pictograms to describe different pain qualities.

Methods

22 pictograms were developed for evaluation based on pain qualities of the short form McGill Pain Questionnaire, version 2 (SF-MPQ-2). An online matching survey was conducted and disseminated via social media in 2021.

Results

An overall matching of 66% or higher between pictogram and pain qualities descriptors was considered a proper matching. This study was carried out internationally (males = 57, age = 41y.o. ± 16; females = 155, age = 41y.o. ± 17) and in Poland (males = 49, age = 35y.o. ± 17; females = 164, age = 35y.o. ± 16). There were 14 pictograms that did not achieve 66% matching in any country. 8 pictograms mutually in all subgroups achieved a matching score of ≥ 66% regardless of geographic location, sex, income, or education level.

Discussion and Conclusions

These 8 pictograms can be used clinically once they have been redrawn to improve consistency, and future research in the design of pictograms representing pain qualities of the SF-MPQ-2 should focus on design improvements for the remaining 14 pain qualities with poor comprehensibility.

### Mirror therapy for the management of phantom limb pain: a single-center experience [^7ba50e32]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Phantom limb pain (PLP) can have devastating consequences, affecting up to 90% of amputees. PLP is associated with analgesia dependence and impaired quality of life. Mirror therapy (MT) is a novel treatment that has been applied in other pain syndromes. We prospectively evaluated MT in the management of PLP.

Methods

A prospective study of patients recruited between 2008 and 2020 who underwent unilateral major limb amputation, with a healthy contralateral limb. Participants were invited to attend weekly MT sessions. Pain in the 7 days prior to each MT session was scored on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS: 0–10 mm) and the short form McGill pain questionnaire.

Results

Ninety eight patients (68 males and 30 females) aged 17–89 years were recruited over 12 years. Forty four percent of patients had amputations due to peripheral vascular disease. Over an average of 2.5 sessions, the final treatment score on the VAS scale was 2.6 (standard deviation ± 3.0) with a reduction of 4.5 points on VAS score. As a comparison using the short form McGill pain questionnaire scoring system, the average final treatment score was 3.2 (± 5.0) with 91% overall improvement.

Conclusions

MT is a very powerful and effective intervention for PLP. It is an exciting addition to the armory of vascular surgeons in the management of this condition.

### Rational treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy with capsaicin 8% patch: from pain relief towards disease modification [^5837a926]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical symptoms and pain assessment scales

Patients were given a study diary to complete starting on the day of screening and continuing for the next 7 days. The diary collected numerical pain rating scores (NPRS) twice daily. An 11-point numerical rating scale (NRPS), with the 0 point being "no pain" and the 10 point being "pain as bad as you can imagine", was used to describe "pain on average in the last 24 hrs" for spontaneous and evoked pain. After 7 days of completing this diary, a member of the study team contacted the patients by telephone and averaged the result of their NPRS to determine their eligibility for the study. Only patients with average pain intensity equal or greater than 4/10 on the NPRS for spontaneous pain were eligible to participate further in the study and were advised to continue with the study diary until the end-of-study follow up visit. Symptoms were also assessed using the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2). The standard Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) was recorded.

### A cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire-2: Chinese version in patients with chronic visceral pain [^2cbcf261]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Translation and procedures

To obtain a Chinese version of the SF-MPQ-2, multiple translation procedures were performed according to Beaton's guidelines that have been used for cross-cultural adaptation of health-related questionnaires. The SF-MPQ-2 was translated into Standard Mandarin Chinese (SF-MPQ-2-CN) by two translators (one is a neuroscientist and the other is a physician specializing in pain medicine). These two translators independently produced two primary SF-MPQ-2 Chinese versions. A third reconciled version was then completed based on a comparison of the former two versions. The fourth version was a translation of the Chinese version back into English and was produced by two additional translators, who had no knowledge of the contents of the original questionnaire. Any discrepancies in the fourth version from these two translators were resolved in the fifth version (the SF-MPQ-2-CN used in the present study) by an expert committee of the Institute for Functional Brain Disorders and Institute for Biomedical Sciences of Pain at Fourth Military Medical University. In order to determine the readability and understandability of the preliminary SF-MPQ-2-CN, it was eventually distributed in a pilot study to 79 patients with chronic pain, who were asked about any unclear words, phrases, or concepts. The results of the pilot study showed that the SF-MPQ-2-CN was easily understood by the subjects without significant complaints.

### Extended reality used in the treatment of phantom limb pain: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^54e13631]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

2.6 Outcomes

The primary outcome was the change in PLP intensity measured by the difference in the Pain Rating Index (PRI) between baseline (visit 0) and end of treatment (visit 15). The PRI is a continuous variable computed as the sum of the scores for all descriptors of the Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Each pain descriptor describes one of 15 different qualities of pain and related symptoms and is rated on an intensity scale as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, or 3 = severe, giving a PRI that ranges from 0 to 45. Secondary outcomes considered different aspects related to PLP and consisted of the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), which is a single-item survey to determine the patient's perception of treatment effectiveness and is rated on a 7-point scale from 'no change (or condition has worsened)' to 'a great deal better' (range 1–7); the PRI change between baseline and follow-up assessments; the PRI defined as a dichotomous variable, to indicate the presence of a clinically meaningful reduction in pain (CMRP; > 50% pain decrease); the Weighted Pain Distribution (WPD), which aims at quantifying the time-varying nature of chronic pain by summing scores of pain ratings during the day, weighted by the amount of time spent in each pain level (range 1–5) and PLP intensity on the NRS.

Additional exploratory outcomes included pain frequency, quality of pain, intrusion of pain in activities of daily living and sleep, disability associated with pain, pain self-efficacy, mood, presence of catastrophizing thinking, health-related quality of life, expectancy of benefit, quality of the patient–provider relationship, and judgment about the credibility of the used treatment. In addition, pain medication changes were recorded at each treatment session. Outcomes were evaluated by the blind evaluators in person at the end of every treatment session. Outcomes were also evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months posttreatment. To incentivize the completion of the follow-up, the patients were given the choice to participate in these assessments at the clinic or using a phone interview. When possible, follow-up assessments were also conducted with participants who had discontinued the treatment. Lists of the assessments conducted at each visit are presented in Table 2. Details about the outcome measures are provided in the published study protocoland supplementary appendix.

### Measuring pain intensity in older patients: a comparison of five scales [^0b7db45f]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The NRS consists of numbers (often, integers from 0 to 10, which are used in the 11-point NRS) where 0 indicates "No pain" and the highest number (e.g. 10) indicates a severe level of pain, such as "Worst pain imaginable". We used the 11-point NRS in the current study. The participants were asked to select the number that best represented their pain intensity, and the number selected represented their NRS score.

Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS is a line (usually, 10-cm long, like the one used in this study) with the left end labeled as "No pain" and the right end labeled an extreme level of pain, such as "Worst pain imaginable". With the VAS, respondents are asked to make a mark anywhere on the line that represents their pain intensity at or somewhere between the 2 extremes. The measured length from the "No pain" end to the mark made by the participants in cm (e.g. somewhere between 0 and 10 for a 10 cm long line) represents their VAS pain intensity score.

### Pain experiences and intrapersonal change among patients with chronic non-cancer pain after using a pain diary: a mixed-methods study [^b88194c6]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Quantitative data collection

Demographic data were recorded including age, gender, pain history (diagnosis, location), pain category (nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, or mixed), duration of pain, education level, employment, and medication.

Other quantitative data were collected from three sources:

Thai Brief Pain Inventory (Thai-BPI)
Thai Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (Thai-SF-MPQ-2)
Daily and weekly quantitative data, written in pain diary as shown below.

Participants completed the Thai-BPI and the Thai-SF-MPQ-2 at their first visit before receiving a pain diary (baseline), and at 4 weeks follow-up.

Thai BPI

The Thai BPI includes the following elements:

body pain mapping
pain intensity: 1) worst pain, 2) least pain, 3) average pain intensity during last 24 hours, and 4) pain right now (rated on a scale from 0 to 10; 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain)
pain interference in: 1) normal work, 2) walking ability, 3) general activity, 4) enjoyment of life, 5) mood, 6) relationship, and 7) sleep (0 = no interference, 10 = most disturbance)
a question about current pain medication (name, indication, dose, route, and start date)
a question about how the participant rated their improvement in the past 24 hours.

Thai SF-MPQ-2

The Thai SF-MPQ-2 includes 22 pain characteristics that represent four aspects of pain, each rated on a numerical scale from 1 to 10:

continuous pain (six characteristics: throbbing, cramping, gnawing, aching, heavy pain, and tender)
intermittent pain (six characteristics: shooting, stabbing, sharp, splitting, electrical-shock, and piercing)
neuropathic pain (six characteristics: hot-burning, cold-freezing, pain caused by light touch, itching, tingling, or pins and needles, numbness)
affective aspect (four characteristics: tiring-exhausting, sickening, fearful, and punishing-cruel).

Both tools complement each other as they examine different pain aspects of the pain experience. For example, BPI measures pain interference and average pain score, whereas the SF-MPQ-2 examines the nociceptive component of pain (both continuous and intermittent), as well as the neuropathic and affective components.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^a7fa4ac7]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy due to single level degenerative disease — comparative surgical outcomes for ACD, ACDF, and ACDFI are reported with consecutive assignment and two-year follow-up; validated measures included the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), SF-36, and a General Health Outcome Measure. Three patients in the ACD group were lost to follow-up; clinical results improved to one year then plateaued. At two years, arm pain was completely absent in 92%, 93%, and 100% of ACD, ACDF, and ACDFI patients, respectively, and neck pain was absent in 83%, 80% and 73%, respectively. At two years, fusion rate on radiograph was 67%, 93%, and 100% respectively, and among ACD patients, 75% had kyphosis at two years. The paper states that clinical outcomes are similar when comparing ACD to ACDF, with or without plating, but radiographic outcomes were worse with ACD with significant loss of lordosis, and it cautions that validity may be limited by very small sample size.

### A cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire-2: Chinese version in patients with chronic visceral pain [^707866b4]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we most likely provided the first report of the validity and reliability of the SF-MPQ-2-CN for the evaluation of patients with chronic or subacute visceral pain in certain Chinese populations. The reliability and validity of the SF-MPQ-2-CN for patients with chronic visceral pain were confirmed using internal consistency analysis and the EFA, respectively. Furthermore, Cronbach's alpha coefficients indicated internal consistency (Table 3), a finding that is consistent with the results of the original study conducted by Dworkin et al. Furthermore, the construct validity of the SF-MPQ-2-CN was also found to be satisfactory. The ICC, calculated by the test–retest method, also indicated excellent reliability, with values of 0.909, 0.973, 0.988, 0.952, and 0.927, for the continuous, intermittent, predominantly neuropathic, and affective subscales and the total scale, respectively. These values were higher than those previously reported by researchers in Japan and Iran, using scales in their respective native languages. The results of the present study were consistent with those of the original English version of the SF-MPQ-2 that yielded values ranging from 0.73 to 0.95and those of two translations in Iranian (0.941)and Japanese (0.83). These findings suggest that the original English version of the SF-MPQ-2 can be cross-culturally applied in different languages for the evaluation of clinical pain.

### A cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire-2: Chinese version in patients with chronic visceral pain [^6721488f]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Sample characteristics

As shown in Table 1, 145 patients with an average age of 63.87 years (SD 8.99) participated in the study, with an age range of 50–89 years. The total sample included 59 (40.69%) females and 86 (59.31%) males. Most of the participants were urban residents (61.38%), and the others were rural residents (38.62%). The duration of pain ranged from 1 to 40 years, with a mean of 7.51 ± 0.69 years. Among the participants, 86.81% were married and living with their partners, whereas the others were divorced (5.56%), widowed (4.86%), unmarried (2.08%), or separated (1.69%). Out of all the participants, 28.47% graduated from college or a higher level of education; 36.11% completed technical, secondary, or high school; and another 36.11% attended school up to a primary education level (junior middle school level and below; Table 1). It was noteworthy that the number of employed subjects was 57.93%, representing the highest ratio of all subjects. The other occupational categories included those who were retired (28.97%), disabled (9.65%), or unemployed (3.45%; Table 1).

Reliability analysis

The ICC for 22 individual items was highly correlated between the test–retest, with a range from 0.819 (aching pain) to 0.994 (tingling or "pins and needles"; Table 2). Moreover, the ICC for subscales of the SF-MPQ-2-CN indicated excellent reliability between the test–retest (Table 3). Furthermore, the ICC for the total SF-MPQ-2-CN also presented excellent reliability with a value of 0.927 (Table 3). Cronbach's alpha coefficient also revealed good internal consistency for the total scale and subscales of the SF-MPQ-2-CN at the primary and secondary visits, respectively (Table 3).

### An integrated quantitative index for measuring chronic multisite pain: the multiple areas of pain (MAP) study [^fd83e424]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite the high prevalence of chronic multisite pain, there is little consensus on methods to characterize it. Commonly used assessments report only one dimension of pain, that is, intensity, thus ignoring the spatial aspect of pain. We developed a novel pain quantification index, the Integrated Pain Quantification Index (IPQI), on a scale of 0 to 1 that integrates multiple distinct pain measures into a single value, thus representing multidimensional pain information with a single value.

Design

Single-visit, noninterventional, epidemiological study.

Setting

Fourteen outpatient multidisciplinary pain management programs.

Patients

Patients with chronic pain of the trunk and/or limbs for at least six months with average overall pain intensity of at least 5 on the numeric rating scale.

Methods

Development of IPQI was performed in a large population (N = 810) of chronic pain patients from the Multiple Areas of Pain (MAP) study.

Results

Prevalence of two or more noncontiguous painful areas was at 88.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.86–0.90), with a mean of 6.3 areas (SD = 5.57 areas). Prevalence of more than 10% body area in pain was at 52.8% (95% CI = 0.49–0.56), with a mean at 16.1% (17.16%). On average, IPQI values were near the middle of the scale, with mean and median IPQI at 0.52 (SD = 0.13) and 0.55, respectively. The IPQI was generalizable and clinically relevant across all domains recommended by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials.

Conclusions

IPQI provided a single pain score for representing complex, multidimensional pain information on one scale and has implications for comparing pain populations across longitudinal clinical trials.

### Measurement properties of the SF-MPQ-2 neuropathic qualities subscale in persons with CRPS: validity, responsiveness, and rasch analysis [^2a4da2d0]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to conduct classical psychometric evaluation and Rasch analysis on the Neuropathic Qualities subscale of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 utilizing scores from persons with complex regional pain syndrome to consider reliability and person separation, validity (including unidimensionality), and responsiveness in this population.

Methods

Secondary analysis of longitudinal data from persons with acute complex regional pain syndrome was utilized for analysis of the psychometric properties and fit to the Rasch model of the Neuropathic Qualities subscale. We followed an iterative process of Rasch analysis to evaluate and address data fitting challenges.

Results

Repeated measures from 59 persons meeting the Budapest criteria were used for analysis. Both item-total correlations and unidimensionality analyses supported theoretical construct validity; all convergent construct validity hypotheses were also supported. Responsiveness was demonstrated comparing baseline and one-year data at d = 0.92, with a standardized response mean of 0.97. Data were able to fit the Rasch model, but all Neuropathic Qualities items had disordered thresholds that required rescoring. Additionally, local dependency and differential item function were addressed by "bundling", suggesting that no further item reduction would be possible.

Conclusions

This study provided preliminary support for the validity and responsiveness of the Neuropathic Qualities subscale in persons with complex regional pain syndrome. Rasch analysis further endorses use of the Neuropathic Qualities subscale as a "stand-alone" measure for neuropathic features, but with substantial background data transformations. Replication with larger samples is recommended to increase confidence in these findings.

### Different measures, different outcomes? Survey into the effectiveness of chronic pain clinics in a london tertiary referral center [^d2178d37]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

The picture of changing outcomes became even more convoluted if subjective patient improvement was taken into account as well. Now, 56% patients reported considerable benefit. Therefore, depending on how outcome was measured, pain clinics seemed to make an impact on 0 to nearly 60% of patients. In accordance with previous reports, 90% of patients were also satisfied with the service. Hence, the variability across all assessed outcomes in this study was very large, possibly not only reflecting the multifaceted nature of pain but also the shortcomings of currently available measurement tools. Consequently, the characteristics and purpose of these variables need to be carefully considered before application.

Assessment tools used in pain medicine can be broadly divided into uni- and multidimensional, depending on how many aspects of pain they are appraising.NRS scores, for instance, are widely used for self-reported unidimensional evaluation of pain intensity. However, the reliability of single ratings has been questioned, and the use of composite NRS scores advocated instead. Further, due to unresolved issues surrounding the translation of assessments into treatments, Moore et al even suggested their abandonment in clinical practice for simple questions, such as "Is pain more than mild?" with dichotomous outcomes. The conversion of scores into pain categories as done here comes close to this suggestion. However, its retrospective nature might have introduced bias, as individual patients might have disagreed with their classification. Finally, all tools relying on patient self-report depend on intact cognitive function. Since there is mounting evidence indicating this to be altered in chronic pain, another risk of bias might therefore hamper current methods of pain assessment.

Patient satisfaction and subjective improvement are multidimensional variables, which amalgamate several factors that define a patient's pain or service experience. 16,35 Both are measures of global impression of change, which have been recommended as critical outcome parameters in clinical trials. 16,35 However, satisfaction, in particular, is often difficult to interpret. It might, for instance, mean satisfaction with service provision or effect of treatments. In addition, it might also reflect satisfaction with communication between patient and health care provider or be an expression of patients' emotional states, such as the feeling of gaining control over the pain again. Therefore, it is not necessarily specific for pain. Here, because of its association with "treatments helping" and "number of comorbidities" but independence of pain intensity and QoL indices, it likely represented a mixed response. The finding that 74% of praise and complaints were about nonmedical issues further supported this notion.

### Chronic pain has a strong impact on quality of life in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy [^cf31f340]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Measures

Pain

The Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF‐MPQ) was used to report pain. The SF‐MPQ is widely used, well‐validated, and reliable and has previously been used in FSHD1. 19 The SF‐MPQ consists of 15 descriptors (11 sensory and 4 affective) which are rated on an intensity scale as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate or 3 = severe, with higher scores representing more pain. Sensory (ranging from 0 to 33), affective (ranging from 0 to 12), and total pain scores (ranging from 0 to 45) and Present Pain Intensity Index (ranging from 0 to 5) were analyzed. An FSHD specific PROM, named universal pain assessment tool, developed by the multi‐disciplinary team at JWMDRC was also used. The universal pain assessment tool is in the process of validation and it includes sections on pain intensity, current pain and chronic pain, and in addition questions regarding medication and other nonpharmacological therapies (sections of the universal pain assessment tool used in this study are shown in Supplementary Table S1, which is available online). For the purpose of the study, "current pain" was defined as any pain experienced in the last 7 days and "chronic pain" as any persistent pain experienced for at least 12 weeks within a year in the last 5 years. The universal pain assessment tool clearly provided the time definition of current and chronic pain according to study pain definitions. To analyze pain intensity, the pain was considered to be severe when reported as horrible or excruciating.

Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life Questionnaire

Patients completed the Individualised Neuromuscular Quality of Life Questionnaire (INQoL), a widely used and well‐validated neuromuscular disease specific measure of QoL. 20, 21 The final score for each section and total INQoL score is presented as a percentage of the maximum detrimental impact where 100 is the greatest impact on QoL.

### Low back pain: critical assessment of various scales [^09b38e16]. European Spine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To study the various pain assessment tools based on their psychometric properties and ease of use.

Methods

Published articles on psychometric properties of pain tools were accessed and data collected for low back pain (LBP)-specific tools, generic tools, neuropathic LBP tools, tools for cognitively impaired patients, and tools for acute LBP.

Results

Among the LBP-specific tools, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) have good construct validity and reliability, and responsiveness over short intervals. Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (QBPDS) gauges only disability and sleep. Among the generic tools, McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI), and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) show good responsiveness, but BPI is the only tool validated for LBP. Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) and Short Form-MPQ-2 (SF-MPQ-2) are both reliable tools for neuropathic LBP. For cognitively impaired patients, Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD), Abbey Pain Scale (APS), and Doloplus-2 are all reliable tools, but PAINAD has good construct validity. For acute pain, Clinically Aligned Pain Assessment (CAPA) is reliable and responsive, but presently, unidimensional tools and SF-MPQ-2 are the tools most preferred.

Conclusion

Based on psychometric properties and ease of use, the best tools for LBP seem to be RMDQ/ODI (among LBP-specific tools), BPI (among generic tools), SF-MPQ-2/NPS (for neuropathic LBP), PAINAD (for cognitively impaired patients), and unidimensional tools and SF-MPQ-2 (for acute pain). Overall, BPI seems to be a tool that can be relied upon the most. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

### Pain relief that matters to patients: systematic review of empirical studies assessing the minimum clinically important difference in acute pain [^51881649]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We included 37 studies (8479 patients) assessing the MCID in acute pain, of which 35 used the mean change approach and seven used the threshold approach. Meta-analyses found considerable heterogeneity between studies and, consequently, no single value of minimum clinical important difference could be meaningfully determined. Study results ranged widely both when they were reported as absolute change (from 8 to 40 mm) and as relative change from baseline (from 13 to 85%). The median of study results based on the mean change approach was 17 (IQR 14 to 23) mm and 23 (IQR 18 to 36) % for absolute and relative values, respectively. Reasons for heterogeneity were explored and baseline pain was identified as a cause of variation in absolute, but not relative, outcomes. In addition, the definition of minimum clinically important change and the use of multiple assessments per patient influenced study results. High heterogeneity was also found for assessments of substantial clinically important difference as well as for worsening of pain.

Strengths and limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of MCIDs in acute pain. We identified 37 studies involving over 8000 patients and a broad range of clinical conditions, study approaches and pain scales. We gained access to unpublished data from 10 studies, including individual patient data from seven studies (918 patients). This ensured high data quality and uniform analysis, and enabled an adequate assessment of the association with baseline pain avoiding the risk of ecological fallacy inherent to aggregated study-level data. The median results of studies providing individual patient data was comparable with the remaining studies and we have no reason to believe these studies were not representative. Association with baseline pain has been reported from individual studies, but the present review is the first comprehensive assessment of the impact of baseline pain across studies. In addition, we identified variation in study designs (single or multiple assessments) and definitions of patients with minimum relief as factors influencing the MCID.

### Optimal strategies for reporting pain in clinical trials and systematic reviews: recommendations from an OMERACT 12 workshop [^89d0603f]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Pain is a patient-important outcome, but current reporting in randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews is often suboptimal, impeding clinical interpretation and decision making.

Methods

A working group at the 2014 Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT 12) was convened to provide guidance for reporting treatment effects regarding pain for individual studies and systematic reviews.

Results

For individual trials, authors should report, in addition to mean change, the proportion of patients achieving 1 or more thresholds of improvement from baseline pain (e.g., ≥ 20%, ≥ 30%, ≥ 50%), achievement of a desirable pain state (e.g., no worse than mild pain), and/or a combination of change and state. Effects on pain should be accompanied by other patient-important outcomes to facilitate interpretation. When pooling data for metaanalysis, authors should consider converting all continuous measures for pain to a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and use the established, minimally important difference (MID) of 10 mm, and the conventionally used, appreciably important differences of 20 mm, 30 mm, and 50 mm, to facilitate interpretation. Effects ≤ 0.5 units suggest a small or very small effect. To further increase interpretability, the pooled estimate on the VAS should also be transformed to a binary outcome and expressed as a relative risk and risk difference. This transformation can be achieved by calculating the probability of experiencing a treatment effect greater than the MID and the thresholds for appreciably important differences in pain reduction in the control and intervention groups.

Conclusion

Presentation of relative effects regarding pain will facilitate interpretation of treatment effects.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^38caa616]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Limitations of these guidelines — evidence base and applicability: certainty of evidence was often low or very low with very limited direct evidence in individuals with sickle cell disease, typically from small, noncomparative studies and with a significant lack of phase 3 randomized controlled trials. Due to this paucity, the panel turned to indirect evidence. Pediatric evidence was frequently low, very low, or uncertain, limiting the ability to make recommendations and underscoring the need for pediatric-specific investigations. Recognition of chronic pain as a distinct entity in sickle cell disease is recent, the evidence base was not expansive, and distinguishing acute from chronic outcomes was often difficult. Because self-report is the gold standard of pain assessment, standardized self-report assessments and outcomes are imperative; variability in study outcomes hindered pooling and led the panel to call for validated, agreed-upon end points for sickle cell disease pain to enable comparisons of efficacy and effectiveness. The panel also notes that the prioritized questions addressed may not constitute the full list of clinically important questions.

Participants' outcomes

Participants' QoL (e.g. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ‐C30), Symptom Questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)). The EORTC QLQ‐C30 is specifically developed for people with cancer, extensively validated across cancer types and stages, and widely used in international trials. FACT is prioritised second for multidimensional, cancer‐specific measures with strong psychometric properties and is validated in diverse cancer populations. However, we will also consider other relevant scales for inclusion.
Depression (e.g. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)). The PHQ is firstly prioritised, validated against gold‐standard psychiatric interviews in people with cancer, and confirmed to have high sensitivity and specificity. The BDI is secondly prioritised for the wide use, validation, and multidimensional assessment of depressive symptoms. These will be the primary tools used in this study. However, we will consider other relevant scales for inclusion.
Communication enhancement (improved communication with providers e.g. Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Surveys, Health Care Communication Questionnaire (HCCQ)). The CAHPS is prioritised for its validation with strong psychometric properties, and it measures care delivery rather than satisfaction. The HCCQ is secondly prioritised for its validity. These will be the primary tools utilised in this study. However, we will consider other relevant scales, including those developed by the study authors, for inclusion.
Pain assessment or control (e.g. Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ)). NRS is prioritised for its ease of use, sensitivity, and recommendation by consensus groups. This is followed by VAS for its reliability and sensitivity to change. BPI and MPQ are suitable for the comprehensive characterisation of pain.
Satisfaction with care (e.g. Satisfaction with Hospital Care Questionnaire)
Days in the intensive care unit (ICU)
Home death (yes/no)

### Greek mcGill pain questionnaire: validation and utility in cancer patients [^5f9c8e51]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

In 1968, Melzack and Casey suggested that there are three major psychological dimensions of pain: sensory, affect, evaluative. These categories interact with one another to provide quantitative and qualitative information on the components of pain. In 1975, Melzack developed the McGill Pain Questionnaire, which is composed of four major parts and evaluates the qualities of pain. The aim of this study was to assess the applicability, reliability, and validity of the McGill Pain Questionnaire on a sample of Greek cancer patients receiving palliative treatment. It was administered to 114 cancer patients before the initiation of the palliative treatment, and then to 80 cancer patients during the treatment 7 days later. The results indicated that scale reliability was very good (0.95–0.97). During the pretreatment period, correlations between Present Rating Index (PRI), Present Pain Intensity (PPI), and Number of Words Chosen (NWC) ranged between 0.42 and 0.92. During the post-treatment time, the correlations ranged between 0.28 and 0.91. Only 21.8% of the words met a criterion of 30% for representativeness on the first administration of the questionnaire, and 9% met this criterion on the second. Validity was satisfactory (P < 0.005) according to "responsiveness to changes in time", as there was a statistical difference between the pretreatment and post-treatment time. Patients presented a desirable level of convergent construct validity (P < 0.05) concerning their performance status. Exploratory factor analysis was examined and two factors with eigenvalue over 1 were extracted, and they accounted for 95.2% of the variance. These results support the Greek-MPQ as a reliable and valid measure for evaluating the qualities of cancer pain in patients receiving palliative care.

### A cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire-2: Chinese version in patients with chronic visceral pain [^d3a69694]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The present study aimed to develop a culturally appropriate and functional Standard Mandarin Chinese translation of the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2) and to assess its reliability and validity for characterizing chronic visceral pain in Chinese patients.

Background

The SF-MPQ-2 has been widely used in studies of pain epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment, and even pathophysiologic mechanisms to assess the major symptoms of clinical pain. Previous reports have shown favorable reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the SF-MPQ-2 in diverse samples of patients with chronic and acute pain. However, a culturally appropriate, functional Chinese version of the scale has never been developed.

Methods

Beaton's guidelines were used for the translation and back-translation procedures. Patients (n = 145) with chronic visceral pain were recruited to complete the Standard Mandarin Chinese version of the SF-MPQ-2 (SF-MPQ-2-CN), of which 41 were asked to complete the SF-MPQ-2-CN a second time, 3 days after the initial visit. The test-retest reliability was quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Cronbach's alpha was calculated to assess internal consistency. Possible components were determined by exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation, and a value of 0.4 was considered requisite for the loading of each factor.

Results

The ICC for subscales ranged from 0.909 to 0.952, and that of the total scale was 0.927, suggesting excellent reliability and validity of the SF-MPQ-2-CN. Cronbach's alpha for subscales ranged from 0.896 to 0.916, and that of the total scale was 0.836 and 0.831 for primary and secondary visits, respectively. The factor loading matrix of the SF-MPQ-2-CN ranged from 0.734 to 0.901 for each of the following subscales: continuous, intermittent, neuropathic, and affective, revealing four components similar to the original scale.

Conclusion

The reliability and validity of the SF-MPQ-2-CN scale are statistically acceptable for the evaluation of Chinese patients with chronic visceral pain.

### Safety and efficacy of esreboxetine in patients with fibromyalgia: an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^2653c81f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Esreboxetine is an investigational, highly selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that has been reported to have antinociceptive effects in preclinical pain models.

Objective

This study assessed the efficacy and safety profile of esreboxetine in the management of fibromyalgia.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients aged ≥ 18 years who met American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia. Eligible patients were required to have a score ≥ 40 mm on the 100-mm visual analog scale of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire at screening and randomization, and a mean score ≥ 4 on an 11-point pain rating scale (from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain) based on the weekly mean pain score in the week before randomization. After a 1-week baseline period and a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to receive esreboxetine or placebo for 8 weeks, followed by a 1-week follow-up period. Esreboxetine dosing was started at 2 mg/d and was escalated by 2 mg/d every 2 weeks until attainment of a dose of 8 mg/d or the maximum tolerated dose. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to week 8 in weekly mean pain scores, as derived from patients' daily pain ratings on the 11-point scale. Additional primary efficacy outcomes included changes in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score and the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). The safety profile was evaluated based on observed and spontaneously reported adverse events, laboratory tests, and other safety measures.

Results

One hundred thirty-four patients were randomized to each study group, but 1 patient in the placebo group did not receive treatment. Thus, the study population consisted of 267 patients (89.5% female; 88.4% white; mean age, ∼50 years [range, 20–84 years]). Twenty-seven patients in each group discontinued the study. Adverse events were the most common reason for discontinuation in the esreboxetine group (11 patients), compared with 3 discontinuing due to adverse events in the placebo group. Patient default (withdrawal of consent and loss to follow-up) was the most common reason for discontinuation in the placebo group (13 patients), compared with 10 in the esreboxetine group. The esreboxetine group had significantly greater improvement in the weekly mean pain score compared with the placebo group (mean [SE] change from baseline: -1.55 [0.16] vs -0.99 [0.16], respectively; P = 0.006). A significantly greater percentage of patients in the esreboxetine group reported a ≥ 30% reduction in pain scores compared with the placebo group (37.6% [50/133] vs 22.6% [30/133]; P = 0.004). Esreboxetine was associated with significant improvement compared with placebo in the FIQ total score (mean change from baseline: -15.63 [1.56] vs -8.07 [1.54]; P < 0.001). On the PGIC, significantly more patients in the esreboxetine group than in the placebo group reported their condition much or very much improved (odds ratio = 2.42; 90% CI, 1.549–3.786; P < 0.001). Esreboxetine also was associated with significant improvements in secondary outcomes compared with placebo. These included fatigue, as reflected in scores on the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (mean [SE] change from baseline: -6.39 [0.75] vs -2.82 [0.75], respectively; P < 0.001), and scores on measures of patient function and health-related quality of life, including the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (mean change from baseline: 4.36 [0.59] vs 1.86 [0.59]; P = 0.002), the SF-36 Mental Component Summary (mean change from baseline: 4.25 [0.83] vs 1.81 [0.83]; P = 0.019), and the Sheehan Disability Scale total score (mean change from baseline: -6.50 [0.64] vs -2.79 [0.61]; P < 0.001). Numerically more patients in the esreboxetine group than in the placebo group reported at least one adverse event (71.6% vs 57.1%), most commonly constipation (17.2% vs 5.3%), insomnia (15.7% vs 3.0%), dry mouth (15.7% vs 2.3%), and headache (10.4% vs 2.3%).

Conclusions

In this 8-week trial in patients with fibromyalgia, esreboxetine was associated with significant reductions in pain scores compared with placebo. It was also associated with improvements in outcomes relevant to fibromyalgia, including the PGIC, function, and fatigue. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00357825.

### Pain relief that matters to patients: systematic review of empirical studies assessing the minimum clinically important difference in acute pain [^9660cd12]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 3
Minimum clinically important difference by baseline pain (individual patient data from 7 studies, 918 patients). MCID assessed as the mean change in pain score among patients with minimal improvement of pain, MCID = Minimal Clinically Important Difference (mm reduction on a 100 mm scale). Forest plot of mean pain difference in 723 episodes where patients reported pain to be "a little better" in 7 studies including a total of 918 patients

From individual patient data, we also found that the MCID decreased with increasing time from baseline, from 17 (12 to 21) mm at 30 minutes to 11 (8 to 14) mm at 120 minutes. However, patients' pain level declined accordingly during the multiple follow-ups and estimates expressed as a relative change from the previous assessment therefore did not decline.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^416de1e7]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain — physiotherapy plus psychosocial program (PGAP) versus physiotherapy alone (retrospective matched cohorts): Patients receiving physiotherapy plus a "Progressive Goal Attainment Program (PGAP) psychosocial program (n = 24)" were matched with those receiving "only physiotherapy (n = 24)". Pain and function measures included the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) with Pain Rating Index (PRI), an "11–point numerical rating scale", a "5–minute walk and finger-to-floor test", and psychosocial scales (PDI, PCS, TSK, BDI–II). At 12 months post-treatment contact, there were "no post-treatment differences in pain intensity, number of pain sites, finger–to–floor test, 5–minute walk distance or self-reported disability", but the physiotherapy + PGAP group had lower MPQ–PRI ("F(1,45) = 4.5, p < 0.05"), catastrophizing ("F(1,45) = 5.2, p < 0.05"), fear of movement ("F(1,45) = 5.0, p < 0.05") and depression ("F(1,45) = 23.8, p < 0.001"). The authors note sample-size limitations, and the guideline states, "This study provides Level II evidence that psychosocial treatment improves the outcomes of physiotherapy in treating patients with LBP".

### Assessment of pain in rheumatic diseases [^f1cb09bd]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Pain is the most prominent symptom in people with musculoskeletal disorders, and the most common motivation for patients seeking medical help. However, pain generally is not recorded quantitatively in routine medical care. Over the last three decades, self-report questionnaires have been developed in which a patient may record quantitatively a pain score at baseline and over time to determine whether their condition has improved, remains unchanged, or has worsened. The most robust quantitative pain measure appears to be a simple 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), which can be completed by the patient and scored by a health professional in less than 10 seconds. Quantitative data concerning pain cannot be obtained from any source other than the patient. Quantitative assessment of pain at each visit in routine rheumatology care, along with the assessment of functional disability, global status, and other patient variables, using a patient self-report questionnaire might lead to improved patient care.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes associated with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) or conventional medical management (CMM) for chronic pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^64819cbf]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) compared to conventional medical management (CMM) for patients diagnosed with chronic pain. Furthermore, the study seeks to compare the utilization of analgesics, as well as the long-term outcomes in terms of quality of life and functional capacity.

Data Sources

We systematically searched Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials from inception up to February 2022.

Review Methods

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were set according to the PICOS criteria. We searched for studies in which SCS was compared with CMM alone for chronic pain. Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies and extracted data. Risk of bias assessments were performed according to Cochrane review criteria and Interventional Pain Management Techniques-quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB) criteria.

Results

The present meta-analysis comprised eight studies and included a total of 893 patients. Our findings demonstrate that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in combination with conventional medical management (CMM) is associated with a significant reduction in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain intensity (P = 0.0005) and decreased scores on the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) (P < 0.0001). Moreover, SCS plus CMM was found to improve patients' quality of life, as evidenced by improvements in SF-36 scores (P < 0.00001), EQ-5D utility index (P = 0.008), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (P < 0.00001). Based on the results of four high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the level of evidence supporting the efficacy of SCS for the treatment of painful neuropathy is graded as level I to II. In contrast, there is currently only low-level evidence to support the use of high-frequency stimulation and other chronic pain conditions, which can be attributed to a lack of sufficient randomized controlled trials.

Limitations

The principal limitation of our study is the significant heterogeneity observed among the cohorts investigated. The primary source of this heterogeneity is the fact that spinal cord stimulation is indicated for the treatment of multiple chronic pain conditions. Moreover, variations in the stimulation parameters, differences among manufacturers, and the specific surgical implantation settings contribute to the increased heterogeneity observed in our analyses. To address this issue, we conducted a subgroup analysis based on specific situations and performed evidence synthesis to mitigate the potential impact of heterogeneity. These approaches allow for a more precise interpretation of the results and a more accurate evaluation of the quality of the included studies.

Conclusions

SCS is an effective treatment to relieve the pain level of chronic pain, decrease analgesic usage, and increase long-term quality of life and functional capacity.

### Reliability, validity, and sensitivity measures of expanded and revised version of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2) in Iranian patients with neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain [^96281e26]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the Persian version of the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SF-MPQ-2) in patients with neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain.

Design

Beaton's guideline was used to translate and adapt the SF-MPQ-2 to Persian.

Subjects

One hundred eighty-four patients with subacute and chronic non-neuropathic pain and 74 patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (total 258) attending multidisciplinary pain clinic participated in the study.

Outcome Measures

Internal consistency and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were estimated for participants who had completed the questionnaire in the morning and evening of the first day. The visual analog scale (VAS) and the present pain intensity (PPI) were also recorded to test convergent validity of the questionnaire. Sensitivity to change was examined after a standard treatment and validated by means of the patient global impression of change (PGIC) in addition to VAS and PPI. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to find possible components.

Results

Cronbach's alpha was 0.906, which showed high internal consistency. ICC (0.941) revealed test-retest reliability. There was high correlation between the mean VAS and the mean total score (r = 0.926). Patients in different levels of PPI and PGIC exhibited significant differences among their mean total scores (P < 0.05). EFA revealed four components similar to the original SF-MPQ-2.

Conclusion

The Persian translation of the expanded and revised version of the SF-MPQ-2 is a highly reliable, sensitive, and valid instrument to evaluate pain in patients with and without neuropathic etiology.

### Age differences in postoperative pain are scale dependent: a comparison of measures of pain intensity and quality in younger and older surgical patients [^6db9b3b8]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

As the population ages, research into the assessment of postoperative pain in older patients is urgently needed. The reliability and validity of most pain scales for the assessment of acute postoperative pain in the elderly remain to be demonstrated. The present study reports the analysis of age-related patterns on three pain scales (McGill Pain Questionnaire, MPQ; Present Pain Intensity, PPI; and Visual Analog Scale, VAS) completed by younger (n = 95, mean age = 56.4 ± 5.8 years) and older (n = 105; mean age = 66.8 ± 2.7 years) men following radical prostatectomy. All patients received intravenous morphine via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) throughout the study. On the first 2 postoperative days (POD), patients completed the pain scales and PCA opioid intake was recorded. An interaction was found between amount of opioid self-administered and POD. In both groups, less opioid was administered on POD 2 than POD 1, but the decrease over time was greater in younger than older men. On both PODs, older men self-administered less opioid than younger men. Age differences in pain were dependent on the pain scale used. Older men had significantly lower scores than younger men on the MPQ and PPI but there were no differences on the VAS. Several age differences in the psychometric properties of the scales were evident. On both PODs, the correlation between VAS and MPQ scores was significantly lower in the older than younger group. POD effect sizes did not differ between the scales or age groups suggesting that all three scales have comparable sensitivity within an age group. However, the different results between the scales for the effect of age suggests that the VAS is not sufficiently sensitive to detect age differences. Therefore, age differences in postoperative pain are better captured by verbal descriptions of pain qualities than non-verbal measures of intensity.

### The level of agreement between the numerical rating scale and visual analogue scale for assessing pain intensity in adults with chronic pain [^d8fb61d9]. Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

The numerical rating scale and visual analogue scale are used to quantify pain intensity. However, it has not yet been explored whether these scores are interchangeable in adults with chronic pain. Data from the prospective multicentre cross-sectional INTERVAL study were used to evaluate the one-dimensionality and agreement between numerical rating scale scores and visual analogue scale scores in adults with chronic pain. Pain intensity scores using the numerical rating scale and visual analogue scale were provided by 366 patients with chronic pain for current, average, minimal and maximal pain. To evaluate whether pain intensity scales are completed in accordance with each other, the proportion of patients who satisfied the following condition was calculated: minimal pain intensity ≤ maximal pain intensity. A factor analysis confirmed the one-dimensionality of the pain measures. A significant difference was found between numerical rating scale and visual analogue scale scores for average, current, minimum and maximum pain. Intra-class correlation coefficient estimates ranged from 0.739 to 0.858 and all measures failed to show sufficient and acceptable agreement at the 95% level. The strength of agreement between pain severity categories was classified as 'moderate' for average and minimal pain and 'substantial' for current and maximal pain. The proportion of patients who scored minimal pain ≤ maximal pain was 97.5% for the numerical rating scale and 89.5% for the visual analogue scale. This study failed to show an acceptable agreement between the numerical rating scale and visual analogue scale when pain intensity was rated by adults with chronic pain, despite showing both scales measure the same information.

### Pain rating schema: three distinct subgroups of individuals emerge when rating mild, moderate, and severe pain [^7be8886f]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

In summary, these results provide insights into the underlying variations in the conceptualization of numerical pain intensity across categorical severities, ie, pain rating schema. We found that three general clusters emerged, indicating that three distinct approaches were used to rate pain across a range of conditions and severities. Accordingly, it may be valuable to assess both numerical intensity and categorical severity to better understand how each individual is evaluating their pain experience. For example, this study demonstrates that a pain rating of "4" could be perceived as mild, moderate, or even severe pain, depending on the individual's underlying pain rating schema. Thus, we recommend that clinicians and researchers consider asking both intensity ratings as well as categorical interpretations (ie, "Can you rate your pain on a 0 to 10 scale?" and "Would you classify your pain as mild, moderate, or severe?"). Lastly, subgrouping individuals based on pain schema may benefit pain heterogeneity studies examining the predictors of pain sensitivity or pain phenotypes to better differentiate cognitive assessment from other sources of heterogeneity (eg, physiological or neurochemical). Ultimately, this information may be used to enhance communication between patients and their care providers and allow for improved comparisons across research studies.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol on how best to use non-pharmacologic therapies to manage chronic low back pain and associated depression [^37b0dd8d]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome will be a reduction in the degree of depressive symptoms and pain intensity at the end of the treatment period. Degree of depressive symptoms will be measured as a continuous variable according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), or any other depressive symptoms rating scale with evidence of adequate validity and reliability. Pain intensity will be measured as a continuous variable on any validated scale such as a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), or other rating scale with evidence of adequate validity and reliability.

The secondary outcomes will include:
Total effective rate (as a dichotomous outcome): defined as the proportion of participants with a clinically relevant improvement according to a predefined change in validated depressive symptom and pain intensity rating scales at the end of the treatment period.
Back pain-related function: measured as a continuous variable on any validated scale such as the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Hanover Functional Ability Questionnaire (HFAQ), or other rating scale with evidence of adequate validity and reliability at the end of the treatment period.
Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL): measured as a continuous variable on any validated HRQoL scale such as the Medical Outcomes Study 36/12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36/12), Brief Form of the World Health Organization's Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), or other well-recognized HRQoL scales with evidence of adequate validity and reliability at the end of the treatment period.
Acceptability (dichotomous outcome): defined as the proportion of participants who drop out of the study for any reason during treatment delivery.
Tolerability (dichotomous outcome): defined as the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment due to any adverse events during treatment delivery.
Safety (dichotomous outcome): defined as the proportion of participants who experienced at least one adverse effect during treatment delivery.

### Pain quality descriptors in community-dwelling older adults with nonmalignant pain [^06fc50b8]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

This study aimed to characterize the prevalence of various pain qualities in older adults with chronic nonmalignant pain and determine the association of pain quality to other pain characteristics namely: severity, interference, distribution, and pain-associated conditions. In the population-based MOBILIZE Boston Study, 560 participants aged ≥ 70 years reported chronic pain in the baseline assessment, which included a home interview and clinic exam. Pain quality was assessed using a modified version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) consisting of 20 descriptors from which 3 categories were derived: cognitive/affective, sensory, and neuropathic. Presence of ≥ 2 pain-associated conditions was significantly associated with 18 of the 20 pain quality descriptors. Sensory descriptors were endorsed by nearly all older adults with chronic pain (93%), followed by cognitive/affective (83.4%) and neuropathic descriptors (68.6%). Neuropathic descriptors were associated with the greatest number of pain-associated conditions including osteoarthritis of the hand and knee. More than half of participants (59%) endorsed descriptors in all 3 categories and had more severe pain and interference, and multisite or widespread pain than those endorsing 1 or 2 categories. Strong associations were observed between pain quality and measures of pain severity, interference, and distribution (P < 0.0001). Findings from this study indicate that older adults have multiple pain-associated conditions that likely reflect multiple physiological mechanisms for pain. Linking pain qualities with other associated pain characteristics serve to develop a multidimensional approach to geriatric pain assessment. Future research is needed to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variability in pain qualities endorsed by older adults.

### Validation of the hanyang pain scale for clerical workers with musculoskeletal pain [^4bbaa812]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Based on the outcomes of previous studies, the VAS is generally considered to assess pain more accurately than the VRS. However, Kremer et alconducted a survey on patients with chronic pain using the VAS and VRS simultaneously and found that 11% of patients answered "no pain" for the VAS compared with 0% for the VRS. Furthermore, patients revealed that they preferred the VRS to the VAS. Based on these results, while the VRS may obtain answers with lower accuracy than the VAS, it can increase the patient response rate because it is easier to understand and simpler to use. These features are preferable for large-scale clinical research or epidemiological studies. Marianne et alreviewed the literature to investigate the utilization and performance of unidimensional pain scales, with specific emphasis on the numerical rating scale (NRS). These authors recommended NRS based on its higher compliance rates, improved responsiveness, ease of use, and improved applicability relative to the VAS/VRS.

However, these simple scales measure pain based on the concept that pain can be assessed based on its intensity alone. They are therefore limited in assessing sensory and emotional factors that can indicate causes of pain. Melzackdeveloped a multifaceted rating scale known as the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ), in which information on pain intensity can be provided quantitatively by reflecting the quality of the pain experience. It also provides objective and detailed information for sensory and emotional evaluation and for assessing the effectiveness of different pain treatments. Numerous experiments and clinical studies have supported the application of the MPQ as a tool for measuring quality and intensity of pain in various therapy areas. Although the assessment of pain through multifaceted concepts has been accepted, no consensus has been reached regarding the accurate assessment of pain measurement tools. The level or description of pain perception can vary according to language, geographical area, living environment, and social and cultural background. Therefore, a multidimensional pain scale written in Korean has been developed, and follow-up studies using the scale have been published. However, according to systematic literature reviews conducted by Litcher-Kelly et al, the VAS is still the most widely utilized tool for the assessment of chronic musculoskeletal pain. This is because the utilization of multidimensional assessment tools requires a considerable amount of time, making it difficult to assess patient pain, and researchers have been predominately interested in pain intensity for the evaluation of pain relief methods. In this regard, it may be necessary to adopt an easy-to-use pain assessment tool for clinical practice.

### Validity, reliability, and assessment sensitivity of the Japanese version of the short-form mcGill pain questionnaire 2 in Japanese patients with neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain [^cdf3ba17]. Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to define the validity, reliability, and assessment sensitivity of the Japanese version of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SF-MPQ-2-J).

Design

This is a cross-sectional study.

Patients and Methods

The original SF-MPQ-2 was translated into Japanese to create the SF-MPQ-2-J, and the cross-cultural equivalence of assessment tool for Japanese patients was validated. The reliability of the SF-MPQ-2-J was assessed using internal consistency, reliability coefficients (Cronbach's α), and reproducibility coefficients (intraclass correlation coefficient) obtained using 234 patients with chronic pain. SF-MPQ-2-J validity was assessed based on associations identified between total and subscale scores compared with other assessment methods. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also performed to test the theoretical structure of the SF-MPQ-2-J.

Results

The internal consistencies calculated included continuous pain, α = 0.893; intermittent pain, α = 0.875; predominantly neuropathic pain, α = 0.917; affective descriptors, α = 0.857; and total score, α = 0.907. The reproducibility coefficients calculated included continuous pain, ρ = 0.81; intermittent pain, ρ = 0.78; predominantly neuropathic pain, ρ = 0.85; affective descriptors, ρ = 0.75; and total score, ρ = 0.83. The CFA showed that the model fit of the readily interpretable subscales was acceptable, and the goodness of fit index value was 0.917. In addition, the mean predominantly neuropathic pain subscale score was found to be significantly higher for patients with neuropathic pain vs non-neuropathic pain.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that the reliability and validity of the SF-MPQ-2-J are excellent, and the SF-MPQ-2-J represents a cross-cultural equivalent to SF-MPQ-2. Consequently, the latter is suitable for research and clinical use, and for discriminating neuropathic pain from non-neuropathic pain.

### Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Norwegian short-form mcGill pain questionnaire-2 in low back-related leg pain [^f9a19c25]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A prospective observational study with translation and psychometric analyses of a questionnaire.

Objective

Cross-cultural adaptation of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 into Norwegian.

Summary Of Background Data

The different versions of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) have been important and influential tools for pain assessment. To more reliably assess qualities of both neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain, the Short-Form MPQ was revised in 2009 (SF-MPQ-2), including seven additional descriptors. No Norwegian adaptation of the SF-MPQ-2 has been performed.

Methods

A translation of the SF-MPQ-2 was performed based on established guidelines. Forward-translations were compared and discussed in an expert workgroup. A synthesis was achieved by consensus. A backward translation was reviewed and consolidated with the forward translations to confirm linguistic equivalence. A prefinal version was tested in eight patients, who were interviewed to evaluate acceptability and comprehension of the questionnaire. Minor changes were implemented. The questionnaire was externally proofread. The final Norwegian version (NSF-MPQ-2) was tested for content and construct validity and internal consistency reliability in a population with low back-related leg pain.

Results

The backward translation was in good accordance with the original version. The prefinal version showed excellent acceptability and comprehension in initial patient-testing. The NSF-MPQ-2 showed satisfactory content and construct validity, including responsiveness to change, and acceptable internal consistency reliability as measured by Cronbach's alpha. A confirmatory factor analysis showed poor fit for the established four-factor structure, especially regarding the neuropathic subscale.

Conclusion

The NSF-MPQ-2 showed excellent acceptability and comprehension, satisfactory content and construct validity, including responsiveness to change, and internal consistency reliability as measured by Cronbach's alpha. However, a confirmatory factor analysis raised concerns regarding the factor-structure in the present population. Until more evidence emerges for the four-factor solution we suggest the NSF-MPQ-2 should be used as a single measure.

### Pain quality descriptors and sex-related differences in patients with shoulder pain [^6d4efca3]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pain is an individualized, subjective, and multidimensional experience that relies considerably on communication. Studies on words that patients use to describe chronic pain have indicated that pain quality descriptors are the most frequently used.–Therefore, pain quality descriptors are crucial in describing pain.

Implications of pain quality descriptors have received increasing attention. These descriptors have helped clinicians discriminate chronic pain conditions, pain mechanisms, and pain sensationsand identify responses to treatments. These results suggest that pain quality assessment is applicable to pain evaluation and treatment.

Pain quality descriptors of lower back pain, and arthritis-related pain, have been studied. Although shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal pain condition, shoulder pain quality descriptors mostly remain unknown. Because pain has multiple and distinct qualities, a variation in pain perception can be reasonably assumed among patients with different musculoskeletal diseases. Therefore, back pain and arthritic pain quality descriptors reported in previous studies cannot be generalized to shoulder pain. Furthermore, although musculoskeletal pain is traditionally considered nociceptive, several studies have suggested shared mechanisms of neuropathic pain in people with osteoarthritis and shoulder pain. Because pain quality descriptors have the potential to facilitate discrimination of pain mechanisms, exclusively assessing shoulder pain quality facilitates understanding nociceptive contributions and neuropathic pain components in overall shoulder pain. A mechanism-based classification of shoulder pain benefits shoulder pain management.

The language used to describe pain may vary among men and women because they may have learned different words from earlier pain experiences for describing pain, and studies have shown that sex-related differences considerably affect clinical pain experience. However, few studies have examined sex-related differences in pain language, particularly in the sensory quality of pain. A study in Australia showed that female university students used more words and more McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) descriptors and focused more on pain quality than male students did to describe their pain experiences. By contrast, Robinson et alfound no sex-related differences in sensory subscale scores of the MPQ among patients with back and facial pain, indicating similar pain quality among men and women. Hence, no conclusive sex-related difference regarding pain quality descriptors was observed.

Investigating sex-related differences in pain quality descriptors has clinical and research implications. Providing healthcare professionals with the knowledge of sex-specific pain terminologies can facilitate clinical communication with patients for pain-related assessment and treatment planning. Moreover, if sex-related differences exist, researchers should consider the differences during development of a pain quality assessment tool and the rating principles for clinical and research use.

### Quality-of-life outcome following hemiarthroplasty or total shoulder arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis. A prospective, randomized trial [^36b0d8ba]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Both total shoulder arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty have been used commonly to treat severe osteoarthritis of the shoulder; however, their effect on disease-specific quality-of-life outcome is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare the quality-of-life outcome following hemiarthroplasty with that following total shoulder arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis of the shoulder.

Methods

Forty-two patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the shoulder were randomized to receive a hemiarthroplasty or a total shoulder arthroplasty. One patient died, and all others were evaluated preoperatively and at six weeks and three, six, twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months postoperatively with use of a standardized format including a disease-specific quality-of-life measurement tool (Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder [WOOS] index), general shoulder rating scales (University of California at Los Angeles [UCLA] shoulder scale, Constant score, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] evaluation form), general pain scales (McGill pain score and visual analogue scale), and a global health measure (Short Form-36 [SF-36]). When a patient required revision of a hemiarthroplasty to a total shoulder arthroplasty, the last score before he or she "crossed over" was used for the analysis.

Results

Significant improvements in disease-specific quality of life were seen two years after both the total shoulder arthroplasties and the hemiarthroplasties. There were no significant differences in quality of life (WOOS score) between the group treated with total shoulder arthroplasty and that treated with hemiarthroplasty (90.6 ± 13.2 and 81.5 ± 24.1 points, respectively; p = 0.18). The other outcome measures demonstrated similar findings. Two patients in the hemiarthroplasty group crossed over to the other group by undergoing a revision to a total shoulder arthroplasty because of glenoid arthrosis.

Conclusions

Both total shoulder arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty improve disease-specific and general quality-of-life measurements. With the small number of patients in our study, we found no significant differences in these measurements between the two treatment groups.

### Comparison of a pain tolerability question with the numeric rating scale for assessment of self-reported chronic pain [^df69ee0b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

The overarching goal of chronic pain treatment is to make pain tolerable for the patient rather than to attain a targeted numeric rating. Our findings confirmed the intuitive assumption that most patients with low pain intensity (ie, NRS score, 1–3) find their pain tolerable. In contrast, the tolerability of pain rated between 4 and 6 varies substantially among patients. In this middle range, if a patient describes pain as tolerable, this might decrease the clinician's inclination to initiate higher-risk treatments. A substantial subgroup of patients with severe pain reported their symptoms as tolerable.

Discordance between tolerability and pain intensity may be an opening for a clinician to explore mood, sleep disruption, or the curtailing of activities to control pain. Asking patients with chronic pain about pain tolerability directly addresses the main limitation of the NRS, which asks patients to rate a complex, highly subjective experience on a unidimensional intensity scale. A limitation of this study is that patients could have had flares of chronic pain or superimposed acute pain episodes at the time of assessment. Research related to the associations of using the PTQ with patient satisfaction regarding communication, treatment goal setting, and treatment effects could further characterize the value of the PTQ.

Short-Form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ)

The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) was created in 1975 and has become one of the most widely used tests for pain measurement. It provides valuable information on the sensory, affective, and evaluative dimensions of pain experience and can discriminate among different pain problems. In 1987, the short form-MPQ (SF-MPQ) was designed and proven to have excellent validity and reliability. The SF-MPQ was further revised in 2009 for various pain conditions (SF-MPQ-2). SF-MPQ-2 includes 22 items with 0–10 numerical response options. Based on the results of these EFAs, four SF-MPQ-2 subscales were established. The results of the CFA demonstrated a good fit for the SF-MPQ-2 subscale. Internal consistency reliability, a Cronbach's alpha of r > 0.75, has been reported.

The Persian translation of the SF-MPQ-2 is a reliable and valid instrument for evaluating pain in Iranian patients with and without neuropathic etiology. Exploratory factor analysis has revealed four components similar to the original SF-MPQ-2. Cronbach's alpha was reported to be above 0.80, which showed high internal consistency. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of more than 0.90 has demonstrated adequate test–retest reliability. There was also a high correlation between the mean VAS and the mean total score (r = 0.92). In this study, Cronbach's alpha approved the scale's internal consistency of 0.82.

Major outcomes

Pain: measured by reliable and valid self‐report continuous outcome in the following order of preference: visual analogue scale (VAS), numerical rating scale (NRS), a scale within a composite pain measure (e.g. McGill Pain Questionnaire (Melzack 1975), other algofunctional scales).
Disability: analysed by continuous validated scales in the following order of preference: Roland‐Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) (Roland 2000; Yamato 2017), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (Fairbank 1980), or other algofunctional scales.
Health‐related quality of life: we will synthesise health‐related quality of life outcomes using one of a prioritised list of measures, as available: SF‐36 or SF‐12 (Ware 1992), PROMIS‐GH‐10 (Hays 2009), EQ‐5D (EuroQol Group 1996), CDC HRQOL‐14 (or other versions) (Moriarty 2003) (Health‐Related Quality of Life) (Guyatt 1993), WHOQOL‐BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale) (THE WHOQOL GROUP 1998), NHP (Nottingham Health Profile) (Wiklund 1990), QOLS (Quality of Life Scale) (Burckhardt 2003), or SIP (Sickness Impact Profile) (Bergner 1976). For the SF‐36, SF‐12, or PROMIS‐GH‐10, we will separately synthesise the physical and mental component scores, as recommended.
Psychological functioning (anxiety and depression): measured as a continuous outcome in the following order of preference: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond 1983), Spielberger State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (Skapinakis 2014), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (Lewinsohn 1997), Beck Depression Inventory (Dozois 1998), or other scales.
Adverse events: we will document all reported adverse events, including mild adverse events, such as transient and self‐resolving events (e.g. minor pain, mild bruising, or temporary skin marks) that do not require medical intervention, and treatment‐specific adverse events which are more severe than mild adverse events (e.g. significant skin infections or severe burns) and may require medical intervention, but that do not necessitate hospitalisation or result in long‐term disability.
Withdrawals due to adverse events: situations where adverse effects are significant enough for participants to decide not to continue with the intervention. We will also record withdrawals due to other reasons, such as inefficacy or other.
Global improvement or perceived recovery: measured by the Global Perceived Effect Scale (Kamper 2010) or other algofunctional scale, preferentially; or by dichotomous measures such as proportion reporting participant‐reported global impression of clinical change (much or very much improved), or similar measure (e.g. proportion achieving 30% reduction in pain), or proportion reporting a good or excellent outcome, or any other definition of 'success' as reported in the trials, extracted as a dichotomous measure.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pain, more specifically with respect to assessment scales, EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider using a categorical scale or verbal rating scale if required, where patients rate pain as following, bearing in mind language and cultural barriers that may mean pain is underreported:

- none

- mild pain

- moderate pain

- severe pain

- very severe pain

- worst pain ever.
