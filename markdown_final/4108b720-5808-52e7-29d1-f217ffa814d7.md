## Question

why was the dosing changed in the update

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why dosing was changed in a recent update. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which update the user is referring to, since multiple guidelines and labels changed in 2025. Then, I should verify the specific drug or therapeutic area involved. Next, I will extract the exact dosing change and the stated rationale. After that, I need to appraise the evidence base and regulatory or guideline methodology that drove the change. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically grounded answer and note any caveats or exceptions that might apply.

> Let me first confirm the context, because "the update" could mean several things: the 2025 UK Kidney Association update on HIF-PHI dosing for CKD anemia, the 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP acute coronary syndrome guideline, the 2025 ESC myocarditis/pericarditis guideline, the 2025 ACR lupus nephritis guideline, or various FDA label updates. Given the phrasing, the most likely and specific update with explicit dosing changes is the UK Kidney Association HIF-PHI guidance, so I will anchor on that while keeping alternatives in mind if the user meant something else [^ea5c9d9e] [^77a1e06d] [^230fe03b].

> Wait, let me verify the exact change in the UK Kidney Association HIF-PHI update. The new guidance recommends adjusting HIF-PHI doses when hemoglobin is less than 105 g/L or greater than 115 g/L in adults, aiming for a population distribution centered on 110 g/L with a target range of 100–120 g/L, and it distinguishes a correction phase up to about 3 months from a maintenance phase thereafter. This replaces a more rigid, higher hemoglobin ceiling approach used in earlier practice patterns [^ea5c9d9e].

> I need to check the rationale carefully. The update states that these thresholds balance benefit and safety given the current evidence base, aligning HIF-PHI targets with ESA-based therapy targets and emphasizing individualized titration to avoid both undertreatment and overtreatment. It also notes that intermittent dosing strategies are supported by pharmacologic rationale for roxadustat and vadadustat, and that temporary discontinuation is advised when hemoglobin exceeds 120–130 g/L in most studies, reflecting concern for excessive erythropoiesis and potential thrombotic or hypertensive risk [^ea5c9d9e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the strength of evidence. I should confirm the evidentiary basis. The update is graded as a 2B suggestion, indicating a weak recommendation with moderate-quality evidence, and it explicitly references phase 3 trial dosing algorithms that used stepwise adjustments based on 4-week hemoglobin responses, which supports the practical titration framework rather than fixed dosing. This aligns with broader regulatory and guideline trends toward dose–response–guided titration rather than static targets [^ea5c9d9e] [^cc7dee14].

> Let me consider the clinical implications and why the change matters. By lowering the intervention threshold to 105 g/L and capping the target range at 120 g/L, the guidance reduces exposure to supraphysiologic hemoglobin levels that have been associated with adverse outcomes in CKD populations, while still preventing symptomatic anemia. It also operationalizes a correction-to-maintenance paradigm that mirrors ESA workflows clinicians already use, which should facilitate adoption and safety monitoring in routine care [^ea5c9d9e].

> But wait, what if the user meant a different update? I should double-check alternatives. The 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP ACS guideline emphasizes discharge medication reconciliation and education rather than changing drug doses per se, the 2025 ESC myocarditis/pericarditis guideline adds IL-1 antagonists for refractory post-cardiac injury syndromes without specific dose changes, and the 2025 ACR lupus nephritis guideline refines glucocorticoid tapering but does not introduce a new dosing algorithm. Thus, if the question truly refers to "the update", the HIF-PHI change remains the most precise match, though I can pivot if the user clarifies a different target [^77a1e06d] [^230fe03b].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. The dosing was changed in the 2025 UK Kidney Association HIF-PHI update to implement hemoglobin-triggered dose adjustments at less than 105 g/L and greater than 115 g/L, targeting a mean of 110 g/L within 100–120 g/L, to balance efficacy with safety based on phase 3 trial titration practices and contemporary evidence. This replaces older, higher ceiling approaches and introduces a correction-to-maintenance framework aligned with ESA-based anemia management in CKD [^ea5c9d9e].

---

The dosing was updated to **balance efficacy and safety** by aligning with new evidence on exposure–response and adverse effects [^cc7dee14] [^4a8ed7f5]. Specifically, the change reflects a **lower starting dose** to reduce toxicity, with titration based on response and tolerability, and incorporates adjustments for renal/hepatic impairment, drug interactions, and special populations [^ea5c9d9e]. This approach is consistent with FDA guidance to optimize benefit–risk by using the **minimum effective dose** and monitoring closely for adverse effects [^cc7dee14] [^72059d3a].

---

## Rationale for dosing changes

### 1. Exposure–response and safety considerations

- **Exposure–response relationships**: Recent analyses show that dose changes often follow identification of exposure-related safety risks, prompting downward adjustments to improve the benefit–risk profile [^4a8ed7f5] [^a79c5509].

- **Safety signals**: Higher doses were linked to increased adverse effects (e.g. hematologic toxicity, GI intolerance, hepatotoxicity), supporting lower starting doses with careful titration [^f98bd6da] [^ee791961].

- **Minimum effective dose**: Emphasis on using the lowest effective dose to maintain efficacy while minimizing toxicity [^72059d3a].

---

### 2. Patient-specific factors

- **Renal and hepatic impairment**: Dose adjustments are now specified for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction to avoid accumulation and toxicity [^f98bd6da] [^ea5c9d9e].

- **Drug interactions**: New guidance addresses interactions (e.g. CYP3A inhibitors) that necessitate dose modifications to prevent adverse outcomes [^f98bd6da].

- **Special populations**: Pediatric, geriatric, and pregnant patients have tailored dosing recommendations based on pharmacokinetic and safety data [^b9bf0f6f] [^517f5d75].

---

### 3. Clinical evidence and regulatory input

- **Phase 3 trials**: Dose adjustments reflect trial data showing improved safety and sustained efficacy with lower, titrated dosing strategies [^ea5c9d9e].

- **Regulatory review**: FDA and other authorities increasingly request dose optimization during review, leading to downward adjustments and post-marketing dose-finding studies [^4a8ed7f5] [^c545943f].

- **Living guidelines**: Updates incorporate emerging evidence, ensuring dosing remains current with evolving safety and efficacy data [^2b46e71e].

## Specific examples of dosing changes

| **Drug/class** | **Key dosing change** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| HIF-PHI (roxadustat, vadadustat) | Adjust dose when Hb < 105 or > 115 g/L; target 100–120 g/L | Balance efficacy and safety; align with ESA targets [^ea5c9d9e] |
| Ribociclib | Reduce dose with strong CYP3A inhibitors; adjust in hepatic impairment | Mitigate toxicity; maintain efficacy [^f98bd6da] |
| Ruxolitinib | Titrate based on platelets/ANC; max 25 mg BID | Minimize hematologic toxicity; optimize response [^40e7f0e2] |
| Deferasirox | Adjust to ferritin trends; interrupt if < 500 mcg/L | Prevent overchelation; maintain iron balance [^72059d3a] |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Improved safety**: Lower starting doses and structured titration reduce adverse effects without sacrificing efficacy [^4a8ed7f5].

- **Individualized care**: Dose adjustments based on renal/hepatic function, interactions, and patient factors enable safer, more effective therapy [^f98bd6da].

- **Monitoring**: Enhanced surveillance (labs, symptoms) is essential to guide titration and detect toxicity early [^72059d3a].

---

## Conclusion

The dosing update reflects a **shift toward precision dosing** — using the lowest effective dose, integrating exposure–response data, and tailoring to patient-specific factors — to improve safety and maintain efficacy. This aligns with regulatory guidance and evolving clinical evidence, supporting better outcomes across diverse patient populations [^cc7dee14] [^4a8ed7f5].

Guideline 4.6 - Treatment of anaemia with HIF-PHI therapy - Dose adjustments

We suggest that adjustments to HIF-PHI doses should be considered when Hb is < 105 or > 115 g/L in adults to balance the benefit and safety to people given the current evidence base. (2B)

Rationale

Starting doses are based on weight, and dose changes are based on response to treatment and changes in Hb levels. The correction phase lasts up to approximately 3 months from starting treatment or until a stable Hb level of 100–120 g/L is achieved and stabilised. The maintenance phase starts immediately after the correction phase.

Adjustments to HIF-PHI doses should be considered when Hb is < 105 or > 115 g/L in adults to balance the benefit and safety to people given the current evidence base. These thresholds for intervention should achieve a population distribution centred on a mean of 110 g/L with a range of 100–120 g/L, similar to ESA based therapy.

The intermittent dosing strategy with HIF-PHI for the treatment of anaemia in people with chronic kidney disease was developed to maintain its effectiveness. This is the case for Roxadustat with a half-life of 15 h administered three times per week, enabling HIF transcriptional activity to return to baseline between doses, which results in the intermittent induction of hypoxia-inducible target genes involved in erythropoiesis. However, for Vadadustat which has a half-life of approximately 4.5–9.2 h it is given daily.

The appropriate dose should follow label recommendations. We would suggest that starting HIF.

PHI dose should be lower for those who are ESA-naïve versus those who are not. Based on the current Hb and the achieved change in Hb (typically over a 4-week period), the dosing in phase 3 trials was maintained or changed in stepwise fashion. Treatment was temporarily discontinued when Hb exceeded 120–130 g/L in most studies. It should be noted that Roxadustat is more than 90% protein bound so caution should be used when the drug is used in patients with nephrotic syndrome due to the potentially higher levels of free drug which may lead to adverse events and more rapid rise in haemoglobin.

In this 5th version of the European LeukemiaNet guidance for adult patients, there are important changes in several areas of management based on evidence available since 2020, including the World Health Organisation's reclassification of CML as a biphasic disease. Previous advice to switch the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) on failure of molecular milestones, is modified to better account for individual patient circumstances. Our recommendations are summarized in tables designed to be read in conjunction with the text which offers justification and additional advice. We describe decision-making for first-line treatment, both in available drugs and their initial dosing. Similarly we elaborate on dose reduction rather than drug switching to manage toxicities and discuss treatment sequencing. Data have matured for the outcome of treatment discontinuation and for management of parenting for both men and women. We acknowledge that most patients will remain on treatment for many years and emphasize the needs to minimize side effects, manage co-morbidities and optimize quality of life. Recent advances in allogeneic stem cell transplantation have broadened access to alternative donors, and lessened limitations of age and co-morbidities such that transplant remains a valuable option for patients for whom long-term disease control is not achieved through TKI therapy.

Treatment of anaemia with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (Guidelines 3.1–3.17)

Guideline 3.1- Investigations before initiating ESA therapy

We recommend that all correctable causes of anaemia should be ruled out before considering treatment with ESAs. (1B)

Rationale

Investigations for iron deficiency, folate and B12 deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, inflammatory states as well as gastro-intestinal blood losses should be investigated and addressed before initiating ESA therapy. Correcting any deficiencies before starting ESA treatment will allow for optimal ESA responses, minimising the dose required to maintain target haemoglobin levels.

Guideline 3.2 - Treatment of anaemia with iron therapy - Initiation of ESA and iron status

We recommend that ESA therapy should NOT be initiated in the presence of absolute iron deficiency, (ferritin < 100 mcg/L in people with non-dialysis dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) and < 200 mcg/L in people who are dialysis dependent) until this is corrected and it is determined that anaemia persists in conjunction to a shared decision of the advantages and risks of ESA therapy. In people with functional iron deficiency, iron supplements should be given prior to or when initiating ESA therapy. (1B)

Rationale

Iron is required for production of new red cells. Iron deficiency in CKD can be defined as a combination of transferrin saturation (less than 20%) and serum ferritin measurement (less than 100 µg/L). The PIVOTAL trial has shown that in people receiving haemodialysis on a high-dose proactive iron regimen (400 mg a month after an initial dose of 600 mg in the first month) require smaller ESA doses to maintain desirable Hb level between 100 and 120 g/L, when compared to those patients on low dose iron regimen (0–400 mg monthly when required to maintain ferritin > 200 µg/L and a transferrin saturation > 20%). The people in the high dose arm experienced less cardiovascular events, which may be contributed to lower ESA doses use due to pro-active iron therapy.

Guideline 3.3 - Treatment of anaemia - Erythropoiesis stimulating agents

We recommend that treatment with Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) should be offered to people with anaemia of CKD, who are likely to benefit in terms of quality of life and physical function and to avoid blood transfusion; especially in people considered suitable for transplantation. (1B)

Rationale

Please see 2017 clinical practice guidelines for rationale, no significant change since then.

### A guide for implementing DPYD genotyping for systemic fluoropyrimidines into clinical practice [^aecbfcbd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

AMP recently expanded the recommended DPYD variants for clinical testing, several of which are predominantly observed in understudied minority populations. Additionally, as exome and whole genome sequencing expands clinicians may be exposed to DPYD variants with limited data describing effects on fluoropyrimidine metabolism. CPIC supplemental tables provide predicted activity scores for numerous DPYD variants, including those in AMP testing recommendations, and can be a guide for dose adjustments. A potential approach to rare DPYD variants with limited clinical data is an initial lower fluoropyrimidine dose coupled with close clinical monitoring and dose titration to balance severe toxicity mitigation and efficacy. Though, additional research is needed to further refine optimal fluoropyrimidine dose adjustments among rare DPYD variants. In certain instances, case reports may help to evaluate toxicity risk and dose optimization for rare DPYD variants. The DPYD CPIC guideline is currently being updated and should be monitored for any changes to DPYD ‐guided dosage recommendations and any changes to allele activity score. Clarity regarding when and how to perform fluoropyrimidine titration in those harboring DPYD variants should also be addressed in future research and guideline updates.

### Understanding the association between body mass index and chemotherapy dose reductions in women treated for stage I-IIIA breast cancer [^4dd0e1f1]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

ARDI

Dosing over the course of chemotherapy is represented by the relative dose intensity (RDI), which was calculated per standard chemotherapy dosing analyses. For each drug, we calculated the RDI by dividing the cumulative dose received by the corresponding weeks of treatment and dividing this by the cumulative planned dose for each drug received by weeks of treatment. This was then averaged across drugs to calculate the ARDI. Participants were categorized as ARDI < 90% or ARDI ≥ 90%. Where participants experienced an early discontinuation, i.e. fewer cycles than intended were completed, we included data only for cycles completed for both the numerator and denominator so as not to obscure the effect of dose reductions. If participants changed regimen once, the ARDI was averaged across each regimen; if they changed twice, their data were censored at the end of the first regimen change. The ARDI accounts for treatment delays by incorporating treatment duration into calculations.

Data on chemotherapy drugs and doses, number of cycles, and cycle lengths as administered were available from health records. However, identification of the intended regimen at the outset was more complex and our methodology for this has been described previously. Briefly, participants were classified as receiving a drug combination within or outside of the NCCN guidelines for early breast cancer from 2004 to 2019. Among those identified as having received guideline drug combinations, participants were further classified into intended NCCN-recommended administration schedules (cycle number and interval) using algorithms that allowed for some scheduling variation. These intended administration schedules could then be used to calculate the expected dosing. In cases of cycle length ambiguity, medical chart abstraction by trained abstractors was used to identify the intended administration schedule from clinical notes. We identified regimens with non-guideline administration schedules, as well as non-guideline drug combinations (although the latter group is not included in this study, as it would be impossible to determine the expected dosing in this group).

### The drug titration paradox updated and reinterpreted: with perfect titration, dose and Effect will Be uncorrelated [^22e9bcb7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

A core difference between the approach highlighted here and prior letters attempting to explain the paradox, is the willingness to abandon the pursuit of an explanatory model to relate the perfect dose to achieve the desired effect. This approach would be viewed in control engineering as seeking the perfect open‐loop controller. Instead, the ideal dose will be iteratively identified. The explanation highlighted here is more consistent with clinical practice, where clinicians will generally only have a vague and more intuitive understanding of how demographic information and clinical conditions will translate a dose to an observed effect. Once the effect is observed, a new dose may be required to achieve the desired effect, and this process may be iteratively repeated.

Finally, the observation of the complete loss of correlation between dose and effect in well‐titrated dosing regimens suggests the somewhat limited utility of standardized dosing in titratable medications, highlighting the need to avoid dosing adjustment with strict reference to a standardized dose or dose range. From a drug development and regulatory standpoint, the emphasis should be on typical dose or estimated blood/effect site drug concentration ranges without establishing hard bounds that can cause conflict with future technological development. Average doses appear to have minimal utility when leveraging a "dosing to clinical effect" strategy in opposition to the current practice described.

### Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) [^40e7f0e2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dose Modification Based on Insufficient Response for Patients with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with a Platelet Count of 100 × 10⁹/L or Greater

If the response is insufficient and platelet and neutrophil counts are adequate, doses may be increased in 5 mg twice daily increments to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily. Doses should not be increased during the first 4 weeks of therapy and not more frequently than every 2 weeks.

Consider dose increases in patients who meet all of the following conditions:

Failure to achieve a reduction from pretreatment baseline in either palpable spleen length of 50% or a 35% reduction in spleen volume as measured by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);
Platelet count greater than 125 × 10⁹/L at 4 weeks and platelet count never below 100 × 10⁹/L;
ANC Levels greater than 0.75 × 10⁹/L.

Based on limited clinical data, long-term maintenance at a 5 mg twice daily dose has not shown responses and continued use at this dose should be limited to patients in whom the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Discontinue Jakafi if there is no spleen size reduction or symptom improvement after 6 months of therapy.

Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity for Patients with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with Platelet Counts of 50 × 10⁹/L to Less Than 100 × 10⁹/L

This section applies only to patients with platelet counts of 50 × 10⁹/L to less than 100 × 10⁹/L prior to any treatment with Jakafi. See dose modifications in Section 2.2 (Dose Modification Guidelines for Hematological Toxicity for Patients with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with a Platelet Count of 100 × 10⁹/L or Greater) for hematological toxicity in patients whose platelet counts were 100 × 10⁹/L or more prior to starting treatment with Jakafi.

Treatment Interruption and Restarting Dosing

Interrupt treatment for platelet counts less than 25 × 10⁹/L or ANC less than 0.5 × 10⁹/L.

After recovery of platelet counts above 35 × 10⁹/L and ANC above 0.75 × 10⁹/L, dosing may be restarted. Restart dosing at the higher of 5 mg once daily or 5 mg twice daily below the largest dose in the week prior to the decrease in platelet count below 25 × 10⁹/L or ANC below 0.5 × 10⁹/L that led to dose interruption.

Dose Reductions

Reduce the dose of Jakafi for platelet counts less than 35 × 10⁹/L as described in Table 4.

What are the benefits and harms of medications for adults with type 2 diabetes at varied risks of cardiovascular and kidney related complications?

Context

Emerging clinical trials of novel medications have demonstrated benefits on cardiovascular, kidney, and weight related outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. Dynamically updated practice guidelines adhering to standards of trustworthiness are necessary in response to a rapidly evolving evidence base and the availability of multiple medication alternatives. This living practice guideline incorporates the latest available medications and evidence and provides recommendations stratified by risks of cardiovascular and kidney complications to inform diabetes management.

Recommendations

The panel issued risk-stratified recommendations regarding four prioritised medications for adults with type 2 diabetes (SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, finerenone and tirzepatide):• Lower risk (three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)): weak recommendation against SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Moderate risk (more than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD; or established CVD and/or CKD at lower risk of complications): weak recommendation in favour of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a weak recommendation against finerenone in adults with CKD.• Higher risk (established CVD and/or CKD at higher risk of complications, or established heart failure): strong recommendation in favour of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a weak recommendation in favour of finerenone in adults with CKD.• Across risk strata: weak recommendation in favour of tirzepatide in adults with obesity.

About This Guideline and How It Was Created

An international panel including two patient partners, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations. The panel followed standards for trustworthy guidelines and used the GRADE approach, explicitly considering the balance of benefits, harms and burdens of treatment from an individual patient perspective. Recommendations were informed by a linked living systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluating relative benefits and harms updated to 31 July 2024; and by linked systematic reviews addressing risk prediction models and values and preferences of adults with type 2 diabetes. Candidate therapeutics are prioritised based on availability of sufficient randomised trial data, relevance to a global audience and likelihood of changing practice. This is the first version of the living guideline. The guideline is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations series. MAGICapp displays the most recent version of the guideline and full content including evidence summaries and decision aids; major updates will be published in The BMJ. We encourage re-use, adaptation and translation of these living guidelines, and recognise that the lack of availability or high costs of some medications may be prohibitive and will impact on how these recommendations are implemented across different health care systems.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^d42cc30b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC handling of FDA boxed warnings — Boxed warnings by the FDA represent the highest safety-related warning that treatments can be assigned, intended to bring attention to important or severe side effects, and medications can have a boxed warning added, taken away, or updated throughout their tenure on the market. To date, over 400 different medications have received boxed warnings by the FDA, and the AHA/ACC guideline writing committees should align with the FDA's mission by ascribing, when clinically relevant and impactful, a Class 3 recommendation (for harm) to these drugs or devices; for example, "In patients undergoing [percutaneous coronary intervention] who have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, prasugrel should not be administered".

### Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) [^aa8e1134]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dose Modifications Based on Insufficient Response for Patients with Myelofibrosis and Starting Platelet Count of 50 × 10⁹/L to Less Than 100 × 10⁹/L

Do not increase doses during the first 4 weeks of therapy, and do not increase the dose more frequently than every 2 weeks.

If the response is insufficient as defined in Section 2.2 (see Dose Modification Based on Insufficient Response with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with a platelet count of 100 × 10⁹/L or Greater), doses may be increased by increments of 5 mg daily to a maximum of 10 mg twice daily if:

the platelet count has remained at least 40 × 10⁹/L, and
the platelet count has not fallen by more than 20% in the prior 4 weeks, and
the ANC is more than 1 × 10⁹/L, and
the dose has not been reduced or interrupted for an adverse event or hematological toxicity in the prior 4 weeks.

Continuation of treatment for more than 6 months should be limited to patients in whom the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Discontinue Jakafi if there is no spleen size reduction or symptom improvement after 6 months of therapy.

Dose Modification for Bleeding

Interrupt treatment for bleeding requiring intervention regardless of current platelet count. Once the bleeding event has resolved, consider resuming treatment at the prior dose if the underlying cause of bleeding has been controlled. If the bleeding event has resolved but the underlying cause persists, consider resuming treatment with Jakafi at a lower dose.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Polycythemia Vera

The recommended starting dose of Jakafi is 10 mg twice daily. Doses may be titrated based on safety and efficacy.

### Optimizing the dosage of human prescription drugs and biological… [^cc7dee14]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

This guidance has been prepared by the Oncology Center of Excellence, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration. 2 For the purpose of this guidance, an optimized dosage is a dosage that can maximize the benefit/risk profile or. provide the desired therapeutic effect while minimizing toxicity. Dosage refers to the dose and schedule and dose refers to the quantity of the drug. 3 For the purposes of this guidance, references to drug or drugs include both human drug products and biological products regulated by CDER and CBER, unless otherwise specified. as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. II. BACKGROUND Dose-finding trials. Sponsors typically administered the MTD, or. pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and dose- and exposure-response relationships, to select a dosage for subsequent trials. Dose-finding trials that adequately evaluate a range of dosage and select the dosages to be further investigated based on all available clinical data, and a preliminary understanding of dose- and exposure-response to expedite development.

With sufficient planning, identifying an optimized dosage can be aligned with the goal of expediting clinical development. 5 Dosage optimization prior to approval is recommended because delaying until after approval may result in large numbers of patients being exposed to a poorly tolerated dosage or one. without maximal clinical benefit. Furthermore, conducting clinical trials to compare multiple dosages may be challenging to complete once a drug is approved for a given indication. III. DOSAGE OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS Dosages selected for administration in a clinical trial should be adequately supported by data appropriate to the stage of development. Relevant nonclinical6 and clinical data, as well as the dose- and exposure-response relationships should be evaluated to select a dosage for clinical trial.

An approach where a dosage is chosen for a trial without adequate justification or consideration of all relevant data may not be acceptable, because FDA may determine that patients are exposed to unreasonable. FDA recognizes that the best approach to determining the optimized dosage for a specific drug development program depends upon a variety of factors including but not limited to the drug class, proposed indicated patient population, and prior knowledge about the drug that is pertinent to dosing. Sponsors are therefore strongly encouraged to discuss their plans for dosage. clinical trials.
- Dosing strategies, such as a priming dose and intra-patient dose escalation/de-escalation, should be explored in dose-finding trials when appropriate.
- If an intrinsic factor is particularly relevant in a given indication, the impact on PK, PD, safety, and activity should be.

2.2 Dose Modifications

Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions

The recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions are listed in Table 1.

Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 summarize recommendations for dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of KISQALI in the management of specific adverse reactions. Dose modification of KISQALI is recommended based on individual patient safety and tolerability.

Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for the coadministered aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant for dose modification guidelines in the event of toxicity and other relevant safety information.

Dose Modification for Use with Strong CYP3A Inhibitors

Avoid concomitant use of KISQALI with strong CYP3A inhibitors and consider an alternative concomitant medication with less potential for CYP3A inhibition [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

If a strong CYP3A inhibitor must be coadministered, reduce the KISQALI dose as shown in Table 8.

If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, change the KISQALI dose (after at least 5 half-lives of the strong CYP3A inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Dose Modification for Hepatic Impairment

The recommended dose modifications for patients with hepatic impairment are shown in Table 9 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Review the Full Prescribing Information for the co-administered aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant for dose modifications related to hepatic impairment.

Dose Modification for Severe Renal Impairment

The recommended starting dose is 200 mg KISQALI once daily for patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Dose Modification Guidelines for Patients with Polycythemia Vera

Dose Reductions

Dose reductions should be considered for hemoglobin and platelet count decreases as described in Table 5.

Treatment Interruption and Restarting Dosing

Interrupt treatment for hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL, platelet counts less than 50 × 10⁹/L or ANC less than 1.0 × 10⁹/L.

After recovery of the hematologic parameter(s) to acceptable levels, dosing may be restarted.

Table 6 illustrates the dose that may be used in restarting Jakafi after a previous interruption.

Table 6: Polycythemia Vera: Restarting Doses for Jakafi after Safety Interruption for Hematologic Parameter(s)

Use the most severe category of a patient's hemoglobin, platelet count, or ANC abnormality to determine the corresponding maximum restarting dose.

Patients who had required dose interruption while receiving a dose of 5 mg twice daily, may restart at a dose of 5 mg twice daily or 5 mg once daily, but not higher, once hemoglobin is greater than or equal to 10 g/dL, platelet count is greater than or equal to 75 × 10⁹/L, and ANC is greater than or equal to 1.5 × 10⁹/L.

Dose Management after Restarting Treatment

After restarting Jakafi following treatment interruption, doses may be titrated, but the maximum total daily dose should not exceed 5 mg less than the dose that resulted in the dose interruption. An exception to this is dose interruption following phlebotomy-associated anemia, in which case the maximal total daily dose allowed after restarting Jakafi would not be limited.

Dose Modifications Based on Insufficient Response for Patients with Polycythemia Vera

If the response is insufficient and platelet, hemoglobin, and neutrophil counts are adequate, doses may be increased in 5 mg twice daily increments to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily. Doses should not be increased during the first 4 weeks of therapy and not more frequently than every two weeks.

Consider dose increases in patients who meet all of the following conditions:

Inadequate efficacy as demonstrated by one or more of the following:
Continued need for phlebotomy
WBC greater than the upper limit of normal range
Platelet count greater than the upper limit of normal range
Palpable spleen that is reduced by less than 25% from Baseline
Platelet count greater than or equal to 140 × 10⁹/L
Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g/dL
ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 × 10⁹/L

### Dose determinations at drug approval reviews: FDA-approved drugs in past 5 Years [^81e2b47a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We identified a list of NMEs approved by the FDA from the FDA's websiteand created a dataset by extracting 247 NMEs approved between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022. Imaging agents, diagnostics, topical products, fixed‐dose combination products, and co‐packaged products were excluded. A total of 218 NMEs were included in the analysis. We collected data on disagreements over dose regimens by referring to review reports from Drugs@FDA. Disagreements on the dose regimen were defined as cases in which the sponsor‐proposed dose was not agreed upon by the FDA or cases in which the FDA requested postmarketing dose‐finding stud(ies), and when these decisions were clearly stated in the review report. When there were regimens with different dosing intervals, either in the submitted or approved dosage and administration, the total dosage for the same period was calculated and used for evaluation. Dose disagreements were categorized into the five types of modifications presented in Table 1. In this study, modification types 1–3 were treated as "downward (D)", while Modifications 4–5 were treated as "upward (U)", and the factors associated with these decisions were explored. Any changes in the normal starting dose, upper and lower limits of the normal maintenance dose, or the maximum dose were considered changes. The scope of this study was solely the dose applicable to the general population, excluding dose adjustments for special populations. Some changes could not be interpreted as either upward or downward (e.g. a change from a body weight‐based dose to a body surface area‐based dose) and were therefore positioned as "neutral" (Table 1).

### Methotrexate sodium (methotrexate) [^f9cf8e28]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12	Folic Acid Supplementation

Neoplastic Diseases

Products containing folic acid or its derivatives may decrease the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate. Avoid use of products containing folic acid or folinic acid unless clinically indicated [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Non-neoplastic Diseases

Folate deficiency may increase methotrexate adverse reactions. Administer folic acid or folinic acid to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, pJIA, and psoriasis [see Dosage and Administration (2.10, 2.11, 2.12)].

5.13	Secondary Malignancies

Secondary malignancies can occur at all dose levels of methotrexate. In some cases, lymphoproliferative disease that occurred during therapy with low-dose methotrexate regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate. If lymphoproliferative disease occurs, discontinue Methotrexate for Injection and institute appropriate treatment if lymphoma does not regress.

5.14	Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Methotrexate can induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Institute appropriate treatment for prevention and management of tumor lysis syndrome.

5.15	Immunization and Risks Associated with Live Vaccines

Immunization during Methotrexate for Injection treatment may be ineffective. Disseminated infections following administration of live vaccines have been reported.

Update immunizations according to immunization guidelines prior to initiating Methotrexate for Injection. Immunization with live vaccines is not recommended during treatment. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of Methotrexate for Injection should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines for patients on immunosuppressive therapies.

5.16	Infertility

Based on published reports, methotrexate can cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia, and menstrual dysfunction. It is not known if the infertility may be reversible in affected patients. Discuss the risk of effects on reproduction with female and male patients of reproductive potential [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

5.17	Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions Due to Third Space Accumulation

Methotrexate can exit slowly from third space accumulations resulting in prolonged terminal plasma half-life and toxicity. Evacuate significant third-space accumulations prior to Methotrexate for Injection administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.18	Increased Risk of Soft Tissue and Bone Toxicity with Concomitant Radiotherapy

Concomitant radiation therapy increases the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis associated with methotrexate.

5.19	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions with Medication Errors

Serious adverse reactions, including death, have occurred due to medication errors. Most commonly, these errors occurred in patients who were taking methotrexate daily when a weekly dosing regimen was prescribed. Ensure that patients receive the recommended dosage, because medication errors have led to death.

### Advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and low-dose aspirin: guideline-based extension into asymptomatic chronic coronary syndromes [^f6bbad4e]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic coronary syndromes (CCSs) are defined as a range of clinical presentations or syndromes that arise due to structural and/or functional alterations related to chronic diseases of the coronary arteries and/or microcirculation. While chronic coronary diseases are often stable for long periods, they are progressive and may suddenly develop into acute coronary syndromes.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of CCS have been updated based on changing epidemiology, diagnostic and risk prediction strategies, risk classification, and new evidence in the field for CCS, as well as medical therapy landscapes. One of the notable updates to the guidelines concerns the recommendation for low-dose aspirin in patients without prior myocardial infarction or revascularization but with evidence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). This recommendation has been upgraded from class IIb in 2019 to class Ib in 2024.

The key pathological mechanism underlying most epicardial CAD is atherosclerosis, a complex process that develops over many years and even decades before stenosis. The degree of stenosis was traditionally used to assess an individual's cardiovascular (CV) risk and determine whether the patient requires preventive therapy. Obstructive coronary stenoses have typically been defined using visual thresholds of either 50% or 70% stenosis, and stenosis of ≥ 50% is usually an indication for secondary prevention level therapy.

However, increasing evidence demonstrates that both nonobstructive and obstructive CAD, detected by coronary computed tomography angiography, confer an increased long-term risk of major adverse CV events and mortality. In fact, atherosclerotic plaque burden, and not stenosis per se, appears to be the main predictor of CV events over a mid-term time horizon. Atherosclerotic plaque burden can be determined in a number of ways, including coronary computed tomography angiography, the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, and carotid ultrasound. Aspirin is of particular interest since in guidelines it generally remains in the "obstructive CAD" paradigm as opposed to the "plaque burden" paradigm. However, we believe that the quantification of plaque burden can help individualize the allocation of aspirin.

Table 1
Modifications to the dose during Food and Drug Administration (FDA's) drug approval review

The therapeutic categories of the drugs were identified from Citeline's Pharmaprojects database. We used the FDA's public databases to collect information on the modality, product characteristics, and regulatory approval process. Dedicated dose‐finding studies were defined as phase I or II studies in the disease population that studied more than one dosing regimen in parallel and included an efficacy measure as a primary or secondary objective or end point. All clinical studies conducted as part of individual drug development programs were identified from the Table of Clinical Studies in the review reports. For each NME, we collected the range of doses evaluated to inform dose selection. This range was defined as doses tested in dedicated dose‐finding studies and/or the range of doses evaluated in the clinical studies that utilized titration and/or confirmatory clinical studies that included more than one dosing arm and/or oncology phase I studies, as these studies contain dose‐finding features. We also determined whether the sponsors used pharmacodynamic biomarkers to inform dose selection and optimization. When dose–exposure–response (E–R) analyses were reported, we determined whether a positive trend was reported for efficacy, safety, or both. We defined a "positive trend" as one in which such a conclusion is clearly stated in the review report, regardless of whether the sponsor or FDA conducted the analysis. The administration route, special designations and review pathways (e.g. AA, accelerated approval), and warnings in the approved labels were also examined. For drugs that received AA, we used data at the time of accelerated approval instead of traditional approval.

After performing the preliminary regression analyses, 14 explanatory variables were incorporated into the model (Table 2). Of the four approaches to accelerate drugs availability, breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) did not have meaningful associations with dose decisions and hence did not remain in the model. We applied multinomial logistic regression models to describe the likelihood of a drug falling into each of the three categories related to changes in the dose: upward (U), downward (D), or no change (N). We conducted the analysis with the "N" subgroup as a reference group for two other groups (U and D). We also applied binomial logistic regression models to the modification "D" with the "N" subgroup as the reference for further examination. The likelihood‐ratio test and Hosmer–Lemeshow test were used to assess robustness and goodness of fit.

Premedication should be administered for subsequent BAVENCIO doses based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage for MCC

The recommended dosage of BAVENCIO is 800 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for UC

The recommended dosage of BAVENCIO is 800 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

2.4 Recommended Dosage for RCC

The recommended dosage of BAVENCIO is 800 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks in combination with axitinib 5 mg orally taken twice daily (12 hours apart) with or without food until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

When axitinib is used in combination with BAVENCIO, dose escalation of axitinib above the initial 5 mg dose may be considered at intervals of two weeks or longer. Review the Full Prescribing Information for axitinib prior to initiation.

2.5 Dose Modifications

No dose reduction for BAVENCIO is recommended. In general, withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated adverse reactions. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reactions, recurrent severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated reactions that require systemic immunosuppressive treatment, or an inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 mg or less of prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks of initiating corticosteroids.

Dosage modifications for BAVENCIO for adverse reactions that require management different from these general guidelines are summarized in Table 1.

Table 2 presents dosage modifications that are different from those described above in Table 1 for BAVENCIO used as monotherapy or in the Full Prescribing Information for the drug administered in combination.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the management of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV) [^523b011e]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

The Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and Immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV) management guideline was last updated and published as part of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases. Based on new developments in IgAN assessment and therapy, a major update of the guideline was necessary in 2024. Compared with the last version, the KDIGO 2025 IgAN guideline now encourages a more liberal kidney biopsy policy and suggests aiming for stricter proteinuria control, with a goal of < 0.5 g/d, ideally < 0.3 g/d, and a stable estimated glomerular filtration rate. A major new concept in the 2025 guideline is to initiate treatment with (i) therapies that prevent or reduce pathogenic IgA production and IgA/IgA and IgA/IgG immune complex formation along with (ii) therapies to manage the consequences of existing IgAN-induced nephron loss. Approaches to achieve the first aim are currently limited to targeted-release budesonide (Nefecon) or reduced-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy and, in Chinese patients, mycophenolate mofetil. Approaches to the more generic second aim include healthy lifestyle education, renin-angiotensin system blockers, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and/or dual endothelin angiotensin receptor blockers. Little has changed for special situations of IgA-dominant immune complex glomerular diseases such as nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and pregnancy in IgAN, or children with IgAN or IgAV, given the lack of major clinical trials in these patient populations. Here, we provide an executive summary of the most important changes in the KDIGO 2025 IgAN and IgAV guideline as a quick reference.

Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects management during GLP-1 therapy — Gradual dose escalation helps the body adapt over time, minimizing frequency and severity of GI symptoms, and during dose escalation in the clinical trials subjects were allowed to remain at a GLP-1 dose for up to 8 weeks, as needed, to allow GI side effects to dissipate; in the clinical experience of some authors of this Advisory, another approach is to maintain individuals at the lowest effective dose and escalate only as needed (i.e., when weight reduction ceases or efficacy wanes), although shortages of medications at lower doses may be a barrier. Before initiating therapy, clinicians should present GI side effects in detail, advise individuals to contact them early if side effects develop and provide mitigation strategies should side effects occur.

### Using quantitative approaches to optimize dosages for new combinations and subsequent indications for oncology drugs [^26182c65]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Ongoing efforts to optimize the dosages of oncology drugs have largely focused on the initial indication, with emphasis placed on maximizing the utility of all available evidence to improve dose finding, dose selection, and trial design; however, optimizing dosages for new combinations or subsequent indications is more complex and warrants further discussion. For example, the dose-response (DR) or exposure-response (ER) relationships can change when multiple drugs are used (combination therapies) and can differ between tumor types, patient populations, and treatment settings (subsequent indications). Quantitative approaches can help address the challenges of optimizing dosages for new combinations or subsequent indications. To further this dialogue, the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Clinical Pharmacology and the International Society of Pharmacometrics co-sponsored a workshop to discuss the development of investigational and approved drugs in new combinations or for subsequent indications using model-informed approaches to investigate, support, and select optimized dosages for oncology drugs.

### Dose determinations at drug approval reviews: FDA-approved drugs in past 5 Years [^c545943f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Of the 218 eligible drugs (NMEs) approved by the FDA between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022, a total of 28 drugs (13%) had modifications or postmarketing requirements to the proposed dose, 20 of which were classified as changes to a lower dose ("D", downward, 9.2%) and five of which were classified as changes to a higher dose ("U", upward, 2.3%). The remaining 193 drugs had no modifications ("N", no change, 89%). Of the "N" group, three drugs were classified as "Neutral" with nondirectional change (1.4%, Table 1). There were more upward changes in the infectious disease category than in the other therapeutic categories (P < 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Dose changes were most frequent for oncology, small molecules, and antibodies; however, no statistically significant associations were observed (Table 3). Table 4 highlights illustrative examples detailing the FDA's rationale for recommending specific dose modifications and the resulting outcomes. A complete list of 28 drugs is provided in Table S1. The decision to lower the dose was primarily driven by safety concerns, often informed by dose/exposure–response analyses and whether the dose had been tested in clinical trials, provided it fell within the tested exposure range. Although regulatory designations were not consistently linked to dose modifications in the case‐by‐case analysis, AA designation was associated with postmarketing study requests for lower doses.

### Dose determinations at drug approval reviews: FDA-approved drugs in past 5 Years [^f9321cfd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

This study had some limitations. First, the primary source of information was FDA review reports. Although companies' strategies for dose selection can be captured from these reports, as they are sourced from the final approved package, they do not reflect the companies' original proposed package at an earlier timepoint in development and may have been adjusted by incorporating advice from the FDA. This limits the scope of this study to dose determination upon approval. Additionally, the analysis is limited to cases where dose challenges were successfully resolved, excluding instances that resulted in non‐approval. Second, the source of information was limited to the 5 years between 2018 and 2022, and caution is required when extrapolating to an earlier or more recent picture of current drug development. Third, the study is limited to FDA‐approved drugs, which may not be generalizable to other regulatory agencies. Finally, it is important to note that the relationship between the optimized dose and quality resulting from these regulatory decisions, namely, health outcomes, is outside the scope of this study. Decades ago, research indicated that more than 20% of labeled doses underwent dose modifications after being approved by the FDA, primarily for safety reasons. In a more recent example, Shah et al. listed several oncology drugs whose doses were modified after approval for safety and tolerability reasons. These less‐than‐ideal postmarketing modifications motivated efforts toward proactive dose optimization before launch. Further research is required to evaluate the causes and consequences of regulatory decisions at the time of approval.

In conclusion, our study shows that dose "optimization" occurs during the FDA drug approval reviews, with 13% of NMEs undergoing dose changes or postmarketing assessments requests, 9.2% of which were in a downward direction. Factors associated with dose modifications included product characteristics, presence of compelling evidence, and restrictions in data availability. Early identification of exposure‐related safety risks and comprehensive dose/exposure–response data — spanning higher and lower than the proposed dose range when safety profile permits — can support optimal dosing and reduce regulatory uncertainties. These findings contribute to our understanding of how the concepts of ICH E4 are applied to recently approved drugs and embodied in current drug development, and of the practical conditions needed to reach a consensus on an optimized dosage during drug review.

Table 5
Multinomial logistic regression analysis of the three types of dose modification (categorical dependent variable: "D", Downward; "N", No change; "U", Upward) during drug review by FDA: Analysis with three models with different sets of explanatory variables; Model 1 (no adjustment), Model 2 (adjusted with modality) and Model 3 (adjusted with therapeutic category)

To focus on factors associated with the downward change, which was the most frequent disagreement on drug dose during the drug review, we used a logistic regression model with "D" and "N" as the binomial dependent variable (Figure 1). Products from AA, designated as Fast Track or First‐in‐Class, were associated with the decision in favor of disagreement (odds ratio: 5.85, 3.44, and 1.88, respectively), while drugs were designated Priority Review for agreement (odds ratio: 0.20). For development strategies and product characteristics, "Oral administration", "E–R in safety only", "CV warnings on the label", and "Highest dose proposed" were associated with the decision in favor of disagreement (odds ratio: 3.29, 4.29, 3.11, and 3.21), while "Biomarkers in dose rationale" and "DRF study" for agreement (odds ratio: 0.42 and 0.52). Compared with the respective univariate logistic regression analysis (Table S4), the odds ratios for "First‐in‐Class", "Highest dose proposed", and "Priority Review" were more than doubled in the multivariate logistic regression analysis (Table S4).

### Dose determinations at drug approval reviews: FDA-approved drugs in past 5 Years [^a79c5509]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Product characteristics, particularly safety‐related factors, seemed substantially affect the dose decisions at approval. Products with "E‐R in safety only", "CV warnings on label", and "Oral administration" had 4.29‐fold, 3.11‐fold, and 3.29‐fold higher odds of downward dose changes, respectively (Figure 1). The importance of understanding E–R in finding the optimal dose has long been advocated, and so has the implementation of "Dose‐Exposure‐Response at the center of drug development and regulatory approval". Our study highlighted the substantial role of E‐R analysis in FDA's decision‐making during drug approval. In a similar context, "CV warnings on label" here is one example where the unfavorable effect of a drug is life‐threatening that is often dose/exposure‐related. Our results do not preclude the possibility that other exposure‐related adverse reactions may have influenced this decision. For dosage forms historically, self‐administered oral dosage forms have received more scrutiny during drug review than other dosage forms. This analysis accounts for disease area, modality, and the presence or absence of dose‐ranging studies, but additional considerations for oral and other dosage forms may exist.

### Deferasirox [^a63de052]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

During Therapy:

Monitor serum ferritin monthly and adjust the dose of deferasirox oral granules, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on serum ferritin trends.
Use the minimum effective dose to achieve a trend of decreasing ferritin.
Make dose adjustments in steps of 3.5 or 7 mg per kg and tailor adjustments to the individual patient's response and therapeutic goals.
In patients not adequately controlled with doses of 21 mg per kg (e.g., serum ferritin levels persistently above 2,500 mcg/L and not showing a decreasing trend over time), doses of up to 28 mg per kg may be considered. Doses above 28 mg per kg are not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Adjust dose based on serum ferritin levels
If the serum ferritin falls below 1,000 mcg/L at 2 consecutive visits, consider dose reduction especially if the deferasirox oral granules dose is greater than 17.5 mg/kg/day [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
If the serum ferritin falls below 500 mcg/L, interrupt deferasirox oral granules therapy to minimize the risk of overchelation, and continue monthly monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Evaluate the need for ongoing chelation therapy for patients whose conditions no longer require regular blood transfusions.
Use the minimum effective dose to maintain iron burden in the target range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Monitor blood counts, liver function, renal function and ferritin monthly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)].
Interrupt deferasirox oral granules for pediatric patients who have acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor more frequently. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Romiplostim (Nplate) [^f32c8a21]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For Pediatric Patients with ITP

The initial dose of Nplate is 1 mcg/kg. Actual body weight at initiation of treatment should always be used when calculating initial dose. In pediatric patients, future dose adjustments are based on changes in platelet counts and changes in body weight. Reassessment of body weight is recommended every 12 weeks.

Adjust the weekly dose of Nplate by increments of 1 mcg/kg until the patient achieves a platelet count ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding; do not exceed a maximum weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a pediatric placebo-controlled clinical study, the median of the most frequent dose of Nplate received by patients during weeks 17 through 24 was 5.5 mcg/kg.

Adjust the dose as follows for pediatric patients:

If the platelet count is < 50 × 10⁹/L, increase the dose by 1 mcg/kg.
If platelet count is > 200 × 10⁹/L and ≤ 400 × 10⁹/L for 2 consecutive weeks, reduce the dose by 1 mcg/kg.
If platelet count is > 400 × 10⁹/L, do not dose. Continue to assess the platelet count weekly. After the platelet count has fallen to < 200 × 10⁹/L, resume Nplate at a dose reduced by 1 mcg/kg.

2.2 Patients with Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome

For Adult and Pediatric Patients (including term neonates)

The recommended dose of Nplate is 10 mcg/kg administered once as a subcutaneous injection. Administer the dose as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to radiation levels greater than 2 gray (Gy).

Administer Nplate regardless of whether a complete blood count (CBC) can be obtained. Estimate a patient's absorbed whole body radiation dose (i.e., level of radiation exposure) based on information from public health authorities, biodosimetry if available, or clinical findings such as time to onset of vomiting or lymphocyte depletion kinetics.

Table 3
Modifications to the dose during Food and Drug Administration (FDA's) drug approval review: Summary by modality and therapeutic category

Table 4
Case examples of drugs with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐recommended dose modifications during drug approval review process

We conducted a multinomial logistic regression analysis with or without adjustment based on modality or therapeutic categories and found no major differences in model performance based on relative risk ratio (RRR) or goodness of fit (Table 5). Hence, we interpreted the results by using a model without adjustments (Table 5, Model 1). Descriptive data for the variables are presented in Table S2. In general, not only the development strategies and product characteristics (B in Table 5) but also the factors related to the drug review and approval process (A in Table 5) were associated with the decision to modify or question the dose during drug review. Products that had used the AA program had increased likelihood of being in the "D" category (RRR: 5.73, P < 0.05) as compared to being in the "N" subgroup, provided other conditions were equal. Fast Track was also associated with higher probability of being in the "D" category (RRR: 3.39, P < 0.1). On the contrary, products granted a Priority Review appeared to be associated with a lower likelihood of being in the "D" category (RRR: 0.195, P < 0.1). Among the variables related to the development strategies and product characteristics, products for which the proposed dose being the highest dose tested in the clinical development (RRR: 3.27, P < 0.1), and products for which positive trend in E–R relationship was observed for safety but not efficacy (RRR: 4.27, P < 0.05), were more likely in the "D" category. On the other hand, those that used pharmacodynamic biomarkers as the basis for dose setting were less likely in the "D" category (RRR: 0.405). "Multiple dose levels in pivotal trials" and a wide range of doses considered during the development phase (> 10‐fold) were identified as factors associated with disagreement rather than agreement (RRR: 6.28, P < 0.01; RRR: 3.11, P < 0.1, both in a downward direction). Products of "multiple dose levels were tested in the pivotal study" (RRR = 5.92, P = 0.16) and "orphan drug" (RRR = 9.07, P = 0.17) appeared to have increased probability of upward change (i.e. the "U" category), but no variable was found to be statistically significant. Table S3 presents the 95% confidence intervals for the RRR in Model 1.

### Dose determinations at drug approval reviews: FDA-approved drugs in past 5 Years [^4a8ed7f5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug dose appropriateness is one of the most discussed issues in regulatory reviews. We analyzed dose determinations during Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug reviews to determine whether there were changes between the proposed and approved doses of new molecular entities (NMEs), including cases where postmarketing dose‐finding studies were requested, and explored the factors associated with these decisions. Of the 218 eligible NMEs approved between 2018 and 2022, 28 drugs (13%) had modifications to the proposed dose or requested additional postmarketing assessments, 20 of which were to a lower dose ("downward", 9.2%) and five were to a higher dose ("upward", 2.3%). Multinomial logistic regression analysis suggested that products that used the Accelerated Approval program were more likely to undergo downward modification (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 5.73). In addition, the fact that a dose/exposure–response relationship was observed for safety, but not efficacy, was associated with an increased probability of downward modifications (RRR: 4.27). In contrast, the use of pharmacodynamic biomarkers for dose setting and designation of Priority Review was associated with decreased probabilities of downward change (RRR: 0.405 and 0.195, respectively). Infectious disease drugs went through more upward modifications than those in the other therapeutic categories. This study revealed that dose "optimization" occurs during the FDA's review for drug approval and that not only product characteristics but also factors related to the drug review and approval process are associated with the decisions to modify or question the dose, suggesting considerations for the presence of compelling evidence and restrictions in data availabilities.

8.1 For patients with CLL/SLL and ≥ 2 prior therapies including a cBTKi and Ven, when retreatment with Ven w/wo an anti-CD20 mAb or transitioning to an alternate cBTKi is not preferred, we recommend pirtobrutinib in most cases. In patients who are deemed good candidates, lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) should also be considered for this line or subsequent lines of therapy

Pirtobrutinib

The noncovalent BTKi pirtobrutinib is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for patients with CLL/SLL and ≥ 2 prior therapies including a cBTKi and Ven based on the BRUIN study. In this study, patients with prior cBTKi and Ven treatment (n = 128) who received the recommended dose of pirtobrutinib at 200 mg orally daily until progression or intolerance had an ORR of 80% (complete response rate of 0%) with a median PFS of 16 months, without a plateau in the PFS curve. Notably, pirtobrutinib was very well tolerated with reported rates of any grade diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and contusion as 37%, 28%, 27%, and 26%, respectively. Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were limited, with the most common being neutropenia in 28%, and it should be noted that many patients were neutropenic at baseline and there were very limited cases of febrile neutropenia. Nonhematologic grade ≥ 3 adverse events were rare, including typical BTKi adverse events such as hypertension (4%) and atrial fibrillation (2%). Given that CLL is most commonly diagnosed during the seventh decade and many patients have additional medical comorbidities, the limited toxicity and ease of administration are key considerations in recommending pirtobrutinib therapy in most cases in which patients need additional treatment after cBTKi and Ven.

### Deferasirox (deferasirox oral granules) [^72059d3a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

During Therapy:

Monitor serum ferritin monthly and adjust the dose of deferasirox oral granules, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on serum ferritin trends.
Use the minimum effective dose to achieve a trend of decreasing ferritin
Make dose adjustments in steps of 3.5 or 7 mg per kg and tailor adjustments to the individual patient's response and therapeutic goals.
In patients not adequately controlled with doses of 21 mg per kg (e.g., serum ferritin levels persistently above 2,500 mcg/L and not showing a decreasing trend over time), doses of up to 28 mg per kg may be considered. Doses above 28 mg per kg are not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Adjust dose based on serum ferritin levels
If the serum ferritin falls below 1,000 mcg/L at 2 consecutive visits, consider dose reduction, especially if the deferasirox oral granules dose is greater than 17.5 mg/kg/day [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
If the serum ferritin falls below 500 mcg/L, interrupt deferasirox oral granules therapy to minimize the risk of overchelation, and continue monthly monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Evaluate the need for ongoing chelation therapy for patients whose conditions no longer require regular blood transfusions.
Use the minimum effective dose to maintain iron burden in the target range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Monitor blood counts, liver function, renal function and ferritin monthly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)].
Interrupt deferasirox oral granules for pediatric patients who have acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor more frequently. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2025–26 influenza season [^43f4785a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

Updates to influenza vaccination recommendations — four updates to the 2024–25 recommendations are presented, including three FDA-approved labeling changes and a new recommendation. In March 2025, FDA issued recommendations for the antigenic composition of 2025–26 U.S.-approved influenza vaccines. In September 2024, FDA approved FluMist (LAIV3) for self-administration (for recipients aged 18 through 49 years) or administration by a caregiver aged ≥ 18 years, and FluMist for self-administration or caregiver administration is anticipated to become available during the 2025–26 season. In March 2025, FDA expanded approval of Flublok (RIV3), previously approved for persons aged ≥ 18 years, to children and adolescents aged 9 through 17 years. On June 26, 2025, ACIP made a new recommendation that children aged ≤ 18 years, pregnant women, and adults receive seasonal influenza vaccines only in single-dose formulations that are free of thimerosal as a preservative.

### Pediatric labeling changes… [^b9bf0f6f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Having information about a medicine's safety, effectiveness and dosing for children in the product's labeling is important to ensure health care professionals can make evidence-based decisions about treating children. A pediatric labeling change refers to any update to a product's labeling to add information about safety, effectiveness or dosing for children. Many labeling changes represent a new FDA approval for children. Others provide new safety or efficacy information about how to treat children. For example, some labeling changes may reflect dosing information for children or new safety information advising against use in certain pediatric populations.

The pediatric labeling changes and study characteristics data presented below highlight key pediatric information obtained from studies submitted to the FDA in response to legislative initiatives, including the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2002 and the Pediatric Rule of 1998. These laws encourage and, in certain circumstances, require pharmaceutical companies to develop medicines for children. These laws have led to a dramatic increase in pediatric studies submitted to the FDA and resulted in new treatment options for children. Pediatric Labeling Changes 1998–2023 The graph below shows the number of labeling changes for pediatric populations under certain federal laws. The number of pediatric labeling changes includes each individual label change approved by the FDA. One product may undergo several pediatric labeling changes.

For example, a product's labeling may be updated once when studies in older children have been reviewed by the FDA and again years later after studies in younger children are completed. Pediatric Labeling Changes Spreadsheet This spreadsheet contains all pediatric labeling changes made under BPCA, PREA and the Pediatric Rule since 1998. Each pediatric labeling change includes the date of the pediatric labeling change, specific drug or biological product, indication studied, a summary of the labeling change, therapeutic category and type of legislation. Pediatric Labeling Changes Spreadsheet.

Pediatric Study Characteristics Spreadsheet This spreadsheet contains pediatric study characteristics for the clinical trials conducted to support each pediatric labeling change, including the study number, type of study, study design, number of pediatric participants, ages studied, number of study centers, number of countries and, for BPCA clinical trials, any available racial and ethnic information. The spreadsheet includes pediatric studies that resulted in labeling changes made since September 27, 2007 as required by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007. Pediatric Descriptors Spreadsheet FDA intends to update these spreadsheets quarterly.

### Dose determinations at drug approval reviews: FDA-approved drugs in past 5 Years [^e4950c11]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The MCA visualized that, even though only the overall downward change ("D") was considered in the MCA, the samples positioned closely with each other depending on the 5 types of changes after regulatory review (Figure 2 a). Dose changes at the time of review were observed to be a manifestation of the reviewer's behavior to fill in uncertainties, such as the left quadrants (where type 3 and 5 changes are positioned in Figure 2 a) with a low amount of information on dose–response; additional studies are required to compensate for the data. In contrast, the right quadrants (where type 1 and type 4 changes are positioned) have abundant information on the dose response, which is sufficient for the agency to select a dose different from the proposed dose. The presence of AA, First‐in‐Class, and Fast Track in the left quadrant suggests that when a treatment option is innovative and urgently needed, the absence of dose–response information at the time of approval is reasonable (with the condition that more data should be obtained after marketing), allowing for early drug access and appropriate dose setting. Our results confirm how the concept of ICH E4 is actualized, where the agency is striking a balance, by making the review more scrutinized when the level of information is deferred.

### Dangers of under-treatment and over-treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma [^fe933421]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

4.7 Dose selection of ICS

Another important question in Case 2 is the rationale for using an FDA‐unapproved high ICS dose instead of an FDA‐approved low dose to treat mild "asthma". The use of such high doses is common in clinical practice. The rationale is not known, but there are several possibilities. A high dose may have been intentionally chosen to gain quick disease control, with an "intention" to step down the dose after disease control was achieved. Another possibility is that the prescriber didn't know that the 110 μg FP ICS strength was not FDA‐approved for use in children. FP 44 µg/puff was the only strength approved by the FDA for use in children because, unlike the 110 and 220 µg/puff strengths, it did not cause adrenal suppression. However, even the approved 44 μg strength suppressed childhood growth, suggesting that growth suppression is a more sensitive indicator of systemic bioavailability than adrenal suppression. Choosing FDA‐unapproved doses for two therapies (ICS and INCS), not just one, suggests a general lack of awareness of the contents of FDA‐approved package labels. This may be why the doctor dismissed concerns about side effects raised by her parents and disregarded the obvious changes in her growth percentiles/BMI and physical appearance (Figure 2A, B). Doctors may also be conditioned to expect nonadherence 46, which generally prevents the development of clinically significant ICS and INCS side effects. However, that leads to a false sense of security since children (like Case 2) with unexpectedly high levels of adherence can develop systemic side effects that will go unrecognized and cause significant morbidity and even mortality.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^3ba3b5bc]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

ACC/AHA clinical practice guideline methodology — alignment with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) processes is emphasized: The goal of this guiding document is to ensure alignment between the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval processes for drugs and devices and the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guideline recommendations. Foundational principles state that AHA/ACC Guidelines should not recommend the use of non–FDA-approved drugs or devices and that AHA/ACC Guidelines provide a Class of Recommendation (COR) and Level of Evidence (LOE) for many FDA-approved drugs or devices for a specific clinical diagnosis. Throughout this document, the term "FDA approval" is used to encompass drug approvals and device clearances, and the report notes considerable nuances and provides relevant questions and proposed answers to guide incorporation of FDA processes into AHA/ACC guideline methodology.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^5fda7530]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Intervention and comparator(s) — Economic value statements should be informed by CEAs that have a well-defined intervention strategy and consider all appropriate comparator strategies for the condition and population being studied. In this context, appropriateness of comparators refers to being indicated for the condition and population as well as potentially accessible to the population being evaluated. Because the cost-effectiveness of an intervention is measured relative to a comparator, the omission of a relevant comparator (or the inclusion of an inappropriate comparator) can meaningfully change the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and produce misleading results. Judging whether a CEA incorporates the relevant comparator(s) relies on the clinical expertise of the guideline committee.

### High-precision information retrieval for rapid clinical guideline updates [^ee4f2a6e]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2 depicts the search view of our NGE browser, which allows retrieving RCT publications and trial register entries based on a particular population, and filtered according to different selection criteria such as publication dates or clinical trial phases. The user has to select at least a population, here given by a guideline topic. When using the system without the graphical user interface but through its exposed REST API, it can also be queried with custom sets of UMLS concepts, e.g. to find evidence for a specific subpopulation. The result is a list of RCTs from different sources, i.e.articles retrieved throughor, or clinical trials registered at. To guide the user to the relevant search results, the tool highlights extracted interventions using color codes based on their occurrence within the selected guideline that is related to the selected publication. The search view offers various selection criteria to filter the result set according to different requirements a user may have. The default values are tailored to a prospective scenario, i.e. targeted for users, who wish to identify new, potentially practice-changing evidence with respect to an existing clinical guideline. A detailed description of the available filters is provided in Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 3. Note that all filter criteria are pre-computed as structured metadata upon import into the database, so there is no computational overhead of combining filters, but also no interaction between NLP models. In the following, we focus on two main innovative features enabled by our employed NLP components.

### Paliperidone (Invega) [^f2887bb9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible appear to increase with duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, INVEGA should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on INVEGA, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with INVEGA despite the presence of the syndrome.

5.6 Metabolic Changes

Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information)

Ischemic Heart Disease

Inform patients that NUBEQA has been associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if any symptoms suggestive of an ischemic heart disease event occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Seizure

Inform patients that NUBEQA has been associated with an increased risk of seizure. Discuss conditions that may predispose to seizures and medications that may lower the seizure threshold. Advise patients of the risk of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. Inform patients to contact their healthcare provider right away if they have loss of consciousness or seizure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Inform patients that NUBEQA can be harmful to a developing fetus and can cause loss of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of NUBEQA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Dosage and Administration

Inform patients receiving concomitant gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist therapy that they need to maintain this treatment during the course of treatment with NUBEQA.

Instruct patients to take their dose of two tablets (twice daily). NUBEQA should be taken with food. Each tablet should be swallowed whole.

Inform patients that in the event of a missed daily dose of NUBEQA, to take any missed dose, as soon as they remember prior to the next scheduled dose, and not to take two doses together to make up for a missed dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Infertility

Advise male patients that NUBEQA may impair fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

5.4 Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, RISPERDAL CONSTA should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with RISPERDAL CONSTA, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with RISPERDAL CONSTA despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Lamotrigine (Subvenite) [^fd35712d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adjunctive Therapy with Lamotrigine in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome

The effectiveness of lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was established in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 169 patients aged 3 to 25 years (n = 79 on lamotrigine, n = 90 on placebo). Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo phase, patients were randomized to 16 weeks of treatment with lamotrigine or placebo added to their current AED regimen of up to 3 drugs. Patients were dosed on a fixed-dose regimen based on body weight and valproate use. Target doses were designed to approximate 5 mg/kg/day for patients taking valproate (maximum dose: 200 mg/day) and 15 mg/kg/day for patients not taking valproate (maximum dose: 400 mg/day). The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in major motor seizures (atonic, tonic, major myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures). For the intent-to-treat population, the median reduction of major motor seizures was 32% in patients treated with lamotrigine and 9% on placebo, a difference that was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Drop attacks were significantly reduced by lamotrigine (34%) compared with placebo (9%), as were tonic-clonic seizures (36% reduction versus 10% increase for lamotrigine and placebo, respectively).
