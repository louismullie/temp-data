## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 40-year-old man with a 6-month history of nighttime acid reflux, a persistent cough that worsens supine, and difficulty swallowing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether this fits reflux-cough physiology. Then, I should verify red flags and the differential diagnosis, especially for dysphagia. Next, I will review the strength of evidence for empiric therapy versus testing, and clarify when to scope versus when to monitor reflux. After that, I need to outline a staged management plan with lifestyle, pharmacologic, and procedural options, and finally, I should set expectations for response timelines and define what constitutes refractory disease and next steps if treatment fails.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. Nighttime reflux with a cough that worsens supine is a classic pattern for reflux-cough syndrome, and the addition of dysphagia raises concern for esophageal injury or motility disease, so I should not jump to conclusions without checking for alarm features and alternative causes of chronic cough and dysphagia [^7b7a2748] [^948ec56f].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags and differential. Hemoptysis, weight loss, anemia, early satiety, odynophagia, or progressive solids dysphagia would push me toward urgent endoscopy to exclude malignancy or stricture; asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, and eosinophilic bronchitis remain common alternative causes of chronic cough and should be screened in parallel, particularly when typical reflux symptoms are absent or minimal [^3ef266d0] [^e402fb75] [^2a068fec].

> I need to check the strength of evidence for empiric therapy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while older narratives suggested GERD accounts for a meaningful fraction of chronic cough, contemporary guidelines emphasize that acid suppression alone is unlikely to help cough in the absence of typical reflux symptoms, and meta-analyses show no clear benefit of PPIs for chronic cough, so empiric PPI monotherapy without lifestyle measures is not recommended in this scenario [^d04e5b88] [^5474e155] [^28367715].

> Let me consider the role of testing. If extraesophageal symptoms predominate without heartburn or regurgitation, guidelines favor upfront reflux monitoring off PPI rather than an empiric PPI trial; wireless pH or pH-impedance can quantify acid and nonacid reflux and correlate with cough, whereas endoscopy is insensitive for diagnosing reflux-related cough and should not be used to establish that diagnosis by itself [^93e8fe2c] [^724c7903] [^9e93aff6].

> But wait, what if dysphagia signals structural disease. I should confirm that dysphagia warrants endoscopic evaluation to exclude stricture, ring, mass, or eosinophilic esophagitis; if alarm features are present or if dysphagia is progressive, upper endoscopy is indicated before or alongside physiologic testing, whereas isolated cough without alarms does not mandate early endoscopy [^71259dcf] [^93e8fe2c].

> Next, I should review a staged management plan. Initially, I almost said to start a twice-daily PPI empirically, but hold on, I should verify — given the absence of typical reflux symptoms here, I should prioritize lifestyle therapy and, if pursued, pair any pharmacotherapy with lifestyle measures rather than using PPIs alone; lifestyle steps include head-of-bed elevation, avoiding meals within 3 hours of bedtime, weight optimization if overweight, and dietary triggers reduction, with the understanding that evidence for cough improvement is limited and individualized [^21b96dce] [^2d62fc06].

> I will now examine pharmacologic options if typical reflux features emerge or if testing supports reflux. In that context, a time-limited, adequately dosed PPI trial with twice-daily dosing for 8–12 weeks can be reasonable, ideally combined with lifestyle therapy; if nocturnal symptoms persist on PPI, a bedtime H2RA can be added, recognizing tachyphylaxis risk with chronic nightly use [^c2d83f6d] [^2208d403].

> Let me think about what to do if cough persists despite optimized therapy. If cough remains refractory after about 3 months of appropriate therapy, I should double-check that other common etiologies have been addressed and then proceed to objective reflux testing off PPI to quantify acid and nonacid exposure and symptom association; manometry can assess for motility disorders if surgery is contemplated, and I should avoid oropharyngeal pH monitoring given poor validation [^2372b33d] [^71f88051] [^897d93e7].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of surgery. Antireflux surgery may benefit carefully selected patients with proven abnormal acid exposure, adequate esophageal motility, and refractory extraesophageal symptoms despite optimized medical therapy; however, surgery should be avoided in those with normal acid exposure or major motility disorders, and decisions should be individualized at a multidisciplinary center [^97b48bd4] [^0182872a].

> I need to ensure expectations are realistic. Improvement in cough attributable to reflux, if present, often lags gastrointestinal symptom response and may take up to 3 months; thus, I should set a predefined reassessment window and use validated cough instruments to track outcomes, while also planning parallel evaluation for asthma, UACS, and eosinophilic bronchitis if cough does not improve as expected [^21b96dce] [^9941bbe2] [^e402fb75].

> Let me reconsider the dysphagia piece. Difficulty swallowing is an alarm symptom that warrants endoscopic evaluation to exclude structural disease; if endoscopy is normal and dysphagia persists, high-resolution manometry can help identify motility disorders such as achalasia or ineffective esophageal motility, which can coexist with reflux and complicate management decisions [^71259dcf] [^aaae962a].

> In summary, I should confirm the syndrome, screen for red flags and alternative diagnoses, avoid PPI monotherapy without typical reflux symptoms, tailor testing to the phenotype with a low threshold to scope for dysphagia, implement lifestyle measures with selective, time-limited pharmacotherapy when appropriate, and escalate to objective reflux testing if cough remains refractory, all while tracking outcomes and maintaining diagnostic humility given the limited specificity of symptoms and tests in extraesophageal reflux [^93e8fe2c] [^5474e155] [^7b7a2748].

The patient's symptoms — nocturnal acid reflux, supine-predominant chronic cough, and dysphagia — are most consistent with **GERD-related chronic cough** [^7b7a2748] and possible **laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)** [^b039fd45], with dysphagia raising concern for esophageal injury or motility disorder [^948ec56f]. The cough likely reflects vagally mediated esophageal–bronchial reflexes and, in some cases, microaspiration [^10afa281] [^11cd368d]. Dysphagia warrants prompt evaluation for esophagitis, stricture, or motility disease [^notfound]. Initial management should include lifestyle measures, a **twice-daily PPI trial for 8–12 weeks** [^c2d83f6d], and objective reflux testing if symptoms persist or if surgery is considered [^2372b33d] [^71f88051].

---

## Clinical significance of symptoms

### Nocturnal acid reflux and supine-predominant cough

- **Pathophysiology**: Nocturnal reflux is common in GERD [^2c2d7b57] and often "silent" from a GI perspective [^7b7a2748]; supine positioning prolongs acid contact and can trigger cough via esophageal–bronchial reflexes or microaspiration [^2c2d7b57] [^10afa281].

- **Clinical evidence**: Chronic cough is a recognized extraesophageal manifestation of GERD [^b039fd45], with reflux contributing to 0–41% of cases in specialty clinics [^7b7a2748]; up to 75% may lack typical heartburn/regurgitation [^7b7a2748].

- **Prognosis**: Nocturnal symptoms impair quality of life and may signal more severe disease or complications [^2c2d7b57].

---

### Dysphagia

- **Clinical significance**: Dysphagia is an alarm symptom [^notfound] that warrants evaluation for esophagitis, stricture, ring, or motility disorder (e.g. achalasia) [^notfound].

- **Diagnostic implications**: Endoscopy is indicated to exclude structural disease; manometry and pH-impedance testing are appropriate if endoscopy is normal or if surgery is planned [^2372b33d] [^71f88051].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Detailed history and physical exam | - Exclude other causes (UACS, asthma, NAEB) [^e402fb75] <br/> - Identify alarm features [^3ef266d0] |
| 2 | Upper endoscopy | - Dysphagia <br/> - Alarm symptoms <br/> - Refractory symptoms [^71259dcf] |
| 3 | Ambulatory reflux monitoring (pH-impedance) | - Persistent cough despite PPI <br/> - Atypical symptoms <br/> - Pre-surgical planning [^2372b33d] [^71f88051] |
| 4 | Esophageal manometry | - Suspected motility disorder <br/> - Pre-surgical planning [^2372b33d] |

---

## Management strategies

### Lifestyle modifications

- **Head-of-bed elevation**: 6–8 inches [^21b96dce].
- **Meal timing**: Avoid meals within 3 hours of bedtime [^21b96dce].
- **Weight loss**: If overweight/obese [^21b96dce].
- **Trigger avoidance**: Limit alcohol, caffeine, fatty foods, and large meals [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: Twice daily for 8–12 weeks [^c2d83f6d]; more effective than H2RAs for GERD control [^2485b2e3].
- **H2 receptor antagonists**: Consider bedtime dosing for nocturnal symptoms if on PPI [^2208d403].
- **Prokinetics**: Limited evidence; reserve for select cases [^047f733a].

---

### Surgical interventions

Consider **laparoscopic fundoplication** or magnetic sphincter augmentation for refractory cases with proven acid reflux and normal motility [^0182872a] [^97b48bd4].

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Response to therapy is often delayed, with cough improving over weeks to months; **follow-up should track cough severity, quality of life, and adverse effects** [^21b96dce] [^9941bbe2]. Persistent or refractory cough warrants objective reflux testing and multidisciplinary evaluation [^2372b33d] [^71f88051].

---

The patient's nocturnal reflux, supine-predominant cough, and dysphagia are most consistent with **GERD-related chronic cough** and possible LPR, with dysphagia signaling structural or motility disease. A structured approach — lifestyle measures, a **twice-daily PPI trial**, and selective testing — is recommended, with endoscopy prioritized for dysphagia and reflux monitoring for refractory cases [^c2d83f6d] [^71259dcf] [^2372b33d].

CHEST guideline — Subacute cough algorithm: In patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks, always screen for the presence of red flags and perform history and physical examination asking about red flags, environmental and occupational factors, and travel exposures. If a postinfectious or life-threatening diagnosis is suspected (pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease), evaluate and treat first, and consider TB in endemic areas and in high risk groups; if not postinfectious, the workup is the same as chronic cough. Assess for possible new onset or exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, and note that GERD is gastroesophageal reflux disease and NAEB is nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Reminders include to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and to routinely follow patients 4 to 6 weeks after the initial visit. Red flags include hemoptysis; smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance; adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years; prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night; trouble swallowing when eating or drinking; vomiting; recurrent pneumonia; and history of abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough.

### A 39-year-old man with refractory chronic cough accompanied by regurgitation and belching [^ad488d21]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 39-year-old man who did not smoke was admitted to the hospital with recurrent cough for 1 year, accompanied by sputum expectoration (with a small amount of white phlegm), acid regurgitation, and belching. Nasal symptoms or other cough-related contributing factors were denied. The patient reported that his cough mainly occurred at nighttime and was aggravated in the supine position. Vomiting could occur when the cough was violent. He denied fever, dysphonia, chest tightness, wheezing, chest pain and hemoptysis, abdominal pain, and bloating. The patient had initially presented to the local hospital and underwent a chest CT scan. The chest CT scan showed slight and scattered patchy infiltration in bilateral lung fields and without other significant pulmonary lesions. Anti-infective treatment was administered but was not effective for ameliorating the cough symptoms. He then received an inhaled corticosteroid, antihistamines, antileukotriene agents, or proton pump inhibitors for 6 months. However, all these treatments failed to alleviate the patient's cough. He had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for > 10 years and was treated with valsartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker) and atorvastatin. In the past year, the patient had lost 10 kg of weight, and his current BMI was 27.72 kg/m 2.

Reflux-cough syndrome — initial management in adults specifies: "In adult patients with chronic cough suspected to be due to reflux-cough syndrome, we recommend that treatment include (1) diet modification to promote weight loss in overweight or obese patients; (2) head of bed elevation and avoiding meals within 3 hours of bedtime; and (3) in patients who report heartburn and regurgitation, PPIs, H2- receptor antagonists, alginate, or antacid therapy sufficient to control these symptoms (Grade 1C)." Remarks note expected time course and positional therapy: "While it is expected that GI symptoms will respond within 4–8 weeks, the literature suggests that improvement in cough may take up to 3 months." and that "Head of bed elevation is suggested… while acknowledging that it has not been demonstrated to be beneficial for cough."

The pathogenesis and clinical features of gastro-oesophageal reflux related cough are complex and the diagnostic tests available are of limited reliability. Treatment needs to be tailored to the specific needs of individual patients and other possible causes of chronic cough should be investigated. Treatment should only be considered to have failed when cough persists after administration of proton pump inhibitors at an adequate dosage for a sufficient length of time.

### Evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1818b42c]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may present with heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, chronic cough, laryngitis, or even asthma. The clinical presentation of GERD is therefore varied and poses certain challenges to the physician, especially given the limitations of the diagnostic testing.

Discussion

The evaluation of patients with suspected GERD might be challenging. It is based on the evaluation of clinical features, objective evidence of reflux on diagnostic testing, correlation of symptoms with episodes of reflux, evaluation of anatomical abnormalities, and excluding other causes that might account for the presence of the patient's symptoms.

Conclusions

The diagnostic evaluation should include multiple tests, in addition to a thorough clinical examination.

Catheter-based pH monitoring — limitations for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) and reflux-related asthma and chronic cough: Catheter-based pH monitoring places a distal esophageal probe to assess acid reflux and symptom timing, but many laryngeal symptoms lack sudden onset making reliable symptom association difficult, and up to 90% of cough events are not reported with event markers; conventional distal 24-hour esophageal pH-monitoring cannot be considered as reliable for diagnosing LPR and reflux-related asthma, and abnormal distal esophageal exposure does not predict proton pump inhibitor response despite being present in 30%–50% of suspected LPR/asthma cases; in chronic cough, abnormal esophageal acid exposure during 24-hour pH monitoring may help to identify a subgroup more likely to have reflux-related chronic cough.

### Reflux and cough [^dae8600b]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Reflux is a significant contributor to cough in otolaryngology practice; cough is just one marker of its many negative effects on the upper aerodigestive tract. Reflux causes cough both by direct irritation/inflammation and by increasing sensitivities to other noxious agents. Detailed and diligent clinical evaluation, including laryngoscopy, is useful in advancing the working diagnosis of reflux-associated cough. Supplemental testing, including impedance monitoring of esophageal refluxate, can be important to evaluate for both acidic and nonacidic reflux exposure. The mainstay of treatment continues to be dietary and other lifestyle interventions and drug therapy. Although proton-pump inhibitor therapy is effective in most patients, especially those with acid reflux disease, prokinetic therapy is probably very important with those with combined acid and nonacid disease and those with pure nonacid disease. It is likely that failure to improve can be due to behavioral and drug compliance issues. Antireflux surgery can yield long-lasting positive outcomes in carefully selected patients despite the lower efficacy of treatment for primary upper aerodigestive tract symptoms (cough, hoarseness, sore throat) compared with heartburn and regurgitation.

### How would you manage this patient with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms? Grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^71259dcf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common medical condition presenting with heartburn, regurgitation, cough, hoarseness, and/or wheezing. Patients with classic GERD symptoms often do not require diagnostic studies before empirical treatment is initiated. However, if atypical features are present, including alarm symptoms for malignancy, or if symptoms do not respond to conventional treatment, upper endoscopy may be necessary. The optimal management of GERD, which is the subject of debate, depends on the frequency and severity of symptoms. In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology published updated recommendations for diagnosis and management of GERD. In addition to histamine-2 receptor antagonist or proton-pump inhibitor therapy, which may be prescribed as needed or continuously, lifestyle and dietary modification are often advised. Here, 2 physicians, a primary care practitioner and a gastroenterologist, debate how to manage a patient with GERD symptoms. They discuss the diagnosis of this condition, its initial management, indications for upper endoscopy, and how to care for the patient whose condition does not respond to empirical therapy.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^047f733a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Extraesophageal reflux — medical therapy and empiric PPI approach — shows mixed trial results in chronic cough: in 1 open-label study, 79% of patients improved, whereas a meta-analysis of 5 placebo-controlled studies and 2 additional randomized trials found no benefit versus placebo; a short course of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, likely twice daily for 1–2 months, is presented as sufficient to assess reflux association, with twice-daily dosing ensuring near complete esophageal reflux control in 95%–99% of patients. Prokinetic add-on therapy has inconsistent support, with three of 4 studies suggesting symptom reduction versus PPI alone but no change in laryngeal findings, and a meta-analysis stating evidence is inadequate to recommend prokinetics. Baclofen data are preliminary: a case series of 3 patients reported improvement or resolution in all 3, and an 8-week course of baclofen (20 mg, 3 times daily) added to omeprazole improved cough in 56% of patients with fewer acid reflux episodes, but there are no controlled studies showing benefit. Alginate therapy in laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) showed significant symptom improvement at all follow-up time points, with laryngeal sign improvement at 6 months after assessments at 2, 4, and 6 months. An empiric course of twice-daily PPI should be considered particularly in patients with more typical symptoms and/or findings of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or in those who have had a prior thorough evaluation and treatment course for causes other than GERD.

Extraesophageal GERD symptoms — key concepts and testing steps highlight limits of diagnostics and preferred sequencing. "Although GERD may be a contributor to extraesophageal symptoms in some patients, careful evaluation for other causes should be considered for patients with laryngeal symptoms, chronic cough, and asthma." "Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of potential extraesophageal symptoms of GERD is limited by lack of a gold-standard test, variable symptoms, and other disorders which may cause similar symptoms." Noninvasive biomarkers lack utility: "salivary pepsin testing is not recommended for evaluation of patients with extraesophageal reflux symptoms." After failed empiric therapy, escalation is specified: "For patients whose extraesophageal symptoms have not responded to a trial of twice-daily PPIs, we recommend upper endoscopy, ideally off PPIs for 2–4 weeks. If endoscopy is normal, consider reflux monitoring." Routine proximal pH testing is discouraged: "For patients with extraesophageal symptoms, we do not routinely recommend oropharyngeal or pharyngeal pH monitoring."

### Extraesophageal presentations of GERD: where is the science? [^3d5f18e1]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article reviews the evaluation and management of patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease, such as asthma, chronic cough, and laryngitis, which are commonly encountered in gastroenterology practices. Otolaryngologists and gastroenterologists commonly disagree upon the underlying cause for complaints in patients with one of the suspected extraesophageal reflux syndromes. The accuracy of diagnostic tests (laryngoscopy, endoscopy, and pH- or pH-impedance monitoring) for patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease is suboptimal. An empiric trial of proton pump inhibitors in patients without alarm features can help some patients, but the response to therapy is variable.

Case Presentation

An 80-year-old man with no history of substance addiction presented with complaints of cough and breathlessness for 4 months. His cough was nonproductive, waxing and waning in nature with high symptom load during daytime, but not associated with chest pain or wheezing. He gives no history of nasal or sinus symptoms, aspiration, or reflux symptoms. Breathlessness was nonparoxysmal, independent of cough and progressing from modified medical research council Grade-I to Grade II. It was not accompanied by wheezing or stridor. He denied specific triggers and seasonal, diurnal, or postural variation of symptoms. His medical history was largely unremarkable, apart from hypertension diagnosed 2 decades earlier. Despite 6 months of treatment with dual antihypertensive medications, his BP remained uncontrolled. He did not receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for the treatment of hypertension as per his old medical records. He denies history of atopy, occupational or environmental dust exposure. He refused history of fever, significant loss of weight or appetite. He had been treated for asthma with a combination of a long-acting beta-2 agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid inhaler, which provided no relief.

### Reflux-cough syndrome: guidelines from the ACCP… [^0182872a]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- If a patient's cough is likely due to GERD, treatment should consistently include lifestyle modifications and medical therapy to control reflux symptoms.
- In the absence of reflux symptoms, proton pump inhibitors should not be used alone for therapy.
- Esophageal manometry and pH-metry are recommended for certain adults with chronic cough if the cough is thought to be reflux related. Recommendations Although a systematic review did not find any high-quality evidence to address the two main clinical questions, the ACCP found sufficient support to outline six core points of guidance. The two most highly rated recommendations are based on low-quality evidence and focus on nonsurgical interventions.

First, if a patient's cough is likely due to GERD, treatment should consistently include promoting weight loss through diet modification in patients who are overweight or obese; counseling on sleeping with their head elevated and on meal avoidance three hours before bedtime; and initiating therapy to control symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation. Second, if a patient has cough but no symptoms of heartburn or regurgitation, proton pump inhibitors alone are not likely to resolve the cough and should not be prescribed without coinciding lifestyle modifications. The potential benefits of each of these approaches were found to clearly outweigh any potential risks. Antireflux surgery should not be advised if a patient with chronic cough has a major motility disorder or if esophageal pH-metry does not show abnormal acid exposure. The risk of surgery is not counterbalanced by any known benefit in either circumstance.

The ACCP advises physicians that antireflux surgery may have a role in treating chronic cough that is suspected of being related to reflux-cough syndrome if peristalsis activity is sufficient, abnormal acid exposure is determined, and when cough is refractory to medical therapy. Based on expert consensus, it is recommended that the evaluation of chronic cough in adults follow a management strategy endorsed in the medical literature. It is important to start from the assumption that cough may be caused by more common etiologies, as well as symptomatic GERD. Guideline source: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence rating system used. Yes.

A 50-year-old male with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease presented with a 3-month history of chronic cough along with intermittent dyspnea and wheezing, which became worse at night, as well as urticaria and pruritus, with no improvement after taking an intranasal corticosteroid, proton pump inhibitor, and oral antihistamine. He did not endorse significant neurologic symptoms. After acute worsening of his cough and dyspnea 1 month after several outpatient clinic and emergency room encounters, he was hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone. However, because of persistent symptoms, he presented to the pulmonary department for further evaluation. His laboratory testing results included elevated absolute eosinophil counts (1000–1700 cells/μL) that persisted for 6 months after hospitalization.

This article discusses the current state of knowledge regarding the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and pulmonary and ear/nose/throat manifestations of reflux and outlines the recent developments in the diagnostic and treatment strategies for this difficult group of patients. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and pH monitoring are poorly sensitive for diagnosing reflux in this group of patients. Instead it is recommended that in those without warning symptoms, an empiric trial of proton-pump inhibitors be the initial approach to diagnosing and treating the potential underlying cause of these extraesophageal symptoms.

### Chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^ead4371d]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To critically review and summarize the literature on cough and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and to make evidence-based recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough due to GERD.

Design/Methodology

Ovid MEDLINE literature review (through March 2004) for all studies published in the English language and selected articles published in other languages such as French since 1963 using the medical subject heading terms "cough", "gastroesophageal reflux", and "gastroesophageal reflux disease".

Results

GERD, singly or in combination with other conditions, is one of the most common causes of chronic cough. In patients with normal chest radiographic findings, GERD most likely causes cough by stimulation of an esophageal-bronchial reflex. When GERD causes cough, there may be no GI symptoms up to 75% of the time. While 24-h esophageal pH monitoring is the most sensitive and specific test in linking GERD and cough in a cause-effect relationship, it has its limitations. In addition, there is no general agreement on how to best interpret the test, and it cannot detect non-acid reflux events. Therefore, when patients fit the clinical profile that has a high likelihood of predicting that GERD is the cause of cough, antireflux medical therapy should be empirically instituted. While some patients improve with minimal medical therapy, others require more intensive regimens. When empiric treatment fails, it cannot be assumed that GERD has been ruled out as a cause of chronic cough. Rather, an objective investigation for GERD is then recommended because the empiric therapy may not have been intensive enough or medical therapy may have failed. Surgery may be efficacious when intensive medical therapy has failed in selected patients who have undergone an extensive objective GERD evaluation.

Conclusions

Accurately diagnosing and successfully treating chronic cough due to GERD can be a major challenge.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^93e8fe2c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

ACG GERD — extraesophageal symptom recommendations include: We recommend evaluation for non-GERD causes in patients with possible extraesophageal manifestations before ascribing symptoms to GERD. We recommend that patients who have extraesophageal manifestations of GERD without typical GERD symptoms (e.g., heartburn and regurgitation) undergo reflux testing for evaluation before PPI therapy. For patients who have both extraesophageal and typical GERD symptoms, we suggest considering a trial of twice-daily PPI therapy for 8–12 wk before additional testing. We suggest that upper endoscopy should not be used as the method to establish a diagnosis of GERD-related asthma, chronic cough, or LPR.

### Management of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease [^2485b2e3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects more than one third of the population. It is generally a chronic condition and has the potential to be serious. Some patients with GERD experience persistent daytime or nighttime heartburn and some sustain severe damage, including ulceration, stricture, and Barrett's esophagus, which can predispose to development of adenocarcinoma. Extraesophageal manifestations of GERD can include otolaryngologic, respiratory, and cardiac problems. Severe GERD responds best to agents that suppress gastric acid secretion. Of these, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) provide the most effective control of gastric acidity and are, therefore, the medical treatment of choice. In fact, nonresponse to a PPI should raise the suspicion that the diagnosis is not GERD. Proton pump inhibitors are quickly becoming the treatment of choice for GERD, especially for severe or refractory cases. For patients whose GERD is refractory even to PPIs or who are unwilling to face years of PPI therapy, antireflux surgery remains an option.

### Esophageal pH monitoring, indications, and methods [^01d55355]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common problem that affects a substantial proportion of the American population. It is estimated that the symptoms of GERD may afflict 40% to 45% of Americans each month. The diagnosis of GERD can be difficult, as its symptoms vary from typical symptoms like heartburn to atypical symptoms such as hoarseness, coughing, and chest pain. Most patients present with typical symptoms and are diagnosed with GERD if they respond to empiric trials of acid suppression. Many tests are available to help with diagnosing GERD in patients who either present with atypical symptoms or who do not respond to acid suppression; however, each test has its own shortcomings. The only test that directly measures whether acid is refluxing into the esophagus is the pH probe, but this test is uncomfortable for the patient, can be difficult to interpret, and may not be necessary in all cases. This article reviews the indications for pH monitoring, its technique, its advantages and limitations, and its role the diagnosis of GERD.

### Chronic cough and OSA: a new association? [^0779c4cd]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is defined as cough lasting more than 2 months. Common causes for chronic cough in nonsmokers with normal chest radiographs and pulmonary functions include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), cough-variant asthma (CVA), and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS). Current guidelines recommend diagnosing the etiology of chronic cough based upon the results of therapy for suspected GERD, CVA, and UACS. Despite following current recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, the cause for a significant proportion of chronic cough remains unexplained. Recent reports indicate the resolution of chronic cough following treatment of concomitantly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Whether this represents a co-occurrence of two commonly prevalent disorders or a pathophysiologic relationship between OSA and cough remains unknown. This review offers insights into a pathophysiologic link between OSA and the commonly purported etiologies for cough, namely, GERD, UACS, and CVA. In addition, evidence for a relationship between airway inflammation that can trigger or perpetuate cough and OSA is discussed. This review explores mechanisms by which nocturnal continuous positive airway therapy resolves cough by improving underlying airway inflammation secondary to OSA and impacts upon GERD, CVA, and UACS.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^36c29bdf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Esophageal impedance monitoring for extraesophageal symptoms — In patients with extraesophageal symptoms refractory to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), studies report that 30%–40% have symptoms associated with nonacid reflux, around 10% have symptoms associated with acid reflux, and 50%–60% cannot be associated with any type of gastroesophageal reflux, and less than 40% of patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestations have an abnormal pH-impedance study. The added value of impedance monitoring is probably higher in patients with unexplained cough, with a cohort of 100 consecutive patients showing reflux characteristics in the 15–30 minutes preceding cough, and with cough detection 56% of patients with unexplained cough had a positive symptom association for reflux and a reflux-cough sequence was demonstrated in approximately 50% of patients.

Chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux (CHEST guideline) — preoperative/diagnostic testing after failed medical therapy or when suspicion is strong: In adult patients with chronic cough potentially due to reflux-cough syndrome who are refractory to a 3-month trial of medical antireflux therapy and are being evaluated for surgical management (antireflux or bariatric), or in whom there is strong clinical suspicion warranting diagnostic testing for gastroesophageal reflux, we suggest that they undergo esophageal manometry and pH-metry with conventional methodology (Grade 2C). Esophageal manometry is done to both evaluate for a major motility disorder and to accurately position the pH electrode for the pH monitoring study, and with conventional methodology, the pH electrode is placed 5 cm proximal to the lower esophageal sphincter, and the study is done off antisecretory medications after withholding PPI therapy for 7 days and H2 receptor antagonists for 3 days prior to the study.

Case presentation

A 46-year-old female patient has been suffering from a chronic dry cough since a Sars-Cov-2 infection in 2020. The cough is characterized by its dry and unremitting nature, predominantly manifesting at night time, worsening while in a supine position, and intensifying following food and fluid intake. The severity of the symptoms reached a point where the patient was compelled to discontinue employment. Following a comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with Cough Hypersensitivity Syndrome. At the time of surgery, the daily long-term medication consisted of 200 mg codeine, 240 mg dexlansoprazole, 20 mg famotidine, 30 mg baclofen, and 1800 mg gabapentin. Multiple therapeutic trials were undertaken, encompassing bronchodilator agents, inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, proton pump inhibitors/antacids, opioids, prokinetics, psychotropic drugs, and antitussive medications, including gefapixant (a specific P2X3 receptor agonist). However, all of these were unsatisfactory to the patient. Notably, she reported that the sole effective therapeutic intervention prior to the surgery involved the inhalation of short-acting local anesthetics (up to 10 times daily with lidocaine 100 mg per application). This was continued perioperatively. Given the patient's resistance to pharmacological treatment and pathological 24-hour pH measurements (DeMeester score 45.2, pathological for GERD over 14.7), the presence of a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter and a significant reduction in quality of life (GERD Health-Related Quality of Life Score 43 out of 75 points), the surgical team opted for a laparoscopic hiatoplasty and an anterior fundoplication.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^897d93e7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Extraesophageal GERD — although GERD may be a contributor to extraesophageal symptoms in some patients, careful evaluation for other causes should be considered for patients with laryngeal symptoms, chronic cough, and asthma. Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of potential extraesophageal symptoms of GERD is limited by lack of a gold-standard test, variable symptoms, and other disorders which may cause similar symptoms. Endoscopy is not sufficient to confirm or refute the presence of extraesophageal GERD. Because of difficulty in distinguishing between patients with laryngeal symptoms and normal controls, salivary pepsin testing is not recommended for evaluation of patients with extraesophageal reflux symptoms. For patients whose extraesophageal symptoms have not responded to a trial of twice-daily PPIs, we recommend upper endoscopy, ideally off PPIs for 2–4 wk; if EGD shows EE, that does not confirm that the extraesophageal symptoms are from GERD, and patients still may need pH-impedance testing. For patients with extraesophageal symptoms, we do not routinely recommend oropharyngeal or pharyngeal pH monitoring.

### Chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux in adults: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^7b7a2748]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and chronic cough in adults — symptom specificity is limited and associations vary across populations. No symptom, including heartburn, is 100% specific for GERD. In a population-based survey of 2,200 residents, frequent heartburn occurred in 18% and, among these, 14% also endorsed "bronchitis." Primary care data showed patients with a new diagnosis of GERD had higher odds of later cough (OR, 1.7; CI, 1.4–2.1) within the next 12 months. A cross-sectional survey of 4,003 residents found 12% reported chronic cough and regurgitation predicted cough (OR, 1.71; 99% CI, 1.20–2.45). Across specialty cough clinics, reflux contributed to 0% to 41% of cases. GERD may be "silent" from a GI perspective in up to 75% of cases, and during reflux monitoring approximately half of unselected chronic cough patients show a positive association between cough and acid or weakly acidic reflux events. Compounding the problem, the efficacy of PPI therapy for resolving GERD symptoms is substantially less than it is for healing esophagitis, and much less for atypical symptoms than it is for heartburn; moreover, a recent Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to conclude that PPI treatment is beneficial in treating nonspecific chronic cough.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^11cd368d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

GERD-related cough

Beside asthma and postnasal drip, GERD has been confirmed to be one of the main three causes of chronic cough, accounting around 20% of cases. Chronic cough is defined as cough that persists for longer than 8 weeks. GERD should be investigated in patients who are not taking any cough-inducing medications, who are non-smokers or exposed to other environmental irritants and who have normal x-ray and no evidence of asthma or postnasal drip. The American College of Chest Physicians suggest that GERD-related cough typically occurs during daytime, in the upright position and is non-productive.

Irritation of the upper respiratory tract with or without microaspiration is reported as a possible mechanism, but this hypothesis remains controversial. Microaspiration may occur due to impairment of the protective reflexes or due to excessive challenges of pharyngeal reflexes. Several studies have reported ineffective esophageal peristalsis in patients with chronic cough with or without acid reflux, suggesting that poor esophageal clearance might be related to cough episodes. On the other hand, infusion of acid into the distal esophagus increases the frequency of coughing and cough reflex sensitivity. In a recent study, it was found that the proximal extent of reflux events is not important for provocation of cough. Both central and local reflexes are considered to induce cough. In addition, cough itself may promote reflux events. An increase in intra-abdominal pressure during cough episodes may provoke reflux events by overcoming lower esophageal sphincter basal pressure.

### An association between unrecognized gastroesophageal reflux disease and excessive daytime sleepiness in Taiwanese subjects suspected to have liver disease: a pilot study [^5df1bc15]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder affecting approximately 10–38% of the adult population in Western countries and an estimated 17% of adults living in Xi'an, Shaanxi province in China. Consequences of GERD include, but are not limited to, Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. In addition, GERD is associated with upper respiratory disease, adversely affects quality of life (QOL), and represents a significant economic consideration in terms of treatment costs.

Sleepiness, or somnolence, is a complex state influenced by factors such as quantity and quality of prior sleep, circadian time, medications, and environmental stimuli as well as by medical, neurological, emotional, and psychiatric conditions. When sleep is not desired, somnolence is unwanted. Continuous inadequate sleep negatively impacts cognitive function, physical performance, overall well-being, and QOL. The pathologic or inappropriate occurrence of somnolence is clinically referred to as excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).

Sleep contributes to a reduction in normal anti-reflux mechanisms; rates of swallowing and salivation are decreased, pressure from the upper and lower esophageal sphincters is decreased, gastric emptying is delayed, and the "heartburn-signal" is depressed. The supine position of most sleepers is thought to facilitate gastroesophageal reflux, a major cause of disrupted sleep due to awakenings from heartburn, dyspepsia, acid brash, coughing, or choking. Not unexpectedly, more than half of patients with chronic GERD report nocturnal symptoms. The consequences of nocturnal GERD are thought to exceed those of daytime GERD in terms of increased risk of esophageal lesions and respiratory complications, poor QOL, inadequate sleep, EDS, poor work productivity, and increased costs. Like daytime GERD, nocturnal GERD can be managed with surgical therapies or proton pump inhibitors such that heartburn and regurgitation are reduced concurrently with an improvement in sleep.

### Reflux monitoring in lung disease: is there a better metric than esophageal acid exposure time? [^90e28035]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Ambulatory reflux monitoring can be performed with either a telemetry capsule to monitor for esophageal acid exposure alone for a period of 48–96 hours, and a 24 hour catheter based impedance/pH study which is most valuable for evaluating patients with objective evidence of GERD who are incompletely relieved with proton pump inhibitors. Some would consider catheter-based impedance/pH as the "best" test to evaluate patients with extraesophageal symptoms including suspected pulmonary complications of GERD. This editorial provides comment on the use of novel advanced metrics, mean nocturnal baseline impedance and post-reflux induced-swallow peristaltic wave index in analysis of these studies.

### Is empiric proton pump inhibition in patients with symptoms of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux justified? [^05b1b756]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of suspected EE manifestations of GERD including LPR is hampered by uncertainties regarding diagnosis, causality, and treatment efficacy. The benefits of a PPI trial lasting three to six months before 24-hour pH and impedance monitoring seem very low. Although this practice is suggested by society guidelines and considered cost effective in many countries it will lead to long-term PPI use in a high number of patients without any benefit and increased risk of side effects. Diagnostic testing with pH and impedance monitoring rather than empiric PPI treatment should be chosen in a higher proportion of patients presenting with symptoms possibly attributable to EE reflux.

### Clinical history in gastroesophageal cough [^4c20ade9]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal disease, a common cause of chronic cough, is often poorly recognised. We reviewed the presenting history of 47 chronic cough patients who had been proven to have gastroesophageal disease by oesophageal function testing. Fourty-seven patients (26 female), were enroled. Symptoms which were most common included: cough on phonation, on rising from bed, associated with certain foods or with eating in general. Symptoms known to be associated with laryngopharyngeal reflux, such as throat clearing, dysphonia, globus and dysphagia were also associated. Heartburn or indigestion was present in 63% of those questioned. These data show that symptoms associated with reflux in chronic coughers differ from those commonly perceived to be characteristic of classical heartburn-associated reflux. These data suggest that, contrary to previous reports, a symptom complex which is characteristic of reflux cough can be identified.

### How to diagnose GERC more effectively: reflections on post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index and mean nocturnal baseline impedance [^2a251b3c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study reveals that patients in the GERC group exhibit significantly lower levels of PSPWI, MNBI, and distal MNBI compared to non-GERC patients. AET demonstrated a higher diagnostic value for GERC, and PSPWI also had a certain diagnostic value similar to AET, notably superior to SI, SAP, MNBI, and distal MNBI. MNBI and distal MNBI had limited diagnostic efficacy for GERC and showed no statistically significant difference compared to SI and SAP. The combination of PSPWI and AET provided a higher diagnostic value for GERC, surpassing the diagnostic performance of AET alone, effectively reducing misdiagnosis. This may be potentially associated with improving recognition of the non-acid GERC.

GERD encompasses symptoms both within and outside the esophagus, while GERC represents the specific extraintestinal manifestations of GERD. Two different mechanisms may underlie the relationship between reflux and cough: the reflux pathway leading to micro-aspiration and the reflex pathway triggering vagally mediated airway reactions. When GERD induces cough, approximately 75% of patients may lack obvious gastrointestinal symptoms, making it challenging to preliminarily distinguish GERC based on clinical manifestations alone. MII-pH monitoring is the most sensitive and specific auxiliary examination for diagnosing GERC. By monitoring parameters such as AET, SI, and SAP, the severity of reflux is evaluated alongside its correlation with coughing. AET is a parameter associated with the severity of acid exposure in subjects and has demonstrated reliable diagnostic value in previous studies focusing on acid reflux. However, over the past decade, the significance of non-acid reflux in gastroesophageal reflux has gradually gained attention. Particularly, among patients receiving acid-suppressive therapy, the occurrence rate of non-acid reflux can reach up to 80%, leading to persistent cough symptoms that hinder recovery. This highlights the limitations of AET. SI and SAP serve as supplementary parameters for establishing the relationship between reflux and cough, aiding in the diagnosis of GERC. However, their acquisition relies on patients documenting the timing of cough events in a diary card, which greatly influences their accuracy. Research conducted by Kavitt et al. indicated that within a 2-minute time window, 74–91% of cough events were missed. Slaughter suggested that SI and SAP are unreliable when the reflux rate is low, as their positive results are susceptible to chance and exhibit high daily variability. Consequently, their actual clinical significance is often overinterpreted. Therefore, the existing parameters such as AET, SI, and SAP are insufficient to meet the clinical diagnostic needs of GERC, necessitating further optimization through the incorporation of new reliable parameters.

### Laryngospasm: an atypical manifestation of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^cd450e02]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To present a potentially life-threatening manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), laryngospasm. This review covers the diagnosis and management of eight patients treated by the authors.

Study Design

A retrospective analysis of 8 consecutive patients who were referred for the evaluation of unexplained laryngospasm. The medical therapy and lifestyle modifications of treatment are discussed.

Methods

The patient records were reviewed and tabulated for age, onset of symptoms, and history of GERD; the presence of an associated upper respiratory infection with persistent cough; and the development of syncope in the presence of laryngospasm.

Results

All 8 patients had initial control of laryngospasm. Three had complete control without relapse, 3 had initial control with rare relapse of mild laryngospasm, and 2 patients had initial control with frequent relapses. Six of the 8 had syncopal episodes as a consequence of the laryngospasm. All patients were initially treated with a proton pump inhibitor. Five of the 8 required the addition of an esophageal prokinetic agent to control the reflux and subsequent laryngospasm. Two patients are off all medications at the time of this writing and 4 of the 8 have had rare relapses after initial control of symptoms. Once control of the laryngospasm had been achieved, there were no subsequent episodes of syncope.

Conclusions

Based on the data collected in these 8 individuals, patients with reflux disease (known or unknown) can develop severe laryngospasm and possible syncope. The key factor seems to be the association of a recent or concurrent upper respiratory infection that results in a protracted cough that is more severe when supine and at times violent. The cough increases the amount of the refluxate, which is the noxious insult to the larynx.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease: expert review [^724c7903]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Ambulatory reflux testing modalities — distal pH, wireless pH, and pH‑impedance for extraesophageal symptoms: Traditional pH-metry quantifies esophageal acid exposure time and reflux events at the distal sensor relative to an intraluminal pH < 4, but distal esophageal pH monitoring has not consistently predicted response of EER manifestations to reflux treatments. Wireless pH monitoring offers a longer period (up to 96 hours) than catheter-based 24-hour pH-only monitoring, allowing assessment of day-to-day variability and potentially increasing diagnostic yield, with the extended period providing a high negative predictive value for GERD if acid reflux parameters are normal, and greater patient tolerance enabling monitoring without substantially altering daily life. pH-impedance catheters incorporate multiple impedance channels and characterize reflux by direction and composition, including acidic (pH < 4), weakly acidic (pH 4–7), and weakly alkaline (pH > 7), and detection of non-acid reflux and symptom correlation in extraesophageal symptoms — particularly chronic cough — represents an advantage for pH-impedance testing. Dual-sensor catheter-based monitoring can assess proximal reflux, but use is limited by a lack of well-established thresholds to define clinically relevant, pathologic proximal reflux.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^22508279]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Troublesome typical symptoms alone may be enough for antisecretory medication trials, but up-front oesophageal testing is suggested for all other symptom categories and in proton pump inhibitor (PPI) non-responders, prior to invasive GERD management or prior to long-term medical management.

Actionable GERD constitutes settings where management requires long-term acid suppression, an escalation of medical management, or consideration of interventional (ie, not easily reversible) management options for GERD such as laparoscopic fundoplication, magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA), endoscopic GERD therapies or bariatric surgery, where high confidence in GERD diagnosis is essential.

The Montreal consensus defines GERD as the reflux of stomach contents into the oesophagus causing troublesome symptoms and/or complications. However, not all 'troublesome' symptoms can be directly linked to reflux of gastric content, and symptoms alone are insufficient for a conclusive diagnosis. Nevertheless, pragmatic continuation of empiric antisecretory therapy is considered appropriate when typical symptoms (heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation) improve with GERD treatment trials(figure 1), although response could also be due to placebo effect. In parallel, assumptions of GERD relationships with cough, hoarseness and other 'isolated' extraoesophageal symptoms (ie, in the absence of typical GERD symptoms) overestimated atypical GERD diagnoses leading to inappropriate use of antisecretory drugs, high economic burden and waste of limited testing resources(figure 1). Use of Lyon consensus criteria is anticipated to improve diagnostic specificity and confidence. While objective testing prior to long-term medical management of typical symptoms is optimal, practicality and cost-effectiveness need further study.

Figure 1
Troublesome typical and atypical symptoms suspicious for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and usual approach to evaluation of these symptoms. An empiric trial of antisecretory therapy is appropriate for typical symptoms in the absence of alarm symptoms. Prolonged wireless pH monitoring is most appropriate for quantification of reflux burden with typical symptoms, although pH-impedance or even pH only monitoring may be options depending on availability and expertise. Belching, cough and asthma may have a potential association with reflux episodes. Supragastric belching and rumination need to be identified, preferably using high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) and managed with behavioural therapy. Up-front testing is performed primarily to rule out a reflux basis for symptoms for all other atypical symptoms. Pulmonary evaluation and laryngoscopy serve to rule out primary non-GERD disorders, and may precede oesophageal physiological testing.

### Cough and gastroesophageal reflux: identifying cough and assessing the efficacy of cough-modifying agents [^a4f4a362]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

From a symptom research standpoint, much has been learned about the management of cough in general and cough caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease in particular. Yet, before further advances can be made in our understanding of how to best manage patients with this common symptom, methodologic challenges remain to be solved. One of the most basic is the development of valid and reliable methods by which to identify cough, assess its impact on patients, and assess the efficacy of cough therapies. Herein, we review the characteristics of cough that relate to its assessment and how the effect of drug treatment on cough has been assessed. Perspective is provided on evaluating the efficacy of cough-modifying agents and the optimal method for identifying a cough and linking it with a reflux event. Investigators should use both subjective and objective methods, because they have the potential to measure different aspects of cough. Subjective measures, such as a cough-specific quality-of-life instruments, are likely to best reflect the severity of cough from the patient's standpoint, because a subjective response most likely integrates both cough frequency and intensity. The ideal objective method should allow cough to be automatically counted over 24 hours in an ambulatory setting. Although it is theoretically possible to design and construct such a device that is also relatively unobtrusive, reliable, and accurate, one is not yet available.

### Chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux in children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^f0b64cb6]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Qualitative data from systematic reviews and guidelines report the following. For children aged " ≤ 14-years" with chronic cough, "we recommend basing the management or testing algorithm on cough characteristics and the associated clinical history. No specific recommendation for children with cough and GERD but it is implied that GERD on its own should be treated." One review stated "Anti-GER medications should not be routinely used for treatment of poorly controlled asthma, chronic cough and laryngitis" and added, "If these medications are used, and there is no response, rather than escalating therapy uncritically, a second specialist opinion is recommended." A systematic review that included "23 RCTs" noted, "Ten studies failed to demonstrate significant benefits of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 receptor antagonists" for infant manifestations attributed to reflux and concluded they "may be used to treat children with gastroesophageal reflux disease, but not to treat asthma or unspecific symptoms."

### Persistent cough: prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux and study of relevant laryngeal signs [^e4816893]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Cough is one of the atypical manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of GERD among patients presenting with persistent cough. The study included 80 patients over a period of 3 years. The inclusion criteria were nonsmoker adults with normal chest radiograph whose chief complaint was cough for at least 4 weeks duration. All patients included were subjected to nasal endoscopy, laryngoscopy, and 24-hour pH monitoring. Reflux was recorded in the different positions. Laryngeal signs of reflux were traced for and their significance was calculated. Patients who proved to have GERD received antireflux treatment with a follow-up of 3 months. The response to antireflux treatment was assessed according to subjective and objective improvement. Relapse in the follow-up period occurred in 9% of patients. It is concluded that laryngeal signs of GERD should be well known to diagnose and properly manage persistent cough.

### Laryngopharyngeal manifestations of reflux: diagnosis and therapy [^a632daa9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Acid reflux — most often associated with heartburn — may also cause a wide range of laryngopharyngeal symptoms, including laryngitis and chronic cough. Symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), like those of gastrooesophageal reflux disease, result from abnormal exposure of tissues to acid refluxate. Deranged sensorimotor function of the upper oesophageal sphincter appears to play a key role in the aetiology of LPR, but the disease is not completely understood. Among the significant long-term complications of LPR are bronchopulmonary disorders, recurrent pneumonia, chronic cough, chronic or recurrent laryngitis, and oral cavity disorders. It also appears to be a risk factor for the development of laryngeal carcinoma. Diagnosis of LPR is based on physical examination, medical history, and results of specific tests. At present, the test of choice for LPR diagnosis is intraluminal oesophageal pH monitoring. Barium contrast oesophagography, intraoesophageal acid perfusion challenge, and flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing may also be used in LPR diagnosis. Treatment for LPR includes changes to the diet and lifestyle, and acid-suppressing therapy. The Therapeutic Working Party at the First Multi-Disciplinary International Symposium on Supraesophageal Complications of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease has recommended twice-daily dosing with a proton pump inhibitor as an initial therapy for LPR, with treatment continued between 4 weeks and 6 months. Such treatment has been found highly effective in resolving symptoms of LPR, and it may also prevent the serious long-term complications of this condition.

### Extraesophageal symptoms: what role for the proton pump inhibitors? [^9df1e76e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The esophageal complications of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are well described and include erosive esophagitis, stricture, Barrett esophagus, and adenocarcinoma. Primary care physicians often encounter patients with "extraesophageal" manifestations of GERD in the absence of heartburn. Patients may present with symptoms involving the pulmonary system, noncardiac chest pain, and ear, nose, and throat disorders. The diagnosis of reflux disease in these individuals may be challenging because, in addition to the absence of heartburn, endoscopy is often negative. Laryngoscopy and 24-hour dual-channel intraesophageal pH-metry may have greater diagnostic yields, but they are costly, invasive, and time-consuming. A trial of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is increasingly being considered a first-line diagnostic test in those with suspected reflux-related extraesophageal symptoms. The duration as well as dose of PPI should be based on the presenting symptoms, with patients having pulmonary manifestations often requiring twice-daily therapy for 2 to 3 months. In contrast, symptoms of reflux-related noncardiac chest pain may be relieved with a 1-week, standard-dose treatment trial. Patients who fail to experience symptom resolution or improvement should undergo further diagnostic evaluations including 24-hour esophageal pH studies while continuing their PPI therapy to establish persistent versus absent acid reflux. The role of fundoplication or other surgical/laparoscopic procedures in these patients has yet to be determined.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease [^26f64237]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition that occurs when reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus causes symptoms and/or complications. The prevalence of GERD in Western societies has been estimated at 30%, making it one of the most commonly encountered disorders in primary care. The spectrum of GERD includes typical symptoms of esophageal reflux (heartburn and/or regurgitation); esophageal injury (erosive esophagitis; stricture; Barrett esophagus; and, rarely, adenocarcinoma); and extraesophageal symptoms, such as hoarseness and chronic cough. Proper diagnosis and treatment of GERD includes symptom control, exclusion of other disorders, avoiding overuse of medications and invasive testing, and minimizing complications.

### Omeprazole-induced intractable cough [^2e22e904]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of chronic, persistent cough induced by omeprazole therapy.

Case Summary

A 42-year-old white woman presented with chronic, persistent cough after omeprazole initiation for treatment of postoperative heartburn. The cough was permanent, dry, and exhausting and worsened at night. Omeprazole therapy was continued for 4 months because the persistent cough was thought to be related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, no cause of persistent, chronic cough was identified. After omeprazole discontinuation, the cough resolved.

Discussion

The most common causes of chronic cough in nonsmokers of all ages are postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, and GERD. However, persistent cough without bronchospasm or other pulmonary involvement may occur as a drug adverse effect. According to the US omeprazole package insert, cough is observed as an adverse reaction in 1.1% of patients, although this has not been mentioned in international drug information sources or medical literature. A MEDLINE search (1966-June 2003) using the terms cough, drug related, adverse effects, and omeprazole failed to find any data. In our patient, there was a temporal relationship between cough and medication use, suggesting a causal relationship. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug reaction was probable. The mechanism is unclear.

Conclusions

Chronic, persistent cough may occur as an adverse effect of omeprazole therapy. Clinicians must be aware of this adverse effect to avoid useless and costly tests.

### Chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux in children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^0786fb89]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Key question 1 guideline comparisons — Across included guidelines addressing chronic cough without clear gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) features, recommendations consistently advise against empiric GERD therapy or investigation: CHEST guidelines state that an empirical approach aimed at treating upper airway cough syndrome due to a rhinosinus condition, GERD and/or asthma should not be used unless other features consistent with these conditions are present (Strong recommendation); de Benedictis and Bush state that empirical GER therapy is unlikely to be beneficial and is generally not recommended; NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN guideline states the working group suggests not to use H2 receptor antagonists or PPIs in patients with extraesophageal symptoms (ie, cough, wheezing, asthma), except in the presence of typical GERD symptoms and/or diagnostic testing suggestive of GERD (Weak recommendation); and the NICE guideline advises Do not routinely investigate or treat for GER if an infant or child without overt regurgitation presents with chronic cough.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^10afa281]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Cough initiated from the esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — evidence is mixed: animal studies and some human studies do not show cough evoked by esophageal distension or luminal acid/capsaicin, yet other human reports do; chronic cough is clearly associated with GERD and reduction of coughing with effective anti-reflux therapy in at least a subset of patients supports reflux as a driver of cough. Studies using cough monitoring with impedance measurements implicate reflux, with one explanation being aspiration that directly activates airway vagal afferents; however, pH/impedance monitoring provides little evidence that refluxate must reach the proximal esophagus or airways to initiate coughing, and available evidence suggests locally or centrally mediated airway reflexes can be initiated directly from the stomach or esophagus, with neuronal projections capable of producing airway mucus secretion or bronchoconstriction that could promote cough.

### Achalasia-associated megaoesophagus presenting with dyspnoea and cough [^a6469f26]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We present an unusual case of achalasia presenting with dyspnoea and persistent cough. These symptoms persisted for months, leading to the patient undergoing a chest X-ray by her general practitioner which showed right basal consolidation and a density extending along the right mediastinum. CT scan was done which revealed megaoesophagus with a diameter of 7cm causing tracheal compression, as well as right basal consolidation, consistent with aspiration. Further history revealed 6-month history of progressive swallowing difficulty, retrosternal chest pain and shortness of breath which worsened when eating solid foods. After thorough workup, a diagnosis of idiopathic achalasia (type II) was made. She was treated with laparoscopic Heller cardiomyotomy and Dor fundoplication with significant improvement at follow-up. Dyspnoea and respiratory symptoms are unusual presenting symptoms, suggesting a need to consider achalasia in a wider range of presentations. Successful treatment of achalasia depends on timely diagnosis and intervention prior to oesophageal failure.

### Extraesophageal manifestations of reflux disease: myths and reality [^a9d7c445]. Chest Surgery Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Because of the anatomic proximity of the esophagus and the upper respiratory tract, it is not surprising that, in some patients with GERD, symptoms attributable to the respiratory and upper aerodigestive tract may occur. The prevalence of respiratory or other extraesophageal manifestations of GERD remains unknown, however, primarily because in any given patient it is often difficult to determine whether GERD is causing the extraesophageal condition or whether the two conditions are coexisting independently. Acid can reflux into the hypopharynx or trachea in some patients with GERD, thereby causing a variety of respiratory tract symptoms. Additionally, vagovagal reflexes triggered by acid that comes in contact with the esophageal or tracheal mucosa may contribute to the pathogenesis of GERD-related respiratory symptoms, particularly wheezing and coughing. The clinician should be particularly suspicious of underlying GERD in patients with unexplained dental caries, posterior laryngitis, chronic unexplained cough, and intrinsic asthma that does not respond to (or worsens with) bronchodilator therapy. Intensive medical antireflux therapy should be instituted in patients with a suspected extraesophageal manifestation of GERD. Failure to respond to this should not lead automatically to antireflux surgery; the clinician should use 24-hour pH monitoring to document the relationship between GERD and extraesophageal complications and to demonstrate that intensive medical therapy has indeed failed to eliminate acid reflux.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease as a cause of cough… [^3ec0941b]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Cough is the most common symptom for which patients consult physicians. Although cough has many potential causes, a review by Ing and Ngu stresses the increasing recognition of gastroesophageal reflux disease as an etiology of persistent cough. In nonsmoking adults who have normal chest radiographs and are not taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, up to 21 percent of cases of chronic cough may be attributable to GERD. Other potential causes of chronic cough in such patients include postnasal drip and bronchial asthma. The mechanism of cough production in GERD remains unclear. Suggested mechanisms include macro and micro aspiration, exaggerated bronchial responsiveness to mechanical or chemical stimulation, and vagal action through esophageal-tracheobronchial reflexes. Cough may be the only presenting symptom of GERD. In one study, cough without heartburn or other typical symptoms of GERD was the presenting symptom in 16 percent of GERD cases.

A systematic diagnostic approach based on clinical history, physical examination and chest radiography, followed by other tests as indicated, is illustrated in. the accompanying figure on page 638. If the origin of cough remains unexplained after testing for postnasal drip, asthma and other common respiratory causes, GERD is the likely cause, but no mucosal damage may be apparent on endoscopy. The optimal investigation technique is 24-hour ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The authors conclude that if the diagnosis is confirmed or if ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring is unavailable, treatment should be initiated with a histamine H. 2-receptor antagonist.

When used in conjunction with lifestyle modifications, these agents are associated with success rates of 80 percent or more for treatment of chronic cough attributable to GERD. The likelihood of good response to therapy does not appear to be related to the severity of symptoms or endoscopic findings. Although proton-pump inhibitors have anecdotally shown even more success in relieving chronic cough related to GERD, this finding has yet to be confirmed by randomized, controlled trials. Antireflux surgery, such as laparoscopic fundoplication, may be necessary in up to 4 percent of patients.

### Laryngopharyngeal reflux in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-a multi-centre study [^2de181da]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease and one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The clinical severity of COPD is determined by comorbidities, one of which is the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a common cause of chronic cough and a potential risk factor for exacerbations of COPD. Frequent exacerbators have a high prevalence of GERD, however approximately 58% of these patients lack typical GERD symptoms.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) represents an extra-esophageal manifestation of GERD. The reflux of gastric contents is fundamental in both LPR and GERD, but the mechanism and the symptoms of the disorders are distinct. LPR occurs when gastric contents pass the upper esophageal sphincter and usually occurs during daytime in the upright position, while GERD occurs when gastric contents pass the lower esophageal sphincter and takes place more often in the supine position at night-time or during sleep. LPR may be a contributing factor in patients with symptomatic COPD however, there are only a few studies analyzing the impact of LPR in patients with COPD. In a large longitudinal study of COPD patients, self-reported GERD or use of PPIs was associated with a 20–60% increased risk of moderate-severe exacerbations and hospitalized exacerbations during 3 years of follow up. Yet, this study was based on a subjective, self-reported history of a physician's diagnosis of GERD and studies based on objective evaluations by laryngeal-pharyngeal pH monitoring in a large COPD cohort are still missing. Here, we investigated the prevalence of LPR and explored its association with clinically relevant outcomes of COPD.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^c2e7de01]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Esophageal stimuli and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — studies in patients with GERD provide evidence that airway reflex may also sensitize the cough reflex; acid challenges to the esophagus markedly reduce the concentration of inhaled capsaicin required to evoke cough or directly result in coughing. The sensitizing effect of the esophageal challenge could be prevented by inhalation of atropine, suggesting a CNS-dependent reflex from the esophagus that resulted in bronchospasm and/or mucous secretion initiating coughing. Medical treatment of GERD has been reported to greatly reduce sensitivity to tussive stimuli, and this sensitizing effect of refluxate or experimental acid challenges likely depends on CNS integration and sensitization of parallel vagal sensory inputs controlling cough.

How to make the diagnosis of asthma in other contexts — Patients presenting with persistent cough as the only respiratory symptom may have cough‑variant or cough predominant asthma, but common causes of an isolated non‑productive cough also include chronic upper airway cough syndrome (often called 'postnasal drip'), cough induced by angiotensin‑converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, gastroesophageal reflux, chronic sinusitis, post‑infectious cough, inducible laryngeal obstruction, and eosinophilic bronchitis. In cough variant asthma, a persistent cough is the only symptom, or, in cough predominant asthma, the most prominent symptom, and the cough may be worse at night or with exercise, and in some patients it is productive. Spirometry is usually normal, and the only abnormality in lung function may be airway hyperresponsiveness.

### Controversies in the evaluation and management of chronic cough [^0550d12e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough that cannot be explained after basic evaluation is a common reason for patients to be referred to respiratory outpatient clinics. Asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and upper airway disorders frequently coexist with chronic cough. There is some controversy as to whether these conditions are causes or aggravants of cough. Heightened cough reflex sensitivity is an important feature in most patients. There is good evidence that it is reversible when associated with upper respiratory tract infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medications, and chronic cough associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation. In many patients, heightened cough reflex sensitivity is persistent and their cough is unexplained. There are few therapeutic options for patients with unexplained chronic cough. There is a pressing need to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of unexplained chronic cough and to develop novel antitussive drugs that down-regulate cough reflex sensitivity.

Another cohort showed successful response to treatment in 35 of 43 patients (82%) with etiologies of 10 cough variant asthma (23%), 9 PND (21%), and 8 GERD (19%); typical reflux symptoms were absent in 46% of GERD cough responders and negative pH-metry results had 100% negative predictive value and 68% positive predictive value. Another series reported cough explained in 95.4% of cases with GERD in 7.7%. In a separate series, asthma, PNDS, and GERD, alone or in combination, were responsible for 93.6% of cases, and pH-metry had 84% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value for GERD etiology. Among surgical cases, all significantly improved with surgery gauged by VAS of cough severity and the Adverse Cough Outcome survey, and GERD cannot be excluded as the cause of CC on the basis of failed medical therapy.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^388beef5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Extraesophageal symptoms attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) provides the following diagnostic guidance: Best Practice Advice 1: The role of a gastroenterologist in patients referred for evaluation of suspected extra esophageal symptom is to assess for gastroesophageal etiologies that could contribute to the presenting symptoms. Best Practice Advice 2: Non-GI evaluations by ENT, pulmonary and/or allergy are essential and often should be performed initially in most patients as the cause of the symptoms are more likely explained by these other entities than reflux. Best Practice Advice 3: Empiric therapy with aggressive acid suppression for 6–8 weeks with special focus on response of the extraesophageal symptoms can help in assessing association between reflux and extraesophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 4: No single testing methodology exists to definitively identify reflux as the etiology for the suspected extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 5: Constellation of patient presentation, diagnostic test results and response to therapy should be employed in the determination of reflux as a possible etiology in extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 6: Testing may need to be off or on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy depending on patients' presenting demographics and symptoms in assessing the likelihood of abnormal gastroesophageal reflux. A. On therapy testing may be considered in those with high probability of baseline reflux. B. Off therapy testing may be considered in those with low probability of baseline reflux with the goal of identifying moderate to severe reflux at baseline.

### The impact of nocturnal symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease on health-related quality of life… [^2c2d7b57]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Subjects with nocturnal GERD demonstrated considerable impairment compared with the US general population and chronic disease populations. Subjects with nocturnal GERD had significantly more pain than those with hypertension and diabetes and similar pain compared with those with angina and congestive heart failure. Conclusions Nocturnal symptoms are commonly experienced by individuals who report frequent GERD symptoms. In addition, HRQL is significantly impaired in those persons who report frequent GERD symptoms, and HRQL impairment is exacerbated in those who report nocturnal GERD symptoms. Using this technology, researchers have identified 2 types of reflux episodes, upright or daytime GERD and supine or nocturnal GERD. 5 Nocturnal reflux episodes occur less frequently, but acid clearance is more prolonged. 6 Patients with GERD and esophagitis have even more frequent nocturnal episodes than those.

A recent population-based study has provided evidence that the presence of heartburn and other upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms is associated with decrements in HRQL. 14 Subjects reporting severe and/or frequent upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms demonstrated a poorer HRQL as measured by the Psychological General Well-Being Scale compared with subjects with no symptoms.
15. Respondents were asked if they had any of the 4 symptoms in the last 3 months: heartburn or burning sensation in the chest; burning sensation or burning pain in the throat; fluid or food come back into the throat or mouth; and an acid, bitter, or sour taste in the mouth. Respondents were asked if they had any of these symptoms in the last 3 months: awakened at night by GERD symptoms, awakened at night by coughing or choking because of fluid, an acid or bitter taste or food in the throat, having GERD symptoms when lying down to sleep at night, and waking up in the morning with GERD symptoms.

In contrast, GERD subjects with nocturnal symptoms had significantly more impaired HRQL compared with the US general population. Nocturnal GERD subjects were significantly more impaired on all domains of the SF-36 with the exception of role limitations–emotional. The greatest differences between nocturnal GERD subjects and the general population were in physical functioning, role limitations–physical, pain, general health perceptions, and vitality. Nocturnal GERD subjects also showed significant impairment on the physical component summary score.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^2d62fc06]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle modification for extraesophageal reflux — targeted nonpharmacologic measures are limited but include that "a prudent recommendation is to use head-of-bed elevation only in patients who have concomitant regurgitation or nocturnal heartburn," and "Avoiding trigger foods may be recommended only if patients report symptom relief." The page notes that lifestyle measures are of limited benefit overall, yet "especially in those with nocturnal heartburn and regurgitation who are overweight or obese, implementation of a weight loss program is effective in treating esophageal acid exposure," while "the role of weight loss in improving or alleviating specifically extraesophageal symptoms awaits future evidence."

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease: symptoms versus pH monitoring results [^da322e12]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The reason why some patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have symptoms of upper aerodigestive system irritation, while others mainly have gastroenterologic symptoms, is not well established. This retrospective case series study was designed to examine the existence of a correlation between symptoms and reflux characteristics, based on data obtained from esophageal pH monitoring.

Methods

The study population consisted of 139 patients; 97 patients presented with laryngopharyngeal symptoms of GERD, including unexplained hoarseness, throat clearing, chronic cough, laryngospasm, globus, throat pain, and 42 patients presented with gastroenterologic symptoms, including heartburn and regurgitation. The results of 24-hour, double-channel ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring were analyzed comparing 2 symptom groups. The incidence of abnormal acid reflux at the upper and lower esophageal segments and the effects of upright and supine positions on reflux parameters were evaluated.

Results

The incidence of laryngopharyngeal reflux was significantly higher in the laryngopharyngeal symptom group than in the other (52% versus 38%). The patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux from both groups showed no significant differences in terms of number of acid reflux episodes, percentage of times pH was 4, and esophageal acid clearance. Upright and supine parameters did not show significant differences between the patient groups. Upright acid reflux episodes were, however, common in both groups at the lower esophageal and laryngopharyngeal segments.

Conclusion

Recent studies suggesting that otolaryngologic patients commonly show upright, daytime reflux with normal esophageal clearance and that typical GERD patients commonly have supine, nocturnal reflux with prolonged esophageal clearance are not supported by this study. This study indicates that acid reflux parameters and positional changes are not sufficient to explain why patients with GERD experience different symptoms. The regional symptoms of GERD may be attributed to the impairment of epithelial resistance, motor activity, and buffering systems for the esophageal antireflux barrier.
