## Question

If I have someone that is acidotic or history of and has liver cirrhosis, should they be on sodium bicarb or sodium chloride?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing acidosis in a patient with liver cirrhosis, especially clarifying when, if ever, to use sodium bicarbonate versus sodium chloride and what safer alternatives and thresholds should guide care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about correctly characterizing the acid–base disorder and its severity. Then, I should verify cirrhosis-specific factors that alter fluid and sodium handling. Next, I will examine the risks and limited indications for sodium bicarbonate and for normal saline. After that, I should review guideline-supported alternatives such as albumin and when balanced crystalloids can be used with caution. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and preventive strategy, double-checking that each step aligns with high-quality guidance and the patient's pathophysiology.

> Let me first confirm the acid–base diagnosis and its urgency. Cirrhosis most commonly presents with respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation with metabolic compensation, so true metabolic acidosis in a cirrhotic patient should make me think infection, hypoperfusion with lactic acidosis, renal failure, gastrointestinal losses, or drug-induced etiologies rather than primary hepatic acid–base regulation per se, which is limited [^114uX2Qa] [^115E5aZE]. I should calculate the anion gap, check lactate, assess for a mixed disorder using expected compensation, and gauge severity by arterial or venous pH; as a rule of thumb, pH less than about 7.20 often necessitates temporizing therapy while the cause is corrected, but I should double-check for confounders such as hypoalbuminemia and dilutional effects common in cirrhosis when interpreting base excess and the anion gap [^113XiPyq] [^115E5aZE].

> Next, I should review cirrhosis-specific context that changes the risk calculus of any fluid or buffer I give. Most decompensated patients are hypervolemic with third-spacing and ascites, hyponatremia is common, renal perfusion is precarious with risk of hepatorenal syndrome, and encephalopathy risk rises with either hypoperfusion from untreated shock or iatrogenic alkalemia; therefore, any therapy that adds sodium or chloride must be scrutinized for its propensity to worsen edema, ascites, and renal vasoconstriction, and diuretics must be actively managed or held in severe hyponatremia or AKI while sodium correction is kept slow to avoid osmotic demyelination [^111UMUD2] [^1164gdyE] [^113o4iib] [^111Ut9Le].

> I will now examine sodium bicarbonate. The theoretical benefit is raising serum bicarbonate and pH, but I need to ensure I am not just masking lactic acidosis or other high–anion gap processes without fixing perfusion; the sodium load and volume expansion can worsen ascites, edema, and portal hypertension in cirrhosis and may induce paradoxical effects without mortality benefit in lactic acidosis, so I should reserve small, carefully titrated doses as a bridge only when pH is severely depressed, typically less than 7.20, and the underlying cause is being addressed, with continuous reassessment of volume status and ventilation [^116xB4R5] [^113XiPyq]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; neonatology literature decrying bicarbonate is not directly generalizable to adults, but it reinforces the lack of outcome benefit when the precipitant is uncorrected, so the adult critical care principle remains to treat hypoxemia, restore perfusion, and target the source first, using bicarbonate sparingly as a temporizing measure in life-threatening acidemia while monitoring sodium load closely in cirrhosis [^116xB4R5].

> Now, let me consider sodium chloride 0.9% normal saline. My first thought is that it has less sodium than bicarbonate, but wait, I should verify the actual sodium loads; per liter, saline delivers 154 mEq of sodium, whereas a 50 mL ampule of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate contains 50 mEq of sodium, so the net sodium burden depends on the total volume and dosing strategy, and large-volume saline can easily deliver more sodium overall in a hypervolemic cirrhotic patient. I need to check the acid–base impact as well, since high-chloride saline can drive or worsen a non–anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may promote renal vasoconstriction; to mitigate this, I should avoid large saline boluses unless there is clear intravascular depletion, favoring alternative volume expanders in cirrhosis when indicated, and minimizing chloride load when possible [^11538Y59] [^1118qHgZ].

> But wait, what about balanced crystalloids like lactated Ringer's or acetate-based solutions as an alternative to saline. Initially, I thought these were contraindicated in severe hepatic insufficiency; hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check the label and guidelines, which actually advise particular caution, if at all, because impaired lactate clearance may blunt alkalinizing action and contribute to hyperlactatemia, so it is not an absolute contraindication but a risk-benefit decision in decompensated disease, especially if severe hepatic insufficiency is present or lactate is already high [^112jt1z2]. Hold on, I should also verify the implications of acetate and gluconate in some balanced solutions; expert consensus notes unknowns and potential hemodynamic effects in specific contexts, so tailoring fluid type and limiting volumes remain essential, with the acknowledgment that definitive comparative data in cirrhotics are limited [^1118qHgZ].

> Next, I should review guideline-based alternatives better aligned with cirrhosis physiology. For intravascular expansion when actually needed, albumin is generally preferred over crystalloids in cirrhosis, with high-quality guidance supporting albumin after large-volume paracentesis greater than 5 L, in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis to reduce renal failure and mortality, and as the first-line volume expander in AKI with ascites; these are not blanket indications for routine use in uncomplicated ascites, where albumin is not recommended, and evidence remains mixed for long-term albumin in diuretic-responsive ascites, so I need to confirm the indication each time [^1163zQbt] [^112SwB5e] [^1162mKa6] [^116sJVkG] [^113yAvvp] [^111RqFmx]. I should also consider specialty guidelines and transfusion societies that support albumin to prevent paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction and favor against its routine use in extraperitoneal infections, balancing benefit, cost, and supply constraints in shared decision-making [^114zXQ87] [^115x6FnP] [^113AuZUB].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway and verify thresholds. If the pH is at or above 7.20, my priority is to treat the precipitating cause of the acidosis, avoid routine bicarbonate, avoid large saline loads, and correct perfusion and oxygen delivery while protecting the kidneys; if the pH is below about 7.20 and the patient remains hemodynamically unstable despite source control and resuscitation, then cautious, small-dose sodium bicarbonate may be used as a bridge with tight monitoring of sodium load and volume, preferably alongside albumin-based volume support when indicated rather than large-volume chloride-rich crystalloids in a hypervolemic cirrhotic patient, and with reassessment of lactate and acid–base trajectory after each step [^113XiPyq] [^116xB4R5] [^1163zQbt]. If intravascular depletion is truly present, I should confirm the indication for albumin or small, judicious volumes of a balanced crystalloid while remembering the caution about lactate handling in severe hepatic insufficiency, and I should promptly evaluate for SBP, sepsis, hemorrhage, or HRS per disease-specific guidance [^112JUCKz] [^112jt1z2] [^112SwB5e] [^112J3ukT].

> I should double-check preventive measures for recurrence, because no prophylactic bicarbonate or saline is appropriate in cirrhosis. The mainstays are moderate sodium restriction, diuretic regimens centered on spironolactone with or without furosemide titrated to response, active avoidance of nephrotoxins such as NSAIDs and aminoglycosides, and careful monitoring of weight, creatinine, and sodium; in severe hyponatremia at or below 125 mEq/L, free water restriction can be considered and hypertonic saline is reserved for severely symptomatic acute cases with slow, goal-directed correction to prevent osmotic demyelination [^117FV1zn] [^11361ekY] [^114c2doV] [^1137kNxV] [^116ABfRy] [^112qX5xP] [^111Ut9Le].

> Hold on, I should verify encephalopathy considerations, since overcorrection toward alkalemia can worsen neurocognitive status while under-resuscitation risks cerebral hypoperfusion; best practice is to stabilize perfusion, treat infections, hemorrhage, or precipitating drugs, and continue evidence-based HE therapy while avoiding abrupt shifts in acid–base and electrolytes that are not clearly indicated in a decompensated cirrhotic [^114gz3bt] [^112JUCKz].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the final recommendation is clear. Neither sodium bicarbonate nor normal saline is routinely appropriate to treat acidosis in cirrhosis; instead, I should correct the underlying cause, prefer albumin for indicated intravascular expansion in cirrhosis, avoid large chloride loads, and reserve cautious small-dose bicarbonate only for severe acidemia as a bridge while continuously reassessing sodium and volume status, recognizing that balanced crystalloids can be used in small, tailored amounts with caution in severe hepatic insufficiency rather than being absolutely contraindicated, which was my initial overstatement [^1163zQbt] [^112SwB5e] [^112jt1z2]. Caveats remain that individual factors such as hypotension, active gastrointestinal bleeding, baseline sodium, and renal function may modify the approach, so iterative reassessment and guideline-concordant care are critical at each step [^112JUCKz] [^112J3ukT].

Do not routinely use **sodium bicarbonate** in cirrhosis unless pH < 7.1 or there is life-threatening acidosis, as it can cause sodium overload, fluid retention, and worsen ascites or encephalopathy. Sodium chloride is likewise **not ideal** because of the risks of hyperchloremic acidosis [^11538Y59] and sodium retention [^113o4iib]. For cirrhosis with acidosis, use **balanced crystalloids** (e.g. Plasma-Lyte) [^11538Y59] or albumin when indicated [^1163zQbt]; reserve sodium bicarbonate for **severe acidosis (pH < 7.1)** with close monitoring.

---

## Pathophysiology of acid-base disturbances in cirrhosis

Patients with cirrhosis commonly have **mixed acid–base disorders**: respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation due to hepatic encephalopathy or hypoxemia [^115E5aZE]; metabolic alkalosis from diuretics [^117UTo73], vomiting, or nasogastric suction; and metabolic acidosis from renal dysfunction [^1157JGo4], lactic acidosis, or gastrointestinal bicarbonate losses. Impaired hepatic clearance of lactate [^112jt1z2] and ammonia [^114gz3bt] contributes to these imbalances, and concomitant renal dysfunction can further worsen acidosis [^1157JGo4] [^114uX2Qa].

## Risks and benefits of sodium bicarbonate in cirrhosis

### Benefits

The primary benefit is **temporary correction of severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.1)**, which may stabilize hemodynamics and reduce hyperkalemia.

---

### Risks

- **Sodium overload and fluid retention**: Sodium bicarbonate administration increases sodium load, exacerbating ascites, edema, and potentially precipitating hepatic encephalopathy [^112Dvr6B].

- **Paradoxical intracellular acidosis**: Rapid bicarbonate administration can increase CO2 production, diffusing into cells and worsening intracellular acidosis [^114DgqRj].

- **Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia**: Bicarbonate therapy can cause electrolyte disturbances, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias [^114DgqRj].

- **Worsening hepatic encephalopathy**: Alkalinization can increase ammonia uptake into the brain, exacerbating encephalopathy.

Given these risks, sodium bicarbonate should be **reserved for severe acidosis (pH < 7.1)** or life-threatening hyperkalemia, with careful monitoring of electrolytes and fluid status.

---

## Risks and benefits of sodium chloride in cirrhosis

### Benefits

Benefits include **correction of hypochloremic, chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis** [^113XiPyq] (common in diuretic-treated cirrhotic patients) and **short-term volume expansion**, which can temporarily improve intravascular volume in hypovolemic patients [^1139yPid].

---

### Risks

- **Sodium retention and fluid overload**: Sodium chloride administration can exacerbate ascites, edema, and precipitate hepatic encephalopathy [^113o4iib].

- **Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis**: Large volumes of sodium chloride can cause hyperchloremic acidosis, worsening renal dysfunction and hemodynamic instability [^11538Y59].

- **Worsening renal function**: Sodium chloride-induced hyperchloremic acidosis can impair renal perfusion, increasing the risk of hepatorenal syndrome.

Given these risks, sodium chloride should be **used cautiously**, primarily to correct hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis or acute hypovolemia, with careful monitoring of fluid balance and renal function [^1139yPid].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **careful fluid and electrolyte management** in cirrhosis:

- **Sodium restriction**: Moderate sodium restriction (2 g/day) [^113o4iib] is recommended for patients with ascites to prevent fluid overload [^112E82xt].

- **Albumin administration**: Intravenous albumin is recommended for large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L) [^112SwB5e] and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis to prevent circulatory dysfunction and renal impairment [^113hz4jE].

- **Balanced crystalloids**: Balanced crystalloids (e.g. Plasma-Lyte) are preferred over sodium chloride for fluid resuscitation to minimize hyperchloremic acidosis and renal impairment [^11538Y59].

- **Sodium bicarbonate**: Reserved for severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.1) or life-threatening hyperkalemia, with careful monitoring.

---

## Alternative strategies for managing acidosis in cirrhosis

Given the risks of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride, management should prioritize **treating underlying causes** (e.g. infections, renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal bicarbonate losses) [^112J3ukT] and using balanced crystalloids for resuscitation to minimize further acid–base disturbance [^11538Y59]. For severe, refractory acidosis or renal failure, consider renal replacement therapy (dialysis or CRRT) [^1157JGo4] and maintain close monitoring of acid–base status, electrolytes, and fluid balance to guide therapy.

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Preferred treatment** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.1) | Sodium bicarbonate (cautiously) | Temporary correction of acidosis; monitor closely |
| Hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis | Sodium chloride (cautiously) | Corrects chloride-responsive alkalosis [^113XiPyq] |
| Fluid resuscitation | Balanced crystalloids | Minimizes hyperchloremic acidosis and renal impairment [^11538Y59] |
| Large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L) or SBP | Intravenous albumin | Prevents circulatory dysfunction and renal impairment [^112SwB5e] |

In cirrhotic patients with acidosis, sodium bicarbonate should be **reserved for severe cases (pH < 7.1)** because of the risks of sodium overload, fluid retention, and worsening encephalopathy. Sodium chloride is likewise risky, potentially causing hyperchloremic acidosis and fluid overload [^11538Y59]. Balanced crystalloids and albumin are **preferred alternatives**, with careful monitoring of acid–base status, electrolytes, and fluid balance [^1163zQbt].

### Enhanced external counterpulsation: a new technique to augment renal function in liver cirrhosis [^113FTGtw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Advanced liver cirrhosis is characterized by cardiovascular changes, such as low arterial blood pressure, peripheral vasodilation, and renal vasoconstriction. Consequently, renal hypoperfusion, impaired diuresis, natriuresis, and eventual hepatorenal syndrome may ensue. Previous studies using head-out water immersion to increase central blood volume have demonstrated the functional nature of the renal abnormalities. Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is a new non-invasive cardiac assist device to augment diastolic blood pressure by electrocardiogram-triggered diastolic inflation and deflation of cuffs wrapped around the lower extremities. We investigated whether EECP would improve renal dysfunction in liver cirrhosis.

- **Methods**: Twelve healthy controls and 19 patients with liver cirrhosis were observed during 2 hours of baseline, followed by 2 hours of EECP. The following parameters of renal and cardiovascular function were measured: renal plasma flow by para-aminohippurate clearance, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by inulin clearance, urine flow rate, urinary excretion rates of sodium and chloride, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), renal vascular resistance (RVR), and plasma concentrations of renin, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), endothelin-1, antidiuretic hormone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.

- **Results**: EECP was well tolerated by both healthy controls and cirrhotic patients. EECP increased MAP in cirrhotic patients from 74 ± 18 to 88 ± 20 mmHg (P < 0.01) and in controls from 89 ± 8 to 94 ± 5 mmHg (P = NS). It also increased ANP in cirrhotic patients from 23 ± 18 to 30 ± 20.

### Natural history of patients hospitalized for management of cirrhotic ascites [^117XjpkM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Since the International Ascites Club published the diagnostic criteria for refractory ascites (RA) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), there have been few studies assessing the natural history of ascites. The aims of this study were to define the natural history of cirrhotic ascites and to identify prognostic factors for dilutional hyponatremia (DH), RA, HRS, and survival.

Two hundred sixty-three consecutive cirrhotic patients were followed for 40.9 ± 2.6 months after their first significant ascites. During follow-up, 74 (28.1%) patients developed DH, 30 (11.4%) RA (diuretic-resistant in 2 cases and diuretic-intractable because of the development of diuretic-induced complications in 28 cases), and 20 (7.6%) HRS (type 1, 7; type 2, 13). The 5-year probability of DH, RA, and HRS development was 37.1%, 11.4%, and 11.4%, respectively. The probability of survival at 1 and 5 years was 85% and 56.5%, respectively.

The independent predictors for survival were baseline age, baseline Child-Pugh score, and DH development. The 1-year probability of survival after developing DH, RA, and type 2 HRS was 25.6%, 31.6%, and 38.5%, respectively. In contrast, the mean survival was only 7 ± 2 days in those patients developing type 1 HRS.

In conclusion, the survival of cirrhotic patients with the first episode of ascites is relatively high, and it is mainly influenced by age and Child-Pugh score at the time of ascites decompensation as well as by DH development. The probability of RA and HRS development is relatively low, but they are associated with poorer outcomes.

### Prognostic value of hypochloremia in critically ill patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^1151oBsr]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Cirrhosis is frequently complicated by electrolyte disturbances, with prior studies primarily focusing on the importance of hyponatremia. Emerging evidence in patients with chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease has identified hypochloremia as an independent predictor for mortality. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of serum chloride and its association with mortality in cirrhotic patients.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study.
- **Setting**: The medical ICU at Parkland Memorial Hospital, a tertiary care public health system in Dallas, Texas.
- **Patients**: Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of decompensated cirrhosis who were admitted to the ICU between March 2015 and March 2017.
- **Interventions**: None.
- **Measurements and main results**: Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazard ratio models were performed to determine the impact of hypochloremia on 180-day mortality. Of the 389 enrolled patients, 133 (34.2%) died within 180 days of ICU admission. Patients with hypochloremia had higher 180-day mortality than those with normochloremia (45.2% vs. 26.7%; p < 0.0001). Cumulative survival via the Kaplan-Meier method was significantly lower in the hypochloremic group. Serum chloride was independently associated with 180-day mortality with multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93–0.98; p = 0.001) or after adjusting for Model for End-stage Liver Disease or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. Contrarily, the inverse association between serum sodium and mortality no longer existed in all multivariable models.

### The surviving sepsis campaign: Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^1118qHgZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

What is not known are the gaps in our understanding, which also indicate the directions for future research.

- **Individual patient populations**: Are there specific patient populations in which saline should be avoided entirely? Testing types of fluids in subgroups of patients to detect the likelihood of adverse effects would be useful.

- **Differences between buffered solutions**: Are there differences between buffered solutions? Is lactated Ringer's superior to acetated/gluconated buffered solution or vice versa?

- **Implications of acetate and gluconate**: What are the implications of acetate and gluconate contained in some balanced solutions? In cardiac surgery patients, an acetate-based balanced solution had similar hemodynamic effects compared with lactated Ringer's. However, significant infusion of acetate may contribute to vasoplegia and myocardial dysfunction in patients with kidney dysfunction.

- **Impact of maintenance fluids**: Recent data suggest that maintenance fluids and fluids used in diluting drugs may provide a significant amount of chloride and have a major impact on fluid balance. Data suggest that selecting sodium/chloride poor maintenance fluids may improve fluid balance and chloride load in postoperative patients, but data in septic patients are still lacking. As such, should chloride-containing solutions (including balanced solutions) be minimized or entirely avoided? This question is especially pertinent given recent instances of supply chain interruption, resulting in shortages of critical fluids and necessitating therapeutic substitutions at the individual patient level.

- **Renal outcomes with buffered solutions**: Are the beneficial renal outcomes associated with buffered solutions compared with saline due to the reduction in chloride content?

### Ethacrynic sodium [^116TkyfA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The effects of ethacrynic acid on electrolytes are related to its renal pharmacologic activity and are dose-dependent. The possibility of profound electrolyte and water loss may be avoided by weighing the patient throughout the treatment period, by careful adjustment of dosage, by initiating treatment with small doses, and by using the drug on an intermittent schedule when possible. When excessive diuresis occurs, the drug should be withdrawn until homeostasis is restored. When excessive electrolyte loss occurs, the dosage should be reduced or the drug temporarily withdrawn.

Initiation of diuretic therapy with ethacrynic acid in the cirrhotic patient with ascites is best carried out in the hospital. Once maintenance therapy has been established, the individual can be satisfactorily followed as an outpatient.

Ethacrynic acid should be given with caution to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, particularly those with a history of previous episodes of electrolyte imbalance or hepatic encephalopathy. Like other diuretics, it may precipitate hepatic coma and death.

Too vigorous a diuresis, as evidenced by rapid and excessive weight loss, may induce an acute hypotensive episode. In elderly cardiac patients, rapid contraction of plasma volume and the resultant hemoconcentration should be avoided to prevent the development of thromboembolic episodes, such as cerebral vascular thromboses and pulmonary emboli, which may be fatal. Excessive loss of potassium in patients receiving digitalis glycosides may precipitate digitalis toxicity.

### Natural history of grade 1 ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis [^11622AQn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients and methods: One hundred consecutive Caucasian patients with grade 1 ascites were enrolled in this retrospective study. One hundred forty-five consecutive Caucasian patients with grade 2/3 ascites and 175 without ascites served as control groups. The study population was composed of hospitalized medical patients or outpatients from three university hospitals in Greece: University Hospital of Patras (n = 315), University Hospital of Ioannina (n = 59), and University Hospital of Heraklion (n = 46). The recruitment of the patients was performed between November 1993 and July 2014. Blood samples were collected from patients throughout the year.

- **Definitions**: The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was based on clinical, laboratory, histological, and ultrasonographic findings. The severity of liver cirrhosis was assessed by the Child-Pugh (CP) score, CP stage, and by the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. The evaluation of ascites was based on medical history, physical examination, abdominal ultrasound, assessment of laboratory parameters, and analysis of the ascitic fluid. The diagnosis of SBP was defined as suggested by the International Club of Ascites diagnostic criteria, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was defined as suggested by the EASL and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidelines, and HRS was defined as suggested by the revised consensus recommendations of the International Club of Ascites. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and severe cardiopulmonary disease or renal failure were excluded from enrollment.

### Dopamine hydrochloride [^114dYa1k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Address hypovolemia, acidosis, and hypoxia before initiating Dopamine HCl injection. If the patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia. Acidosis may reduce the effectiveness of dopamine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Preparation and administration instructions**: For the 40-mg/mL preparation, transfer by aseptic technique the contents containing either 5 mL (200 mg) or 10 mL (400 mg) of Dopamine HCl injection to either a 250-mL or a 500-mL bottle of one of the sterile intravenous solutions listed below:

	- 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP
	- 5% dextrose injection, USP
	- 5% dextrose and 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP
	- 5% dextrose and 0.45% sodium chloride injection, USP
	- 5% dextrose and lactated Ringer's injection
	- Sodium lactate injection, USP 1/6 molar
	- Lactated Ringer's injection, USP

	- The resultant dilutions are stable for 24 hours after dilution in these intravenous solutions.

	- Dopamine HCl injection is administered (only after dilution) by intravenous infusion. Administer it into a large vein with the use of an infusion pump, preferably in an intensive care setting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

	**Note**: Inspect Dopamine HCl injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit. The solution should be clear and practically colorless. Do not administer if the solution is darker or discolored. Use a higher concentration if necessary.

### An evidence-based approach to studies in cirrhosis and portal hypertension: Medical management of mild to moderate ascites [^114y3LLY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Previous articles in this series have examined the critical appraisal of isolated structured clinical questions using the framework of evidence-based medicine. When patients are identified with a disease-specific process, however, an integrated approach for addressing multiple questions is required. This article, the sixth in the evidence-based medicine series for this journal, integrates critical appraisal techniques to examine the decision-making process used when evaluating a patient with cirrhosis and new-onset mild to moderate ascites.

In the following clinical scenario, an approach is described for determining prognosis after the development of ascites and whether salt restriction and oral diuretics are effective therapies. The format is similar to other evidence-based medicine articles published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The evidence-based medicine concepts have been expanded from previous articles, and examples from the hepatology literature have been used.

### Ethacrynic acid [^1112VqMx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The effects of ethacrynic acid on electrolytes are related to its renal pharmacologic activity and are dose-dependent. The possibility of profound electrolyte and water loss may be avoided by weighing the patient throughout the treatment period, by careful adjustment of dosage, by initiating treatment with small doses, and by using the drug on an intermittent schedule when possible. When excessive diuresis occurs, the drug should be withdrawn until homeostasis is restored. When excessive electrolyte loss occurs, the dosage should be reduced or the drug temporarily withdrawn.

Initiation of diuretic therapy with ethacrynic acid in the cirrhotic patient with ascites is best carried out in the hospital. Once maintenance therapy has been established, the individual can be satisfactorily followed as an outpatient. Ethacrynic acid should be given with caution to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, particularly those with a history of previous episodes of electrolyte imbalance or hepatic encephalopathy. Like other diuretics, it may precipitate hepatic coma and death.

Too vigorous a diuresis, as evidenced by rapid and excessive weight loss, may induce an acute hypotensive episode. In elderly cardiac patients, rapid contraction of plasma volume and the resultant hemoconcentration should be avoided to prevent the development of thromboembolic episodes, such as cerebral vascular thromboses and pulmonary emboli, which may be fatal. Excessive loss of potassium in patients receiving digitalis glycosides may precipitate digitalis toxicity. Care should also be exercised.

### Acetadote [^112YuQfZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dilution of Acetadote in each of these three solutions results in different osmolarity of the acetylcysteine solution for intravenous administration. The choice of diluent should be based on the individual patient's clinical status, medical conditions, and institutional protocols. The treating clinician should assess each case individually and consult with their pharmacy if there are any concerns about the appropriate diluent choice. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent, as it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids than 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection.

Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The color of the diluted solution ranges from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured; the color change does not affect the quality of the product. The diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature. Discard the unused portion. If a vial was previously opened, do not use it for intravenous administration.

- **General considerations for selecting the three-bag or two-bag regimen**: The total recommended dosage of Acetadote is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as either a three-bag regimen or a two-bag regimen.

It is not known whether the two-bag regimen is comparable to the three-bag regimen.

### No good deed: Acidosis in chronic kidney and liver disease [^112Dvr6B]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Low credibility.

Studies indicate that low or high serum bicarbonate levels, reflecting metabolic acidosis or alkalosis, are linked with higher all-cause mortality rates in moderate and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) cases. Correcting presumed acidosis using sodium bicarbonate to target serum levels around 22 mmol/L has proven beneficial in delaying disease progression and providing mortality benefits. A similar prognostic association may exist with uncorrected metabolic acidosis in chronic liver disease. However, correcting it with sodium-containing salts may require more interventions due to increased sodium/fluid load. In patients with liver failure, who are naturally alkalotic and have concerns about sodium load, the impact of this intervention remains unclear.

This study aims to generate proof of concept through a retrospective chart review in individuals with CKD-related metabolic acidosis and liver cirrhosis. Our analysis showed a statistically significant association between the need for paracentesis and bicarbonate therapy. However, the study has multiple drawbacks, including its retrospective nature and single-center patient data limitations.

We extrapolate that lowering bicarbonate targets in other clinical scenarios such as liver failure, pregnancy, and cardiac failure may be prudent and could lead to a reduced sodium load.

### Lactated ringers [^112jt1z2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Precautions:

- **Air embolism risk**: Do not connect flexible plastic containers in series to avoid air embolism due to possible residual air contained in the primary container. Pressurizing intravenous solutions in flexible plastic containers to increase flow rates can result in air embolism if the residual air in the container is not fully evacuated prior to administration. Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism. Vented intravenous administration sets with the vent in the open position should not be used with flexible plastic containers.

- **Caution in patients with hepatic insufficiency**: Lactated Ringer's Injection should be administered with particular caution, if at all, to patients with conditions associated with increased lactate levels or impaired lactate utilization, such as severe hepatic insufficiency. Hyperlactatemia can develop in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, since lactate metabolism may be impaired. In addition, Lactated Ringer's Injection may not produce its alkalinizing action in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency due to impaired lactate metabolism.

- **Caution in patients with hypercalcemia**: Solutions containing calcium salts should be used with caution in patients with hypercalcemia or conditions predisposing to hypercalcemia, such as severe renal impairment and granulomatous diseases associated with increased calcitriol synthesis, such as sarcoidosis, calcium renal calculi, or a history of such calculi.

- **Lactate as a substrate for gluconeogenesis**: This should be taken into account when Lactated Ringer's Injection is used in patients with higher needs for glucose regulation.

### Rifaximin has the potential to prevent complications of cirrhosis [^116drm5C]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The details of the patient population, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and study design have been published elsewhere. Briefly, adults with cirrhosis, a history of two or more episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) with a Conn score of 2 or more within six months of screening, but currently in remission from HE (i.e. Conn score of 1 or less), and a MELD score of 25 or less at study entry were eligible for inclusion in the study.

Exclusion criteria included active spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or the requirement of daily prophylactic therapy for SBP, renal insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL), anemia (hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL), and hypovolemia or any electrolyte abnormality with the potential to affect mental function. The trial design was a randomized, phase III, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of rifaximin 550 mg (Xifaxan®, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) or placebo administered twice daily (BID) for six months. Concomitant use of lactulose was permitted during the study. As previously reported, the study protocol received approval by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each center, and the study was conducted in adherence to guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonisation. All patients provided written informed consent.

### Con: The unclear benefit of albumin [^115BGSxs]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Many studies have shown that 20% human albumin solution infusions improve circulatory function in patients with advanced liver disease, and this treatment is widely recommended and used by all hepatologists. However, it is more expensive than other crystalloids or colloids, and several countries suffer shortages of supply. This article examines whether other fluids might be considered for these patients.

### Xigduo XR [^116go5QM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For patients aged 65 or greater, the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with age due to a higher likelihood of hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment. It is essential to assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

- **Radiological studies with contrast**: The administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients can lead to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. It is advised to stop Xigduo XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure, or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure and restart Xigduo XR if renal function is stable.

- **Surgery and other procedures**: Withholding food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk of volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Xigduo XR should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.

- **Hypoxic states**: Several postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been linked to lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, it is crucial to discontinue Xigduo XR.

### Sodium bicarbonate: Basically useless therapy [^114DgqRj]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Common clinical practices often lack experimental evidence. One such example is the administration of sodium bicarbonate to neonates. Despite its long history of widespread use, there is no objective evidence demonstrating that sodium bicarbonate improves outcomes for patients in cardiopulmonary arrest or with metabolic acidosis. In fact, evidence suggests that this therapy may be detrimental. This review explores the history of sodium bicarbonate use in neonatology and examines the evidence that challenges the clinical practice of administering sodium bicarbonate during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or for treating metabolic acidosis in the NICU.

### Acid base disorders in cirrhosis [^114uX2Qa]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Low credibility.

Metabolic and respiratory acid-base disorders are common in individuals with liver disease and cirrhosis. The most common disorder is respiratory alkalosis, which may be related to dyspnea or respiratory stimulation. Primary metabolic disorders are less common. Although the liver plays a role in the metabolism of amino acids and the generation of acid from dietary sources, it does not play a role in the regulation of pH. Instead, metabolic disorders may arise from alterations in normal metabolism or from medications, particularly diuretics and osmotic laxatives, used in the treatment of these complex patients. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of these disorders can aid in the management of individuals with liver disease in hospital and outpatient settings.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^112E82xt]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for liver cirrhosis, specifically concerning salt restriction, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend advising moderate restriction of sodium intake (80–120 mmol/day, corresponding to 4.6–6.9 g of salt). This means implementing a no added salt diet with the avoidance of pre-prepared meals in patients with moderate, uncomplicated ascites.

---

### Fluid resuscitation in acute medicine: What is the current situation [^11538Y59]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The administration of intravenous fluids for resuscitation is the most common intervention in acute medicine. There is increasing evidence that the type of fluid may directly affect patient-centered outcomes. There is a lack of evidence that colloids confer clinical benefit over crystalloids, and they may be associated with harm. Hydroxyethyl starch preparations are associated with increased mortality and the use of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis; albumin is associated with increased mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Crystalloids, such as saline or balanced salt solutions, are increasingly recommended as first-line resuscitation fluids for the majority of patients with hypovolemia.

There is emerging evidence that saline may be associated with adverse outcomes due to the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis; however, the safety of balanced salt solutions has not been established. Fluid requirements vary over the course of critical illness. The excessive use of fluids during the resuscitative period is associated with increased cumulative fluid balance and adverse outcomes in critically ill patients.

The selection of fluid depends on the clinical context in which it is administered and requires careful consideration of the dose and potential for toxicity. There is an urgent need to conduct further high-quality randomized controlled trials of currently available fluid therapy in patients with critical illness.

Terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide are accepted options. Therapy should be administered for 3–5 days in patients experiencing acute variceal bleeding.

---

### Acid-base interpretation: A practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes.

- **Metabolic acidosis**: For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances.

- **Metabolic alkalosis**: Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion.

- **Respiratory disorders**: Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Impact of a goal directed fluid therapy algorithm on postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing open right hepatectomy: a single centre retrospective observational study [^114KMG1t]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Fluid intervention and vasoactive medication management: Usual care group**: Intraoperatively, fluid intervention and use of vasoactive drugs for the usual care group was at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. There was no maintenance fluid therapy administered. Fluid therapy consisted of either 4% or 20% albumin, or the balanced crystalloid, PlasmaLyte. The type and volume of fluid administered was at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Acute normovolemic hemodilution was not utilized in any of the patients. As part of standard care, central venous pressure (CVP) was generally maintained at less than 8 mmHg during the pre-hepatic transection and dissection phases. Reverse Trendelenburg position and glyceryl trinitrate (5–20 μg/min) were further employed to decrease CVP below 5 mmHg if the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) was within 20% of the baseline value. After completion of the liver transection, euvolemia was restored with crystalloid or colloid fluid intervention, aiming for a target CVP between 10 and 12 cmH₂O. Use of vasoconstrictors, such as metaraminol, phenylephrine, or noradrenaline, was at the discretion of the anesthesiologist to support MAP within 20% of baseline values.

- **Fluid intervention and vasoactive medication management: GDFT group**: Patients in the goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) group received intraoperative advanced hemodynamic monitoring using a FloTrac system (FloTrac System 4.0, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). The FloTrac sensor was used with an EV1000 clinical platform to continuously measure and display key flow parameters, including cardiac output.

### Meld score and serum sodium in the prediction of survival of patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation [^112WEsnK]. Gut (2007). Low credibility.

Serum sodium predicts prognosis in cirrhosis and may improve the prognostic accuracy of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, but the available information is limited. The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic value of serum sodium in the prediction of survival at 3 and 12 months after listing in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation and to compare its predictive value with that of the MELD score.

- **Patients and methods**: 308 consecutive patients with cirrhosis listed for transplantation during a 5-year period were included in the study. The end-point was survival at 3 and 12 months before transplantation. Variables obtained at the time of listing were analysed for prognostic value using multivariable analysis. Accuracy of prognostic variables was analysed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

- **Results**: The MELD score and serum sodium concentration were the only independent predictors of survival at 3 and 12 months after listing. Low serum sodium was associated with an increased risk of death in all subpopulations of patients with cirrhosis categorised according to the major complication developed before listing. The area under the ROC curves for serum sodium and MELD score was not significantly different both at 3 months (0.83 vs. 0.79, respectively) and at 12 months (0.70 vs. 0.77, respectively). The addition of serum sodium did not significantly improve the accuracy of the MELD score in the prediction of survival at 3 and 12 months.

### Ethacrynic acid [^1114snas]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

While many patients do not require supplemental potassium, the use of potassium chloride or potassium-sparing agents, or both, during treatment with ethacrynic acid is advisable, especially in cirrhotic or nephrotic patients and in patients receiving digitalis.

Salt liberalization usually prevents the development of hyponatremia and hypochloremia. During treatment with ethacrynic acid, salt may be liberalized to a greater extent than with other diuretics. Cirrhotic patients, however, usually require at least moderate salt restriction concomitant with diuretic therapy.

- **Intravenous use**: Ethacrynate sodium is for intravenous use when oral intake is impractical or in urgent conditions, such as acute pulmonary edema.

The most important history items to ascertain are whether the patient has symptoms and how long this imbalance has taken to develop. Treatment rapidity depends on the severity of symptoms, with the most rapid treatment occurring only in the severely symptomatic. Overcorrection has dire consequences and must be approached carefully and systematically to prevent these devastating outcomes.

### Introduction to the revised American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases position paper on acute liver failure 2011 [^113yt2qc]. Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

- **Advances in management of ALF**: The medical management of ALF has not been extensively studied and remains poorly defined. In the absence of evidence-based clinical trials, experts from 23 centers in the United States have proposed detailed management guidelines by consensus. Since the last AASLD position paper, several noteworthy advances have been made in assessing the risk of developing, and managing, specific complications of ALF.

- **Serum ammonia and intracranial hypertension (ICH)**: A detailed analysis of serum ammonia in patients with ALF identified a concentration of 75 μM as an important threshold below which patients rarely develop ICH. Conversely, arterial ammonia levels of > 100 μM on admission represent an independent risk factor for the development of high-grade hepatic encephalopathy, and a level of > 200 μM predicts ICH. The risk of developing ICH is decreased by raising the serum sodium to 145–155 mEq/L with hypertonic saline. Once established, however, the medical treatment of ICH must bridge patients to liver transplantation, because no treatment permanently reverses cerebral edema. In cases of ICH refractory to osmotic agents (e.g. mannitol and hypertonic saline), therapeutic hypothermia (cooling to a core temperature of 32°C-34°C) has been shown to bridge patients to transplantation, but is associated with a theoretical risk of impairing liver regeneration.

- **Neurological recovery**: To optimize neurological recovery after ALF, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) must be raised to avoid cerebral underperfusion and anoxia. In hypotensive patients with ALF, intravascular volume should be carefully managed to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion.

### Whither the bicarbonate era [^116xB4R5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

For metabolic acidosis, beyond treating the underlying cause, correcting hypoxemia, and establishing good perfusion, sodium bicarbonate is often given at variable arbitrary thresholds of depressed blood pH. Recently, Zanella and colleagues employed extracorporeal removal of chloride by electrodialysis in healthy pigs made acidemic by either lactic acid infusion or hypoventilation (CO2 retention). By physically drawing off chloride and establishing a local separation of charge, blood electroneutrality at the membrane is immediately reestablished by the hydrolysis of water to yield a hydroxyl ion that instantly combines with CO2 to form bicarbonate. The authors show the feasibility of quantitatively increasing bicarbonate in this fashion for both forms of acidosis without the associated and unwanted hypernatremia and volume loading that can occur with intravenous sodium bicarbonate administration.

The accompanying editorialists proclaim the postbicarbonate era with this study that illustrates a major tenet of the Stewart approach to acid–base chemistry and its superiority over other approaches to understanding acid–base physiology and pathophysiology. In Stewart's paradigm, H+, OH−, HCO3−, and CO32− are relegated to the status of dependent variables; that is, they can only be formed from the differential movements and exchanges of independent strong ions (Na+, K+, and Cl−) that disturb electroneutrality, which is immediately corrected by the hydrolysis of water and reaction with CO2.

### Lasix [^117UTo73]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Warnings

In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, Lasix therapy is best initiated in the hospital. In hepatic coma and in states of electrolyte depletion, therapy should not be instituted until the basic condition is improved. Sudden alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance in patients with cirrhosis may precipitate hepatic coma; therefore, strict observation is necessary during the period of diuresis. Supplemental potassium chloride and, if required, an aldosterone antagonist are helpful in preventing hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

If increasing azotemia and oliguria occur during treatment of severe progressive renal disease, Lasix should be discontinued.

Cases of tinnitus and reversible or irreversible hearing impairment and deafness have been reported. Reports usually indicate that Lasix ototoxicity is associated with rapid injection, severe renal impairment, the use of higher than recommended doses, hypoproteinemia, or concomitant therapy with aminoglycoside antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, or other ototoxic drugs. If the physician elects to use high-dose parenteral therapy, controlled intravenous infusion is advisable (for adults, an infusion rate not exceeding 4 mg Lasix per minute has been used) (see precautions: drug interactions).

### Antimicrobial therapeutic determinants of outcomes from septic shock among patients with cirrhosis [^111tXMvx]. Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

This was a nested cohort study within a retrospective database on septic shock conducted in 28 medical centers in Canada, the United States, and Saudi Arabia by the Cooperative Antimicrobial Therapy of Septic Shock (CATSS) Database Research Group between 1996 and 2008. The details of the setting have been described elsewhere. Data were extracted for all adult patients with cirrhosis (biopsy-proven cirrhosis, documented variceal hemorrhage or portal hypertension, hepatic ascites, or encephalopathy). Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards of all participating institutions.

- **Measurements**: We collected baseline patient characteristics including demographics and comorbid conditions. The following data were obtained on day 1 of septic shock: serum lactate, bilirubin, creatinine, bicarbonate levels, platelet count, international normalized ratio, white blood cell (WBC) count, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score. We calculated the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score on day 1 as described previously.

- **Outcomes**: Hospital mortality was considered the primary outcome variable. Secondary outcomes were ICU mortality and hospital and ICU length of stay.

### Lactic acidosis in a critically ill patient: Not always sepsis [^112a62Ar]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis in the emergency department and other hospital settings is typically due to tissue hypoxia, with sepsis being the most common cause. However, in patients with persistently elevated lactate levels without evidence of inadequate oxygen delivery, type B lactic acidosis should be considered. We report the case of a 12-year-old boy with relapsed and refractory pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who presented in distress with tachycardia, a history of fever, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. The patient had severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate upon arrival to the emergency department. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and intravenous antibiotics, the patient's acidosis worsened. Serial blood cultures were negative, and he was eventually diagnosed with type B lactic acidosis secondary to relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

### Furosemide [^113Gq6XJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Warnings

In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, it is advisable to initiate furosemide therapy in a hospital setting. In cases of hepatic coma and electrolyte depletion, therapy should be delayed until the underlying condition improves. Sudden changes in fluid and electrolyte balance in patients with cirrhosis can precipitate hepatic coma, necessitating strict observation during the diuresis period. Supplemental potassium chloride and, if required, an aldosterone antagonist can help prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

If increasing azotemia and oliguria occur during the treatment of severe progressive renal disease, furosemide should be discontinued.

Cases of tinnitus, reversible or irreversible hearing impairment, and deafness have been reported. Reports typically indicate that furosemide ototoxicity is associated with rapid injection, severe renal impairment, the use of higher than recommended doses, hypoproteinemia, or concomitant therapy with aminoglycoside antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, or other ototoxic drugs. If the physician opts for high-dose parenteral therapy, controlled intravenous infusion is advisable. For adults, an infusion rate not exceeding 4 mg of furosemide per minute has been used (see precautions, drug interactions).

- **Pediatric use**: In premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome, diuretic treatment with furosemide during the first few weeks of life may increase the risk of persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), possibly through a prostaglandin-E-mediated process.

### Generlac [^112c2uKb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy, including the stages of hepatic pre-coma and coma, controlled studies have shown that lactulose solution therapy reduces blood ammonia levels by 25 to 50%. This reduction is generally paralleled by an improvement in patients' mental state and EEG patterns. The clinical response has been observed in about 75% of patients, which is at least as satisfactory as that resulting from neomycin therapy.

An increase in patients' protein tolerance is also frequently observed with lactulose solution therapy. In the treatment of chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy, lactulose solution has been administered for over 2 years in controlled studies.

### Acid-base disturbance in patients with cirrhosis: relation to hemodynamic dysfunction [^115E5aZE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances were investigated in patients with cirrhosis in relation to hemodynamic derangement to analyze the hyperventilatory effects and the metabolic compensation. A total of 66 patients with cirrhosis and 44 controls were investigated during a hemodynamic study.

Hyperventilatory hypocapnia was present in all patients with cirrhosis and progressed from Child class A to C (P < 0.01). Arterial pH increased significantly from class A to C (P < 0.001) and was correlated inversely to the mean arterial blood pressure (r = -0.30, P < 0.02), systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.25, P < 0.05), indocyanine green clearance (r = -0.37, P < 0.005), and serum sodium (r = -0.38, P < 0.002). Metabolic compensation was shown by a reduced standard base excess in all patients (P < 0.001). Standard base excess contained elements related to changes in serum albumin, water dilution, and effects of unidentified ions (all P < 0.001). A significant hepatic component in the acid-base disturbances could not be identified.

Hypocapnic alkalosis is related to disease severity and hyperdynamic systemic circulation in patients with cirrhosis. The metabolic compensation includes alterations in serum albumin and water retention that may result in a delicate acid-base balance in these patients.

### Serum sodium, model for end-stage liver disease, and a recent invasive procedure are risk factors for severe acute-on-chronic liver failure and death in cirrhotic patients hospitalized with bacterial infection [^111umRkL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Bacterial infection is present in up to 30% of hospitalized cirrhotic patients. It can lead, even after its resolution, to organ dysfunction and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). It serves as the precipitating factor of ACLF in one-third of cases and is the main cause of mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and identify early risk factors for severe ACLF and death in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis with bacterial infection.

This prospective observational study included hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis and bacterial infection. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and the progression to organ dysfunction and death was assessed. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify predictors of severe ACLF and in-hospital mortality.

This study included 88 patients. ACLF was observed in 62 (70%) patients, with 48 (55%) experiencing grade 2 or higher. Of the 27 deaths (31% of all patients), 26 had severe ACLF (54% mortality) [P < 0.0001]. The independent risk factors for ACLF of at least grade 2 and death were baseline serum sodium [odds ratio (OR): 0.874; P = 0.01, and OR: 0.9, P = 0.04], initial MELD [OR: 1.255, P = 0.0001, and OR: 1.162, P = 0.005], and a recent invasive procedure [OR: 3.169, P = 0.01, and OR: 6.648, P = 0.003].

Lower serum sodium values, higher MELD scores at the diagnosis of infection, and a recent history of invasive procedures were identified as independent risk factors for severe ACLF and death in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infection.

### Aldactone [^117Deauh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Edema associated with hepatic cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome**: Aldactone is indicated for the management of edema in the following settings: cirrhosis of the liver when edema is not responsive to fluid and sodium restriction; and nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response. Because it increases serum potassium, Aldactone may be useful for treating edema when administration of other diuretics has caused hypokalemia.

- **Primary hyperaldosteronism**: Aldactone is indicated in the following settings: short-term preoperative treatment of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism; long-term maintenance therapy for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are not candidates for surgery; and long-term maintenance therapy for patients with bilateral micro or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism).
