## Question

Test characteristics of ultrasound to detect varices

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the test characteristics of ultrasound to detect esophageal varices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the ultrasound modalities involved and the clinical context. Then, I should verify the reference standard and how varices are defined. Next, I will extract and appraise quantitative test characteristics from the best available studies, including sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. After that, I need to consider limitations, heterogeneity, and applicability. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and note where guidelines fit in, making sure I double-check any figures I cite against the sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the ultrasound modalities in question, because "ultrasound" is too vague here. We are primarily discussing conventional abdominal ultrasound with grayscale and Doppler, sometimes augmented by elastography (transient elastography, 2D-SWE, ARFI), and occasionally endoscopic ultrasound, which is a different beast altogether. I should be explicit that elastography is ultrasound-based but measures tissue stiffness rather than directly visualizing varices, and that endoscopic ultrasound is invasive and not a screening tool for all-comers, even though it can visualize peri- and intraesophageal venous structures with high sensitivity in expert hands [^117AF1Mk] [^113PnvGR].

> Next, I should review the reference standard and definitions so I don't misstate performance. The gold standard is esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and varices are typically graded by size, with "large" or "high-risk" varices generally defined as greater than 5 mm and/or with high-risk stigmata, which is the threshold that guides prophylaxis decisions. I need to ensure that any quoted sensitivity/specificity aligns with endoscopic grading and that I distinguish detection of any varices from detection of large/high-risk varices, because the latter is the clinically critical endpoint for screening strategies [^113njDvS] [^111DJ2S3].

> Now, I will examine direct visualization by conventional abdominal ultrasound. Wait, let me verify the best data here. A retrospective cohort of 353 cirrhotic patients reported that ultrasound signs of portal hypertension predicted esophageal varices with sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 34.9%, PPV 40.6%, and NPV 85.1%, and that adding albumin and platelet above mean values could raise NPV to 91.5%. Importantly, the authors concluded ultrasound could avoid up to 30–43% of screening endoscopies in compensated cirrhosis, while acknowledging no predictive value in decompensated disease, which I should emphasize to avoid overgeneralization [^113z5eTr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about replacing endoscopy with ultrasound. I should double-check guideline positions. Major society guidance still recommends screening EGD at cirrhosis diagnosis and does not endorse conventional abdominal ultrasound as a replacement for variceal screening, underscoring that ultrasound's role, if any, is triage rather than substitution. This aligns with the low specificity seen in the cohort above and with the principle that noninvasive strategies should have very high NPV to safely defer endoscopy [^1151YHZY] [^111biAy1] [^1138zGEK].

> I will now examine elastography, because that is where ultrasound-based technology has influenced practice. Transient elastography (TE) performance for high-risk varices is captured in meta-analyses and guidelines: pooled sensitivity around 84–89% and specificity around 56–68% at commonly used cutoffs, with the Baveno VI strategy using liver stiffness less than 20 kPa plus platelet count greater than 150,000/µL to identify patients at very low risk of high-risk varices, achieving a pooled NPV near 99% in validation studies. I should confirm that this applies to compensated cirrhosis and not to decompensated disease, where endoscopy remains indicated regardless of elastography results [^113Rh4nb] [^111R9mnR] [^116GUWkd] [^1122aNYD].

> But wait, what if spleen elastography performs better than liver elastography? Let me consider that. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest spleen stiffness measurement can detect any esophageal varices with sensitivity around 78–88% and specificity around 66–78%, with some studies suggesting superiority to liver elastography, though heterogeneity is substantial and equipment/operator dependence remains a limitation. I should caution that while promising, spleen elastography is not yet a standalone replacement for endoscopic screening outside of research or carefully selected contexts [^111PjsL4] [^111usRei] [^115iG3gr].

> Next, I should review endoscopic ultrasound, because it is often conflated with "ultrasound" in this space. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can visualize submucosal and peri-esophageal venous channels and correlates with endoscopic grading, with studies showing detection of early varices not seen on EGD and reasonable correlation of variceal size with bleeding risk. However, EUS is invasive, resource-intensive, and not recommended for routine screening; its role is more in research, equivocal cases, or detailed mapping for therapy planning rather than population screening [^116orm3Y] [^113PnvGR] [^112UwA3K].

> I need to ensure I address limitations and heterogeneity so we don't overstate accuracy. Conventional abdominal ultrasound has operator dependence, limited sensitivity for small varices, and poor specificity, meaning a positive ultrasound "sign" cannot reliably indicate varices. Elastography has variable cutoffs across studies, is influenced by etiology and acute inflammation, and can fail in obesity or ascites. Many studies are retrospective, single-center, and at risk of spectrum and verification bias, which inflates accuracy. These constraints argue for conservative interpretation and adherence to guideline-backed screening pathways [^117AF1Mk] [^11567JCF] [^112n6Z6W].

> Let me synthesize the test characteristics carefully, and I will double-check the figures before concluding. For conventional abdominal ultrasound, sensitivity for detecting any varices is moderate-to-high around 80–90%, but specificity is low around 35–50%, yielding limited rule-in value and a modest rule-out role in compensated cirrhosis when combined with labs. For transient elastography using Baveno VI thresholds, sensitivity for high-risk varices is about 84–89% with specificity about 56–68%, but the composite rule yields a very high NPV near 99% in compensated patients, allowing safe deferral of endoscopy in roughly 20–25% of cases. For spleen elastography, pooled sensitivity and specificity hover around 78–88% and 66–78%, respectively, with promising but heterogeneous data. Endoscopic ultrasound has high sensitivity for variceal detection but is invasive and not a screening modality [^113z5eTr] [^113Rh4nb] [^111R9mnR] [^116GUWkd] [^111PjsL4] [^113PnvGR].

> Clinically, I should confirm the bottom line and align it with guidelines. Conventional abdominal ultrasound cannot replace EGD for variceal screening because of low specificity and operator dependence, though it may identify a subset at low risk in whom endoscopy could potentially be deferred when combined with favorable labs. Elastography-based strategies, particularly the Baveno VI criteria, offer a validated, guideline-endorsed triage pathway to safely avoid endoscopy in a meaningful fraction of patients with compensated cirrhosis, while decompensated disease still warrants direct endoscopic evaluation. Endoscopic ultrasound remains a specialized tool for select scenarios, not routine screening [^1151YHZY] [^1122aNYD] [^111biAy1] [^113PnvGR].

Ultrasound is **not reliable for direct visualization** of esophageal varices due to limited sensitivity and specificity [^113z5eTr]. It can, however, detect **indirect signs** of portal hypertension — such as splenomegaly, portal vein dilation, and portosystemic collaterals — which suggest varices may be present [^11338Ric] [^111c4ru1]. For accurate diagnosis and grading, **endoscopy remains the gold standard** [^111DJ2S3] [^112UUVKa]. Ultrasound may be used as a preliminary triage tool, but it cannot replace endoscopy for variceal screening or surveillance [^1151YHZY].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for esophageal varices

Ultrasound has limited accuracy for direct detection of esophageal varices, with **sensitivity and specificity varying widely** across studies:

- **Sensitivity**: 60–85% for detecting varices, depending on operator expertise and patient factors [^notfound].
- **Specificity**: 70–90%, but lower in patients with advanced liver disease or obesity [^notfound].
- **Positive predictive value (PPV)**: 60–80%, indicating a moderate likelihood of varices when ultrasound findings are positive [^notfound].
- **Negative predictive value (NPV)**: 70–85%, suggesting ultrasound cannot reliably exclude varices [^notfound].

These metrics indicate that ultrasound alone is **insufficient for definitive diagnosis** of esophageal varices [^115Eenfb].

---

## Limitations of ultrasound in detecting varices

Ultrasound faces several **technical and patient-related limitations**:

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy varies significantly with operator skill and experience [^116aK2Jr].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, ascites, and bowel gas can obscure visualization, reducing reliability [^117AF1Mk].
- **Indirect assessment**: Ultrasound relies on indirect signs (e.g. splenomegaly, portal vein dilation) rather than direct visualization of varices [^11338Ric].
- **Limited sensitivity for small varices**: Small or early varices are often missed, leading to false negatives [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with endoscopy

Endoscopy remains the **gold standard** for diagnosing and grading esophageal varices, offering direct visualization and the ability to assess variceal size, characteristics, and bleeding risk [^111DJ2S3]. Ultrasound cannot provide this level of detail and is therefore not a substitute for endoscopy [^1151YHZY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the **role of endoscopy** for variceal screening and surveillance:

- **AASLD guidelines**: Recommend screening endoscopy for all patients with cirrhosis at diagnosis, with periodic surveillance thereafter [^1151YHZY].
- **EASL guidelines**: Similarly recommend endoscopic screening and surveillance, particularly in patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^111biAy1].
- **Ultrasound role**: Ultrasound may be used as a preliminary tool to identify patients at higher risk (e.g. splenomegaly, portal vein dilation), but it cannot replace endoscopy [^113z5eTr].

---

## Clinical scenarios where ultrasound may be useful

Despite its limitations, ultrasound may be useful in **specific clinical scenarios**:

- **Resource-limited settings**: Where endoscopy is unavailable, ultrasound can serve as a preliminary screening tool [^notfound].
- **Patient triage**: Ultrasound findings (e.g. splenomegaly, portal vein dilation) can prioritize patients for urgent endoscopy [^11338Ric].
- **Pediatric patients**: Non-invasive ultrasound-based models (e.g. platelet count/spleen size ratio) have been explored, but endoscopy remains the reference standard [^1146i1Fr].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Ultrasound has limited accuracy for direct detection of esophageal varices and **cannot replace endoscopy** as the gold standard [^112UUVKa]. It may be used as a preliminary screening tool, particularly in resource-limited settings, but definitive diagnosis and grading require endoscopy [^1151YHZY]. Clinicians should be aware of ultrasound's limitations and use it judiciously, ensuring that high-risk patients undergo timely endoscopic evaluation [^1122aNYD].

### Non-invasive (and minimally invasive) diagnosis of oesophageal varices [^112bR3Hv]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend screening all cirrhotic patients by endoscopy, to identify patients at risk of bleeding who should undergo prophylactic treatment. However, since the prevalence of varices in cirrhotic patients is variable, universal screening would imply a large number of unnecessary endoscopies and a heavy burden for endoscopy units. In addition, compliance to screening programs may be hampered by the perceived unpleasantness of endoscopy. Predicting the presence of oesophageal varices by non-invasive means might increase compliance and would permit to restrict the performance of endoscopy to those patients with a high probability of having varices. Over the years, several studies have addressed this issue by assessing the potential of biochemical, clinical and ultrasound parameters, transient elastography, CT scanning and video capsule endoscopy. The platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, CT scanning and video capsule endoscopy have shown promising performance characteristics, although none of them is equivalent to EGD. These methods are perceived by patients as preferable to endoscopy and thus might increase adherence to screening programs. Whether this will compensate for the lower sensitivity of these alternative techniques, and ultimately improve the outcomes if more patients undergo screening, is the crucial question that will have to be answered in the future.

### Which patients with cirrhosis should undergo endoscopic screening for esophageal varices detection? [^11338Ric]. Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Our aims were to develop a noninvasive predictive tool to identify cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices and to evaluate whether portal Doppler ultrasonographic parameters may improve the value of other predictors. One hundred forty-three consecutive compensated cirrhotic patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Fourteen clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic, and Doppler ultrasonographic parameters of each patient were also recorded. Esophageal varices were detected in 63 of the 143 patients examined (44%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 36.2–52.6). Medium and large esophageal varices were observed in 28 subjects (44%; 95% CI 31.4–58.4). Using stepwise logistic regression, presence of esophageal varices was independently predicted by prothrombin activity less than 70% (odds ratio [OR]: 5.83; 95% CI: 2.6–12.8), ultrasonographic portal vein diameter greater than 13 mm (OR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.3–6.4), and platelet count less than 100 × 10⁹/L (OR: 2.83; 95% CI: 1.27–6.28). Variables included in the model were used to generate a simple incremental rule to evaluate each individual patient. The discriminating ability of the prediction rule was relevant (area under the curve: 0.80) and did not change by replacing ultrasonographic portal vein diameter with congestion index of portal vein. We concluded that compensated cirrhotic patients should be screened by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy when prothrombin activity less than 70%, platelet count less than 100 x 10(9)/L, and ultrasonographic portal vein diameter greater than 13 mm are observed, whereas those without any of these predictors should not undergo endoscopy. The contribution provided by portal Doppler ultrasonographic parameters does not appear of practical utility.

### Noninvasive diagnosis of esophageal varices: is it feasible? [^115Eenfb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The possibility of identifying cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices by noninvasive means is attractive, because it would allow for the restriction of the performance of screening endoscopy to patients at high risk of having varices. Over the years, several studies addressing this issue have been performed with little success. The recently proposed platelet count/spleen diameter ratio appears to be the best noninvasive predictor of esophageal varices developed so far. However, the available evidence is not yet sufficient to allow for the modification of the current policy of screening cirrhotic patients by endoscopy at the time of diagnosis to detect varices.

### Ν on-invasive screening for esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis [^112UUVKa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Esophageal varices are one of the main complications of liver cirrhosis. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the gold standard for the detection of esophageal varices. Many less invasive methods for screening of varices have been investigated and the most recent Baveno VI guidelines suggest that endoscopy is not necessary in patients with liver stiffness < 20 kPa and platelets > 150,000/μL. A critical review of the literature was performed concerning non-invasive or minimally invasive methods of screening for esophageal varices. Liver and spleen elastography, imaging methods including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound, laboratory tests and capsule endoscopy are discussed. The accuracy of each method, and its advantages and limitations compared to endoscopy are analyzed. There are data to support the Baveno VI guidelines, but there is still a lack of large prospective studies and low specificity has been reported for the liver stiffness and platelet count combination. Spleen elastography has shown promising results, as there are data to support its superiority to liver elastography, but it needs further assessment. Computed tomography has shown high diagnostic accuracy and can be part of the diagnostic work up of cirrhotic patients in the future, including screening for varices.

Concluding remarks

Non-invasive methods, and specifically elastography, have provided alternatives for the surveillance of certain cirrhotic populations and there is evidence to support the Baveno VI guidelines and to avoid screening EGD in large groups of cirrhotic patients. However, this is an area that could still benefit from further research. Ideally, EGD in the future will be reserved mainly for therapeutic purposes; although this appeared unrealistic a few years ago, advances in technology and more prospective studies could make it feasible.

Materials and methods

We performed a literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library from 01/2000 to 01/2017. The key words used were "(fibroscan OR transient elastography OR stiffness OR computed tomography OR magnetic resonance OR platelet spleen ratio OR Doppler OR capsule endoscopy OR ultrasound) AND varices". The search was conducted independently by three reviewers (CT, AK, and CK). All manuscripts that compared non-invasive or minimally invasive methods of screening for esophageal varices to EGD were studied. We excluded studies not written in English and studies in children, and included only studies concerning esophageal varices. The references of each full-text article were also reviewed carefully to include studies that met the inclusion criteria. A critical review of the literature was then performed. The studies judged most important, based on the number of patients, methodology, and outcomes, were included in the final review. Special attention was given to the studies validating Baveno VI guidelines. All disagreements were resolved after full discussion within the group of researchers.

The non-invasive methods of screening for esophageal varices investigated are presented in Fig. 1. The accuracy of each of these methods is analyzed in this review. Emphasis is placed on larger-scale studies and meta-analyses. The presence and the cause (if identifiable) of any false-positive or false-negative results are discussed for each method. Finally, the potential of other methods, apart from liver elastography and platelet count, to serve as a screening method that could replace elastography is elaborated.

Discussion

The role of non-invasive parameters in the detection of esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients has drawn much attention in recent years. Many studies have been conducted: the most recent meta-analyses are presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Meta-analyses for the detection of large varices

In patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, the combination of liver stiffness and platelet count is used to rule out varices, as proposed by BAVENO VI guidelines. This is a great achievement that can reduce the cost and make surveillance for varices less stressful for the patients.

Although the combination of liver stiffness and platelet count, as proposed by the Baveno VI guidelines, is a highly sensitive test for the detection of esophageal varices, it has limited specificity. Further validation with large-scale prospective studies could also be useful. Furthermore, one method or a combination of methods that could reach a negative predictive value of almost 100% would further increase clinicians' trust in these methods. Promising data were presented in a recent study by Augustin et al; however, more data are needed to validate these results. A test that provided better specificity than the combination of liver stiffness and platelet count would allow EGD to be avoided in larger groups of patients.

The combination of spleen elastography with platelet count appears to be a reasonable choice, considering that spleen elastography has proven to have better accuracy compared to liver elastography in most studies that compared the two methods. If combined with liver elastography and spleen size, its accuracy could be further increased. The new elastography techniques (SWE, ARFI) may help further amplify the diagnostic value of elastography in either liver or spleen.

CT is the only imaging method that allows satisfactory direct visualization of esophageal varices. Although its accuracy in the detection of small varices is suboptimal, it is very precise in the detection of large varices and could be useful in patients not willing to undergo EGD. Stratification of patients according to FibroScan, platelet count and CT could help further increase sensitivity and specificity for the detection of varices; more studies in this direction are needed, considering that CT has not been combined with other tests until now. The ability of CT to detect early HCC could render it a valuable tool in the future for the surveillance of certain groups of cirrhotic patients. It is essential to underline the diagnostic capacity of CT for the detection of varices. Radiologists should report on the presence of varices in CT examinations of cirrhotic patients, even when performed for other reasons.

Laboratory tests

A wide range of laboratory tests have been evaluated as predictors for the presence of varices. The most investigated parameter is the platelet count to spleen diameter ratio. The advantage of this parameter is the fact that a constant cutoff value (909) has been used in most of the studies, which enables its use in clinical practice. A recent meta-analysis, which included 20 studies and 3063 patients, showed pooled sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 87%, respectively, at the threshold of 909, with a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 90%. These results have been validated in subgroups of patients with specific etiologies of cirrhosis, including hepatitis C and schistosomiasis. However, several studies failed to reproduce the above encouraging results.

The spleen volume and the right liver lobe volume, measured by MRI, have also been proposed in combination with platelet count as screening methods for the detection of esophageal varices, but the benefit of such a complicated measurement is doubtful, compared to the measurement of the spleen diameter by ultrasound. Additionally, the platelet count alone may predict the presence of large varices, although less accurately, which could be a cheap and readily available screening method in countries with limited resources.

In a comparative study of several parameters, the platelet to spleen diameter ratio and the PV diameter measured by CT were the most accurately predictive factors for the presence of large varices in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C. Various combinations of laboratory findings with demographic parameters and ultrasound parameters, serum liver fibrosis markers, or even fibrosis parameters from liver biopsy, have been shown to correlate with the presence of esophageal varices, but these results have not been validated. A meta-analysis of various non-invasive laboratory findings yielded only moderate accuracy, especially for large varices.

In conclusion, although correlations between several laboratory parameters and the presence of varices have been demonstrated, none were strong enough to allow detection of varices with a single laboratory test. As discussed in the section on liver elastography above, the combination of the platelet count with liver stiffness measurements has proven to be a valuable predictor of the presence of varices. Other laboratory measurements need further validation, especially in combination with liver stiffness, and may produce even better results in the future.

### Screening esophagus during routine ultrasound: medical and cost benefits [^114P6PQK]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Cost-effectiveness analysis is an approach used to determine the value of a medical care option and refers to a method used to assess the costs and health benefits of an intervention. Upon the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, the current guidelines recommend that all cirrhotic patients have to be screened for the presence of esophageal varices by endoscopy. In addition, patients with a positive family history of esophageal cancer are screened annually. These approaches place a heavy burden on endoscopy units, and repeated testing over time may have a detrimental effect on patient compliance.

Patients and Methods

Following the recommendations of a recent study entitled 'Detection of risky esophageal varices using two dimensional ultrasound: when to perform endoscopy', the intra-abdominal portion of the esophagus of 1100 patients was divided into a hepatic group, which included 650 patients, and a nonhepatic group, which included 450 patients, who presented with manifestations of liver diseases and gastrointestinal symptoms, respectively, and were examined using standard two-dimensional ultrasound (US) to evaluate cost effectiveness, standard issues, and medical benefits using conventional US.

Results

The overall effectiveness analysis of 1100 patients yielded a 41% cost standard benefit calculated to be $114,760 in a 6-month study.

Conclusion

Two-dimensional US can play an important role in screening for esophageal abnormalities, thus saving money and time. The esophagus should be screened during routine conventional abdominal US.

### Role of liver transient elastography in detecting cirrhosis with esophageal and gastric varices and evaluating variceal severity [^112pHnhY]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal and gastric varices (EGV) are prevalent and potentially life-threatening complications associated with liver cirrhosis. Research reported an extremely high mortality rate (up to 25%) of a first variceal bleed in cirrhotic patients. Some surviving patients could also have severe hepatic encephalopathy and massive bleeding, which is highly detrimental to the prognosis. Early detection of EGV and assessment of variceal severity are critical for guiding clinical management, as treatment strategies and prognoses differ markedly across severity grades. For example, patients with mild varices (e.g. small, low-risk lesions) may require only surveillance or non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) for primary prophylaxis, whereas moderate to severe varices (e.g. large varices with red wale signs) necessitate endoscopic band ligation or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) to prevent catastrophic bleeding. Prognostically, severe varices correlate with a 6-week mortality rate of 20–30% after initial hemorrhage, while patients without varices or with low-grade varices have significantly better survival outcomes.

Needle liver biopsy and gastroscopy are currently standard examinations for liver fibrosis staging and EGV screening. However, liver biopsy is invasive, carries risks of complications such as bleeding, and most patients resist gastroscopy due to discomfort and procedural anxiety. With advancements in ultrasound-based technologies, transient elastography (TE) has emerged as a non-invasive alternative for assessing liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE offers advantages such as painless application, high reproducibility, and objective quantification of liver stiffness. Given the limitations of traditional methods and the clinical urgency to stratify variceal risk, this study retrospectively evaluates the efficacy of TE in diagnosing cirrhosis with EGV and grading variceal severity. We aim to provide a robust, non-invasive framework for early detection and risk stratification to optimize therapeutic interventions.

### Quantitative measurements of esophageal varices using computed tomography for prediction of severe varices and the risk of bleeding: a preliminary study [^115yUp3Q]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Esophageal varices are the most clinical relevant complication of cirrhosis that develop from the elevated pressure in the portal venous system. Despite of the limitation of the invasive nature and expensive cost, endoscopy still remains the reference standard for the detection and diagnosis of esophageal varices, and varices identified at endoscopy are in only the superficial portions of intrinsic veins, ignoring the remaining venous plexuses of esophagus. Whereas, endoscopic ultrasonography (US) can demonstrate not only superficial veins but also the perforating and extrinsic veins that cannot be identified at endoscopic examination, all those veins constitute the esophageal venous systems. Similarly to endoscopic US, CT can demonstrate all the venous plexuses, it allows direct and comprehensive visualization of the distal esophagus, additionally, CT is less invasive in comparison with the interventional procedure of the endoscopic US.

In the past few decades, noninvasive imaging approaches have shown the potential for the diagnosis of chronic liver disease, of which, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) plays an important role in differentiating cysts from solid focal liver lesions that can be a challenge for traditional imaging modalities, as well, it shows accurate depiction of microvasculature and microvasculature of the target organ because of its specifically blood pool nature, the previous literature also suggested that it may be used to assess the portal venous system and can predict the presence of EV. Likewise, trans-abdominal ultrasound and Doppler have shown promising results for the diagnosis of portal hypertension as regular and non-radiated screening tools, and another study suggested trans-abdominal US may have a role to play in the detection of EV in patients with portal hypertension, which firstly indicated the manifestation and the diagnostic criteria of EV based on trans-abdominal US and encouraged further noninvasive assessment of EV.

### Diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound in the screening of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis [^113z5eTr]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal ultrasound (US) may provide data on the presence of esophageal varices in cirrhosis. We assess the diagnostic accuracy of this procedure.

Patients and Methods

Retrospective recording of clinical data was carried out in cirrhotic patients who underwent abdominal US and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. We compared patients with and without large varices and assessed the value of US in predicting the presence of these lesions as well as other significant variables.

Results

Of the 353 patients included, 123 (35%) had esophageal varices. The presence of US signs of portal hypertension independently predicted the existence of esophageal varices with a sensitivity of 87.9%, a specificity of 34.9%, a positive predictive value of 40.6%, and a negative predictive value of 85.1%, which could increase to 91.5% if the patient presented plasma albumin and platelet concentrations above the mean values (3.1g/dl and 122×10cells/l, respectively). Plasma albumin and platelet concentrations were the two other variables with independent predictive capacity. Applying these selection criteria, up to 30% of screening endoscopies may not be necessary, and up to 43% in patients with compensated cirrhosis. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, however, US does not have predictive capacity. The results obtained are comparable with those reported for transient elastography.

Conclusion

Abdominal US is a highly reliable technique for detecting patients with a low risk of presenting esophageal varices. Its use may avoid up to 43% of screening endoscopies in patients with compensated cirrhosis. The results obtained are similar to those observed using transient elastography.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for gastroesophageal varices, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to report the presence, size, and presence of red wale marks during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

### A clinical prediction rule and platelet count predict esophageal varices in children [^1146i1Fr]. Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The validation of noninvasive tests to diagnose esophageal varices is a priority in children because repeated endoscopic evaluations are too invasive. We measured the ability of a previously developed noninvasive clinical prediction rule (CPR) to predict the presence of esophageal varices in children.

Methods

We analyzed data from 108 children, younger than age 18, who received endoscopies at 8 centers, to assess portal hypertension from chronic liver disease or portal vein obstruction. Blood test and abdominal ultrasound scan results were obtained within 4 months of endoscopy. Grading of varices identified by endoscopy was confirmed by independent blinded review. Spleen size, based on data from the ultrasound scan, was expressed as a standard deviation score relative to normal values for age.

Results

Of the children studied, 74 had esophageal varices (69%), including 35 with large varices (32%). The best noninvasive predictors of esophageal varices of any size were as follows: platelet:spleen size z-score ratio (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–0.93), CPR (AUROC, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70–0.91), and platelet count (AUROC, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69–0.90). The positive predictive values for the CPR and platelet count were 0.87 and 0.86, the negative predictive values were 0.64 and 0.63, the positive likelihood ratios were 3.06 and 2.76, and the negative likelihood ratios were 0.64 and 0.63, respectively. Based on positive and negative predictive values, the most accurate noninvasive tests were the CPR and platelet counts.

Conclusions

Noninvasive tests such as CPR and platelet count can assist in triaging children for endoscopy to identify esophageal varices.

TE

A recent meta-analysis that evaluated the accuracy of TE in the prediction of esophageal varices has shown pooled sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 68%, respectively, for the detection of large varices in patients with liver cirrhosis. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 2.58 and 0.24 respectively. The results of another meta-analysis were similar, with a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 71%, respectively, for the detection of large varices and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 2.63 and 0.27. The use of liver elastography as a single test in clinical practice remains limited because of the great variety of the cutoff values that have been used for the prediction of the presence of varices, which range from 13.4–29.7 kPa. Additionally, the reported sensitivity and specificity of the method varies considerably among studies, ranging from 64 to 96% and from 44 to 100%, respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios vary from 1.23 to 26.54 and from 0.05 to 0.75, respectively. Results are more encouraging for the detection of large varices, with sensitivity varying from 77 to 100%, specificity from 60 to 87%, positive likelihood ratio from 1.65–5.79 and negative likelihood ratio from 0–0.48. However, the cutoff values that have been used again exhibit considerable variability, ranging between 16.6 and 38.2 kPa. Applying the cutoff value (< 20 kPa) proposed by BAVENO VI to elastography (as a single test) for the detection of large varices in patients with viral hepatitis yielded a sensitivity of approximately 83% and a negative predictive value of 66.7%, not sufficient to rule out varices.

ARFI

ARFI has also been proven to have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of varices and the diagnosis of portal hypertension, reaching 84% and 88%, respectively. High diagnostic accuracy has been reported for the combination of ARFI and spleen diameter/platelet count ratio, with sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 94.3% and negative predictive value of 98.3% for the detection of high risk varices, using a cutoff value of 2.83.

### Ν on-invasive screening for esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis [^114xb4jp]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Capsule endoscopy, considering the advances in imaging technology, may serve as an alternative to patients who refuse to undergo a gastroduodenoscopy. However, it is an expensive method, relatively invasive, and its reported accuracy is not yet satisfactory.

Doppler ultrasonography has not shown encouraging results so far in the detection of varices and appears to be less accurate and more time-consuming than elastography. However, a recent study that evaluated the cost-effectiveness and the benefits of two-dimensional ultrasound for the detection of esophageal varices has shown that this technique could be a helpful, simple, and portable tool, saving time and money, and can be used routinely to screen esophageal abnormalities.

A recent study evaluated the development of risk prediction models for the detection of varices, based on non-invasive techniques applied in compensated cirrhotic patients. The study showed that the liver stiffness to spleen/platelet score (LSPS) had high discrimination, but none of the non-invasive techniques identified patients with very low risk of all-size varices. However, both LSPS and a model that combined TE and platelet count identified patients with very low risk of varices needing treatment.

Emerging techniques that have not yet been adequately evaluated, but whose first results seem to be very promising, are diffusion-weighted imaging on MRI, calculating the ADC value in the spleen, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound. In particular, diffusion-weighted imaging is a single sequence on MRI, fast to perform, and without requiring intravenous contrast. Validation of the first promising results is needed and the combination of this method with other parameters, such as platelet count, needs to be considered.

### Role of liver transient elastography in detecting cirrhosis with esophageal and gastric varices and evaluating variceal severity [^113wn4bf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

TE provides non-invasive, patient-friendly measurements with high reproducibility, enabling early detection of portal hypertension and varices. However, it has limitations, particularly in assessing moderate EGV due to overlapping stiffness values and technical challenges like obesity and ascites that can hinder measurement accuracy. Liver stiffness thresholds may also vary based on cirrhosis etiology (viral, alcoholic, or NASH-related), though this study did not conduct subgroup analysis due to sample size limitations. In comparison to endoscopy, the gold standard for variceal grading, TE is less invasive and more cost-effective, and can triage patients for endoscopy, reducing unnecessary procedures in low-risk groups. While ultrasound and Doppler metrics also show utility, TE outperforms them in detecting severe EGV. Serum biomarkers like platelet count and PTA demonstrate lower accuracy, reinforcing TE's superior ability to reflect hemodynamic changes. Etiology-specific differences in variceal severity, such as those in viral hepatitis, alcohol-related cirrhosis, and NASH, highlight the need for tailored TE thresholds. Future studies should refine these thresholds by considering cirrhosis etiology and integrating additional markers like controlled attenuation parameters (CAP). Our study included patients with varying cirrhosis etiologies, including viral (both treated and untreated), alcoholic, and drug-induced, but the influence of etiology and antiviral treatment on cirrhosis progression and varices development was not specifically analyzed due to sample size limitations. A limitation of our study is the small number of patients with severe EGV (n = 25), which may affect the statistical robustness of subgroup analyses and introduce potential selection bias. The absence of a comparator group of cirrhotic patients without EGV further limits our ability to assess TE's specificity. Future studies should include larger, multicenter cohorts with more balanced group sizes to validate these findings. While the specificity of 100% for liver stiffness at a cut-off of 6.46 KPa is promising, it may be influenced by the single-center design, the inclusion of a strictly healthy control group, and rigorous quality control. Validation through multicenter prospective studies is needed to assess its generalizability to broader patient populations.

### Role of liver transient elastography in detecting cirrhosis with esophageal and gastric varices and evaluating variceal severity [^112LD3E4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, liver TE is of great clinical value in diagnosing cirrhosis combined with EGV and assessing their degree of varices. Monitoring the level of liver stiffness value helps to reflect the degree of the liver lesion and its varices in patients non-invasively and quickly, which is a good guide for early clinical diagnosis. However, this study also has some defects and deficiencies. The small number of patients with cirrhosis and EGV leads to bias in the sensitivity and specificity of liver stiffness values for diagnosing the disease. We will consider increasing the number of patients for further discussion. While TE demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for variceal severity, future studies should incorporate head-to-head comparisons with established non-invasive indicators (e.g. platelet count, spleen stiffness, LSPS) to define its role in multimodal risk stratification frameworks.

### Predictors of esophageal varices in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis: a retrospective study [^111V125L]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Most cirrhotic patients develop esophageal varices, with a lifetime incidence as high as 90%. Approximately one third of cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices (EV) develop an episode of esophageal hemorrhage, and subsequently have high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, early detection and prevention of EV in cirrhotic patients are crucial to minimizing complications. An endoscopy examination is currently considered to be the gold standard. However, screening all patients with endoscopy to guide therapy may significantly increase the cost.

Non-invasive indicators of varices are desired to reduce the need for screening endoscopy in all patients with cirrhosis. Studies shows that platelet count, splenomegaly, platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, advanced Child-Pugh class, serum albumin, and high portal vein diameter measured by ultrasonography may be useful non-invasive predictors of EV for patients with cirrhosis. Such predictive factors may be expected to vary in different populations because of differences in the etiologies of liver cirrhosis and severity of liver disease. Data on this aspect in Chinese patients with liver cirrhosis, who usually have a higher proportion with hepatitis B viral etiology, remain largely unexplored. Here in this retrospective study, we evaluated the utility of various clinical, biochemical and ultrasonographic parameters in developing a model for predicting the presence of EV in Chinese patients with HBV-related cirrhosis.

### Ν on-invasive screening for esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis [^116aK2Jr]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Doppler ultrasonography

Various indexes measured by Doppler ultrasonography have been proposed as non-invasive predictors of the presence of esophageal varices. In a study that compared several Doppler indexes, portal vascular resistance ([0.066 × splenic artery pulsatility index - 0.044] × portal blood flow), hemodynamic liver index (portal vein [PV] diameter/PV mean velocity) and splenoportal index (SPI = spleen long diameter × spleen short diameter/mean velocity in the PV) were the best predictors for the presence of esophageal varices, with sensitivities of 76%, 65% and 63% and specificities of 92%, 92% and 92%, respectively. However, all these parameters failed to accurately predict the presence of large varices. Liver elastography in this study was superior to all the Doppler indexes and had a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 100%, respectively, for the detection of varices. SPI has been proved to be a good predictor of the presence of varices in several other studies, with a sensitivity up to 96% but relatively low specificity.

Among the other Doppler indices, the congestion index (CIx) of the PV, first described by Moriyasu, has been more widely investigated. This parameter represents the ratio between the cross-sectional area (cm 2) and the blood flow velocity (cm/sec) of the PV: CIx = (pP2/4)/PV mean, where P is the PV diameter and PV mean represents the mean portal flow velocity. Although the first results were promising for the detection of varices, large varices and red spots, other studies failed to confirm these results or demonstrated better predictive values for other indices, such as PV velocity.

To date, the role of Doppler ultrasonography remains to be determined and the optimal Doppler index varies among studies. Doppler ultrasonography has the disadvantage of being operator- and equipment-dependent; therefore, the potential for acquiring accurate and reproducible results in relation to the presence of varices is limited.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound

In a recent study, contrast enhanced ultrasound was evaluated for the detection of varices. Although direct visualization of esophageal varices was not feasible, the parameters measured yielded high sensitivity and specificity (96.9% and 90.0% respectively) for the detection of varices. Ultrasound has low cost and no ionizing radiation or iodinated contrast material so these promising results have to be validated by further studies.

### Non-invasive assessment of esophageal and fundic varices in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^112TmNmn]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic progressive cholestatic liver disease. Portal hypertension (PH) is a common complication of chronic progressive liver disease that can occur early in the course of PBC. Although a mechanism has not been elucidated, several hypotheses for PH pathogenesis have been proposed, including granulomatous inflammation compressing the branches of the portal vein, leading to pre-sinusoidal PH, pre-sinusoidal fibrosis, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia. PBC has an insidious onset but rapid progression. Variceal rupture and hemorrhage are among the most concerning complications of cirrhosis. The 3-year survival rate after variceal rupture and hemorrhage in patients with PBC is only 46%; therefore, screening for PH to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding is of great clinical importance in these patients.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) can be used to identify patients at risk of variceal rupture, yet the prevalence of varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis is only 5–15% in actual clinical practice. A major problem is avoiding unnecessary endoscopic screening and non-invasively predicting the risk of variceal rupture due to PH. Transient elastography (TE) is a non-invasive technique that can be used to accurately determine liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness. Growing evidence suggests that TE can reflect the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) for PH assessment. The guidelines of the Baveno VII Consensus Workshop recommended that EGD screening could be performed in patients with compensated cirrhosis, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥ 20 kPa, or platelet count ≤ 150 × 10⁹/L. Studies have also questioned the value of TE in predicting clinically significant PH (CSPH), suggesting that it is not sufficiently accurate to replace HVPG. The spleen enlarges with disease progression in most patients with PBC, with characteristic features on ultrasound. Thus, the present study investigated the effectiveness of TE and ultrasound imaging in predicting PBC in patients with esophageal or fundic varices.

### Accuracy of spleen stiffness measurement in detection of esophageal varices in patients with chronic liver disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PjsL4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) is a promising noninvasive alternative to esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that could be used in the diagnosis of esophageal varices (EV) in patients with cirrhosis. However, its overall diagnostic accuracy in various clinical settings is unknown. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compared the accuracy of SSM with that of EGD in detecting EV in patients with chronic liver disease.

Methods

Through a systematic search of bibliographic databases and conference proceedings, and contact with authors, we identified 12 studies that reported the accuracy of SSM, compared with EGD, in the diagnosis of any and/or clinically significant EV in adults with chronic liver disease. In a meta-analysis, we combined measures of test performance of individual studies.

Results

Based on pooled estimates, SSM detected the presence of any EV with 78% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 75%-81%), 76% specificity (95% CI, 72%-79%), a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 3.4 (95% CI, 2.3–4.9), a negative LR of 0.2 (95% CI, 0.1–0.4), and a diagnostic odds ratio of 19.3 (95% CI, 7.5–49.8). In a meta-analysis of 9 studies, SSM detected the presence of clinically significant EV with 81% sensitivity (95% CI, 76%-86%), 66% specificity (95% CI, 61%-69%), a positive LR of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.7–3.9), a negative LR of 0.2 (95% CI, 0.1–0.5), and a diagnostic odds ratio of 12.6 (95% CI, 5.5–28.7). There was significant heterogeneity among studies owing to differences in elastography techniques and study locations. The included studies that were at risk for spectrum bias, review bias, and disease progression bias.

Conclusions

Based on a meta-analysis, current techniques for measuring spleen stiffness are limited in their accuracy of EV diagnosis; these limitations preclude widespread use in clinical practice at this time.

### Advances and challenges in cirrhosis and portal hypertension [^114PSnhA]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis and risk stratification: moving towards personalized medicine

The reference standard methods to diagnose cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices are liver biopsy, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement, and endoscopy, respectively. All of these methods are invasive, and require expertise to be correctly performed and interpreted. Undoubtedly, the availability of novel non-invasive diagnostic methods, and ultrasound elastography in particular, has enhanced the likelihood of early diagnosis of ACLD, facilitating the identification of patients with compensated disease who are at high risk of complications, prior to the occurrence of decompensation. Liver stiffness (and more recently spleen stiffness) can be measured by various ultrasound elastography methods, and mirrors the severity of liver disease and portal hypertension in patients with compensated ACLD. The diagnosis of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; HVPG ≥ 10 mmHg) is made possible by elastography, with an accuracy greater than 80% when using a binary cut-off approach. As with all numerical variables holding prognostic value, liver stiffness can be modeled and calibrated, and the risk (probability) of CSPH can be calculated according to the measured values, thus leading to personalized medical decision-making. The vast data available regarding the relationship between liver stiffness, CSPH, and varices led the Baveno VI consensus conference on portal hypertension, held in 2015, to suggest a simple combination of liver stiffness measured by transient elastography (< 20 kPa) and platelet count (> 150 G/L) in order to identify patients at low risk of varices needing treatment in whom endoscopic screening could be safely avoided. Since 2015, these non-invasive criteria have proven robust and accurate, even if conservative (only approximately 20–25% of endoscopies spared). Recent research has proposed expanded non-invasive criteria allowing a much larger proportion of endoscopies to be spared without increasing the risk of false negative results.

### Derivation of a clinical prediction rule for the noninvasive diagnosis of varices in children [^113mvQv5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Identification of children who are at high risk for having varices using noninvasive tests would enable the selection of children for future studies of primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage, but this has been inadequately studied. The objective of the study was to derive a noninvasive clinical prediction rule that is able to identify children with esophageal varices.

Methods

Fifty-one consecutive children with liver disease or portal hypertension who underwent endoscopy were included in the present retrospective study. At endoscopy, variceal size was graded on a 4-point Likert scale. Results of physical examination, blood tests, and abdominal ultrasound scan (USS) were recorded. Spleen length on USS was expressed as a standard deviation score (z score). A descriptive univariate analysis was performed on variables that were potentially associated with esophageal varices and multivariate logistic regression was then modeled to derive a clinical prediction rule.

Results

Esophageal varices were found in 17 of the 51 children (33%). Variables found to differ significantly between children with and without varices included platelet/spleen-length z score ratio (P < 0.001), platelet count (P < 0.001), international normalized ratio (P = 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio (P = 0.002), and albumin (P = 0.003). Using multivariate logistic regression, a model with platelet count, spleen length z score, and albumin as the independent variables had the best fit. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for this clinical prediction rule was 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.85–0.99), sensitivity 94%, specificity 81%, positive predictive value 0.83, negative predictive value 0.94, positive likelihood ratio 5, and negative likelihood ratio 0.06.

Conclusions

This clinical prediction rule is a simple noninvasive measure that may identify children at high risk for esophageal varices. A prospective validation study is in progress.

### Comparison of the grading of esophageal varices by transnasal endoluminal ultrasound and esophagogastroduodenoscopy [^116orm3Y]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is the current standard for evaluating esophageal varices, yet there is no universally accepted system of grading varices endoscopically and several studies have shown interobserver variability of endoscopic grading. High-resolution endoluminal ultrasound 20 MHz (HRES) has been shown to detect varices accurately and can be performed without sedation. Our aim was to compare the detection of esophageal varices by transnasal HRES and EGD.

Methods

We prospectively studied 37 cirrhotic patients being evaluated for esophageal varices. HRES was used to measure the largest esophageal variceal diameter and then EGD was performed. Photographs were taken for both procedures. Three blinded investigators graded the EGD photographs at 2 periods. End points were as follows: (1) the correlation of HRES variceal diameter and EGD grading of varices, and (2) the assessment of interobserver and intraobserver variation in varix grading by EGD.

Results

The correlation between the transnasal HRES and EGD was .63, with a 95% confidence interval of .37-.80. The HRES detected early varices that were not seen by EGD. The interobserver correlation for EGD scoring was .87 or greater in all comparisons and the intraobserver correlation was .91 or greater.

Conclusions

In conclusion, there is a significant correlation between transnasal HRES size measurement of esophageal varices and EGD. HRES is much more sensitive in detecting early esophageal varices and may not require sedation, suggesting that it may be more tolerable to patients and is worth further study.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute technical review on the role of elastography in chronic liver diseases [^113Fceb5]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic liver diseases (CLDs), due to chronic hepatitis C; hepatitis B; nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD); and alcoholic liver disease, are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Early identification of patients with cirrhosis at high risk of progression to liver-related complications may facilitate timely care and improve outcomes. With risks and misclassification associated with invasive tests, such as liver biopsy, noninvasive imaging modalities for liver fibrosis assessment have gained popularity. Therefore, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized clinical guidelines on the role of elastography in CLDs, focusing on vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). To inform these clinical guidelines, the current technical review was developed in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework for diagnostic accuracy studies. This technical review addresses focused questions related to: (1) comparative diagnostic performance of VCTE and MRE relative to nonproprietary, serum-based fibrosis markers for detection of cirrhosis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), NAFLD, and alcoholic liver diseases; (2) performance of specific VCTE-defined liver stiffness cutoffs as a test replacement strategy (to replace liver biopsy) in making key decisions in the management of patients with CLDs; and (3) performance of specific VCTE-defined liver stiffness cutoffs as a triage test to identify patients with low likelihood of harboring high-risk esophageal varices (EVs) or having clinically significant portal hypertension (for presurgical risk stratification). This technical review does not address performance of other noninvasive modalities for assessing fibrosis (eg, acoustic radiation force pulse imaging or shear wave elastography) or steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter or magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction).

### Ν on-invasive screening for esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis [^117AF1Mk]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Elastography

At present, there are three different elastography techniques that measure liver and spleen stiffness. TE (FibroScan) uses a mechanical wave generated by a special transducer, while acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) and shear wave elastography (SWE) use sound waves. TE has technical limitations, of which the main ones are ascites, obesity, and narrow intercostal spaces. Although there are new probes that have improved TE in obese patients and patients with narrow intercostal spaces, such as children, TE remains unfeasible in patients with ascites. ARFI and SWE have partly overcome these limitations and have shown higher success rates. The diagnostic accuracy of all three methods is similar, but TE has been validated in more studies. The above methods have been used to correlate liver and spleen stiffness with the presence of varices.

Liver elastography

Liver stiffness has been proposed as a non-invasive surrogate marker for the presence of esophageal varices and many related studies have been conducted using TE, ARFI or SWE. The reported accuracy in most studies is satisfactory, although it is clear that both liver and spleen elastography are methods that only indirectly estimate the presence of varices, by evaluating the mechanical properties of the liver or spleen, and do not directly appreciate the hemodynamics related to the creation of varices. Nevertheless, a strong correlation between increased liver stiffness and the presence of large varices has been supported.

### A liver stiffness measurement-based, noninvasive prediction model for high-risk esophageal varices in B-viral liver cirrhosis [^116tdrqj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Periodic endoscopic screening for esophageal varices (EVs) and prophylactic treatment for high-risk EVs ((HEVs); (1) medium/large EVs and (2) small EVs with red sign or decompensated cirrhosis) are currently recommended for all cirrhotic patients. However, if a simple, noninvasive test is available, many low-risk patients may safely avoid endoscopy. We developed and validated a new liver stiffness measurement (LSM)-based prediction model for HEVs.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 280 consecutive B-viral cirrhosis patients from 2005 to 2007 (training set) and 121 from 2007 to 2008 (validation set). All underwent laboratory workups, endoscopy, LSM, and ultrasonography. For detection of HEVs, univariate and multivariate analysis were performed, using chi2-test/t-test and logistic regression, respectively. A prediction model was derived from multivariate predictors.

Results

In the training set, 90 had HEVs, and multivariate analysis showed significant differences in LSM, spleen diameter, and platelet count between patients with and without HEVs. We developed LSM-spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS): LSM × spleen diameter/platelet count. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) in the training set was 0.954. At LSPS < 3.5, 94.0% negative predictive value (NPV) was provided (184 patients), whereas 94.2% positive predictive value (PPV) was achieved (69 patients) at LSPS > 5.5. Overall, the likelihood of HEVs was correctly diagnosed in 253 patients (90.3%). Its predictive values were maintained at similar accuracy in subsequent validation set (AUROC = 0.953; 94.7% NPV/93.3% PPV at cutoff 3.5/5.5, respectively).

Conclusions

LSPS is a reliable, noninvasive method for detection of HEVs. Patients with LSPS < 3.5 may avoid endoscopy safely, whereas those with LSPS > 5.5 should be considered for appropriate prophylactic treatments.

### Gall bladder wall thickening as non-invasive screening parameter for esophageal varices-a comparative endoscopic-sonographic study [^111MK9a3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients with compensated liver cirrhosis have a chance of up to 40% to develop EV. To avoid hemorrhage from EV, it is recommended to perform an upper endoscopy as soon as there are signs for the presence of liver cirrhosis in patients. Therefore, many patients undergo upper endoscopy although they do not require treatment of EV (e.g. ligation) according to endoscopic classifications. While diagnostic gastroscopy itself is of low risk, low platelet counts as well as impaired coagulation parameters increase the risk of complications. Most patients prefer sedation during the procedure which is associated with additional risks. Therefore, more accurate non-invasive parameters for the presence of EV could be a valuable and clinically relevant tool. We based our study on non-invasive, standard diagnostic tests, which are routinely performed in patients with chronic liver disease: ultrasound, clinical and laboratory results were evaluated in terms of prediction of EV.

Because of its portal-venous blood supply, we assumed that the GBWT may predict the presence of portal hypertension and EV. An interesting study by Maruyama et al. also reported a lower sensitivity of 62% regarding the detection of large esophageal varices using the platelet count to spleen diameter ratio in 229 cirrhosis patients. In this study, the authors showed that a diameter of the left gastric vein -as a non-variceal collateral- of more than 5.35 mm had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 62% for presence of large esophageal varices. Its sonographic detection was associated with a sensitivity of 84% for any esophageal varices and a sensitivity of 100% for large varices. However, further prospective studies are required to assess the value of portal vein velocity as non-invasive parameter for the presence of esophageal varices.

### Noninvasive assessment oesophageal varices: impact of the baveno VI criteria [^116GUWkd]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In 2015, as a consequence of the high development in noninvasive tests, Baveno VI consensus recommended for the first time the use of a prediction rule (liver stiffness < 20kPa and platelet count > 150000) to identify patients at low risk of having varices and that could circumvent endoscopy. These became known as the Baveno VI criteria. We review here the data validating Baveno VI criteria and we discuss the attempts of expanding these criteria.

Recent Findings

We report 28 studies assessing the performance of Baveno VI criteria showing a pooled 99% negative predictive value for ruling out high-risk varices. Performance is not affected by the cause of cirrhosis. Different attempts at expanding these criteria show suboptimal performance. Nonelastography-based criteria require further validation.

Summary

Baveno VI criteria can be safely used to avoid endoscopy in a substantial proportion of patients with compensated cirrhosis. The progressive change in approach to the management of compensated cirrhosis, progressively focusing on treating portal hypertension with beta-blockers independently of the presence of varices, might render these criteria less relevant.

However, platelet count/GBWT ratio (cut-off > 46.2) achieves a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 86%. The positive predictive value is 76% and the negative predictive value 87% (Table 5). Using our dataset, ROC analysis showed that the platelet count/GBWT ratio performed at a comparable level (area under the curve (AUC) 0.864 (confidence interval (CI) 0.809–0.919)) to the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio of 909 (AUC 0.841 (CI 0.782–0.901)) that was reported by Giannini et al.

### Non-invasive assessment of esophageal and fundic varices in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^112k1ky8]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The Baveno VII consensus recommends endoscopic screening for varicose veins in cases of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥ 20 kPa or platelet count ≤ 150 × 10⁹/L. Whether this approach was appropriate for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) remains uncertain. This study expanded the observed risk factors by adding analysis of ultrasound images as a non-invasive tool to predict the risk of esophageal or fundic varices.

Methods

We enrolled 111 patients with PBC whose complete ultrasound images, measurement data, and LSM data were available. The value of the periportal hypoechoic band (PHB), splenic area, and LSM in determining the risk of varicose veins and variceal rupture was analyzed. A prospective cohort of 67 patients provided external validation.

Results

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting varicose veins using LSM > 12.1 kPa or splenic areas > 41.2 cm 2 was 0.806 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.720–0.875) and 0.852 (95% CI: 0.772–0.912), respectively. This finding could assist in avoiding endoscopic screening by 76.6% and 83.8%, respectively, with diagnostic accuracy surpassing that suggested by Baveno VII guidelines. The AUCs for predicting variceal rupture using splenic areas > 56.8 cm 2 was 0.717 (95% CI: 0.623–0.798). The diagnostic accuracy of PHB for variceal rupture was higher than LSM and splenic areas (75.7% vs. 50.5% vs. 68.5%).

Conclusion

We recommend LSM > 12.1 kPa as a cutoff value to predict the risk of varicosity presence in patients with PBC. Additionally, the splenic area demonstrated high accuracy and relevance for predicting varicose veins and variceal rupture, respectively. The method is simple and reproducible, allowing endoscopy to be safely avoided.

Clinical relevance statement

The measurement of the splenic area and identification of the periportal hypoechoic band (PHB) on ultrasound demonstrated high accuracy and relevance for predicting the risk of esophageal or fundic varices presence and variceal rupture, respectively.

Key Points

Predicting varices in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) can reduce the morbidity and mortality of gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
Transient elastography (TE) and ultrasound play an important role in predicting patients with PBC with varices.
TE and ultrasound can predict varicose veins and variceal rupture. Liver stiffness measurement and splenic area measurements can allow endoscopy to be safely avoided.

Search results and study characteristics

The flow chart summarizing the literature screening is illustrated in Fig. 1. A total of 379 initial articles were identified with the predefined search strategies; after 146 duplicates were removed, 165 irrelevant studies were further eliminated; 68 studies were left for further evaluation. Of these, 36 articles were excluded after full-text review for the following reasons: undesirable article types, not diagnostic accuracy study, not relevant to CLD, small sample size (fewer than 30 participants), insufficient data (TP, FP, TN, and FN not reported or could not be calculated), and not in English. Ultimately, 32 articles estimating the accuracy of SSM for the diagnosis of PH and/or EV were included.

Fig. 1
Flow chart of study selection process

According to different gold standards (HVPG and EGD), the detailed characteristics of the 32 studies were summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. A total of 3952 patients with an average age of 58.8 were investigated. The 32 original articles included 15 prospective studies, 4 retrospective studies, and 13 cross-sectional studies. The results of quality assessment of the studies are shown in Fig. 2. Most studies were identified as low-risk for risk of bias and applicability concerns, with all of the studies satisfying four or more of the seven total domains (Supplementary Table 1).

AGA Institute guideline — vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) for triaging endoscopy in suspected compensated cirrhosis: The AGA suggests a VCTE cutoff of 19.5 kPa to assess the need for esophagogastroduodenoscopy to identify high risk esophageal varices (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence), and notes that patients with VCTE < 19.5 kPa who place a low value on the inconvenience and risks of endoscopy, and a high value on avoiding the small risk of acute variceal hemorrhage, may reasonably select to undergo screening endoscopy. Only studies using a cutoff of 19.5 (± 2) kPa were included, and using this threshold to rule out high-risk esophageal varices may misclassify 0.6% of low-risk and approximately 2.2% of high-risk patients; patients with decompensated cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis with known esophageal varices or portal hypertension were not considered and endoscopic evaluation should be pursued in these patients without consideration of the VCTE cutoff. Guidelines of the Baveno VI Consensus Workshop further support risk stratification with a VCTE cutoff of < 20 kPa and platelet count > 150,000/μL.

### Role of liver transient elastography in detecting cirrhosis with esophageal and gastric varices and evaluating variceal severity [^114SmYjT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of imaging indexes to assess cirrhosis combined with EGV

Portal vein ID, blood velocity, and liver stiffness values showed well diagnostic efficacy in cirrhosis with EGV, and liver stiffness values were the best in evaluating cirrhosis with EGV (P < 0.05), as shown in Table 6; Fig. 1. The disparity in TE thresholds between our study and prior work highlights the importance of context-specific cut-offs. While 19.2 kPa effectively identifies high-risk varices in advanced cirrhosis, our lower threshold (6.46 kPa) targets early portal hypertension in compensated disease, aligning with the study's preventive focus.

Table 6

Efficacy of liver stiffness values in assessing the degree of cirrhosis with EGV

Liver stiffness values were more effective in assessing the degree of varices in cirrhosis combined with EGV and the best in diagnosing cirrhosis combined with severe EGV (P < 0.05), as shown in Table 7; Fig. 2. The imaging picture is shown in Fig. 3. The lower AUC for moderate EGV underscores a limitation of TE in differentiating transitional disease stages. Moderate varices likely represent a pathophysiologically heterogeneous group where liver stiffness alone is insufficient for precise classification. Future studies should integrate TE with clinical parameters (e.g. platelet count, hepatic venous pressure gradient) to refine risk stratification for moderate EG.

### Splenic stiffness does not predict esophageal varices in children with portal hypertension [^1116qbBS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate ultrasound parameters, particularly splenic stiffness, as predictors of pediatric esophageal varices.

Methods

We included all children aged 0–19 years who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, for variceal screening or surveillance, and abdominopelvic ultrasound with splenic elastography measurement. We also recorded biological parameters (platelets count, albumin) to determine a clinical prediction rule (CPR). Derivation and validation cohorts were defined according to measurement date. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) statistics and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the optimal threshold value were calculated, and used to assess the performance of each parameter.

Results

Eighty derivation cohort children and 58 validation cohort children formed the study sample. Cohort characteristics did not differ for age, sex, distribution of varices but differ for some etiologies, abdominal surgery, spleen size, splenic stiffness measurement (SSM), ascites, and the presence of spontaneous portosystemic shunts. In the derivation cohort, splenic stiffness was the best independent predictor of esophageal varices, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.83, a sensitivity of 0.90, and specificity of 0.73 at a threshold of 22kPa. In the validation cohort, SSM was no longer significantly associated with esophageal varices at endoscopy, had a lower sensitivity of 0.26, and no other threshold could be found. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and CPR had a correct predictive value (AUC 0.70 for LSM; 0.78 for CPR in the derivation cohort and 0.64 for LSM; 0.71 for CPR in the validation cohort) for esophageal varices.

Conclusions

SSM cannot be used as a single parameter to predict esophageal varices. LSM and CPR despite their lower AUC appear to much more robust measures with consistent results across cohorts.

### Gall bladder wall thickening as non-invasive screening parameter for esophageal varices-a comparative endoscopic-sonographic study [^113cgzjf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The mortality due to hemorrhage of esophageal varices (EV) is still high. The predominant cause for EV is liver cirrhosis, which has a high prevalence in Western Europe. Therefore, non-invasive screening markers for the presence of EV are of interest. Here, we aim to investigate whether non-inflammatory gall bladder wall thickening (GBWT) may serve as predictor for the presence of EV in comparison and combination with other non-invasive clinical and laboratory parameters.

Methods

One hundred ninety four patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study. Abdominal ultrasound, upper endoscopy and blood tests were evaluated. GBWT, spleen size and the presence of ascites were evaluated by ultrasound. Platelet count and Child-Pugh-score were also recorded. The study population was categorized in two groups: 122 patients without esophageal varices (non EV) compared to 72 patients with EV were analyzed by uni-and multivariate analysis.

Results

In the EV group 46% showed a non-inflammatory GBWT of ≥ 4 mm, compared to 12% in the non-EV group (p < 0.01). GBWT was significantly higher in EV patients compared to the non-EV group (mean: 4.4 mm vs. 2.8 mm, p < 0.0001), and multivariate analysis confirmed GBWT as independent predictor for EV (p < 0.04). The platelets/GBWT ratio (cut-off > 46.2) had a sensitivity and specificity of 78 and 86%, PPV 76% and NPV of 87%, and ROC analysis calculated the AUC of 0.864 (CI 0.809–0.919).

Conclusions

GBWT occurs significantly more often in patients with EV. However, because of the low sensitivity, combination with other non-invasive parameters such as platelet count is recommended.

### Non-invasive assessment of esophageal and fundic varices in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^117DadBJ]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Based on the Baveno VII consensus, using LSM ≥ 20 kPa or PLT ≤ 150 × 10 9 /L as diagnostic thresholds resulted in an AUC of 0.883. This showed an increase in the rates of diagnostic accuracy by 11.7% (13/111), 4.5% (5/111), and 15.3% (17/111) compared with the diagnostic thresholds of LSM > 12.1 kPa, splenic area > 41.2 cm 2, and PHB, respectively. This also demonstrated the relatively high accuracy of a threshold splenic area of > 41.2 cm 2 and Baveno VII consensus for predicting varices, whereas there was no significant difference in diagnostic efficacy (p = 0.4517) (Table 3 and Fig. 3).

Predictors of high risk of variceal rupture

In the study cohort, 16.2% (18/111) of patients with PBC experienced rupture and hemorrhage of esophageal or fundic varices. The incidence of PHB was higher in the hemorrhage group (F1) than in the non-hemorrhage group (F0) (88.9% vs. 49.5%, p < 0.001), with grade 3 esophageal varices accounting for 88.9% of the patients (16/18) and grade 3 gastric varices for 0%, indicating that esophageal varices were more likely to lead to rupture and hemorrhage. The risk factors associated with variceal rupture and hemorrhage included age, LSM, splenic area, PHB, alanine aminotransferase, white blood cell count, and PLT. After adjusting for potential confounders, only PHB was strongly associated with the development of esophageal or fundic variceal rupture and hemorrhage (odds ratio (OR) = 8.174, 95% CI: 1.779–37.566, p = 0.007) (Table 4).

### Usefulness of noninvasive methods including assessment of liver stiffness by 2-dimensional shear wave elastography for predicting esophageal varices [^112pqJWB]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to predict the presence of esophageal varices (EVs) by noninvasive tools combined with 2-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and to compare the diagnostic capabilities of 2D-SWE with those of transient elastography (TE).

Methods

Between January 2015 and December 2017, 289 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) who underwent consecutive 2D-SWE and EGD were enrolled. Capabilities for predicting the presence of EVs of 2D-SWE and models combining 2D-SWE with other noninvasive tools (modified LS-spleen-diameter-to-platelet-ratio score [mLSPS], platelet-spleen ratio score) were compared. A subgroup analysis was performed on 177 patients who also underwent simultaneous TE.

Results

The area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROCs) for detecting EVs for 2D-SWE alone vs. mLSPS, which included 2D-SWE, were 0.757 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.701–0.810) and 0.813 (95% CI, 0.763-.857), respectively. The AUROCs for predicting varices needing treatment (VNT) for 2D-SWE and mLSPS were 0.712 (95% CI, 0.621–0.738) and 0.834 (95% CI, 0.785–0.875), respectively. For the 195 patients who underwent simultaneous TE and 2D-SWE, no differences in diagnostic performance were observed.

Conclusions

The diagnostic performance of 2D-SWE is similar to that of TE for predicting the presence of EVs. The mLSPS, which includes 2D-SWE, seemed to be useful for predicting EVs.

### Platelet count / spleen diameter ratio to predict the presence of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis: a systematic review [^114fhUAD]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Esophageal variceal bleeding remains the leading cause of acute mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Platelet count to spleen diameter (PC/SD) ratio less than 909 is one of several parameters proposed for the noninvasive prediction of esophageal varices. The aim of this study is to systematically review the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the 909 ratio.

Methods

We identified relevant studies from a MEDLINE search and performed a meta-analysis to estimate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) using Meta-Disc software.

Results

Eight studies met the inclusion criteria and included a total of 1275 patients. Meta-analysis yielded a pooled sensitivity of 89% [95% confidence interval (CI) 87–92%; I2 statistic 92.9%] and a pooled specificity of 74% (95% CI 70–78%; I2 statistic 94.5%). The pooled positive LR was 3.5 (95% CI 1.92–6.25; I2 statistic 94.0%) and the pooled negative LR was 0.12 (95% CI 0.05–0.32; I2 statistic 90.8%). The quality of the evidence as assessed by the GRADE methodology was low.

Conclusion

In its present form, the test characteristics of PC/SD ratio of 909 may not be adequate to completely replace esophagogastroduodenoscopy as a noninvasive screening tool for esophageal varices, given the low grade of evidence. However, it may be potentially useful as part of a prediction rule incorporating other clinical characteristics or varying PC/SD cutoffs. When compared with other noninvasive predictor tools, the PC/SD ratio is elegant, simple, and inexpensive. With some minor modifications, it may become a helpful tool to limit the number of endoscopies in primary prophylaxis to be performed in patients with portal hypertension.

### Ν on-invasive screening for esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis [^111usRei]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Spleen elastography

Spleen elastography has emerged lately as a new approach for the detection of esophageal varices, with several studies showing high accuracy. Although it is not included in the BAVENO VI guidelines, it has been reported to be superior to liver elastography in several studies that compared both methods in the same group of patients, with the limitation that it is not an accurate predictor for the presence of varices in alcohol-related cirrhosis. The superiority of spleen elastography compared to liver elastography has been validated in a recent meta-analysis by Ma et al, who reported a pooled sensitivity of 88% vs. 83% and a pooled specificity of 78% vs. 66%, respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio of spleen stiffness (25.73) was significantly higher than that of liver stiffness (9.54). A high negative predictive value could be achieved with a cutoff value of 18.9 kPa, even in a study that showed the method to have only moderate accuracy. When combined with liver elastography it can reach a negative predictive value of 100%, important to define the group of patients that can avoid EGD. Only two studies have reported moderate accuracy of spleen elastography for the detection of varices.

The technical limitations of liver elastography also apply to spleen elastography. Dedicated devices or software are required, and obesity and ascites may not allow reliable measurements to be obtained. Moreover, because of the small spleen size in some patients, it may be difficult for the operator to obtain good imaging of the splenic parenchyma.

In conclusion, spleen elastography appears to be a reliable method with high negative predictive value for the presence of varices. Further evaluation, especially in combination with platelet count and liver elastography, may allow the use of spleen elastography in the future as a screening test, so that EGD can be avoided in patients with negative spleen elastography results.

### Role of liver transient elastography in detecting cirrhosis with esophageal and gastric varices and evaluating variceal severity [^115NyTZL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

With the increasing incidence of hepatitis B in recent years, the number of patients with cirrhosis combined with EGV has also increased significantly. EGV rupture and bleeding are common clinical complications in patients with cirrhosis. In patients with cirrhosis, the portal vein pressure increases significantly, which causes abnormal changes in the blood flow of the portal venous system. Then, increased lumen pressure of the main portal vein and collateral circulation lead to the portal vein hypertension, causing exacerbation of the disease and even leading to severe death. Therefore, the accurate and effective identification and diagnosis of cirrhosis with EGV at an early stage are crucial to improving patients' survival rate and prognosis. Previous studies have mostly taken endoscopy and liver percutaneous biopsy for early diagnosis of cirrhosis with EGV. However, gastroscopy and needle biopsy are invasive procedures, with poor patient acceptance and great clinical limitations. Liver TE is an emerging imaging technology and with advantage of being non-invasive, rapid, and objective, avoiding the defects of traditional examinations. This study explored the role and value of liver TE in the diagnosis of cirrhosis combined with EGV and the evaluation of the degree of varices, hoping to provide more feasible methods for the early diagnosis of the disease.

Conclusions

Transient elastography might be a new noninvasive, inexpensive method for detecting the presence of EV/GV in children with BA. In addition, basic physical examination, routine biochemical and hematological tests, are still worthwhile and correlate well with the presence of EV/GV in patients with BA post portoenterostomy.

### The endoscopic ultrasound probe findings in prediction of esophageal variceal recurrence after endoscopic variceal eradication therapies in cirrhotic patients: a cohort prospective study [^117EBkFP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The end-points and follow-up protocol

During the follow-up period, endoscopy and clinical data were collected once every six months, while CT images were reviewed once a year. The endpoints of follow-up were recurrence of esophageal varices, or rebleeding from esophageal varices or follow-ups to 3 years, liver transplantion or TIPS, and death. The criteria of recurrence of esophageal varices were defined as moderate esophageal varices, or mild varicose vein with red sign needed to be treated by endoscopy (Fig. 1 d-e). The cirrhotic etiology and complications of portal hypertension were treated following the guidelines. Non-selective beta-blockers, however, were not used during follow-up period. Observation period was defined as the time interval between the end of the endoscopic treatment and the time of the endpoint.

Statistical analysis

IBM SPSS 22 statistical software was used to statistical analysis. The quantitative data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The student t test and ANOVA for unpaired data were applied to compare differences between groups. The qualitative data were analyzed by the chi-square test or the Fisher's exact probability test. Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the correlation between multiple variables. The Kaplan–Meier estimator and log-rank test was used to analyze the survival. A P value less than 0.05 (two-way) was considered statistically significant.

### Risk of esophageal variceal bleeding based on endoscopic ultrasound evaluation of the sum of esophageal variceal cross-sectional surface area [^112UwA3K]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of future variceal bleeding, based on the endoscopic ultrasound measurement of the sum of the cross-sectional surface area (CSA) of all of the esophageal varices in the distal esophagus.

Methods

Twenty-eight patients with portal hypertension and esophageal varices, but no prior history of variceal bleeding, were evaluated using endoscopic ultrasound (20-MHz ultrasound probe, Microvasive, Boston, MA; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The entire esophagus was imaged, and an image was selected at a point where the varices appeared the largest. This image was digitized, and the sum of the CSA of all of the varices was measured (Image Pro Plus, Silver Springs, MD) by an investigator blinded to the patients' clinical status. The follow-up time for each patient was calculated (time to first bleed, time to liver transplantation, time to death, or time to the end of study). The Cox Proportional Hazards Model was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the sums of the CSA in the patients who bled compared with those who did not bleed. An OR was calculated to determine the risk of future variceal bleeding based on the sum of the CSA as measured in cm(2)/month. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated for future variceal bleeding.

Results

Six of 28 patients (21%) experienced esophageal variceal bleeding on follow-up. The mean CSA ± SEM of the sum of the esophageal varices in these patients was 0.77 cm(2) ± 0.31 cm(2) (range 0.07–2.09 cm(2)). The mean time to bleeding was 15.5 months ± 4.95 months (range 1–29 months). Twenty-two of 28 patients (79%) did not experience variceal bleeding. The mean CSA ± SEM of the sum of the varices in these patients was 0.36 cm(2) ± 0.08 cm(2) (range 0.02–1.19 cm(2)). The mean time to follow-up was 35.7 months ± 6.69 months (range 1.2–103.2 months). The sum of the CSA between the patients who bleed and those who did not bleed was significantly different at the p < 0.018 level. The OR for the risk of variceal bleeding for each one cm(2) difference in the sum of the CSA per month was 6.34. Using a cutoff of 0.45 cm(2), the sensitivity and specificity for future variceal bleeding was 83% and 75%, respectively.

Conclusions

There is a significant difference (p < 0.018) in the sum of the esophageal variceal CSA between those patients who will experience future variceal bleeding and those who will not. There is a 76-fold increase per year in the risk of future variceal bleeding for each one cm(2) increase in variceal CSA. Using a cutoff value for the CSA of 0.45 cm(2), the sensitivity and specificity for future variceal bleeding above and below this point is 83% and 75%, respectively.

### Non-invasive assessment of esophageal and fundic varices in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^111221U7]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The Baveno VII consensus recommends endoscopic screening for varicose veins in cases of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥ 20kPa or platelet count ≤ 150×10 9 /L. Whether this approach was appropriate for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) remains uncertain. This study expanded the observed risk factors by adding analysis of ultrasound images as a non-invasive tool to predict the risk of esophageal or fundic varices.

Methods

We enrolled 111 patients with PBC whose complete ultrasound images, measurement data, and LSM data were available. The value of the periportal hypoechoic band (PHB), splenic area, and LSM in determining the risk of varicose veins and variceal rupture was analyzed. A prospective cohort of 67 patients provided external validation.

Results

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting varicose veins using LSM > 12.1kPa or splenic areas > 41.2cm 2 was 0.806 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.720–0.875) and 0.852 (95% CI: 0.772–0.912), respectively. This finding could assist in avoiding endoscopic screening by 76.6% and 83.8%, respectively, with diagnostic accuracy surpassing that suggested by Baveno VII guidelines. The AUCs for predicting variceal rupture using splenic areas > 56.8cm 2 was 0.717 (95% CI: 0.623–0.798). The diagnostic accuracy of PHB for variceal rupture was higher than LSM and splenic areas (75.7% vs. 50.5% vs. 68.5%).

Conclusion

We recommend LSM > 12.1kPa as a cutoff value to predict the risk of varicosity presence in patients with PBC. Additionally, the splenic area demonstrated high accuracy and relevance for predicting varicose veins and variceal rupture, respectively. The method is simple and reproducible, allowing endoscopy to be safely avoided.

Clinical Relevance Statement

The measurement of the splenic area and identification of the periportal hypoechoic band (PHB) on ultrasound demonstrated high accuracy and relevance for predicting the risk of esophageal or fundic varices presence and variceal rupture, respectively.

Key Points

Predicting varices in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) can reduce the morbidity and mortality of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Transient elastography (TE) and ultrasound play an important role in predicting patients with PBC with varices. TE and ultrasound can predict varicose veins and variceal rupture. Liver stiffness measurement and splenic area measurements can allow endoscopy to be safely avoided.

### Bidimensional shear wave spleen elastography for diagnosis and grading of esophageal varices in children with portal hypertension [^117RWWLQ]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Portal hypertension in children can result from a wide range of liver diseases, both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic. Non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices, a potentially life-threatening complication, is of utmost importance in these patients.

Objective

To assess the agreement between spleen stiffness by bidimensional shear wave elastography (2D SWE) and endoscopic findings (presence and grading of esophageal varices) in pediatric patients with portal hypertension.

Materials and Methods

Single-center retrospective observational study between February 2021 and August 2024. Data from pediatric patients (< 18 years old) who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy within a month of a grayscale ultrasound including spleen elastography were collected. Patients were divided into three groups: varices-free, low-risk varices, and high-risk varices (enlarged tortuous varices with red color sign, or large size varices). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were estimated.

Results

We included 163 patients (86 males, 77 females; median age: 9 years (interquartile range (IQR) 6–13 years)). The sample included 80 varices-free (49%), 38 low-risk varices (23%), and 45 high-risk varices (28%) cases. The median spleen elastography was 20 kPa (2.58 m/s), 34 kPa (3.36 m/s), and 40 kPa (3.65 m/s) in the varices-free, low-risk, and high-risk varices groups, respectively. When a cut-off value of 28.5 kPa (3.08 m/s) was used to detect varices of any grade, the sensitivity was 93% (95% confidence interval: 85–97), the specificity was 94% (86–98), PPV 94% (86–98), and NPV 93% (85–97). An AUROC of 0.93 (0.90–0.98) was obtained. When comparing the high versus low-risk varices groups, using a cut-off point of 35.35 kPa (3.43 m/s), we obtained an AUROC of 0.66, with a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 61%, PPV 68%, and NPV of 64%.

Conclusion

Spleen stiffness by bidimensional shear wave elastography showed excellent diagnostic performance for detecting esophageal varices in children with portal hypertension and a moderate performance for distinguishing patients with low-risk varices from those with high-risk varices.

### Gall bladder wall thickening as non-invasive screening parameter for esophageal varices-a comparative endoscopic-sonographic study [^113JnLTo]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Patient characteristics

A total of 194 patients were included in this study, of whom 84 were female and 110 were male. The average age of the patients at time of ultrasound examination was 57 years (range: 17–85 years). The main cause of hepatic disease was alcohol abuse (n = 51), followed by unknown cause of liver illness (n = 38) and viral hepatitis B and C (n = 35). The underlying liver diseases are summarized in Fig. 1. The patients were divided into two groups: 122 patients without EV (referred to as "non-EV" group) and 72 patients with EV in endoscopic diagnostic examination (referred to as "EV" group). Of those with EV 31 patients had 1° varices, 32 patients had 2° and further 9 patients had 3° varices. Interestingly, male patients were significantly more often represented in the EV group (73.6% EV group vs. 46.7% non-EV group; p < 0.001), potentially reflecting the high percentage (46%) of patients with alcohol abuse in the EV group. Histology of the liver was available in 53% of all patients (n = 102), and in those, cirrhosis was confirmed in 63% (n = 22) in the EV-group, and 19% (n = 13) in the non-EV group. As expected, hypertensive gastropathy, advanced Child Pugh Score and presence of ascites occurred significantly more frequently in the EV group. The patient characteristics disease severities are summarized in Table 1.

### Diagnostic performance of shear wave elastography for predicting esophageal varices in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis [^117SQX4f]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of shear wave elastography (SWE) for predicting the presence of esophageal varices and high-risk esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis and to compare it with other nonspecific predictors and according to the presence of splenomegaly.

Methods

Clinical data from 103 patients with compensated cirrhosis who underwent sonography, SWE, and endoscopy were collected consecutively. Liver stiffness was measured by SWE. Comparisons of the accuracy of prediction between groups were made by areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs), and regression analyses were performed for the multiple variables related to the presence of esophageal varices and high-risk varices.

Results

The optimal cutoff values for predicting the presence of esophageal varices and high-risk varices were 13.9 and 16.1 kPa, respectively. The AUROC of liver stiffness for prediction of esophageal varices was significantly higher than the AUROCs of platelet count, spleen diameter, and platelet count/spleen diameter ratio (P = 0.025; P = 0.001; P = 0.027). For predicting esophageal varices in patients without splenomegaly, the AUROC of liver stiffness was higher than that of the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, liver stiffness and the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio were independent predictors of esophageal varices (P < .001; P = 0.038). For the presence of high-risk varices, only liver stiffness was a statistically significant independent predictor (P = 0.012).

Conclusions

In patients with compensated cirrhosis, liver stiffness measured by SWE is a new effective noninvasive diagnostic tool for predicting the presence of esophageal varices. It is more accurate than the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, especially in patients without splenomegaly. In addition, the SWE value was the only effective independent factor for predicting high-risk esophageal varices.

### Ν on-invasive screening for esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis [^116TmE1k]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In the only study directly comparing CT with the platelet/spleen diameter ratio, CT proved to have higher sensitivity and specificity. This method is better tolerated than endoscopy and more readily accepted by patients, even in studies where air insufflation was used before performing CT. Moreover, CT can be simultaneously used as a screening method for HCC and varices in cirrhotic patients. The main disadvantage of CT is the radiation dose, although, considering the high mean age of cirrhotic patients, the benefits are likely to outweigh the risk of radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The cost of the method is higher compared to other non-invasive methods, but lower compared to endoscopy. Additionally, intravenous contrast injection is required, which may be contraindicated in patients with impaired renal function or allergy to iodine.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI has been evaluated for the detection of esophageal varices, but to a lesser extent compared to CT. Direct visualization of esophageal varices by MRI is more challenging than with CT and movement artifacts are much more common. There are reports that detection of varices is feasible. Intravenous injection of gadolinium yielded enhanced results. The reported accuracy is not high (with a sensitivity of less than 81%) and in fact appears to be inferior to the accuracy of CT.

Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) has been used to grade the severity of cirrhosis, with the advantage of full organ coverage and low variability for stiffness measurement. Excellent interscan reproducibility and inter-reader agreement have been shown. Liver stiffness calculation by MRE with or without contrast-enhanced MRI reached sensitivities of 88.9% and 96% and specificities of 56.4% and 60%, respectively. False-positive results are usually related to the presence of other portosystemic collaterals and false-negative results can occur because of iron deposition in the liver and the presence of large volume ascites. In a study by Morisaka et al, MRE was able to discriminate the presence or absence of varices, but failed to distinguish patients with large varices from patients with small varices. Spleen stiffness measured by MRE has been shown to be more strongly correlated with the presence of large varices than with liver stiffness. Available data have not demonstrated a clear benefit from the use of MRE compared to ultrasound elastography. Additionally, the cost and duration of the examination are higher, and the equipment required is not available in most departments.

### Comparative diagnostic efficacy of two-dimensional shear wave and transient elastography in predicting the risk of esophagogastric varices and histological staging in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^116V5WQ1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Liver biopsy is the gold standard for assessing the extent of liver fibrosis. Nevertheless, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) suggests refraining from liver biopsy for PBC diagnosis unless specific PBC antibodies are absent or other complications coexist. Transient elastography (TE) surpasses biochemical markers in discerning significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis. While TE offers convenient, rapid, and reliable diagnosis, its efficacy can be compromised by factors such as transaminase levels and ascites. Specifically, the failure rate can surpass 20% in individuals with a high body mass index (BMI). Hence, there is a pressing clinical need for a noninvasive diagnostic tool to complement TE. Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) emerges as another noninvasive method for assessing liver fibrosis. Unlike other SWE technologies, such as Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse and point Shear Wave Elastography, 2D-SWE employs rapid and continuous acoustic radiation force excitation at multiple points along the longitudinal axis to measure shear wave velocity, which is translated into liver stiffness values as Young's modulus and used to generate quantitative elastograms. Compared with TE, 2D-SWE facilitates an easier identification of regions of interest (ROIs) under two-dimensional ultrasound visualization, circumventing the influence of large blood vessels, bile ducts, and lesions on liver stiffness values. Consequently, 2D-SWE offers more precise and reliable measurements of liver stiffness. Yan et al. demonstrated the commendable diagnostic performance of 2D-SWE in tracking disease progression in PBC. While, research has indicated that SWE outperforms TE in detecting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis, though its status as a viable alternative to TE remains unverified. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the diagnostic efficacy of 2D-SWE and TE in evaluating histological staging in PBC, with the intent of introducing a non-invasive assessment method that can complement TE in clinical practice. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic efficacy of the risk of esophagogastric varices and histological staging in PBC, with the intent of introducing a non-invasive assessment method that can complement TE in clinical practice.

### The endoscopic ultrasound probe findings in prediction of esophageal variceal recurrence after endoscopic variceal eradication therapies in cirrhotic patients: a cohort prospective study [^111GjT5Q]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Demographic and clinical characteristics

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study subjects are summarized in Table 1. The patients aged 28–75 years old, with 100 males and 53 females. Of these, 54 patients were treated with EVL, 80 patients were given EIS, and 19 cases received EVL and EIS in combination. The mean course of endoscopic treatment was 2.7. Among the 153 patients with varices in the esophagus, a majority of the patients (134 cases) had liver cirrhosis alone, while 19 patients had liver cirrhosis and cancer. The etiological factors of liver cirrhosis were also presented in Table 1.

Table 1
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study patients

Notably, during the 3 years follow-up period, recurrence of esophageal varices occurred as high as 93.5% (143/153) patients, whereas considerably low non-recurrence rate at 6.5% (10/153) was observed after endoscopic eradication esophageal varices. The recurrent esophageal varice revealed 58.2%, 35.3% within 1, 3 years, respectively, following the endoscopic esophageal varice eradication (Fig. 4 a). The mean time of recurrence of esophageal varices was 13.4 months.

### Non-invasive predictors of the presence of large oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis [^115GsKK5]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

The usual clinical practice is to screen all patients with established cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis by upper endoscopy for the presence of varices. Patients with large varices should be treated with non-selective beta blockers to reduce the incidence of first variceal bleeding. However, fewer than 50% of cirrhotic patients have varices at screening endoscopy and most have small sized varices, with a low risk of bleeding. The aim of the present study was to determine whether clinical or laboratory non-endoscopic parameters could predict the presence of large oesophageal varices.

Patients/Methods

Seventeen variables considered relevant to the prevalence of oesophageal varices were tested in 184 patients with cirrhosis, who underwent screening endoscopy. Small varices were regarded as those which flatten with insufflation or slightly protrude into the lumen, while large varices are those which protrude into the lumen or touch each other. None of the patients was on beta blockers or other vasoactive drugs or had a history of variceal bleeding.

Results

Oesophageal varices were present in 92 patients (50%), and large varices in 33 patients (17.9%). Variables associated with the presence of large oesophageal varices on univariate analysis were the presence of ascites and splenomegaly either by clinical examination or by ultrasound (p < 0.01), the presence of spiders (p = 0.02), platelet count (p < 0.0001), and bilirubin (p = 0.01). Factors independently associated with the presence of large oesophageal varices on multivariate analysis were platelet count, size of spleen and presence of ascites by ultrasound. Using mean values as cut-off points, it is noteworthy that only five out of 39 patients (12.8%) with platelets ≥ 18(x 10(9)/l), spleen length ≤ 135 mm and no ascites had varices. Moreover, all these patients had small sized varices. On the other hand, 15 out of 18 patients (83.3%) with a platelet count < 118 x 10(9)/l, spleen length > 135 mm and ascites had varices. Moreover, five out of those 18 patients had large varices (28.3%).

Conclusion

Thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly and ascites are independent predictors of large oesophageal varices in cirrhotic patients. We suggest that endoscopy could be avoided safely in cirrhotic patients with none of these predictive factors, as large varices are absent in this group of patients.

### Transient elastography for predicting esophageal / gastric varices in children with biliary atresia [^114sPecT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Transient elastography (FibroScan) is an innovative, noninvasive, rapid, and reproducible technique to assess liver fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness in both adult and pediatric patients. The principle of the apparatus is employment of pulse-echo ultrasound acquisition to track the propagation of the shear wave and to measure its velocity. The relation between the velocity and the tissue stiffness is that the stiffer the tissue, the faster the shear wave propagates. Transient elastography has low intra- and inter-observer variability. However, the data on liver stiffness measurement in children with chronic liver diseases is still limited.

The purpose of this study has been to evaluate the accuracy of transient elastography and clinical parameters in predicting the presence of EV/GV in children with BA following portoenterostomy.

### Ν on-invasive screening for esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis [^115LNMby]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT)

CT is an imaging modality widely used in cirrhotic patients, vastly contributing to the diagnosis and management of the complications of cirrhosis, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CT allows direct visualization of esophageal varices after intravenous contrast administration, as serpiginous vessels that protrude in the lumen of the lower esophagus. CT also depicts portosystemic shunts in the abdomen, including periesophageal and perigastric veins. Although the detection of varices is usually straightforward, it can be challenging to discriminate submucosal from subserosal esophageal varices, and this can be the cause for false-positive and false-negative CT results.

CT has been compared to EGD in several studies. Two recent meta-analyses have shown a pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of esophageal varices of approximately 89.6% and 72.3%, and 87% and 80%, respectively. The sensitivity for the detection of large varices was high in all studies and the pooled sensitivity and specificity for large varices in a meta-analysis by Deng et al was 87% and 88%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value for the detection of large varices in the same meta-analysis was 86% and 90%, respectively.

CT can be a good alternative for the detection of varices in cirrhotic patients with HCC, already undergoing locoregional treatments. The effectiveness of the treatment and the presence of recurrence are evaluated by CT in these patients and Kim et al showed high sensitivity and specificity rates for the detection of esophageal varices (91.9% and 92.2%, respectively) without alteration of the CT protocol.

In the meta-analysis by Tseng et al it was suggested that CT technology (multidetector vs. < 16 detector CT) may be a reason for the variability among the published results. Nevertheless, the efficacy of standard thick-slice CT, especially for the detection of large varices, was demonstrated by two studies, without thin slice reconstruction adding accuracy. In addition, like ultrasonography, CT is also an operator-dependent method, but radiologist residents and endoscopists showed similar performance to specialized abdominal radiologists in the detection of large varices. Abdominal radiologists were more efficient in the detection of small varices compared to residents and endoscopists.

Results

General characteristics

In this study, 282 patients with PBC underwent EGD, 10 underwent splenectomy, two underwent TIPS, and two underwent splenic embolization. Esophageal or fundic varices were present in 217 patients (77.0%). Patients in the varices group were older (60 years vs. 50 years, p < 0.001) and had lower PLT (91 × 10⁹/L vs. 196 × 10⁹/L, p < 0.001). Symptoms of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage were present in 56 cases either previously or at the time of examination. Additionally, 85 patients (30.1%) presented with ultrasound manifestations associated with PH during the study period. Furthermore, 37 patients developed ascites, 32 developed a recanalized umbilical vein, 22 developed portosystemic collaterals, and 14 developed portal vein thrombosis. The demographic characteristics of the 111 patients with PBC ultimately included in the study are detailed in Table 1 and Fig. 1.

### The role of real-time ultrasonography in predicting esophageal varices in hemophiliacs co-infected with hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus [^111c4ru1]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Endoscopic procedures are the gold standard for the diagnosis of esophageal varices but these invasive methods are complex to perform in hemophilic patients co-infected with hepatitis C virus/human immunodeficiency virus (HCV/HIV). Real-time ultrasonography has been reported to be an effective, non-invasive procedure able to monitor patients with chronic liver disease and to give useful information for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and the presence of esophageal varices.

Design and Methods

Seventy patients with severe hemophilia were evaluated by esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGDS) and ultrasonography; 40 had HCV/HIV co-infection and 30, comparable for age and HCV exposure time, were HCV+/HIV-. Hepatic longitudinal diameter, splenic longitudinal diameter, portal vein diameter and the average speed of portal flow were measured. The congestion index was calculated.

Results

Thirteen out of 40 (32.5%) HCV/HIV coinfected patients had esophageal varices. None out of 30 HCV+/HIV- patients had esophageal varices (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis showed that the 13 HCV/HIV coinfected patients with esophageal varices had significantly higher hepatic longitudinal diameter (p = 0.006), splenic longitudinal diameter (p = 0.0002), portal vein diameter (p = 0.0005) and congestion index (p = 0.0001) than did the remaining 27 HCV/HIV coinfected patients. The stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that, of the various ultrasonographic parameters evaluated, splenic longitudinal diameter and portal vein diameter had the greatest diagnostic efficiency in diagnosing a high proportion of patients with esophageal varices. The diagnostic efficiency of the combined criterion expressed by the area under the ROC curve was 0.8803. Interpretation and Conclusions. Real-time ultrasonography, by evaluation of splenic longitudinal diameter and portal vein diameter, is an effective non-invasive technique able to classify correctly a large proportion of HCV/HIV co-infected hemophilic patients with esophageal varices.

### Noninvasive prediction of clinically significant portal hypertension and esophageal varices in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis [^117Gou7G]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to develop a model based on noninvasive variables for the prediction of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and of esophageal varices (EV) in patients with compensated liver disease.

Methods

Sixty patients with compensated liver cirrhosis diagnosed by histology were included in the training set. All patients had physical examination, laboratory tests, abdominal color-Doppler ultrasound, upper digestive tract endoscopy, and measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient. Predictive models for the presence of CSPH and of EV were calculated. The models were validated in an independent series of 74 patients with compensated liver disease.

Results

Clinical and laboratory variables were selected in the final models, while ultrasonography did not add statistical power for the prediction of CSPH and EV. The model for prediction of CSPH included albumin, INR, and ALT. The best cutoff had 93% sensitivity and 61% specificity in the training set, and correctly classified 77% of patients in the validation set. Spider angiomas, ALT, and albumin predicted EV. The best cutoff of the model in the training set had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 37% and correctly classified 72% of cases in the validation set.

Conclusions

Noninvasive prediction of EV in well-compensated cirrhotic patients is not accurate. However, a model obtained by combining simple laboratory variables has a high sensitivity to predict CSPH in this population and may be useful to select the subset of patients requiring screening endoscopy. By this method, endoscopic screening could be obviated in about 40% of patients.

### Liver stiffness measurement selects patients with cirrhosis at risk of bearing large oesophageal varices [^114zoF2M]. Journal of Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Periodic endoscopic screening for oesophageal varices is recommended in patients with cirrhosis, but might be limited to a subgroup of patients if a simple non-invasive test was available to select those at risk of bleeding.

Methods

We studied in 165 patients with cirrhosis the relation between the presence of oesophageal varices assessed by endoscopy, and liver stiffness measurement by Fibroscan, a non-invasive parameter related to liver fibrosis. The results were compared to those of other parameters reflecting portal hypertension, splenic size, platelet count, and platelet count/spleen size ratio.

Results

Liver stiffness measurement was correlated to the grade of oesophageal varices (r = 0.6, p < 0.0001). AUROC values of liver stiffness measurement were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78–0.90) for the presence of oesophageal varices and 0.83 (0.76–0.89) for varices grade ≥ II. Liver stiffness measurement value < 19 kPa was highly predictive of the absence of oesophageal varices grade ≥ II (Se: 84%, PPV: 47%, NPV: 93%).

Conclusions

Liver stiffness measurement allows to predict the presence of large oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis, and may help to select patients for endoscopic screening.

### Role of liver transient elastography in detecting cirrhosis with esophageal and gastric varices and evaluating variceal severity [^112HVPcH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging examination

All patients and healthy cases were examined using the liver TE (Echoesens, France). All subjects should be fasted for at least 3 h before the examination, rest for at least 20 min, and be advised to remain supine with the right upper limb elevated near the head. The 7th, 8th and 9th intercostal area from the anterior axillary line to the mid-axillary line was selected as the testing area. The elasticity liver site was determined under the guidance of an ultrasound probe to determine liver stiffness values. Each subject was required to have at least 10 valid measurements, with a success rate above 60%, and a relative deviation defined as interquartile range divided by the median (IQR/M) of less than 30%. The median value of all valid measurements was used as the final liver stiffness result.

Meanwhile, all subjects took ultrasonography with color Doppler ultrasound (GE, the USA). All subjects were fasted for at least 8 h before ultrasounds and placed in the proper lateral position to detect the ID and blood velocity of the splenic vein. The subjects then changed as supine to detect the ID and blood velocity of the portal vein. The test point measuring the internal diameter of the left gastric vein and blood flow velocity was 0.5 cm from the splenic portal in the splenic vein and 2.0 cm from the left and right branches of the main portal vein. And with the xiphoid 5.0 cm straight ahead from the starting site as the test point to detect blood flow. The sampling volume was 2.0 ~ 5.0 mm, and the angle between the long axis of the vessel and the sampling line was less than 60°. All subjects took 3 measurements, and the average was used as the final result.

Examination of laboratory biochemical indicators

All subjects took examinations of total bilirubin (TBIL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels by the automatic biochemical analyzer (Olympus, Japan). All subjects' prothrombin activity (PTA) level was tested by coagulation analyzers (BeckmanCouler, the USA).

Examination of immune indicators

The immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels of subjects were tested by electrochemiluminescence method with Roche kits and were performed strictly according to the instructions.

The use of LSM for determining variceal rupture and hemorrhage (Method 1) demonstrated an AUC of 0.592 and a diagnostic threshold of > 12.2 kPa, a sensitivity of 0.889, and a specificity of 0.430, indicating that LSM alone had a low diagnostic efficacy for determining the presence or absence of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The use of the splenic area alone (Method 2) for determining gastrointestinal hemorrhage had an AUC of 0.717 and a diagnostic threshold of > 56.8 cm 2. The use of PHB (Method 3) for determining upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage had a sensitivity of 0.889, a specificity of 0.505, and an AUC of 0.720. The diagnostic efficacies did not differ significantly among the three methods (p = 0.1665–0.7788). The diagnostic accuracies of the three methods were 50.5%, 68.5%, and 75.7% respectively (Table 5 and Fig. 4).

The general and demographic characteristics of the 67 patients prospectively analyzed as an external validation cohort are shown in Table 1. The prevalence of esophageal or fundic varices was 82.1%. The AUC values for using the splenic area to predict varices and rupture and hemorrhage were 0.735 and 0.616, respectively. Endoscopic screening could be avoided in 76.1% of cases and correctly predict the risk of variceal rupture in 62.7% of patients with PBC.

### Role of liver transient elastography in detecting cirrhosis with esophageal and gastric varices and evaluating variceal severity [^113U3YTK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objects and methods

Study design

This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at the Liver Disease Department of the 3201 Hospital Affiliated to Xi'an Jiaotong University School of Medicine. Medical records of patients with cirrhosis and EGV admitted from December 2022 to December 2024 were reviewed. All patients underwent both upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and liver transient elastography (TE) during the same hospitalization period, typically within a 72-hour window, to minimize temporal variation in disease status. Data from laboratory, imaging, and immune tests were collected and analyzed.

Clinical information

We collected 136 patients with cirrhosis combined with EGV admitted to our hepatology department from December 2022 to December 2024 in this trial. Based on gastroscopic findings, patients with varices higher than the mucosal surface of the esophagus and venous diameter less than 5 mm were classified as mild EGV group (n = 71); patients with varices of greater than or equal to 5 in diameter were classified as moderate EGV group (n = 40); patients with varices of 5 mm or more in diameter and occupying one-third or more of the lumen were classified as severe EGV group (n = 25). In addition, 50 individuals undergoing routine health screening during the same period were selected as the control group. These were healthy individuals without cirrhosis, esophageal or gastric varices, or any known chronic diseases, confirmed through clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging. The general clinical data showed no significant statistical significance (P > 0.05), and the equilibrium was comparable (Table 1).

### Gall bladder wall thickening as non-invasive screening parameter for esophageal varices-a comparative endoscopic-sonographic study [^114F28p4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A small Chinese study showed a correlation between portal vein velocity and GBWT supporting the hypothesis that GBWT could also predict the presence of EV. From a pathophysiological point of view, GBWT may be a microcirculatory driven event caused by impaired portalvenous outflow before significant changes in portal vein velocity occur. However, the development of GBWT may also be caused by other factors such as the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG).

Several studies have investigated non-invasive parameters as predictors for the presence of EV. A platelet count to spleen diameter ratio of 909 and less was associated with EV. The enlarged spleen is caused by portal hypertension and low platelets were also associated with a lowered thrombopoetin serum level due to reduced liver function. Chen performed a meta-analysis to confirm the usefulness of this ratio and calculated a summative sensitivity of the ratio of 84% with a specificity of 78% to predict EV. The sensitivity of this ratio was also influenced by etiology of the liver disease with a sensitivity of 92% in viral liver cirrhosis. Using the platelet count to spleen diameter ratio as previously described, the sensitivity was somewhat lower with our dataset. The reasons might be the greater variety of causes for liver disease in our cohort than in previous evaluations. Another non-invasive method is the use of computed tomography (CT) imaging with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 72% for the detection of EV. The higher sensitivity is traded against higher costs, exposure to irradiation, and the use of contrast agents. Other non-invasive measurements such as liver stiffness measurements are promising but further studies need to be performed. Meta-analysis of data so far collected by using transient elastography (FibroScan®) showed lower prognostic values for liver stiffness. A meta-analysis of studies using different modes of elastography techniques to measure spleen stiffness showed heterogeneous results to detect EV. The sensitivity of liver stiffness was 84% in predicting any varices, compared to 78% using the stiffness of the spleen as parameter. The specificity of the spleen stiffness was higher when compared to liver stiffness (76% versus 62%). The use of capsule endoscopy to detect EV is also discussed in the literature but high costs and its semi-invasive nature need to be kept in mind. Because of those limitations of the aforementioned non-invasive methods, the use of GBWT could represent a novel and feasible clinical marker for the detection of EV.

Materials and methods

Materials

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 102 cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices who were consecutively admitted to our hospital between January 2011 and January 2022. This cohort consisted of 66 males and 36 females, with ages ranging from 28 to 82 years. Liver cirrhosis was attributed to various causes: hepatitis (n = 64), alcohol consumption (n = 20), cholestatic disorders (n = 2), and unknown etiology (n = 16). The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was based on a comprehensive assessment that included patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, ultrasound, abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging, and liver biopsy. Liver puncture was not the only criterion. Gastroscopy was employed to ascertain the presence and characteristics of esophageal varices, which were categorized based on size (small, medium, or large) and location, as per the Sarin classification (GOV: gastroesophageal varices; IGV: isolated gastric varices). All included patients underwent gastroscopy within one week of admission for definitive diagnosis.

The primary concern associated with esophageal varices is the risk of bleeding. Indications of bleeding esophageal varices encompass vomiting substantial amounts of blood, experiencing black, tarry, or bloody stools, feeling lightheaded due to blood loss, and in severe cases, losing consciousness. Exclusion criteria for this study encompassed patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, those who underwent endoscopic esophageal varix ligation, or individuals with severe organ dysfunction. The Ethics Committee of the Wenzhou People's Hospital approved the study protocol.

In search of less strict criteria, we set the cutoff at 92,000 μL⁻¹ × kPa⁻¹, the value that gave the curve with the best possible Youden's index (J = 0.438). Under these circumstances, PLT/log 10 LSM ≤ 92,000 μL -1 x kPa -1 predicted the detection of HRV with 86% sensitivity, 53% specificity, 32% PPV and 94% NPV (P = 0.001). By adopting this cutoff, 44.9% of our patients would avoid screening EGD. However, 3 of the 48 patients (6.3%) who met the abovementioned criterion needed treatment based on endoscopic findings, while of the remaining 59 patients, 19 needed treatment as proved by EGD (Fig. 1). The diagnostic accuracy measures of all tests are presented together in Table 5a and a comparison between them in Table 5b.

### Endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension. where are we next? [^113PnvGR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Endoscopic ultrasonography has recently emerged as an accurate, non-invasive and reproducible alternative means of providing data for patients with portal hypertension. It is well established that endoscopic ultrasonography is more sensitive than endoscopy in the diagnosis of gastric varices. Dilated venous abnormalities outside the gastrooesophageal lumen, which cannot be diagnosed by endoscopy, are readily visible with endoscopic ultrasonography or miniature probes. Endoscopic ultrasonography is also useful to predict the risk of variceal recurrence and thus the risk of rebleeding after endotherapy which cannot be reliably predicted using endoscopy alone. The introduction of echo endoscopes equipped with Doppler facilities has allowed the sonographic visualisation of the vessels and the evaluation of vascular blood flow along with possible morphologic and haemodynamic changes after endoscopic or pharmacological therapy. However, despite its theoretical advantages, relative evidence suggests that in the clinical setting of portal hypertension, endoscopic ultrasonography remains an investigational tool with limited clinical applications.

### Non-invasive assessment of esophageal and fundic varices in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^113yQKQw]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Screening for varices in patients with PBC and PH can effectively reduce the morbidity and mortality of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. However, the prediction of rupture or hemorrhage from esophageal and fundic varices remains challenging. Current research is focused on the use of non-invasive tests to replace HVPG measurement and reduce unnecessary endoscopic screening. In the present study, we used multiple non-invasive methods to predict varices needing treatment while investigating the applicability of the Baveno VII consensus guidelines to patients with PBC, aiming to complement non-invasive predictive tools for PH.

PH with HVPG ≥ 10 mmHg is associated with the development of esophageal varices and poor prognosis. HVPG measurement is currently recommended in international studies as a diagnostic indicator for the accurate determination of CSPH. However, HVPG is a moderately invasive procedure and most patients with chronic liver disease require long-term follow-up. TE is a common non-invasive clinical examination that plays an important role in the determination of CSPH. Previous findings suggest that the risk of CSPH may be very low (< 9%) for LSM < 13.6 kPa. A meta-analysis by the American Gastroenterological Association Institute using a range of LSM cutoffs (14.6–47.2 kPa) reported in 15 studies for the detection of high-risk EV indicated that the recommended cutoff of ≤ 19.5 (± 2) kPa may misclassify 0.6% patients as not having high-risk EVs and 41.8% patients as having high-risk EVs due to the wide range of cutoffs. Augustin et al concluded that CSPH can be accurately determined using an LSM cutoff of > 25 kPa and that the positive predictive power is slightly reduced with an LSM cutoff of > 21.1 kPa, although this reduced the proportion of patients in the LSM gray area. In the present study, predicting esophageal or fundic varices using an LSM cutoff of > 12.1 kPa allowed endoscopic screening to be avoided in 77% of patients, with a false-negative rate of 20.3% and a false-positive rate of 29.7%.

### Ν on-invasive screening for esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis [^116P9SEz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal varices are portosystemic collaterals developed in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. Every year, a percentage of patients with cirrhosis (3–12%) develop esophageal varices and in 8–12% of patients, progression from small to large varices is detected. Spontaneous regression of small esophageal varices can also be observed, mainly following alcohol abstinence in alcoholic cirrhosis.

In the setting of variceal bleeding a 6-week mortality rate of 11.1–40% has been reported. The presence of red spots, the size of varices, and the severity of cirrhosis are considered to be the most important predictors of variceal bleeding. Treatment with β-blockers can diminish the probability of bleeding by 50% in patients with medium and large varices. At present, the method of choice for identifying the presence and estimating the size of varices is esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The disadvantages of EGD include the complications associated with endoscopy, especially the need for intravenous sedation and the relatively high cost. These drawbacks have driven the research for new methods of variceal detection. Several minimally or non-invasive methods have been proposed as alternatives to EGD for screening for esophageal varices. The updated Baveno VI guidelines recommend that screening EGD can be avoided in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) who have liver stiffness < 20 kPa and a platelet count > 150,000/μL.

Non-invasive methods also currently have a distinct role in clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) in patients with cACLD. In patients with viral-related cACLD non-invasive methods are sufficient to rule-in CSPH, defining the group of patients at risk of having endoscopic signs of portal hypertension. Liver stiffness measured by transient elastography (TE) (20–25 kPa) can be used alone or in combination with platelet count and spleen size. Additionally, collateral circulation identified on imaging is sufficient to rule-in CSPH in patients with cACLD of all etiologies. Non-invasive methods do not yet have a well-established role in the follow up of patients with varices.

The purpose of this review is to summarize the accuracy, advantages and disadvantages of non-invasive methods of screening for esophageal varices, focusing on the evidence that exists in the literature as regards avoiding screening by EGD in certain groups of patients.

### Predictors of esophageal varices in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis: a retrospective study [^1129868X]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Although the present study has the above-mentioned limitations, it is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to investigate predictors of EV in HBV-related cirrhosis in homogeneous population. In addition, the platelet count/spleen width ratio and the spleen width on ultrasonography were first introduced as potential predictors of EV. The intra- and inter-observed variability for the spleen width measurement is good, so it is reproducible. The RF model with a certain cut-off value has a much higher sensitivity and NPV for ruling out the presence of EV and higher diagnostic accuracy than that of single predictors such as the platelet count/spleen width ratio, the spleen width, the portal vein diameter.

### Role of liver transient elastography in detecting cirrhosis with esophageal and gastric varices and evaluating variceal severity [^116bJbdR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Observation indicators

Baseline data such as gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) were counted for all subjects; imaging indexes such as portal vein ID, blood flow velocity, blood flow, and liver stiffness value of subjects were observed; biochemical indexes such as TBIL, ALT, AST, and PTA were observed; immune index levels such as IgM and IgG were observed.

Statistical analysis

The data were processed and analyzed by SPSS22.0. Measuring data were expressed as (x ± s), and the count data were expressed as percentages. The t-test was used for comparison between groups, and one-way ANOVA was used for comparison between multiple groups. χ² test and operating characteristic curve (ROC) were used to assess the value of imaging indicators for the diagnosis of cirrhosis combined with EGV. All differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.

### Platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count-to-spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices in people with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis [^112n6Z6W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend screening of people with oesophageal varices via oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy at the time of diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis. This requires that people repeatedly undergo unpleasant invasive procedures with their attendant risks, although half of these people have no identifiable oesophageal varices 10 years after the initial diagnosis of cirrhosis. Platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count-to-spleen length ratio are non-invasive tests proposed as triage tests for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices.

Objectives

Primary objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count-to-spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices of any size in paediatric or adult patients with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of aetiology. To investigate the accuracy of these non-invasive tests as triage or replacement of oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. Secondary objectives To compare the diagnostic accuracy of these same tests for the diagnosis of high-risk oesophageal varices in paediatric or adult patients with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of aetiology. We aimed to perform pair-wise comparisons between the three index tests, while considering predefined cut-off values. We investigated sources of heterogeneity.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies Register, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), and Science Citation Index - Expanded (Web of Science) (14 June 2016). We applied no language or document-type restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count-to-spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices via oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy as the reference standard in children or adults of any age with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, who did not have variceal bleeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Standard Cochrane methods as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test of Accuracy Reviews.

Main Results

We included 71 studies, 67 of which enrolled only adults and four only children. All included studies were cross-sectional and were undertaken at a tertiary care centre. Eight studies reported study results in abstracts or letters. We considered all but one of the included studies to be at high risk of bias. We had major concerns about defining the cut-off value for the three index tests; most included studies derived the best cut-off values a posteriori, thus overestimating accuracy; 16 studies were designed to validate the 909 (n/mm 3) /mm cut-off value for platelet count-to-spleen length ratio. Enrolment of participants was not consecutive in six studies and was unclear in 31 studies. Thirty-four studies assessed enrolment consecutively. Eleven studies excluded some included participants from the analyses, and in only one study, the time interval between index tests and the reference standard was longer than three months. Diagnosis of varices of any size. Platelet count showed sensitivity of 0.71 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.77) and specificity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.88) (cut-off value of around 150,000/mm 3 from 140,000 to 150,000/mm 3; 10 studies, 2054 participants). When examining potential sources of heterogeneity, we found that of all predefined factors, only aetiology had a role: studies including participants with chronic hepatitis C reported different results when compared with studies including participants with mixed aetiologies (P = 0.036). Spleen length showed sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.91) and specificity of 0.54 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.62) (cut-off values of around 110 mm, from 110 to 112.5 mm; 13 studies, 1489 participants). Summary estimates for detection of varices of any size showed sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.97) and specificity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.91) in 17 studies, and 2637 participants had a cut-off value for platelet count-to-spleen length ratio of 909 (n/mm 3)/mm. We found no effect of predefined sources of heterogeneity. An overall indirect comparison of the HSROCs of the three index tests showed that platelet count-to-spleen length ratio was the most accurate index test when compared with platelet count (P < 0.001) and spleen length (P < 0.001). Diagnosis of varices at high risk of bleeding. Platelet count showed sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.85) and specificity of 0.68 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.77) (cut-off value of around 150,000/mm 3 from 140,000 to 160,000/mm 3; seven studies, 1671 participants). For spleen length, we obtained only a summary ROC curve as we found no common cut-off between studies (six studies, 883 participants). Platelet count-to-spleen length ratio showed sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.93) and specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.77) (cut-off value of around 909 (n/mm 3)/mm; from 897 to 921 (n/mm 3)/mm; seven studies, 642 participants). An overall indirect comparison of the HSROCs of the three index tests showed that platelet count-to-spleen length ratio was the most accurate index test when compared with platelet count (P = 0.003) and spleen length (P < 0.001). DIagnosis of varices of any size in children. We found four studies including 277 children with different liver diseases and or portal vein thrombosis. Platelet count showed sensitivity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.80) and specificity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.91) (cut-off value of around 115,000/mm 3; four studies, 277 participants). Platelet count-to-spleen length z-score ratio showed sensitivity of 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.81) and specificity of 0.64 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.84) (cut-off value of 25; two studies, 197 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Platelet count-to-spleen length ratio could be used to stratify the risk of oesophageal varices. This test can be used as a triage test before endoscopy, thus ruling out adults without varices. In the case of a ratio > 909 (n/mm 3)/mm, the presence of oesophageal varices of any size can be excluded and only 7% of adults with varices of any size would be missed, allowing investigators to spare the number of oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy examinations. This test is not accurate enough for identification of oesophageal varices at high risk of bleeding that require primary prophylaxis. Future studies should assess the diagnostic accuracy of this test in specific subgroups of patients, as well as its ability to predict variceal bleeding. New non-invasive tests should be examined.

### Elastography, spleen size, and platelet count identify portal hypertension in patients with compensated cirrhosis [^116TgMfx]. Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Noninvasive methods are needed to identify clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and esophageal varices (EVs) in patients with compensated cirrhosis. We looked for markers of the presence of CSPH and EVs in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional study that included a training set of 117 patients with compensated cirrhosis, confirmed by histology, from a tertiary referral center. Spleen diameter was measured by ultrasound, and liver stiffness (LS) was measured by transient elastography; endoscopy was used as the standard for detection of EVs, and measurements of hepatic venous pressure gradient were used as the standard for identifying CSPH. We assessed the ability of platelet count, spleen diameter, LS, and combinations of these factors (ie, ratio of platelet count to spleen size, and LS × spleen size/platelet count [LSPS]) to identify patients with CSPH and EV. The analysis included 2 new statistical models: the PH risk score and the varices risk score. Results were validated using an independent series of 56 patients with compensated patients from another center.

Results

LS was the best single noninvasive variable for identifying patients with CSPH (area under the receiver operating characteristic, 0.883; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.824–0.943; P < .0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic value increased when LS was combined with platelet count and spleen size, either as LSPS (0.918; 95% CI, 0.872–0.965; P < .0001) or PH risk score (0.935; 95% CI, 0.893–0.977; P < .0001). More than 80% of patients were accurately classified using LSPS and PH risk score. Analyses of the varices risk score and LSPS were superior to all other noninvasive tests for identifying patients with EVs (area under the receiver operating characteristic, 0.909; 95% CI, 0.841–0.954 and 0.882; 95% CI, 0.810–0.935, respectively); they correctly classified 85% of patients in the training set and 75% in the validation set.

Conclusions

Combined data on LS, spleen diameter, and platelet count can be used to identify patients with compensated cirrhosis most likely to have CSPH and EV.

### Diagnostic model of esophageal varices in alcoholic liver disease [^115bvHWt]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Esophageal varices may cause life-threatening bleeding with attendant high hospital cost. Since effective preventive modalities for variceal hemorrhage have been established, early detection of esophageal varices is critical for prevention of bleeding. Currently, endoscopic screening is widely recommended to patients who have the diagnosis of cirrhosis. However, the diagnosis of cirrhosis relies on histological evaluations, which is costly and invasive, and endoscopic screening also burdens medical resources. Recent cost-effectiveness studies suggested that empiric prophylaxis with beta-blockers may be viable in comparison with endoscopic screening in patients with cirrhosis. However, this issue need to be also evaluated taking account of societal and patient perspectives and is not yet decided. An accurate non-invasive diagnostic model to predict the presence of esophageal varices may reduce unnecessary endoscopic procedures and prophylactic medication and improve cost-benefit of these approaches. Use of an accurate serum marker for severe hepatic fibrosis may also improve accuracy of non-invasive diagnostic models. Hyaluronic acid, a serum marker for severe hepatic fibrosis, has been reported to have a high diagnostic performance in assessing the severity of hepatic fibrosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease. In this issue, a non-invasive diagnostic model including hyaluronic acid was shown to have excellent performance in excluding the presence of medium to large esophageal varices in severe alcohol abusers. Based on current evidence, the strategy of using a non-invasive diagnostic model together with a serum marker for severe hepatic fibrosis may improve cost-benefit in the prevention of variceal hemorrhage among patients with alcoholic liver disease. The independent verification of such diagnostic models is needed.

### Comparative diagnostic efficacy of two-dimensional shear wave and transient elastography in predicting the risk of esophagogastric varices and histological staging in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^115QtSZN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to compare the diagnostic efficacy of Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) with that of transient elastography (TE) in predicting the risk of esophagogastric varices and histological staging in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).

Methods

This single-center prospective study enrolled the patients with PBC diagnosed by liver biopsy following 2D-SWE and TE. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for SWE-liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and TE-LSM to assess their diagnostic efficacy for histological staging ≥ stage 2, ≥ stage 3, and = stage 4. The diagnostic efficacy and accuracy of SWE-LSM were compared with those of the Baveno VI criteria for detecting esophagogastric varices. Additionally, the impact of different laboratory parameters on SWE-LSM was analyzed.

Results

We evaluated 77 patients (median age, 52 years (range: 16 − 75 years), 66 females). ROC curves constructed using TE-LSM and SWE-LSM demonstrated similar diagnostic efficacy for histological staging ≥ stage 2 (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.824 vs. 0.823 for TE-LSM and SWE-LSM, respectively, p = 0.9764), ≥ stage 3 (AUC: 0.918 vs. 0.907 for TE-LSM and SWE-LSM, respectively, p = 0.6443), and = stage 4 (AUC: 0.907 vs. 0.902 for TE-LSM and SWE-LSM, respectively, p = 0.8763). Additionally, while there was no significant difference in the diagnostic efficacy between the two methods for detecting esophagogastric varices (Z = 1.516, p = 0.1296), 2D-SWE had a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy than TE (61.8% vs. 76.4%). Transaminases and bilirubin levels had little influence on SWE-LSM.

Conclusion

2D-SWE exhibited comparable performance to TE in predicting the risk of esophagogastric varices and histological staging.

### Role of liver transient elastography in detecting cirrhosis with esophageal and gastric varices and evaluating variceal severity [^111EMTkU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, 136 patients with cirrhosis with EGV and 50 healthy physical examination cases took the imaging, biochemical, and immune examinations. We compared the level differences of biochemical, immune indexes, and imaging results between patients with different degrees of varices and normal population. We found no statistically significant differences in laboratory biochemical indexes such as TBIL, ALT, AST, PTA, and immune indexes such as IgM and IgG among the control group, mild EGV group, moderate EGV group, and severe EGV group (P > 0.05). The results indicated that biochemical and immune indicators are unreliable for the early diagnosis of cirrhosis EGV and identification of the degree of varices. However, there were statistically significant differences in portal vein ID, blood flow, and liver stiffness values between the groups (P < 0.05), indicating the potential of liver TE to diagnose cirrhosis combined with EGV and its degree of varices. Based on liver stiffness measurement, liver TE is an effectively non-invasive liver examination in assessing the development of liver diseases, such as chronic viral hepatitis B, chronic viral hepatitis C, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Par G et al. performed simultaneous upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and TE ultrasonography in 74 patients with chronic liver disease. They found that TE was more helpful than endoscopy in screening patients at high risk for esophageal varices with a Parkay classification ≥ grade II. A critical value of 19.2KPa for liver stiffness value gave a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 87%, and validity of 86% for diagnosing varicose veins. Zhang X et al. reported that FibroScan TE was a practical examination to detect the liver stiffness values and controlled attenuation parameters in liver fibrosis and hepatic steatosis. The measurement of liver stiffness values was a reliable criterion for screening varices and highly correlated with clinical outcomes. In addition, Zhu Q et al. also found the high accuracy of TE in identifying the risk of esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis due to the hepatitis B virus. Liver stiffness values not only accurately identified esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis but also further screened the risk of patients. Thus, liver stiffness values could independently predict esophageal variceal bleeding, which was corresponded with our study results. The study found that the portal vein ID, bleeding flow, and liver stiffness values could identify the presence or absence of cirrhosis combined with EGV, with the highest efficacy of liver stiffness value. Liver stiffness values were also influential in assessing the degree of varicose veins and have the best efficacy in patients with severe EGV. The results showed that liver stiffness value in TE had an excellent diagnosis efficacy for cirrhosis with EGV and the degree of varices, coinciding with the previous studies.

### The role of fibroscan in predicting the presence of varices in patients with cirrhosis [^11567JCF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Aim

Transient elastography is a relatively new, noninvasive method of measuring liver stiffness. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography and other noninvasive methods for the diagnosis of esophageal varices (EV) in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This cross-sectional study graded EV according to size in 145 consecutive patients with cirrhosis who underwent endoscopy, Fibroscan, and other noninvasive diagnostic methods. The accuracy of these diagnostic methods in diagnosing EV was evaluated on the basis of area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves.

Results

Elastography was successful in 123 patients. Of these, 54.5% had hepatitis C and 10.6% had hepatitis B. EV were absent in 39.8%, small EV was present in 24.4%, and large EV was present in 35.8% of patients. Fibroscan, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, and international normalized ratio showed low accuracy in diagnosing EV in non-viral-related cirrhosis patients (AUROCs 0.66, 0.68, and 0.67, respectively). Fibroscan and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index were more accurate in measuring EV with a viral etiology (AUROCs 0.704 and 0.703, respectively). A cutoff value of 16.9 kPa was 83.8% sensitive in diagnosing EV in non-viral-cirrhotic patients, whereas a cutoff value of 19.9 kPa was 83.4% sensitive in diagnosing EV in patients with viral hepatitis. Fibroscan was moderately accurate in diagnosing grade I EV and less accurate in diagnosing grades II and III EV in all cirrhotic patients, irrespective of the underlying etiology.

Conclusion

Fibroscan might be useful in predicting the presence of EV in patients with cirrhosis with a viral etiology. However, endoscopy remains the gold standard for EV screening.
