## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "natural" and "non-natural" (conventional) medications that can be used to mitigate pain, including evidence strength, indications, safety, and a practical treatment hierarchy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and classify natural versus conventional options. Then, I should review which natural therapies have stronger versus mixed or negative evidence. Next, I will examine conventional pharmacologic options with guideline support and risk considerations. After that, I should integrate condition-specific guidance and nonpharmacologic adjuncts. Finally, I need to check safety, herb–drug interactions, and propose an evidence-informed algorithm with clear cautions and monitoring steps [^112vYzRo] [^112DBK9u] [^113XgE21].

> Let me first confirm definitions so I don't misclassify options. By "natural", I will consider botanicals and dietary supplements such as curcuminoids, willow bark, omega-3s, glucosamine/chondroitin, and topical plant-derived agents like capsaicin, while acknowledging that regulatory pathways for supplements differ markedly from drugs, affecting quality, consistency, and claims. "Non-natural" will include conventional pharmacologics such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, adjuvants like pregabalin, and opioids, recognizing guideline roles and labeled indications. I need to ensure I keep regulatory differences in mind because they impact purity, dosing, and safety monitoring in clinical decisions [^115mnzku] [^112vYzRo].

> Now, I will review natural therapies with comparatively stronger evidence signals. Curcuminoids show a statistically significant reduction in pain across eight randomized trials with 606 patients, with an SMD around −0.57 and good tolerability, though I should be cautious about heterogeneity and clinical relevance by condition. This suggests curcuminoids can be a reasonable adjunct when patients seek anti-inflammatory supplements and prefer lower systemic risk profiles, provided product quality is vetted. For capsaicin, both network and guideline-level evidence support topical use in osteoarthritis and localized pain, with SMDs consistent with moderate benefit and predominantly local adverse effects like burning or irritation; dose and delivery form matter for effect and tolerability. Cannabinoid-based medicines should not be first-line, but guidelines recommend offering them as adjuncts for chronic pain when other modalities are inadequate or poorly tolerated, with potential opioid-sparing considerations in selected patients, especially those on moderate-to-high opioid doses, after shared decision-making and risk screening [^112PQDPp] [^115qHgAg] [^113R1Djn] [^113XgE21] [^116M1Bxh] [^113rZnRp].

> Hold on, I should separate mixed or conditionally supported natural options from those to avoid. Willow bark is a good example of conflicting data; a post-marketing randomized comparison versus rofecoxib suggested improvement in low back pain indices, yet contemporary high-credibility guidance advises against offering Salix species for chronic primary low back pain, so routine use is not supported for that indication. Glucosamine and related supplements have only conditional support in some decision aids for chronic musculoskeletal pain, reflecting uncertainty and small effects. Ginger as a food has conditional support in some contexts, but as a supplement for low back pain, evidence is insufficient, so I need to counsel patients accordingly and set expectations [^113WpBDj] [^112DBK9u] [^1136SR18] [^114fK6Zz].

> Wait, let me verify the "avoid" list to prevent inadvertent recommendations. For chronic primary low back pain, WHO guidance recommends avoiding devil's claw and white willow products among others, and notes insufficient evidence for several topical combination herbal products and specific botanicals such as Brazilian arnica and lily extracts. I initially wrote "Harpagophytum procumbens (uña de gato)" in the prior trace, but that is incorrect; hold on, I should correct it now: Harpagophytum procumbens is devil's claw, whereas "uña de gato" refers to Uncaria tomentosa, so I must not conflate them. Military-focused decision aids also recommend against several supplements, including willow bark extract, collagen, creatine, L-carnitine, MSM, pycnogenol, vitamin E, and devil's claw, emphasizing the need for caution and quality concerns in this space [^111WECyu] [^1136SR18] [^113Yyrtf].

> Next, I will examine conventional first-line non-opioid pharmacotherapy so I don't miss core standards of care. For acute pain, guidelines consistently recommend NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen as initial therapy tailored to patient risk, with topical NSAIDs favored in osteoarthritis when feasible to reduce systemic exposure. I need to remember that topical capsaicin can be considered in OA when topical NSAIDs or acetaminophen are inadequate, given its safety profile and local mechanism, while monitoring for skin irritation and counseling on application techniques [^112vYzRo] [^115qHgAg].

> I should confirm opioid positioning and labeling, since risk–benefit is critical. Opioids should be reserved for selected patients after optimizing nonpharmacologic and nonopioid strategies in chronic noncancer pain, with careful risk assessment and functional goals. Labeled indications for hydromorphone injection, oxycodone products, and oxycodone–acetaminophen specify use only when alternatives are inadequate, and Dsuvia is restricted to certified, medically supervised settings with explicit limits, while buprenorphine transdermal has mixed efficacy data and requires careful titration and monitoring. These labels reinforce that opioids are last-line options with clear limitations due to addiction, misuse, and overdose risks, necessitating close follow-up, PDMP checks, and exit strategies [^1126Yzqj] [^116p3h8Z] [^11559wZ6] [^116B7iwA] [^1149cMYs] [^111wvDy4].

> Let me consider adjuvant analgesics where evidence supports specific phenotypes. Pregabalin has robust labeling data in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, with defined responder criteria and randomized-withdrawal maintenance benefits, so it is reasonable for carefully selected patients after nonpharmacologic measures, with counseling about dizziness, somnolence, and edema. For localized neuropathic pain, high-concentration capsaicin patches are used in some jurisdictions and may be considered as part of a multimodal plan when oral agents are poorly tolerated, though guideline strength varies by condition and region, and I should confirm local labeling and patient preference before proceeding [^111MhzAA] [^116zRNPC] [^113rfGEJ].

> I will now integrate condition-specific guidance so recommendations match clinical context. For chronic low back pain, multiple high-credibility guidelines support nonpharmacologic approaches such as exercise therapy, manual therapy, spinal manipulation, and massage as part of a multimodal plan, with pharmacotherapy individualized and herbal offerings like Salix and Harpagophytum specifically discouraged. For fibromyalgia, nonpharmacologic modalities such as acupuncture, hydrotherapy, yoga, tai chi, qigong, and mindfulness can be offered alongside selected pharmacologic options like pregabalin in appropriate cases. In oncology settings, integrative therapies such as massage for post-treatment breast cancer pain, acupuncture for general or aromatase inhibitor–related pain or chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and yoga for AI-related arthralgia can be considered within comprehensive care plans [^112B6L1G] [^111pxHxH] [^113PTUdL] [^115AWesd] [^117Uk16w] [^112eHnNv] [^112dSvWs] [^112DBK9u].

> I need to ensure safety considerations and interactions are explicit, especially for natural products. Many dietary and herbal supplements lack consistent GMP-level quality, may be contaminated or mislabeled, and can interact with conventional drugs, so I should proactively review all nonprescription products and counsel on risks. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects and pharmacodynamic interactions, warranting extra caution, reconciliation, and deprescribing when benefits are uncertain or harms emerge [^117XNc49] [^116L6DsY] [^111WTJBv].

> Let me now articulate a practical, evidence-informed algorithm, and I will double-check it aligns with guidelines. For acute pain, start with NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen, add topical NSAIDs for localized OA, and avoid routine opioids. For chronic pain, prioritize nonpharmacologic therapies; consider topical NSAIDs and capsaicin for focal OA pain; consider curcuminoids as an adjunct when patients prefer a vetted supplement and have low bleeding risk; reserve cannabinoids as adjuncts only when standard approaches fail or are intolerable and after risk–benefit discussion, with attention to local laws and driving safety; use adjuvants like pregabalin for neuropathic phenotypes; escalate to opioids only when benefits for function clearly outweigh risks and with explicit monitoring and discontinuation criteria. I should explicitly avoid recommending willow bark and devil's claw for chronic primary low back pain per WHO, and I should document shared decision-making at each step [^112vYzRo] [^112DBK9u] [^113XgE21] [^1126Yzqj].

> In summary, I should emphasize that among "natural" options, curcuminoids and topical capsaicin have the most consistent supportive signals for pain reduction in selected contexts, while cannabinoid-based medicines may be offered as adjuncts for refractory chronic pain with careful selection and monitoring. Conversely, for chronic primary low back pain, avoid willow bark and devil's claw despite older or mixed studies suggesting benefit, and correct prior mislabeling by noting that devil's claw is Harpagophytum and "uña de gato" refers to Uncaria tomentosa. Conventional first-line non-opioids remain the foundation, with opioids reserved as last resort under strict safeguards, and all choices should be anchored in shared decision-making, condition-specific guidelines, and vigilant safety oversight [^112PQDPp] [^115qHgAg] [^113XgE21] [^111WECyu].

### Lyrica [^111MhzAA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

For various levels of improvement in pain intensity from baseline to the study endpoint, Figure 9 shows the fraction of patients achieving that level of improvement. The figure is cumulative, and patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as Week 1, which persisted throughout the study.

- **Randomized withdrawal study**: This study compared Lyrica with placebo. Patients were titrated during a 6-week open-label dose optimization phase to a total daily dose of 300 mg, 450 mg, or 600 mg. Patients were considered responders if they had both: 1) at least a 50% reduction in pain (VAS), and 2) rated their overall improvement on the PGIC as "much improved" or "very much improved". Those who responded to treatment were then randomized in the double-blind treatment phase to either the dose achieved in the open-label phase or to placebo. Patients were treated for up to 6 months following randomization.

- **Efficacy assessment**: Efficacy was assessed by the time to loss of therapeutic response, defined as 1) less than a 30% reduction in pain (VAS) from open-label baseline during two consecutive visits of the double-blind phase, or 2) worsening of FM symptoms necessitating alternative treatment. Fifty-four percent of patients were able to titrate to an effective and tolerable dose of Lyrica during the 6-week open-label phase. Of the patients entering the randomized treatment phase assigned to remain on Lyrica, 38% of patients completed 26 weeks of treatment versus 19% of placebo-treated patients.

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of curcuminoids in clinical practice: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112PQDPp]. Pain Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Curcuminoids are natural products with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. There have been a number of reports on the analgesic effects of curcuminoids in clinical trials, yet data have not been fully conclusive.

- **Objectives**: To provide the highest level of evidence on the efficacy of curcuminoids in patients with painful conditions through a meta-analysis of data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using data reported by RCTs. The primary efficacy measure was pain intensity or algofunctional status. The treatment effect was summarized with standardized mean difference (SMD) calculated from differences in means of pain measures between treatment and control groups using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: A total of eight RCTs met our inclusion criteria, including 606 randomized patients. Curcuminoids were found to significantly reduce pain (SMD: -0.57, 95% CI: -1.11 to -0.03, P = 0.04). This pain-relieving effect was found to be independent of the administered dose and duration of treatment with curcuminoids and was free from publication bias. Curcuminoids were safe and well-tolerated in all evaluated RCTs.

- **Conclusion**: Curcuminoids supplements may be a safe and effective strategy to improve pain severity, warranting further rigorously conducted studies to define long-term efficacy and safety.

### Guideline for opioid therapy and chronic noncancer pain [^1126Yzqj]. CMAJ (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioids and pain, specifically concerning non-opioid therapies, CMA 2017 guidelines recommend optimizing nonpharmacological and nonopioid pharmacological therapies. These should be prioritized as the first-line treatment in patients with chronic non-cancer pain, rather than initiating a trial of opioids.

### Conditional recommendations for specific dietary ingredients as an approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based decision aid for health care providers, participants, and policy makers [^113R1Djn]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Conditional recommendations were made (37.5% weak, in favor; 62.5% strong, in favor) for the use of capsaicin as a cream or patch for pain and related symptoms. Research shows high-quality evidence and certainty that capsaicin will produce a statistically significant reduction in pain (SMD = –0.56) and the patient's global assessment of improvement (risk difference [RD] = –0.21) compared with placebo at time points closest to four weeks. The desirable anticipated effects were judged to be moderate overall, and the undesirable anticipated effects, primarily associated with burning, itching, and irritation, were judged to be small to trivial. Most OTC creams contain 0.025–0.075% capsaicin and can be applied three to four times a day to the affected area. The application of higher OTC doses (i.e. 0.25%) is only recommended if the patient can tolerate the increased undesirable effects, an approach that can potentially provide quicker pain relief with less frequent applications.

Because the cost of capsaicin is highly dependent upon its dose and delivery system, it was challenging for members to judge the required resources based on the evidence. Given the desirable vs. undesirable anticipated effects, however, its use likely justifies the resource requirements and out-of-pocket expenses. Members agreed that capsaicin would likely be acceptable to stakeholders and feasible/suitable to implement for use as a cream or patch.

### Dilaudid [^116p3h8Z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dilaudid injection is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, reserve Dilaudid injection for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options, such as non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products, have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, and have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Clinical practice guidelines for cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines in the management of chronic pain and co-occurring conditions [^116M1Bxh]. Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of opioids for pain, and more specifically with respect to non-opioid therapies, the CCP-CEG 2023 guidelines recommend offering cannabinoid-based medicines as an adjunct treatment. This is particularly suggested for patients taking moderate to high doses of opioids (greater than 50 morphine equivalents) for the management of chronic pain. The goal is to potentially increase opioid sparing.

### Dietary ingredients requiring further research before evidence-based recommendations can be made for their use as an approach to mitigating pain [^115zNe1v]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The project's full methodological approach is detailed within the first of this series of three articles and is included as supplementary data: Detailed Methodology. Briefly, the authors relied upon the Institute of Medicine guidelines to ensure transparent processes were followed and conflicts of interest were managed or mitigated in the selection and recruitment of a group of key stakeholders and subject matter experts. The committee, named the Holistic Evidence Review Board (HERB), was convened to develop essential research questions and definitions and assess the factors required for decision-making. A review team, independent of HERB, then conducted a series of systematic reviews to assess the state of the evidence and to explore the safety and efficacy of various dietary ingredients for treating pain and related outcomes. The gathered evidence was integrated with the expertise of these subject matter experts, and modified Delphi methods were used to develop evidence-based recommendations for the use of dietary ingredients as well as priority areas in need of future research following the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence-to-decision framework. The systematic review evidence used to inform recommendations is reported in the supplementary data: Summary Report.

### Nonopioid analgesics discovery and the Valley of Death: EMA401 from concept to clinical trial [^114GxFYh]. Pain (2022). Low credibility.

There are multiple obstacles that impede the success in the development of novel nonopioid pain therapeutics that are efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated for the relief of chronic pain in patients. The high degree of difficulty in achieving success has led several large pharmaceutical companies to exit the novel pain therapeutics field because it is considered "too hard". Nevertheless, others in industry and academia continue to persist despite the long (over 15 years) and arduous path to success.

### Herbal topical analgesic for pain management: Perspectives from cancer patients [^111gccvF]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Herbs and natural products are increasingly used by cancer patients for pain management, but few studies have examined their integration within conventional cancer care. This study describes the characteristics, experiences, and perspectives of cancer patients who were prescribed an herbal topical analgesic for pain management.

- **Design and setting**: Program evaluation of a pilot herbal dispensary at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center.

- **Subjects**: Cancer patients who were prescribed the Tibetree Pain-Relieving Plaster (PRP) by an integrative medicine physician.

- **Methods**: Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients were abstracted from medical records. Semistructured phone interviews were conducted 1–2 weeks after PRP prescription to evaluate patient experiences with using PRP for pain. Interviews were analyzed through thematic content analysis.

- **Results**: From February 2019 to February 2020, 50 patients were prescribed PRP. The median age (range) was 63 years (21–86), 37 patients (74%) were female, 14 (28%) were non-White, and 38 (76%) were using oral analgesics. During interviews, the majority of patients reported that the PRP improved pain and health-related outcomes, was convenient to use, and addressed pain management needs that were not fulfilled by oral analgesics. However, a few patients described adverse experiences with PRP, including skin irritation.

Understanding patient experiences and perspectives is a critical step toward evidence-based integration of herbs and natural products into cancer pain management.

### Natural products and supplements for geriatric depression and cognitive disorders: An evaluation of the research [^111WTJBv]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Numerous geriatric patients are using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for late-life mood and cognitive disorders. Natural products and supplements are a common CAM intervention, and patients should be appropriately advised of their risks and benefits. The data for omega-3 fatty acids, ginkgo biloba, SAMe, St John's wort, B vitamins, vitamin D, huperzine, caprylidene, and coconut oil will be evaluated. Since the evidence basis for natural products and supplements is limited, especially for the geriatric population, studies involving the general adult population are included to infer effects in the aging population. Despite the data available, more rigorous studies with larger sample sizes over longer periods are still needed. Regardless of a physician's preference to recommend various natural supplements and products, a physician could protect their patients by having an understanding of the side effects and indications for various natural products.

### Natural product use among veterans with chronic pain: A qualitative study of attitudes and communication with healthcare providers [^116DFqQo]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Despite mixed evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of natural products, many are marketed for pain and related symptoms. The use of these products is prevalent among veterans, who have disproportionately high rates of chronic pain. At the time of writing, however, there is limited research on veterans' beliefs and attitudes about natural products and their communication with healthcare providers about their natural product use.

- **Objective**: To explore how veterans experiencing chronic pain make decisions about natural product use, investigate veterans' beliefs about the safety and efficacy of these products, and examine veterans' experiences discussing natural products with their providers.

- **Design**: A qualitative sub-study conducted as a supplement to a pragmatic randomized controlled trial for chronic pain management.

- **Participants**: Twenty veterans experiencing chronic pain who reported using natural products for pain management or related health concerns.

- **Approach**: Qualitative interviews with veterans were conducted over the phone and audio-recorded. Interviews were guided by an original semi-structured interview guide, and qualitative data were analyzed using a template-based rapid analysis technique.

- **Key results**: Veterans with chronic pain may perceive natural products as safer than pharmaceutical products and may prefer to use natural products. Talking with providers about natural products is important to veterans, who would like information regarding the safety and potential for interaction of natural products with pharmaceutical products. However, veterans were.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^114ZuPe4]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The primary analysis across the included dietary ingredients, where feasible (i.e. sufficient data), was based on trials reporting a continuous outcome measure for pain reduction compared with placebo. Meta-analyses compared with other active therapies were not attempted due to heterogeneity among various comparators. When more than one time point was provided for a single outcome, the authors chose the time point closest to three months for the main analysis.

- **Secondary analyses**: The secondary analyses were based on trials reporting:

1. A continuous measure for pain at any other time point (i.e. most commonly reported on the visual analog scale [VAS] or Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC] pain subscale).
2. A dichotomous outcome measure at any time point (i.e. responder data for improvement marked as "global health").
3. A continuous outcome measure for physical function or disability (i.e. commonly reported as physical function or stiffness WOMAC subscale) at any time point.
4. A continuous outcome measure for global function (i.e. often reported as a total WOMAC or total Lequesne's Functional Index).
5. A dichotomous outcome measure of medication use (i.e. reported as the event to not require the use of rescue medication) at any time point.
6. A dichotomous outcome measure of the number of participants experiencing any adverse events.

Measures of psychological health (i.e. mood, anxiety, depression, stress), health-related quality of life (global, physical, and/or mental), sleep, and cognitive performance were examined at any time point.

### Spiritual healing as a therapy for chronic pain: A randomized, clinical trial [^116WHdEv]. Pain (2001). Low credibility.

Spiritual healing is a popular complementary and alternative therapy; in the UK, almost 13,000 members are registered in nine separate healing organizations. The present randomized clinical trial was designed to investigate the efficacy of healing in the treatment of chronic pain. One hundred and twenty patients suffering from chronic pain, predominantly of neuropathic and nociceptive origin resistant to conventional treatments, were recruited from a Pain Management Clinic.

The trial had two parts:

- **Face-to-face healing** or simulated face-to-face healing for 30 minutes per week for 8 weeks. (Part I)
- **Distant healing** or no healing for 30 minutes per week for 8 weeks. (Part II)

The McGill Pain Questionnaire was pre-defined as the primary outcome measure, and the sample size was calculated to detect a difference of 8 units on the total pain rating index of this instrument after 8 weeks of healing. Visual Analog Scales (VASs) for pain, SF-36, Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale, Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP), and patient subjective experiences at week 8 were employed as secondary outcome measures.

Data from all patients who reached the pre-defined mid-point of 4 weeks (50 subjects in Part I and 55 subjects in Part II) were included in the analysis. Two baseline measurements of outcome measures were made, 3 weeks apart, and no significant differences were observed between them. After eight sessions, there were significant decreases from baseline in the McGill Pain Questionnaire total pain rating index score for both groups in Part I and for the control group in Part II. However, there were no statistically significant differences between healing and control groups in either part.

### A systematic review on the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine for chronic non-specific low-back pain [^114HW7MT]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Data collection and analysis

- **Selection of studies**: Two reviewers, working independently, examined all citations from the electronic search. Full articles were obtained for citations believed to meet the inclusion criteria. A third reviewer was consulted if consensus was not reached.

- **Assessment of risk of bias of included studies**: Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias and conducted data extraction. Risk of bias was evaluated using the criteria list from the CBRG, consisting of 11 items that assess internal validity. Items were scored as positive if criteria were met, negative if bias was likely, or inconclusive if information was insufficient. Discrepancies in scoring and data extraction were resolved through consensus meetings. A study was considered to have a low risk of bias if it fulfilled six or more validity items. Studies with a fatal flaw, defined as having a drop-out rate higher than 50% at the first follow-up or significant baseline differences not accounted for in analyses, were excluded from the meta-analyses. This definition aligns with an earlier Cochrane review.

- **Data extraction**: An a priori list of items was used for data extraction, including both descriptive data (e.g. study population, type of intervention) and quantitative data regarding primary and secondary outcome measures.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^1136SR18]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Approximately 55–76% of service members use dietary supplements for various reasons, including pain and related outcomes. This work evaluates research on dietary ingredients for chronic musculoskeletal pain to inform decisions for practice and self-care, specifically for Special Operations Forces personnel.

- **Methods**: A steering committee convened to develop research questions and factors required for decision-making. Key databases were searched through August 2016. Eligible systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials were assessed for methodological quality. Meta-analysis was applied where feasible. GRADE was used to determine confidence in the effect estimates. The committee made evidence-informed judgments and recommendations for practice and self-care use.

- **Results**: Nineteen eligible dietary ingredients were assessed for quality, efficacy, and safety. Avocado soybean unsaponifiables, capsaicin, curcuma, ginger (as a food source), glucosamine, melatonin, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and vitamin D were conditionally recommended as their benefits outweighed risks, but there was still some uncertainty about the trade-offs. No recommendations were made for boswellia, ginger (as a dietary supplement), rose hip, or s-adenosyl-L-methionine. Recommendations were made against the use of collagen, creatine, devil's claw, l-carnitine, methylsulfonylmethane, pycnogenol, willow bark extract, and vitamin E. Research priorities were developed to address gaps precluding stronger recommendations.

Currently, the scientific evidence is insufficiently complete to draw stronger conclusions.

### Herbal and dietary therapies for primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea [^113ZmvGP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhoea refers to the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin and is a common gynaecological complaint. Common treatment for dysmenorrhoea involves medical therapy such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), which both work by reducing myometrial activity (contractions of the uterus). The efficacy of conventional treatments such as nonsteroidals is considerable; however, the failure rate is still often 20–25%. Many consumers are now seeking alternatives to conventional medicine, and research into the menstrual cycle suggests that nutritional intake and metabolism may play an important role in the cause and treatment of menstrual disorders. Herbal and dietary therapies are among the more popular complementary medicines, yet there is a lack of taxonomy to assist in classifying them.

In the US, herbs and other phytomedicinal products (medicine from plants) have been legally classified as dietary supplements since 1994. Included in this category are vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and other dietary substances. For the purpose of this review, we use the wider term herbal and dietary therapies to include the assorted herbal or dietary treatments that are classified in the US as supplements, as well as the phytomedicines that may be classified as drugs in the European Union.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and safety of herbal and dietary therapies for the treatment of primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea when compared to each other, placebo, no treatment, or other conventional treatment.

### Topical herbal therapies for treating osteoarthritis [^111UuNW4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Before the development of extraction and synthetic chemistry, musculoskeletal complaints were commonly treated with preparations made from medicinal plants. These preparations were either administered orally or applied topically. Unlike oral medicinal plant products, topical treatments act partly as counterirritants or can be toxic if taken orally.

- **Objectives**: This review aims to update the Cochrane review from 2000 on herbal therapy for osteoarthritis by evaluating the effectiveness of topical medicinal plant products.

- **Search methods**: Databases for mainstream and complementary medicine were searched using terms that covered all forms of arthritis and medicinal plant products. We searched several electronic databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to February 2013, without language restrictions. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved trials.

- **Selection criteria**: The selection included randomized controlled trials of herbal interventions used topically, compared with either inert (placebo) or active controls, in individuals with osteoarthritis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected the trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias within the included studies, and extracted relevant data.

- **Main results**: A total of seven studies (comprising six different medicinal plant interventions and 785 participants) were included. The presence of single studies (five studies) and non-comparable studies (two studies) prevented the pooling of results. Moderate evidence was found from a single study involving 174 individuals with hand osteoarthritis.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115qHgAg]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of pain and disability, for which two topical treatments are used: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and capsaicin. Topical NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, reversibly block the production of prostanoids, thereby reducing pain and inflammation. Topical NSAIDs, alongside paracetamol, are recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as first-line pharmacological treatments. Over £32 million's worth of prescriptions of topical NSAIDs were dispensed in community pharmacies in England in 2016. Topical NSAIDs are also freely available over the counter and are widely advertised to consumers.

Meanwhile, capsaicin, the substance responsible for the warming spiciness of chili peppers, is primarily available on prescription in the UK. Almost 200,000 tubes of 0.025% capsaicin were dispensed in 2016, amounting to over £4 million. Capsaicin is thought to cause defunctionalisation of spontaneously active peripheral nociceptors that otherwise maintain chronic pain conditions.

Topical NSAIDs and capsaicin are applied directly to the skin over the painful joint, and little to no active drug is absorbed into the bloodstream, resulting in their favorable safety profiles. Topical administration, therefore, offers a safe and effective alternative to oral analgesics for people with just one or a few painful peripheral joints, especially for individuals with comorbidities, multiple medications, or those wishing to avoid tablets. The efficacy of topical NSAIDs and capsaicin in OA is documented.

### Herbal medicine for low back pain: A Cochrane review [^1111hitr]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was conducted to determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine compared with placebo, no intervention, or standard/accepted/conventional treatments for nonspecific low back pain.

Low back pain is a common condition and a substantial economic burden in industrialized societies. A large proportion of patients with chronic low back pain use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and/or visit CAM practitioners. Several herbal medicines have been proposed for use in low back pain.

The following databases were searched: Medline (1966 to April 2003), Embase (1980 to April 2003), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 2003), and Cochrane Complementary Medicine (CM) field Trials Register. Additionally, reference lists in review articles, guidelines, and in the retrieved trials were checked. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults over 18 years of age suffering from acute, subacute, or chronic nonspecific low back pain were included. Types of interventions included herbal medicines defined as a plant used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function.

Two reviewers conducted electronic searches in all databases. One reviewer contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. Authors, titles, subject headings, publication type, and abstracts of the isolated studies were downloaded or a hard copy was retrieved. Methodologic quality and clinical relevance were assessed separately by two individuals.

### Roxybond [^11559wZ6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Roxybond is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], reserve Roxybond for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products) have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, or have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.

Roxybond should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

Findings were determined to be clinically relevant based upon the size of the effect only. A cut-off point of 25 points (0–100 scale) was considered to represent the minimally clinically important change (MCIC) for pain. An effect was considered clinically significant when the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than this MCIC. For the SMD, effect sizes were defined as 0.8 for large effects.

### Herbal medicine for low back pain [^115U1Lut]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). High credibility.

Low back pain is a common condition and a substantial economic burden in industrialized societies. A large proportion of patients with chronic low back pain use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in low back pain.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for non-specific low back pain.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Trials Register (Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2005), EMBASE (1980 to July 2005); checked reference lists in review articles, guidelines, and retrieved trials; and personally contacted individuals with expertise in this very specialized area.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials, examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub-acute, or chronic non-specific low back pain. The interventions were herbal medicines, defined as plants that are used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors conducted the database searches. One author contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. Full references and abstracts of the identified studies were downloaded. A hard copy was retrieved for final inclusion decisions. Methodological quality and clinical relevance were assessed separately by two individuals. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

- **Main results**: Ten trials were included in this review. Two high-quality trials provided evidence.

### A systematic review on the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine for chronic non-specific low-back pain [^1159VWXh]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

- **Versus any other intervention**: Only one study, which had a low risk of bias, examined the effects of acupuncture compared to another intervention — namely standard care. This standard care consisted of treatment by a physician or physiotherapist and included a "multimodal treatment program". Patients in the acupuncture group were allowed "rescue medication" for acute episodes, consisting of a short course of NSAIDs (no more than 2 days per week). A statistically, but not clinically relevant effect was observed for pain at the short-term and intermediate follow-ups (MWD −8.50, 95% CI −11.04 to −5.96; −9.40, 95% CI −12.13 to −6.67; −12.10, 95% CI −15.25 to −8.95, respectively) (low-quality evidence). In contrast, a moderate statistically significant and clinically relevant effect was observed for functional status at the short-term and intermediate follow-ups in favor of acupuncture (SMD −0.53, 95% CI −0.67 to −0.38; −0.64, 95% CI −0.79 to −0.49; −0.76, 95% CI −0.91 to −0.61, respectively) (low-quality evidence). Recovery was examined but analyzed as a continuous variable.

- **Versus other types of acupuncture**: One small study (n = 35) with a high risk of bias examined the effect of standard acupuncture versus superficial acupuncture (acupuncture sensation de qi) and deep needling at trigger points in patients 65 years of age and older (very low-quality evidence). There were no significant differences between the groups at the end of either of the two treatment phases. Another study (n = 61) with a low risk of bias examined the effect of auricular electroacupuncture compared to conventional manual auricular acupuncture (low quality evidence).

### Salicylate-containing rubefacients for acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^111DE1zu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Rubefacients containing salicylates cause irritation of the skin and are believed to relieve various musculoskeletal pains. They are available on prescription and are common components in over-the-counter remedies. This is an update of a review of rubefacients for acute and chronic pain, originally published in 2009, which found limited evidence for efficacy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of topically applied salicylates in acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, from inception to 22 August 2014, together with the Oxford Pain Relief Database, two clinical trial registries, and the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled clinical trials of topical rubefacients containing salicylates to treat musculoskeletal pain in adults, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, and reporting outcomes at close to 7 (minimum 3, maximum 10) days for acute conditions and 14 (minimum 7) days or longer for chronic conditions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, and extracted data. We calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit or harm (NNT or NNH) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model. We analysed acute and chronic conditions separately.

- **Main results**: New searches for this update identified one new study that satisfied our inclusion criteria, although it contributed information.

### Caldolor [^117HF8X8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effect of Caldolor on acute pain was evaluated in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

- **Analgesia (pain)**: In a study of women who had undergone an elective abdominal hysterectomy, 319 patients were randomized and treated with Caldolor 800 mg or placebo administered every 6 hours (started intra-operatively) and morphine administered on an as-needed basis. Efficacy was demonstrated as a statistically significant greater reduction in the mean morphine consumption through 24 hours in patients who received Caldolor compared to those receiving placebo (47 mg and 56 mg, respectively). The clinical relevance of this finding is supported by a greater reduction in pain intensity over 24 hours for patients treated with Caldolor, even though morphine was available on an as-needed basis.

- **Additional studies**: In a study of patients who had undergone elective abdominal or orthopedic surgery, 406 patients (87 men, 319 women) were randomized to receive Caldolor 400 mg, Caldolor 800 mg, or placebo administered every 6 hours (started intra-operatively), along with morphine on an as-needed basis. This study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in outcome between patients receiving Caldolor 800 mg or 400 mg and placebo, although there were trends favoring the active treatments.

An additional study of orthopedic surgical pain confirmed the findings of the study of abdominal surgical pain. A total of 185 patients were randomized and treated with Caldolor 800 mg or placebo administered every 6 hours (started pre-operatively) and morphine administered on an as-needed basis.

### Aspirin-responsive gene switch regulating therapeutic protein expression [^113ACzUW]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In this context, aspirin, a globally recognized medication with a rich medical history, is a compelling candidate. The medical use of willow bark extracts to treat fever, cold, and pain dates back thousands of years. In the 19th century, scientists isolated and synthesized the active compound in willow bark, salicylic acid (SA). Its derivative, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), was later developed as a more palatable and stable form, mass-produced under the name aspirin. It quickly became one of the most commonly used and affordable medications in modern society.

Aspirin's multifaceted therapeutic profile encompasses analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet properties, making it a go-to medication for many common ailments such as headaches, muscle aches, and arthritis. Indeed, one of the most well-established benefits of ASA is its ability to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, notably heart attacks and strokes, due to its antiplatelet activity. Consequently, ASA is widely recommended for individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease, including those with a history of heart attack or stroke, as well as those grappling with high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol levels.

Furthermore, recent investigations have expanded our understanding of its potential. For example, low-dose ASA is prescribed to pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia. ASA also shows promise in inhibiting tumor growth, suppressing metastasis, and enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. There is also evidence that it reduces colorectal cancer risk, showcasing its vast therapeutic scope.

### Open-label placebo treatment in chronic low back pain: a randomized controlled trial [^115Ku3V5]. Pain (2016). High credibility.

During baseline interviews, we obtained data on participant demographics, including age, gender, years of education, employment status, pain medication, and complementary medicine usage. Outcomes were measured at baseline and after 11 and 21 days using paper and pencil questionnaires. Participants on the TAU arm who agreed to participate in a 3-week OLP follow-up responded again to the questionnaires 21 days later. There was no midterm visit during the 3-week open-label follow-up.

Following validated procedures in research on chronic low back pain (cLBP), our a priori primary outcomes were a change from baseline at 3 weeks in lower back pain intensity during the prior week and dysfunction related to lower back pain. Pain intensity was assessed by asking participants to rate their pain using 3 standard Numeric Rating Scales, ranging from 0 ("no pain") to 10 ("worst pain imaginable"), scoring maximum pain, minimum pain, and usual pain. The mean of the 3 measures was our primary pain outcome. Our other primary outcome was back-related dysfunction, which was measured using the validated Portuguese adaptation of the Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire. The Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire includes 24 yes or no statements about difficulties in daily activities, such as difficulties in getting dressed and climbing stairs. The overall score is a sum of positive responses, ranging from 0 to 24, with a higher score signifying more disability. Our secondary measure was bothersomeness, assessed by

### Treatment of low back pain with a herbal or synthetic anti-rheumatic: A randomized controlled study. Willow bark extract for low back pain [^113WpBDj]. Rheumatology (2001). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of a proprietary extract of willow bark (Assalix) and a selective inhibitor (rofecoxib) of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2).

Methods: An open, randomized, post-marketing study was conducted in an outpatient clinic on two groups of patients aged 18 to 80 years, presenting over a 6-month period with acute exacerbations of low back pain. Using a computer-generated random list, 114 patients were allocated to receive a daily dose of herbal extract containing 240 mg of salicin [PAID (phyto-anti-inflammatory drug) group] and 114 were allocated to receive 12.5 mg of the synthetic COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib [NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) group]. The doses were chosen according to existing recommendations. All patients were free to use whatever additional conventional treatments were thought necessary. The outcome measures were a modified Arhus index, its pain component, and the Total Pain Index.

Results: The groups were well-matched. After 4 weeks of treatment, the Arhus index had improved by about 20%, its pain component by about 30%, and the Total Pain Index by about 35%. The number of pain-free patients (visual analogue scale score ≤ 5 and ≥ 30% in the Total Pain Index relative to its baseline) increased significantly. The improvement was also reflected reasonably well in the physicians' and patients' judgments of the effectiveness of treatment, which were largely concordant. Few patients from either group resorted to additional treatments.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^117XNc49]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Approximately 70–74% of the general adult population and 55–76% of service members use dietary supplements, often basing their choices on advice from both reliable and unreliable sources. The evidence supporting the benefits of using dietary supplements for pain management over any potential harms is unclear. Although supplements are often perceived to have fewer adverse events than conventional treatments, the safety of many products remains unknown. Many have not been assessed for safety or efficacy, nor have they been prepared according to Good Manufacturing Processes. A large number of dietary and herbal supplements may contain various toxins as they do not undergo standard regulatory and quality control.

Since dietary ingredients could potentially offer a promising self-care intervention, it is crucial to clearly determine their safety and efficacy for pain management and their impact on other outcomes, such as psychological health and quality of life. If these products are to be used for mitigating musculoskeletal pain, evidence-based research is necessary to inform appropriate and safe decisions regarding the available ingredients.

The purpose of this project, as part of the US Special Operations Command's Preservation of the Force and Family Behavioral Health Program, was to determine whether research on dietary ingredients for chronic musculoskeletal pain provided sufficient evidence to inform decisions for both clinical practice and self-care use. To achieve this goal, state-of-the-science evaluations were conducted.

### Herbal medicine for low-back pain [^113ZAPZ4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Low-back pain (LBP) is a common condition that imposes a substantial economic burden on people living in industrialized societies. A large proportion of people with chronic LBP use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in treating people with LBP. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for non-specific LBP.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases up to September 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal, and PubMed. We also checked reference lists in review articles, guidelines, retrieved trials, and personally contacted individuals with expertise in this area.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub-acute, or chronic non-specific LBP. The interventions were herbal medicines, which we defined as plants used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function.

- **Data collection and analysis**: A library scientist with the Cochrane Back Review Group conducted the database searches. One review author contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. We downloaded full references and abstracts of the identified studies and retrieved a hard copy of each study for final inclusion decisions. Two review authors assessed risk of bias and GRADE criteria.

### Herbal medicinal products or preparations for neuropathic pain [^116zbUPb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a consequence of damage to the central nervous system (CNS), for example, cerebrovascular accident, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury, or peripheral nervous system (PNS), for example, painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), or surgery. Evidence suggests that people suffering from neuropathic pain are likely to seek alternative modes of pain relief such as herbal medicinal products due to adverse events brought about by pharmacological agents used to treat neuropathic pain. This review includes studies in which participants were treated with herbal medicinal products (topically or ingested) who had experienced neuropathic pain for at least three months.

- **Objectives**: To assess the analgesic efficacy and effectiveness of herbal medicinal products or preparations for neuropathic pain, and the adverse events associated with their use.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED to March 2018. We identified additional studies from the reference lists of the retrieved papers. We also searched trials registries for ongoing trials and contacted experts in the field for relevant data in terms of published, unpublished, or ongoing studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (including cross-over designs) of double-blind design, assessing efficacy of herbal treatments for neuropathic pain compared to placebo, no intervention, or any other active comparator. Participants were 18 years and above and had been suffering.

### Patient experience and perspective on medical cannabis as an alternative for musculoskeletal pain management [^1143QLCv]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The increasing use of opioids for pain management has raised concerns about their potential for abuse and dangerous adverse effects. Currently, the United States accounts for 80% of global opioid consumption, generating a narcotic crisis that costs approximately $78.5 billion annually. This situation has led to an increase in the number of deaths due to opioid overdose, with more than 750,000 deaths in the United States since 1999. Additionally, a 1.68 million person-year life loss was reported in 2016, with the highest incidence among individuals aged 24 and 25 years, accounting for 20% of the deaths.

Contrarily, opioid misuse is another critical concern, with statistics ranging from 21% to 29% in patients with chronic pain and 4% to 6% in patients transitioning to heroin use. Persistent opioid use has been associated with reasons other than the intensity of surgical pain, creating a harmful situation for patients due to the disproportionate use of these narcotics.

### SPL drug information for capsaicin [^116zRNPC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Capsaicin, also known as Qutenza, is indicated for several uses.

- **Labeled indications**: Symptomatic relief of pain in adults, including moderate-to-severe pain, and symptomatic relief of musculoskeletal pain in adults.

- **Off-label indications**: Symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis in adults.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^111Qt12s]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Recommendations were based on conditions and factors considered specific to SOF populations. The HERB only recommended ingredients that showed a benefit and did not negatively impact other areas, such as alleviating bodily pain but increasing financial stress due to the cost of an ingredient.

- **Evidence-based recommendations**: The HERB grouped recommendations for practice into three tiers based on their collective judgment. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASUs), capsaicin, curcuma, glucosamine prescription (Rx) and over-the-counter (OTC), melatonin, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and vitamin D. Ginger was also conditionally recommended but only as a food source; no recommendation for use as a dietary supplement could be made at this time. No recommendations were made for boswellia, rose hip, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe). Lastly, recommendations were made against the use of collagen, creatine, devil's claw, L-carnitine, methylsulfonylmethane, pycnogenol, willow bark extract, and vitamin E.

Specific details regarding the resulting evidence-based recommendations are provided in subsequent articles within this series.

### Dietary ingredients requiring further research before evidence-based recommendations can be made for their use as an approach to mitigating pain [^11752FAc]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The methodological processes and steps taken allowed for transparent and evidence-based recommendations to be made to inform policy decisions regarding the use of dietary ingredients for chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and other related symptoms. No recommendations were made for the use of SAMe, ginger, boswellia, or rose hips as dietary supplements; however, the factors required to move the evidence toward better decisions are transparently documented. Stakeholders can use this evidence gained and factors considered as a decision aid when determining directions for the next steps in research. As noted in the second paper within this series, dietary ingredients are not intended to treat any particular health condition, and as MSK pain is a clinical condition, any ingredient or combination of ingredients would be required to go through the FDA Investigational New Drug Applications process.

### Percocet [^116B7iwA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Percocet is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Due to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids — a risk present at any dosage or duration — reserve Percocet for patients for whom alternative treatment options, such as non-opioid analgesics, have either not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, and have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia [see WARNINGS]. Percocet should not be used for an extended period unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for low back pain, specifically concerning alternative and complementary medicine (herbal products), the WHO 2023 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend the following products for adult patients with chronic primary low back pain (LBP):

- **Brazilian arnica**: (Solidago chilensis)
- **Ginger**: (Zingiber officinale Roscoe)
- **Topical white lily**: (Lilium candidum)
- **Topical combination herbal compress**
- **Topical combination herbal transdermal patch**.

### Butrans [^111wvDy4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Butrans has been evaluated in four 12-week double-blind, controlled clinical trials in opioid-naïve and opioid-experienced patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain or osteoarthritis. Pain scores were used as the primary efficacy variable. Two of these studies, described below, demonstrated efficacy in patients with low back pain, while one study in low back pain and one study in osteoarthritis did not show a statistically significant pain reduction for either Butrans or the respective active comparators.

- **12-week study in opioid-naïve patients with chronic low back pain**: A total of 1,024 patients with chronic low back pain who were suboptimally responsive to their non-opioid therapy entered an open-label, dose-titration period for up to four weeks. Patients initiated therapy with three days of treatment with Butrans 5 mcg/hour. After three days, if adverse events were tolerated, the dose was increased to Butrans 10 mcg/hour. If adverse effects were tolerated but adequate analgesia was not reached, the dose was increased to Butrans 20 mcg/hour for an additional 10–12 days. Patients who achieved adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects on Butrans 10 or 20 mcg/hour were then randomized to remain on their titrated dose of Butrans or matching placebo. Fifty-three percent of the patients who entered the open-label titration period were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week, double-blind treatment period. Twenty-three percent of patients discontinued due to an adverse event.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^115PuDnb]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

For continuous data, standardized mean differences (SMDs) were computed as the difference between groups in pre–post change scores using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version 3.3.070 (CMA; Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). When standard deviations for change scores were not reported, they were calculated from pre- and post-SDs, using \(r = 0.5 \) for the product–moment correlation. For studies with dichotomous outcomes, the risk difference (RD) between dietary ingredient and placebo groups (i.e. the percentage of responders with improvement, medication use, and adverse events) was calculated using Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager (RevMan) software (version 5.2.7). Meta-analyses of SMDs and RDs were performed with the generic inverse model of RevMan.

Random-effects models were used. Statistical heterogeneity was examined by Cochrane's Q test and \(I^2 \), with low, moderate, and high \(I^2 \) values of 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively. A \(P \) value of less than 0.05 was set as the level of significance. SMDs of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 were considered small, medium, and large, respectively, according to Cohen's d. Pooled effect sizes for the pain-related outcome of primary interest were translated into the VAS (0–100) for ease of clinical interpretation by using a standard deviation of 25 points. Note that translations should be interpreted with caution as controversy remains on what is considered clinically "relevant".

The overall quality of the body of evidence and confidence in the effect estimates for each of the outcomes, as compared with placebo, was assessed using the Grading of Recommendat…

### Management of chronic pain using complementary and integrative medicine [^112LTsFM]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) encompasses both Western-style medicine and complementary health approaches as a new combined approach to treat a variety of clinical conditions. Chronic pain is the leading indication for the use of CIM, with about 33% of adults and 12% of children in the US having used it in this context. Although advances have been made in treatments for chronic pain, it remains inadequately controlled for many people. Adverse effects and complications of analgesic drugs, such as addiction, kidney failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding, also limit their use. CIM offers a multimodality treatment approach that can tackle the multidimensional nature of pain with fewer or no serious adverse effects.

This review focuses on the use of CIM in three conditions with a high incidence of chronic pain: back pain, neck pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. It summarizes research on the mechanisms of action and clinical studies on the efficacy of commonly used CIM modalities such as acupuncture, mind-body systems, dietary interventions and fasting, and herbal medicine and nutrients.

### Dsuvia [^1149cMYs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Dsuvia is indicated for use in adults in certified, medically supervised healthcare settings such as hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments, for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic when alternative treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Not for home use or for use in children. Discontinue treatment with Dsuvia before patients leave the certified, medically supervised healthcare setting. Dsuvia should not be used for more than 72 hours as its use beyond this duration has not been studied. It must be administered only by a healthcare provider. Due to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], reserve Dsuvia for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products) have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, or have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.

Dsuvia contains sufentanil, an opioid agonist, and is indicated for use in adults in certified medically supervised healthcare settings.

### Complementary and alternative medicine for postoperative pain: A systematic review [^117Sv3u5]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of postoperative pain is an ongoing challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. Poorly controlled pain is associated with poorer patient outcomes, and the prescription of opioids may lead to prolonged, nonmedical use. Complementary and alternative medicine is widely adopted by the general public, and its use in chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions has been studied; however, its efficacy in a postoperative context has not yet been established.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic literature review of 10 databases to identify all relevant publications. We extracted variables related to pain measurement and postoperative opioid prescriptions.

- **Results**: We identified 8 relevant publications from an initial pool of 2,517 items. Of these, 5 were randomized studies and 3 were nonrandomized studies. All 8 studies addressed postoperative pain, with 5 showing significant decreases (p < 0.05) in postoperative pain. Additionally, 5 studies addressed postoperative opioid use, with 2 showing significant differences (p < 0.05) in opioid consumption. Substantial heterogeneity among the studies precluded meta-analysis. No articles were found to be free of potential bias.

- **Conclusions**: Currently, there is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of complementary and alternative medicines for postoperative pain management or as an alternative to opioid use following orthopaedic surgery.

### Cebranopadol, a novel first-in-class analgesic drug candidate: First experience in patients with chronic low back pain in a randomized clinical trial [^115kaNgY]. Pain (2017). High credibility.

- **Methods**: We conducted the first human phase II, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel group trial with cebranopadol in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain (LBP) with and without a neuropathic pain component. Patients were recruited from 79 investigational sites across 11 European countries from November 2012 to July 2014. The clinical trial protocol, amendments, and informed consent forms were approved by the relevant regulatory authorities and ethical committees; all patients provided written informed consent before entry into the trial. The EudraCT trial number is 2012–001920–36, and the identifier is NCT01725087.

- **Trial population**: The trial included male and female patients aged 18 to 80 years with a clinical diagnosis of chronic LBP of nonmalignant origin, where moderate-to-severe pain had been present for at least 3 months. Patients were required to be on stable opioid or non-opioid analgesic medication with regular intake for at least 3 months and to be dissatisfied with their analgesic treatment. An average 24-hour analgesic medication-free baseline pain score of ≥ 5 on the 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) was required during the 3 days preceding randomization. Patients were deemed ineligible if they had chronic LBP potentially associated with a specific spinal cause or conditions other than LBP that could confound the self-evaluation of pain. Patients who had undergone recent or more than one previous low back surgery, any invasive procedure aimed at reducing LBP, or any kind of neuromodulation were excluded.

### Oral herbal therapies for treating osteoarthritis [^114pc1bW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Medicinal plant products are used orally to treat osteoarthritis. Although their mechanisms of action have not yet been elucidated in full detail, interactions with common inflammatory mediators provide a rationale for using them to treat osteoarthritic complaints.

- **Objectives**: To update a previous Cochrane review to assess the benefits and harms of oral medicinal plant products in treating osteoarthritis.

- **Search methods**: We searched electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform) until 29 August 2013, without language restrictions, and we examined reference lists from retrieved trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of orally consumed herbal interventions compared with placebo or active controls in people with osteoarthritis were included. Herbal interventions included any plant preparation but excluded homeopathy or aromatherapy products, or any preparation of synthetic origin.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors used standard methods for trial selection and data extraction, assessing the quality of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach for major outcomes such as pain, function, radiographic joint changes, quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events, total adverse events, and serious adverse events.

- **Main results**: Forty-nine randomized controlled studies (33 interventions, 5980 participants) were included. Seventeen studies of confirmatory design (sample and effect sizes pre-specified) were mostly at moderate risk of bias. The remaining 32 studies…

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): Current therapies and topical treatment option with high-concentration capsaicin [^113rfGEJ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

- **Cannabinoids**: Clinical trials provide little medical evidence that cannabinoid-based medicines are effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study with 16 patients also could not support a substantial benefit of cannabinoids in treating CIPN. According to the guideline of the German Society for Neurology, cannabinoids are not recommended for the treatment of neuropathic pain of any origin, as efficacy is low and the rate of side effects is high. In individual cases, and upon failure of other therapeutic options, treatment with cannabinoids may be considered in the context of multimodal pain therapy.

- **Pharmacological intervention — topical therapies**:

	- **Patches**:
		- **Lidocaine**: The lidocaine patch (700 mg) is approved for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia but has also been suggested by guidelines for the treatment of localized neuropathic pain of other origins, including CIPN. However, randomized clinical trials proving efficacy in CIPN are missing at the time of writing. Lidocaine patches might be used as a second-line option for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain, especially in cases of intolerability of oral medications (e.g. in elderly patients).

		- **Capsaicin**: In Europe, the capsaicin patch (179 mg) is approved for the topical treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain as monotherapy or in combination with other pharmaceutical products for pain treatment. The guideline of the German Society for Neurology recommends the capsaicin 179 mg patch for any kind of neuropathic pain as a second-line therapy. The effect is comparable.
