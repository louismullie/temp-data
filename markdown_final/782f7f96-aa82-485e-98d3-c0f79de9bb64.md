## Question

explain hazard ratio of 0.54

---

## Answer

> Let's see… hat do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of how to interpret a hazard ratio of 0.54, including its definition, mathematical meaning, common misinterpretations, clinical implications, and how to contextualize it with confidence intervals and alternatives like RMST and risk ratios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition of a hazard ratio and what it actually estimates. Then, I should verify the mathematical interpretation of 0.54 and translate that into plain language. Next, I will examine common pitfalls, especially the temptation to equate HR with relative risk. After that, I should review clinical examples where HR ≈ 0.54 appears and what that means in practice. Finally, I will consider assumptions, confidence intervals, and complementary metrics like RMST to give a balanced, clinically useful interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't gloss over fundamentals. A hazard ratio is the ratio of instantaneous event rates between two groups at any given time, conditional on having survived to that time point; it does not directly convey cumulative risk or absolute differences, which is a key limitation clinicians often overlook [^111i5aKK] [^112GjxDE].

> Now, I will interpret the mathematics of 0.54. An HR of 0.54 means the hazard in the treatment group is 0.54 times that of the control group, which corresponds to a 46% reduction in the instantaneous risk of the event at any time point, assuming proportional hazards and holding other covariates constant; wait, let me verify the subtraction, yes, 1 − 0.54 = 0.46, so a 46% relative reduction in hazard, not necessarily a 46% reduction in cumulative risk [^113cZRwa] [^112GjxDE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk reduction. I need to ensure we distinguish hazard from cumulative risk. The HR does not tell us the absolute risk reduction or the relative risk at a fixed time point; when events are rare, HR can approximate relative risk, but when events are common, HR diverges from relative risk and can overstate benefit if misread as RR, so I should double-check the event frequency before translating HR into "percent risk reduction" language [^112GjxDE].

> Next, I should review concrete clinical contexts where HR ≈ 0.54 has been reported to anchor interpretation. In the EMBRACA trial for BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer, talazoparib versus chemotherapy yielded a PFS HR of 0.54, indicating a substantial reduction in the hazard of progression or death; similarly, in the SURVET VTE prevention study, sulodexide reduced recurrent VTE with an adjusted HR of 0.45, and the incidence risk ratio was 0.54, illustrating how HR and RR can align when events are infrequent; in COMPASS PAD, rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduced major adverse limb events with an HR of 0.54, again reflecting a large hazard reduction for limb outcomes; finally, in NAFLD, statins were associated with a 46% reduction in hepatic decompensation and mortality with HR ≈ 0.54, underscoring consistent clinical signals across diverse domains [^114U49SG] [^111xHGdo] [^114eEp6W] [^1142u33H].

> I should confirm the proportional hazards assumption because it underpins HR interpretability. If hazards are not proportional over time, the single HR is an average that can obscure early versus late effects; violations are common in oncology and immunotherapy, and alternatives like RMST or time-varying models should be considered to avoid misleading summaries, so I need to check for nonproportionality before overinterpreting a single HR value [^116XgaA6] [^116jznTF] [^114PgdUa].

> Let me consider the confidence interval carefully. A 95% CI around HR = 0.54 that excludes 1.0 supports statistical significance at α = 0.05, but I should remember that CIs on the HR scale are asymmetric on the natural log scale; compatibility interpretations and log transformation help communicate uncertainty more transparently, so I should double-check how the CI was calculated and reported before making strong claims [^1125t5wE].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is about absolute benefit rather than relative hazard. I need to check whether absolute risk reduction, number needed to treat, or RMST were reported, because HR alone can appear large while absolute gains are modest; for example, across oncology RCTs, median PFS gains are often in the 1–3 month range despite HRs around 0.5–0.7, and RMST provides a time-based, clinically intuitive complement that avoids proportional hazards assumptions, so I should verify whether RMST or landmark analyses accompany the HR [^116jznTF] [^115M1ypM] [^111pDr4y].

> I will now examine competing risks and model choice, because in settings like cardiovascular disease or transplant, death from other causes can distort simple HR interpretations. If the clinical goal is estimating cumulative incidence or prognosis, subdistribution hazard models may be more appropriate than cause-specific Cox models; I should confirm whether the analysis accounted for competing events when interpreting an HR of 0.54 in those contexts [^116jg9j7] [^114QJPJ7].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, clinically useful statement. An HR of 0.54 indicates that, at any instant, the treated group experiences about 46% lower instantaneous risk of the event compared with control, assuming proportional hazards; this is a relative effect that does not specify absolute risk reduction or time horizon, so I should pair it with absolute event rates, RMST, or NNT to guide shared decision-making and avoid overpromising benefit [^112GjxDE] [^113cZRwa] [^111pDr4y].

> Finally, I should double-check for internal consistency and note limitations. HRs are powerful for detecting early separation of survival curves but can be unstable with few events, sensitive to censoring patterns, and potentially biased in early-stopped trials; therefore, I need to review event counts, follow-up maturity, and whether bias-adjusted or sensitivity analyses were presented before concluding that an HR of 0.54 translates into a clinically meaningful benefit for patients [^1153Dndt] [^116XgaA6].

A hazard ratio of 0.54 means the treatment group has a **46% lower instantaneous risk** of the event (e.g. death, progression) at any given time compared with the control group, assuming proportional hazards [^112GjxDE] [^114PgdUa]. This is a **relative effect** that does not directly translate to a 46% absolute risk reduction; the actual benefit depends on baseline risk and time horizon [^112GjxDE] [^113L7WH9]. For example, if control risk is 20% at 1 year, the treated risk is about 12% (a 46% relative reduction), but if control risk is 2%, the absolute reduction is only ~0.9% [^112GjxDE]. Always interpret the hazard ratio alongside confidence intervals, p-values, and absolute risk differences to assess clinical significance [^1125t5wE] [^112TvXxJ].

---

## Mathematical interpretation

Mathematically, an HR of 0.54 indicates that, at any time, the hazard (instantaneous event rate) in the treatment group is **54% of that in the control group**, corresponding to a **46% reduction in hazard** [^112GjxDE]. This assumes the proportional hazards assumption holds (i.e. the relative hazard is constant over time) [^114PgdUa].

---

## Clinical interpretation

Clinically, an HR of 0.54 suggests a **substantial treatment benefit**, reducing the hazard of the event by 46% [^112GjxDE]. However, this is a **relative measure**; the absolute risk reduction depends on the baseline risk and follow-up duration [^112GjxDE].

---

## Examples from medical literature

Several studies report HRs around 0.54, illustrating **practical interpretation**:

- **Talazoparib in metastatic breast cancer**: In the EMBRACA trial, talazoparib reduced the hazard of progression or death by 46% (HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.71) compared with chemotherapy [^113hGPBi] [^114U49SG].

- **Statins in NAFLD**: Statins reduced hepatic decompensation and mortality by 46% (HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46–0.62) in patients with NAFLD [^1142u33H].

- **Colonoscopy and colorectal cancer**: Normal colonoscopy reduced incident colorectal cancer by 46% (HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31–0.94) over 10 years [^112UfykN].

---

## Limitations and considerations

When interpreting an HR of 0.54, **consider the following**:

- **Proportional hazards assumption**: The HR assumes constant relative risk over time; violations can complicate interpretation [^114PgdUa] [^116XgaA6].

- **Confidence intervals**: Always consider the 95% CI; if it includes 1.0, the effect may not be statistically significant [^1125t5wE].

- **Absolute risk reduction**: HRs are relative; absolute risk reduction depends on baseline risk and follow-up duration [^113L7WH9] [^112GjxDE].

- **Clinical significance**: Evaluate whether the observed effect size is clinically meaningful in the specific context [^113L7WH9].

## Interpretation of hazard ratio 0.54

| **Aspect** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|
| Mathematical meaning | Hazard in treatment group is 54% of control group |
| Relative risk reduction | 46% reduction in hazard |
| Clinical significance | Substantial benefit, but depends on baseline risk |
| Assumption | Proportional hazards |
| Limitations | - Absolute risk reduction varies <br/> - Confidence intervals must be considered |

---

A hazard ratio of 0.54 indicates a **46% reduction in the hazard** of the event in the treatment group compared with the control group, representing a substantial relative benefit. The absolute clinical impact depends on baseline risk and follow-up duration, so always interpret HRs alongside confidence intervals, p-values, and absolute risk differences [^112GjxDE].

### Interpretation of time-to-event outcomes in randomized trials: an online randomized experiment [^112GjxDE]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Time-to-event outcomes are paramount in cancer randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In this context, the hazard ratio (HR) is increasingly used to measure treatment effects. The HR does not provide any information on the cumulative risks of the outcome, but it may be misinterpreted as a relative risk (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Illustrative examples for the interpretation of hazard ratio, relative risk, and difference in restricted mean survival times. (A) The cumulative risk of death at 24 months is 95%. Because the outcome is frequent, it follows that the HR of 0.66 (95% CI 0.55–0.80) differs from the RR of 0.87 (0.82–0.91). Misinterpreting this HR as an RR leads to overestimating the reduction in risk of mortality. The correct interpretation of the HR is that, on a given day, an individual still at risk on the experimental treatment is 0.66 times as likely to experience death compared with an individual on the control treatment. In contrast, the RR indicates a 13% reduction in mortality risk at 24 months with the experimental treatment when compared with the control treatment (or equivalently a relative risk reduction of 13%). Finally, the RMSTD indicates a 2.68-month gain in life expectancy over 24 months for those on the experimental treatment when compared with control. (B) The cumulative risk of event at 24 months is 14%. Because the outcome is relatively infrequent, it follows that the HR of 0.58 (0.36–0.94) approximates the RR of 0.54 (0.52–0.57). The RMSTD is small, indicating that those on the experimental treatment live only 0.59 months longer, on average, compared with those on the control treatment. In any case, at any time point t, the hazard (or rate) of death pertains only to participants still at risk of death; the hazard ratio compares the experimental and control groups with respect to the instantaneous risks of death at time t only within participants surviving up to t; in contrast, the relative risk compares the cumulative risks of dying up to time t; the difference in restricted mean survival times quantifies the gain (or loss) in event-free survival over the time interval from 0 to t.

This brief communication will clarify the difference between a relative hazard and a relative risk. We highlight the importance of this difference, and demonstrate in practical terms that 1 minus the hazard ratio should not be interpreted as a risk reduction in the commonly understood sense of the term. This article aims to provide a better understanding of the type of risk reduction that a hazard ratio implies, thereby clarifying the intent in the communication among practitioners and researchers and establishing an accurate and realistic foundation for communicating with patients.

### Comparison of treatment effects measured by the hazard ratio and by the ratio of restricted mean survival times in oncology randomized controlled trials [^116jznTF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to compare empirically the treatment effects measured by the hazard ratio (HR) and by the difference (and ratio) of restricted mean survival times (RMST) in oncology randomized trials.

Methods

We selected oncology randomized controlled trials from five leading journals during the last 6 months of 2014. We reconstructed individual patient data for one time-to-event outcome from each trial, preferably the primary outcome. We reanalyzed each trial and compared the treatment effect estimated by the HR with that by the difference (and ratio) of RMST. We estimated an average ratio of the HR to the ratio of RMST; an average ratio less than one indicates more optimistic assessments with HRs.

Results

We analyzed 54 randomized controlled trials totaling 33,212 patients. The selected outcome was overall survival in 21 (39%) trials. There was evidence of nonproportionality of hazards in 13 (24%) trials. The HR and RMST-based measures were in agreement regarding the statistical significance of the effect, except in one case. The median HR was 0.84 (Q1 to Q3 range, 0.67 to 0.97) and the median difference in RMST was 1.12 months (range, 0.22 to 2.75 months). The average ratio of the HR to the ratio of RMST was 1.11 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.15), with substantial between-trial variability (I² = 86%). Results were consistent by outcome type (overall survival v other outcomes) and whether the proportional hazard assumption held or not.

Conclusion

On average, the HR provided significantly larger treatment effect estimates than the ratio of RMST. The HR may seem large when the absolute effect is small. RMST-based measures should be routinely reported in randomized trials with time-to-event outcomes.

Treatment Outcomes for Overall Survival, Progression-Free Survival, and Tumor Response

Abbreviations: HR, hazard ratio; IQR, interquartile range; OR, odds ratio; RCT, randomized clinical trial; RR, relative risk.

The combined risk of tumor progression or death (PFS) associated with any condition was lower by a mean of 48% (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.47–0.57; I² = 88%), with a median PFS increase of 2.70 months (IQR, 1.61–4.29 months; range, 0.10–14.70 months) (Table 3 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The median HR for PFS across all studies was 0.55 (IQR, 0.40–0.67; range, 0.16–0.92). Patients who received the novel treatment had a 2.37-fold higher tumor response (95% CI, 2.00–2.80; I² = 91%) (Figure 2 and Table 3). The median RR for tumor response across all studies was 2.58 (IQR, 1.51–8.60; range, 1.00–60.45). In 27 of 54 RCTs (50.0%) that reported HRs, the 95% CIs of the HRs for OS were compatible with shorter survival times (ie, values > 1.0). This compatibility with shorter PFS times was also observed for PFS in 8 of 54 RCTs (14.8%). In 5 of 54 RCTs (9.3%), the reported 95% CI was compatible with unfavorable outcomes for both PFS and OS.

### Assessment of hazard ratios in oncology clinical trials terminated early for superiority: a systematic review [^1153Dndt]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do bias-adjusted hazard ratios differ from unadjusted hazard ratios when oncology clinical trials are stopped for efficacy at the interim analysis?

Findings

In this systematic review of 19 clinical trials, 2 bias-adjusted hazard ratios — calculated using conditional mean-adjusted estimator and weighted conditional mean-adjusted estimator — were distinct from the unadjusted hazard ratio in small trials. Larger differences between the unadjusted and bias-adjusted values were observed when the estimated hazard ratio was greater than 0.5.

Meaning

These findings suggest presenting the bias-adjusted hazard ratios, along with the unadjusted hazard ratio, in the data monitoring committee meeting because bias-adjusted estimators may play an important role in the committee's decision.

### How Do the accrual pattern and follow-up duration affect the hazard ratio estimate when the proportional hazards assumption is violated? [^116XgaA6]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

In randomized clinical trials, the magnitude of the treatment effect is often reported using the hazard ratio (HR) even when the proportional hazards (PH) assumption is not met. Conducting numerical studies, this commentary illustrates how/why the HR estimate via the standard Cox's procedure is difficult to interpret even as an "average" treatment effect for non‐PH cases.

### Cox proportional hazard ratios overestimate survival benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors: cox-TEL adjustment and meta-analyses of programmed death-ligand 1 expression and immune checkpoint inhibitor survival benefit [^113pL2Vx]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Survival benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in lung cancer is not fully understood.

Methods

PubMed-cataloged publications through February 14, 2022, were queried for randomized controlled trials of ICI in lung cancer, and identified publications were reviewed for inclusion. Reported Cox hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival were transformed to Cox-TEL HR for ICI short-term survivors (ST-HR) and difference in proportions for patients with long-term survival (LT-DP). Meta-analyses were performed using a frequentist random-effect model. Outcomes of interest were pooled overall survival Cox HR, ST-HR, and LT-DP in NSCLC, stratified by programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) level (primary outcome) and ICI treatment line (secondary).

Results

A total of nine publications representing eight clinical trials were selected for meta-analysis. Primary analysis yielded the following metrics for patients with PD-L1 expression less than 1%, more than or equal to 1%, and more than or equal to 50%, respectively: pooled Cox HR, 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62–0.82), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.68–0.82), and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.54–0.70); pooled ST-HR, 0.91 (95% CI: 0.79–1.05), 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82–0.94), and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.60–0.83); and pooled LT-DP, 0.10 (95% CI: 0.00–0.20), 0.09 (95% CI: 0.06–0.12), and 0.11 (95% CI: 0.05–0.17). Results of secondary analysis revealed LT-DP of approximately 10% across treatment lines.

Conclusions

This study reveals an approximately 10% long-term survival probability increment in ICI long-term survivors across PD-L1-positive subpopulations in both ICI treatment lines. Furthermore, ST-HR was consistently poorer than Cox HR. For patients with PD-L1 less than 1%, neither LT-DP nor ST-HR achieved statistical significance. The analysis provides greater insight into the treatment effect of ICI in published trials.

### Survival benefit of coronary-artery bypass grafting accounted for deaths in those who remained untreated [^116wnj3H]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort of 8,220 patients with angiographically-proven coronary artery disease and planned surgical revascularization, we compared survival between patients who underwent CABG and those who remained untreated after the decision to treat was made. We found that the hazard of death among patients who underwent CABG was 51 percent of that in the untreated group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.51 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.61]). The effect was stronger when patients underwent surgery shortly after the treatment decision (adjusted hazard ratios 0.43 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.53] and 0.58 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.70] for early and late intervention, respectively). Relative to untreated patients, the hazard of death for those who underwent CABG was 46 percent lower in the semi-urgent group and 55 percent lower in the non-urgent group (adjusted hazard ratios 0.54 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.66] and 0.45 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.63], respectively).

CABG is indicated to alleviate symptoms and to reduce the risk of death among patients who have limiting angina that persists despite optimal medical treatment and suitable coronary anatomy. To fully evaluate the survival benefit of CABG, the hazard of death for patients who have undergone CABG should be compared with the hazard of death for those who have not undergone the procedure, considering the intervention as an intermediate event in the course of disease. Because the group membership (treated vs. untreated) cannot be defined at the beginning of follow-up, we accomplished this by using the Cox regression with a time-dependent indicator variable for CABG occurrences during the follow-up period after registration for the treatment. The hazard ratio for that variable gives the estimated survival benefit, which a patient for whom surgical revascularization is indicated can interpret as the reduction in the risk of death offered by undergoing CABG relative to remaining untreated. Contrasting post-operative and pre-operative mortality had two premises. The first was that excluding pre-operative deaths and losses to follow-up relating to a longer wait for treatment would imply that survival time begins at the time of the procedure, rather than at the time of the decision to treat. The second was that measuring mortality reduction afforded by undergoing CABG requires an allowance for the possibility that the patient undergoes treatment and dies anyway.

### Standardised survival probabilities: a useful and informative tool for reporting regression models for survival data [^115bzoQL]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Adjusted survival curves using the mean covariate method

A more informative way to summarise the treatment effect is to use adjusted survival probabilities. As mentioned earlier for the Kaplan–Meier estimator, the survival probability at a specific time corresponds to the probability of being event-free at a particular time after the beginning of follow-up (e.g. 5 years after surgery). Even though rarely reported, estimating survival probabilities after fitting a regression model is no more difficult than HRs and it can be obtained using standard statistical software. In a modelling context, when multiple covariates are included in the regression model, adjusted survival probabilities are often estimated using the average covariate value for the adjusting covariates. For the breast cancer example, after fitting the same flexible parametric survival model described earlier for the HR (with hormonal therapy as the treatment of interest and adjusting for various variables), 10 years after surgery the relapse-free survival probability (i.e. the probability of being alive with no relapse) was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.43–0.54) for those who received hormonal therapy and 0.39 (95% CI: 0.36–0.41) for those who did not receive it (Fig. 3). This can also be interpreted in terms of proportions: 48% of those who received hormonal therapy and 39% of those who did not receive hormonal therapy were alive without having a relapse 10 years after surgery. To obtain these estimates, we set all adjusting variables to their mean value, except the treatment that is first set to treated and then untreated, and an adjusted survival curve is estimated for each treatment arm. So, our estimates correspond to the survival probability of an "average" individual if this "average" individual received hormonal therapy and an "average" individual who did not receive hormonal therapy. Thus, a caveat with "naively" adjusted survival curves is the need to calculate an "average" for included variables. For continuous variables, such as age at surgery, the "average" individual in terms of the mean value might be easy to interpret. However, for categorical variables, such as tumour size, it is not clear what an average individual is. The average value for a binary variable such as sex taking values 1 for females and 0 for males corresponds for instance to the proportion of individuals who were females (e.g. if 40% of the individual were females it will be equal to 0.4) and has no meaning on an individual level (as it does not correspond to either females or males). Also, for continuous variables, even though it is more straightforward to think about the mean value, this might still not be relevant to our study population. Imagine for example, a disease that is more common among individuals younger than 25 years old and older than 60 years old. In this example, the average age at diagnosis might not even correspond to a plausible patient profile. A way to overcome this is to obtain adjusted survival curves at fixed values for the adjusting variables but in this way the survival curves will still be restricted to a specific covariate pattern.

### Vibration of effect in more than 16 000 pooled analyses of individual participant data from 12 randomised controlled trials comparing canagliflozin and placebo for type 2 diabetes mellitus: multiverse analysis [^1153v9Cv]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

For the difference in HbA1c, the mean difference was −0.59% (95% confidence interval −0.71% to −46%) at 52 weeks figure 2. The distribution of the mean differences estimated ranged from −0.97% to −0.37% (range of 0.60%), with a median of −0.60% (interquartile range −0.64% to −0.57%). The effect estimates were −0.75% for the first centile and −0.48% for the 99th centile, indicating the absence of a Janus effect. In 15 994 (97.93%) pooled analyses, we observed a statistically significant superiority of canagliflozin over placebo.

For major adverse cardiovascular events, the hazard ratio was 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.92) at 52 weeks figure 2. The distribution of the hazard ratios estimated ranged from 0.05 to 2.76 (range of 2.71), with a median of 0.62 (interquartile range 0.50–0.73). Hazard ratios were 0.20 for the first centile and 0.89 for the 99th centile. Of 8144 meta-analyses, 8100 (99.46%) had hazard ratios in favour of canagliflozin (33.40% (2705/8100) were significant), and 0.54% (44/8144) of the meta-analyses had hazard ratios in favour of placebo (none was significant).

For serious adverse events, the hazard ratio was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 0.96) at 52 weeks figure 3. The distribution of the hazard ratios estimated ranged from 0.38 to 1.88 (range of 1.5), with a median of 0.87 (interquartile range 0.80–0.89). Hazard ratios were 0.59 for the first centile and 1.14 for the 99th centile, indicating the presence of a Janus effect. Of 16 332 meta-analyses, 15 864 (97.13%) had a hazard ratio in favour of canagliflozin (36.27% (5754/15 864) were significant), and 468 (2.87%) had a hazard ratio in favour of placebo (8.33% (39/468) were significant). Figure 4 details overlap between point estimates and confidence intervals confidence intervals for all pooled analyses.

### Breaking free from the hazard ratio: embracing the restricted mean survival time in clinical trials [^111pDr4y]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinicians consider the Cox proportional hazards model to be the default tool of choice for analyzing right-censored time-to-event outcomes in randomized clinical trials. 1 The Cox model estimates the ratio of the hazard of the outcome of interest (e.g., the time to death) between two treatment groups. The hazard is defined as the instantaneous probability of experiencing the event of interest in the next time interval among individuals who had not yet experienced the event. As a statistical measure, the hazard ratio can be difficult to interpret.

### Risks and benefits of anticancer drugs in advanced cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113JPtge]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The overall HR for PFS was 0.58 [95%CI (confidence interval): 0.53–0.63] (Fig. 2 A–C). Average median PFS in the experimental arms was 5.7 months, as compared to 3.6 months in the control arms. The HR improved over time, from 0.87 [95%CI: 0.62–1.23] during the 2000–2005 period to 0.69 [95%CI: 0.61–0.79] during the 2005–2010 period, 0.54 [95%CI: 0.48–0.62] during the 2010–2015 period, and 0.52 [95%CI: 0.46–0.59] during the 2015–2020 period (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2 A). The HR did not differ significantly between trials using a placebo versus trials with BSC only (P = 0.58) (Fig. 2 B). Some statistically significant heterogeneity was observed between treatment classes, with HRs that were less favorable with immunotherapy and hormone therapy (0.75 [95%CI: 0.63–0.88]), as compared to chemotherapy (0.53 [95%CI: 0.43–0.65]) and molecularly targeted agents (0.54 [95%CI: 0.49–0.60]) (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2 C).

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^1142u33H]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

High-risk nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH) management emphasizes cardiometabolic care and specific medication guidance. In high-risk patients, we recommend following standards of care for managing diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, and when possible, preference should be given to diabetes medications with known efficacy in NASH (ie, GLP-1RAs and pioglitazone). Of note, pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and among SGLT2 inhibitors randomized controlled trials have reported a placebo-subtracted reduction in steatosis of approximately 20% with unknown effects on liver histology. Statins can be prescribed to patients with F2–F3 and Child A or B cirrhosis, and a meta-analysis including 13 studies and 121,058 patients showed a 46% reduction in hepatic decompensation (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46–0.62) and 46% lower mortality (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.47–0.61). However, statins do not appear to extend survival in Child class C cirrhosis and, because data in decompensated cirrhosis remain limited, use in these patients should be avoided. There is no safe threshold for alcohol intake in patients with advanced fibrosis.

Lung cancer staging — multimodality staging uptake and outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries — notes that data have shown the staging evaluation has often been carried out very poorly; Farjah et al assessed single (CT scan), bimodality (CT scan plus PET scan or CT scan plus invasive staging), and trimodality (CT, PET, and invasive staging) tests for mediastinal metastases, finding that only 30% had bimodality staging and 5% had trimodality staging, and after adjustment those who underwent bimodality and trimodality staging had a significantly lower risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.56–0.60; tri vs single-modality: hazard ratio, 0.49; 99% CI, 0.45–0.54), with associations maintained after excluding poor-risk groups; results may reflect unidentified residual confounding and better staging may serve as a marker for better care.

### Estimating the lifetime benefits of treatments for heart Failure [^113L7WH9]. JACC: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study compared ways of describing treatment effects. The objective was to better explain to clinicians and patients what they might expect from a given treatment, not only in terms of relative and absolute risk reduction, but also in projections of long-term survival.

Background

The restricted mean survival time (RMST) can be used to estimate of long-term survival, providing a complementary approach to more conventional metrics (e.g. absolute and relative risk), which may suggest greater benefits of therapy in high-risk patients compared with low-risk patients.

Methods

Relative and absolute risk, as well as the RMST, were calculated in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) trials.

Results

As examples, in the RALES trial (more severe HFrEF), the treatment effect metrics for spironolactone versus placebo on heart failure hospitalization and/or cardiovascular death were a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5 to 0.77), number needed to treat = 9 (7 to 14), and age extension of event-free survival +1.1 years (−0.1 to + 2.3 years). The corresponding metrics for EMPHASIS-HF (eplerenone vs. placebo in less severe HFrEF) were 0.64 (0.54 to 0.75), 14 (1 to 22), and +2.9 (1.2 to 4.5). In patients in PARADIGM-HF aged younger than 65 years, the metrics for sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.88), 23 (15 to 44), and +1.7 (0.6 to 2.8) years; for those aged 65 years or older, the metrics were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.94), 29 (17 to 83), and +0.9 (0.2 to 1.6) years, which provided evidence of a greater potential life extension in younger patients. Similar observations were found for lower risk patients.

Conclusions

RMST event-free (and overall) survival estimates provided a complementary means of evaluating the effect of therapy in relation to age and risk. They also provided a clinically useful metric that should be routinely reported and used to explain the potential long-term benefits of a given treatment, especially to younger and less symptomatic patients.

### Sulodexide for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism: the sulodexide in secondary prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (SURVET) study: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111xHGdo]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

The analysis adjusted for age, sex, index event (pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis), country, duration of exposure to VKA, and delay between the end of VKA treatment and randomization confirmed that sulodexide treatment reduced the risk of recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24–0.84; P = 0.01; Figure 2 B). Independent risk factors for recurrent VTE included age (hazard ratio, 1.33 per decade; 95% CI, 1.06–1.65; P = 0.01) and male sex (hazard ratio, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.25–4.78; P = 0.01). No association was found between recurrent VTE and length of exposure to VKA (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.41–1.53; P = 0.48), delay between the end of VKA treatment and randomization (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.37–1.36; P = 0.71), country (P = 0.09), or index event (hazard ratio, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.63–4.44; P = 0.30).

Under the "all failures" assumption, the proportion of failures among control subjects was 48 of 308 or 15.6% (95% CI, 11.7–20.1) and that among treated patients was 26 of 307 or 8.5% (95% CI, 5.6–12.2; P = 0.009, Fisher test). The incidence risk ratio of failure among treated patients was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.35–0.85) versus control subjects. The results of the logistic analysis adjusted for the same confounders indicated for the Cox analysis are reported in the text and in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement.

Applying the nearest-neighbor outcome to the 29 patients lost to follow-up using the propensity score yielded a proportion of events of 30 of 308 (9.7%) among control subjects and 16 of 307 (5.2%) among treated subjects (P = 0.045, Fisher test; incidence risk ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30–0.96).

### Association of thyroid dysfunction with cognitive function: an individual participant data analysis [^111z7arh]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Thyroid Dysfunction and Dementia

Cross-sectional analysis of thyroid dysfunction and dementia were unfeasible owing to few participants who were not euthyroid with dementia at baseline (78 participants among 11 cohorts). In longitudinal analyses among 12 cohorts, no association was found between thyroid dysfunction and incident dementia (Figure 3; eFigure 6 in the Supplement). The hazard ratio of dementia ranged from 1.54 (95% CI, 0.76 to 3.10) for overt hyperthyroidism to 0.79 (95% CI, 0.48 to 1.28) for overt hypothyroidism. Continuous analysis of thyrotropin and FT 4 levels also did not provide evidence for an association; hazard ratio, 0.96 per SD increase of natural log-transformed thyrotropin (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.02; p = 0.16); hazard ratio, 1.05 per SD increase of FT 4 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.13; p = 0.16). Heterogeneity between studies was low (I² = 0%-40%).

Network of all trials: overall mortality

Table 1presents the results of the network meta-analysis of overall mortality in people with and without diabetes. In people with diabetes the estimated hazard ratio for sirolimus eluting compared with bare metal stents was 1.14 (95% credibility interval 0.74 to 1.60), for paclitaxel eluting versus bare metal stents was 1.09 (0.71 to 1.66), and for sirolimus versus paclitaxel eluting stents was 1.02 (0.70 to 1.57), and compatible with both a substantial harm and a moderate benefit of either eluting stent compared with bare metal stents. The corresponding values for people without diabetes were 1.02 (0.77 to 1.29), 0.90 (0.67 to 1.16), and 1.13 (0.83 to 1.54; table 1). A moderate to high inconsistency of 61% was found among people with diabetes, but none among people without diabetes.

*Inconsistency of network expressed as percentage difference in hazard ratios between direct randomised comparisons within trials and indirect comparisons between trials. Values near 0 indicate that all comparisons in network are consistent, showing fully coherent estimates of hazard ratios comparing any two stent types. Values can range from 0% to infinity. The more values deviate from 0%, the more inconsistent the network. A value of 25% may be interpreted to indicate low inconsistency, 50% moderate, and 100% high inconsistency.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113wmNhF]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Hypertension treatment intensity and stroke risk — randomized and meta-analytic evidence indicate benefit of lower blood pressure targets: A rural China cluster–design trial resulted in an SBP/DBP difference of 2.3/1.9 mm Hg with a stroke hazard ratio (HR) of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.60–0.73); a U.S. trial reported a 5-year SBP/DBP difference of 12/4 mm Hg with a stroke HR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.50–0.82); and a Ghana RCT showed an SBP/DBP difference of 9.3/2.8 mm Hg with a stroke HR of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47–0.97). In adults with diabetes, ACCORD BP yielded a stroke HR of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.39–0.89). Individual participant data and network meta-analyses have demonstrated a stroke benefit of more versus less intensive antihypertensive treatment, including an SBP < 130 mm Hg versus higher BP targets, and in type 2 diabetes an achieved SBP of 130 to 134 mm Hg versus 140 to 144 mm Hg had an HR of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.54–0.99).

For survival analysis in comparative coronavirus disease 2019 trials, the routinely used hazard ratio may not provide a meaningful summary of the treatment effect. The mean survival time difference/ratio is an intuitive, assumption-free alternative. However, for short-term studies, landmark mortality rate differences/ratios are more clinically relevant and should be formally analyzed and reported.

### Interpretation of population health metrics: environmental lead exposure as exemplary case [^113nK1VT]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

In 13 946 participants followed up until 31 December 2000 (Table 1), the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 1.34 (95% CI, 1.16–1.54) for total mortality, 1.53 (CI, 1.21–1.94) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.78 (CI, 1.08–2.67) for coronary mortality. In 14 289 individuals followed up until 31 December 2011 (Table 2), the corresponding estimates of relative risk were 1.37 (CI, 1.17–1.60), 1.70 (CI, 1.30–2.22), and 2.08 (CI, 1.52–2.85), respectively. From individual measures of blood lead and their associated hazard ratios, in the 2018 report, PAF (also known as the population impact factor), was computed as the integral of hazard ratios at each blood lead level weighted by the logarithmically transformed population distribution of blood leads over the total range from 0.70 to 56.0 µg/dL. The PAFs amounted to 18.0% (CI, 10.9%–26.1%) for total mortality, 28.7% (CI, 15.5%–39.5%) for cardiovascular mortality, and 37.4% (CI, 23.4%–48.6%) for coronary mortality. Given the annual number of deaths in the United States for total, cardiovascular, and coronary mortality (2 288 888; 891 896; and 494 652, respectively), the estimates of preventable deaths, assuming that blood lead concentrations were all reduced to 1.0 µg/dL or less, amounted to 412 000 (CI, 250 000–598 000) for total mortality, 256 000 (CI, 138 000–352 000) for cardiovascular mortality, and 185 000 (CI, 116 000–241 000) for coronary mortality.

The rate of any ST was low overall and was reduced with ticagrelor 90 mg (0.6% versus 0.9%; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40–0.99; absolute risk reduction, 0.28%; 95% CI, −0.08 to 0.65%) with directional consistency for ticagrelor 60 mg (0.7% versus 0.9%; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.54–1.26; absolute risk reduction, 0.18%; 95% CI, −0.18 to 0.55; p interaction = 0.81). Ticagrelor (doses pooled) numerically reduced any ST in the intention‐to‐treat cohort with a greater apparent effect in the on‐treatment cohort (Figure 3). Similar trends were seen for definite or probable ST and definite ST (Figure 3 and Table 2).

Stent Type

The rate of any ST in the placebo arm was similar across stent types (first‐generation DES: 1.3%; later‐generation DES: 1.0%; BMS; 0.7%; P = 0.071). Ticagrelor was equally efficacious in patients with DES compared with BMS and in those with later‐generation versus first‐generation DES as the most recent stent type received (Figure 4).

### Chemotherapy and targeted therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer that is either endocrine-pretreated or hormone receptor-negative: ASCO guideline update [^113hGPBi]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Olaparib and talazoparib in metastatic breast cancer — progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes and panel interpretation are as follows: In a study including BRCA mutation carriers, olaparib improved median PFS versus standard single-agent chemotherapy overall (7.0 months v 4.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.80; P < .001), but not in the metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive subset (hazard ratio for progression or death 0.91; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.41). EMBRACA randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 431 patients with metastatic HR-positive or triple-negative disease to talazoparib versus standard therapy and showed longer median PFS with talazoparib overall (8.6 months v 5.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.71; P < .001), with improvement in the HR-positive BRCA subgroup (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.71). Given lower toxicity, after 1–2 prior lines of endocrine therapy (ET), "PARP inhibition is preferable to chemotherapy", although the panel notes these trials did not compare against taxanes or platinums and "it is not known whether PARP inhibitors are superior to platinum or taxane chemotherapy in the metastatic setting".

### Colorectal cancer incidence after colonoscopy at ages 45–49 or 50–54 years [^1119q8DD]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence at ages younger than 50 years is increasing, leading to proposals to lower the CRC screening initiation age to 45 years. Data on the effectiveness of CRC screening at ages 45–49 years are lacking.

Methods

We studied the association between undergoing colonoscopy at ages 45–49 or 50–54 years and CRC incidence in a retrospective population-based cohort study using Florida's linked Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project databases with mandated reporting from 2005 to 2017 and Cox models extended for time-varying exposure.

Results

Among 195,600 persons with and 2.6 million without exposure to colonoscopy at ages 45–49 years, 276 and 4844 developed CRC, resulting in CRC incidence rates of 20.8 (95% CI, 18.5–23.4) and 30.6 (95% CI, 29.8–31.5) per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Among 660,248 persons with and 2.4 million without exposure to colonoscopy at ages 50–54 years, 798 and 6757 developed CRC, resulting in CRC incidence rates of 19.0 (95% CI, 17.7–20.4) and 51.9 (95% CI, 50.7–53.1) per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratios for incident CRC after undergoing compared with not undergoing colonoscopy were 0.50 (95% CI, 0.44–0.56) at ages 45–49 years and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.29–0.34) at ages 50–54 years. The results were similar for women and men (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.57 and hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43–0.62 at ages 45–49 years, and hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.31–0.39 and hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.26–0.32 at ages 50–54 years, respectively).

Conclusions

Colonoscopy at ages 45–49 or 50–54 years was associated with substantial decreases in subsequent CRC incidence. These findings can inform screening guidelines.

### Placebo adherence and its association with morbidity and mortality in the studies of left ventricular dysfunction [^1123nBXE]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

As in the Treatment Trial, multivariable adjustment had little effect on the results. The association between placebo adherence and mortality was similar in the bivariate and fully adjusted models for all outcomes except non-CVD mortality, for which adjustment caused substantial attenuation (Table 5).

Table 5
Adjusted Hazard Ratios (and 95% Confidence Intervals) for Association of Placebo Adherence with Mortality and Incident Events in the SOLVD Prevention Trial

e All covariates: all of the above

Significant differences (p < 0.05) indicated in bold type

The Prevention Trial analyses did not support the concept that other serious illness was responsible for both the lower adherence and higher mortality. Unlike the Treatment Trial analyses, the association remained significant after dropping the final total mean adherence measurement (HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.96) or the final two adherence measurements (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.88) in the models using total mean adherence. Results were similar in the models using adherence as a cumulative mean variable (HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.87 with a single lag and HR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.79 with two lags in the adherence variable). Finally, the association was also essentially unchanged when estimated using adherence as a time-dependent variable and using the second (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.86) or third (HR = 0.59 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.98) most recent visit.

### Moving beyond the hazard ratio in quantifying the between-group difference in survival analysis [^114PgdUa]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

In a longitudinal clinical study to compare two groups, the primary end point is often the time to a specific event (eg, disease progression, death). The hazard ratio estimate is routinely used to empirically quantify the between-group difference under the assumption that the ratio of the two hazard functions is approximately constant over time. When this assumption is plausible, such a ratio estimate may capture the relative difference between two survival curves. However, the clinical meaning of such a ratio estimate is difficult, if not impossible, to interpret when the underlying proportional hazards assumption is violated (ie, the hazard ratio is not constant over time). Although this issue has been studied extensively and various alternatives to the hazard ratio estimator have been discussed in the statistical literature, such crucial information does not seem to have reached the broader community of health science researchers. In this article, we summarize several critical concerns regarding this conventional practice and discuss various well-known alternatives for quantifying the underlying differences between groups with respect to a time-to-event end point. The data from three recent cancer clinical trials, which reflect a variety of scenarios, are used throughout to illustrate our discussions. When there is not sufficient information about the profile of the between-group difference at the design stage of the study, we encourage practitioners to consider a prespecified, clinically meaningful, model-free measure for quantifying the difference and to use robust estimation procedures to draw primary inferences.

### Polygenic prediction of recurrent events after early-onset myocardial infarction [^116Wnmek]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The cumulative incidence of recurrent events by PGS category is depicted in Figure 3. After adjustment for age, sex, secondary prevention medications, and 10 principal components, each 1-SD higher PGS was associated with a 21% higher hazard of recurrent events (hazard ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.13–1.31]; P = 4.04×10⁻⁶). Compared with those in the low PGS category, those in the high PGS category had a 57% higher hazard of recurrent events (hazard ratio, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.26–1.96]; P = 5.57×10⁻⁵). There was no evidence of violation of proportional hazards assumptions in the tested modes (Schoenfeld residual P > 0.05).

The discrimination ability of conventional risk factors, PGSs, and monogenic variants for recurrent cardiovascular events is displayed in Figure 4. Compared with smoking (C index, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.52–0.56]), diabetes (C index, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.53–0.57]), obesity (C index, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.52–0.56]), hypertension (C index, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.52–0.56]), family history (C index, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.52–0.56]), and hypercholesterolemia (C index, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.53–0.57]), the PGS alone had the highest predictive power (C index, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.54–0.58]). Use of secondary prevention medications had a high predictive power (C index, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.67–0.70]).

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^112UfykN]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Normal colonoscopy — risk for incident and fatal colorectal cancer is consistently reduced across multiple cohorts (High quality of evidence). A cohort of 304,774 individuals with normal colonoscopy vs 980,154 with no lower endoscopy showed reduced incident CRC on long-term follow-up (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.38–0.52), with risk ranging from HR 0.35 for ≤ 3 years to 0.65 at ≥ 15 years. Fatal CRC was also reduced (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.24–0.45) over 300,000 person-years. In Utah, among 131,349 with normal colonoscopy, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for CRC was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.19–0.32) through 5 years and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.44–0.76) for 7–10 years; a 70% relative risk reduction was observed through 10 years (SIR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.24–0.33). In a health plan cohort of 1,251,318 adults, there was a 46% relative reduced risk for incident and an 88% relative reduced risk for fatal CRC among 99,166 with normal screening colonoscopy through the traditionally recommended 10-year period (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31–0.94 for incident; HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02–0.82 for fatal), with reduced risk noted even up to 12 years post–normal screening colonoscopy.

### 2023 AHA / ACC / ACCP / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113wSjdm]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Bariatric procedures in chronic coronary disease — indications and outcomes — are outlined with quantitative data. Patients with CCD and severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 or BMI 35–39.9 kg/m2 with a weight-related comorbidity) who have not met weight loss goals with lifestyle and pharmacologic intervention may benefit from a bariatric procedure such as gastric bypass surgery, and procedures appear relatively safe and effective at least in those < 65 years of age. In the SOS study, bariatric surgery was linked to prevention of type 2 diabetes and lower incidence of MI or stroke versus matched controls, with hazard ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.29–0.76] for death and hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.54–0.83] for MI or stroke. These benefits do not appear to occur with liposuction; bariatric surgery is described as effective for weight loss, glycemic control, and reducing cardiovascular risk factors, and more recent retrospective studies in CCD show significant reductions in MACE compared with matched controls.

### Sex related differences in efficacy and safety of antithrombotic therapy in patients with coronary artery disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fBX7q]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Nine trials provided sex stratified outcomes for the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (4706 events; 54 935 patients). w2–3 w8–10 w12 w16 w23 w24 We found no difference in the risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke between more intensive versus less intensive regimens in both men (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04; P = 0.38) and women (1.01, 0.90 to 1.13; P = 0.88), with no significant interaction (interaction hazard ratio 1.04, 0.91 to 1.19; P for interaction = 0.55; I² = 3.00%; P for heterogeneity = 0.41) (supplementary figures S10 and S11).

Data on stent thrombosis in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention were reported by 17 trials (938 stent thromboses; 121 879 patients). w3 w4 w6 w8–13 w15–17 More intensive therapies reduced the risk of stent thrombosis in both men (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.77; P < 0.001) and women (0.71, 0.54 to 0.92; P = 0.01), without significant interaction (interaction hazard ratio 1.09, 0.78 to 1.54; P for interaction = 0.61; I² = 35.5%; P for heterogeneity = 0.11) (supplementary figures S12 and S13).

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

Risk estimates were consistent with the main analyses after selection of studies evaluating antithrombotic regimens currently recommended for patients with coronary artery disease and studies with a different follow-up time length (≤ 30 days versus > 30 days) (supplementary figures S14-S30). Meta-regression analyses showed no significant relation of mean age of patients and year of trial publication with the interaction hazard ratio (supplementary figures S31-S44). The leave-one-out analysis did not show relevant changes for each outcome of interest (supplementary tables S8-S14).

Reporting bias

We found evidence of reporting bias only for stroke (supplementary figures S45-S51).

Table 5
Univariate and multivariate covariate-specific HR for radiation vs. active monitoring for prostate cancer.

HR hazard ratio, CI confidence interval, * intersection terms.

The * denotes intersection terms identified by our method. The lower block of covariates represents terms extracted from clinical notes. For each covariate, we show the effect size (HR), the 95% confidence interval (CI), and the statistical significance (P value) from a Wald statistics test.

In Fig. 3 d and Table 6, we show the results with surgery vs. radiation for stage I NSCLC. With structure, we observe a significant effect that surgery is superior to radiation. The results from Chang et al.and clinical judgment tells us that surgery and radiation should be about equipoise for stage I NSCLC. The shift is not as significant as with prostate cancer, but we also note that the established clinical standard for lung cancer is not as well studied. We observe a more significant shift with multi.coxph, with an average shift of 0.15 or 38.5%. We observe an average shift of 0.06, or 15.4%, with matching and an average shift of 0.02, or 5.1% with IPTW. For structured, we observe an HR of 0.39 with 95% CI (0.30–0.51) and P value < 0.001 with multi.coxph. For struct+intersect, we estimate an HR of 0.54 with 95% CI (0.40–0.53) and P value < 0.001 with multi.coxph. We shift the HR point estimate by 0.15, or 38.5%, toward equipoise. While the adjusted results are not as close to the RCT results as compared to Fig. 3 a and b, the HR estimates are all shifted towards equipoise in terms of bias reduction for each combination. We suspect the less significant shift is again due to the even smaller data size of stage I NSCLC. The doubly robust method of multi.coxph seem to perform better under these settings.

### Effect of beta blockers in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a retrospective cohort study [^11183cdS]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

A total of 2005 patients died during the study period, equating to an annual mortality of 34%. We calculated Cox proportional hazards ratios for each treatment group based on stepwise management for COPD. At each comparison, the adjusted hazard ratio for treatment groups including a β blocker were lower than the respective treatment group without a β blocker. Thus the crude hazard ratios for those patients taking inhaled corticosteroids, long acting β agonists, and tiotropium with and without β blocker were 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.52) and 0.54 (0.48 to 0.61), while their adjusted hazard ratios were 0.28 (0.21 to 0.39) and 0.43 (0.38 to 0.48), respectively. Similarly, the crude hazard ratios for the patients taking inhaled corticosteroids and long acting β agonists with and without β blocker were 0.43 (0.31 to 0.60) and 0.67 (0.59 to 0.78), and their adjusted hazard ratios were 0.44 (0.31 to 0.62) and 0.64 (0.57 to 0.74), respectively. Finally, the crude hazard ratios for patients taking inhaled corticosteroids with and without β blocker were 0.51 (0.33 to 0.79) and 0.66 (0.55 to 0.79), and their adjusted hazard ratios were 0.48 (0.31 to 0.74) and 0.69 (0.58 to 0.83). Adjusted hazard ratios for all treatment groups and covariates used in the Cox regression model are shown in figure 2and table 4.

### There is more to length of survival than survival: endpoints in oncology trials [^112sPKXB]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Progression-free survival as a primary endpoint for comparative trials does not fully capture the therapeutic risk/benefit ratio. Additionally, summarization of the treatment effect via a hazard ratio is problematic when the proportional hazards assumption is violated. Restricted mean survival time metrics may address these challenges but have other limitations. See related article by Chang et al., p. 3282.

### The effects of aetiology on outcome in patients treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy in the CARE-HF trial [^113JNPyq]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics in the 813 patients enrolled in CARE-HF

The proportion of patients with echocardiographic signs of dyssynchrony at baseline, including IVMD > 40 ms, aorta pre-ejection time > 140 ms, and a QRS duration ≥ 150 ms at baseline, was greater in patients without IHD.

The effect of CRT on echocardiographic variables by aetiology and assigned treatment at 3 months are shown in Table 2. At this time, reductions in IVMD, mitral regurgitation, and LV end-systolic volume and improvement in LVEF with CRT were already substantial and no clear difference in the magnitude of effect of CRT between patients with and without IHD had appeared.

Table 2
Echocardiographic and quality of life outcome differences at 3 months' follow-up

Clinical outcome variables measured during the study at 18 months' follow-up are presented in Table 3. Mean QRS duration at 18 months was shortened and quality of life and NYHA class were improved by CRT in both patient groups. There was a trend for a greater effect of CRT on the primary outcome measure of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization, in patients without IHD (hazard ratio 0.48; 95% CI 0.35–0.65) when compared with those with IHD (hazard ratio 0.72; 95% CI 0.54–0.95) (Table 4, Figures 1 and 2). However, the interaction term comparing these two hazard functions was not statistically significant, indicating that the apparent difference could plausibly be explained by chance (P = 0.06). The effect of CRT on all-cause mortality was very similar [hazard ratio 0.60 (95% CI 0.42–0.86) and 0.59 (95% CI 0.37–0.92) for IHD and no IHD, respectively].

Intermediate coronary lesions — FFR-guided PCI versus optimal medical therapy at 5 years shows the following outcomes. Estimated cumulative incidence at 5 years is reported for FFR-guided PCI (N = 1056) and medical therapy (N = 1344). Cardiac death or MI was 10.7% (8.4–13.6) with FFR-guided PCI versus 16.4% (13.3–20.1) with medical therapy; hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.72 (0.54–0.96), p-value .02. MI was 8.5% (6.5–11.1) versus 13.4% (10.7–16.8); hazard ratio 0.70 (0.51–0.97), p-value .03. All-cause mortality was 7.0% (5.2–9.6) versus 6.5% (4.7–8.9); hazard ratio 1.03 (0.69–1.54), p-value .89.

### Colorectal cancer mortality reduction is associated with having at least 1 colonoscopy within the previous 10 years among a population-wide cohort of screening age [^111VM3FY]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Colonoscopy has been demonstrated to be effective in colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality reduction, although current screening guidelines have yet to be evaluated. We assessed the protective benefit of colonoscopy within the previous 10 years and whether this effect is maintained with age.

Methods

We used administrative data to compare risk of CRC death (CCD) across colonoscopy utilization among a population-wide cohort comprising individuals aged 60 to 80 years (N = 1,509,423). Baseline and time-dependent colonoscopy exposure models were assessed in the context of competing "other causes of death" (OCDs). Cumulative incidence of CCD and OCD across colonoscopy exposure, over follow-up, was estimated. Relative hazards were computed by age strata (60–69 years, 70–74 years, 75+ years) and proximal and distal cancer subsites.

Results

At least 1 colonoscopy during 10 years before baseline was estimated to provide a 51% reduced hazard of CCD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.54) over the following 8 years. When colonoscopy was modeled as a time-dependent covariate, the risk of CCD was further diminished (multivariable-adjusted HR 0.36; 95% CI, 0.33–0.38). Stratified analyses suggested moderately attenuated CCD risk reduction among the oldest age group; however, consideration of OCDs suggest that this is related to competing risks. CCD risk reduction related to colonoscopy was lower for proximal cancers.

Conclusions

Colonoscopy within the previous 10 years provides substantial protective benefit for average-risk individuals over 60 years. CCD risk reduction may be maintained well beyond 74 years, a common upper age limit recommended by screening guidelines.

### Association between adiposity after diagnosis of prostate cancer and mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115iT2PH]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Linear dose-response meta-analysis

We included 16 studiescomprising 55 457 men (range 239–15 565) and 3412 deaths (24–658). An indication of a positive association for every 5 unit increase in body mass index and higher rate of mortality specific to prostate cancer was found, but the 95% confidence interval included the null value (hazard ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.17, I² = 54%, P value for heterogeneity < 0.01, Egger's P = 0.23, Debray's P = 0.32). Excluding two separate studiesfrom the leave-one-out analysis slightly altered the summary estimate, resulting in a positive association not including the null value (table 1, figure 4, and online supplemental appendix 1, supplementary figure 3B).

### The risk of dementia in relation to cognitive and brain reserve [^1132MeXj]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Background:

Individual differences in the risk to develop dementia remain poorly understood. These differences may partly be explained through reserve, which is the ability to buffer cognitive decline due to neuropathology and age.

Objective:

To determine how much early and late–life cognitive reserve (CR) and brain reserve (BR) contribute to the risk of dementia.

Methods:

4,112 dementia-free participants (mean age = 66.3 years) from the Rotterdam Study were followed up for on average 6.0 years. Early-life CR and BR were defined as attained education and intracranial volume, respectively. Late-life CR was derived through variance decomposition based on cognition. Late-life BR was set as the total non-lesioned brain volume divided by intracranial volume.

Results:

Higher early-life CR (hazard ratio = 0.48, 95% CI = [0.21; 1.06]) but not early-life BR associated with a lower risk of incident dementia. Higher late-life CR (hazard ratio = 0.57, 95% CI = [0.48; 0.68]) and late-life BR (hazard ratio = 0.54, 95% CI = [0.43; 0.68]) also showed lower levels of dementia. Combining all proxies into one model attenuated the association between early-life CR and dementia (hazard ratio = 0.56, 95% CI = [0.25; 1.25]) whereas the other associations were unaffected. These findings were stable upon stratification for sex, age, and APOE ɛ 4. Finally, high levels of late-life CR and BR provided additive protection against dementia.

Conclusion:

The findings illustrate the importance of late-life over early-life reserve in understanding the risk of dementia, and show the need to study CR and BR conjointly.

### The benefit of short-term androgen deprivation therapy with radiation therapy for intermediate-risk prostate cancer [^117GthAP]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A previous, individual patient-level meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated the overall survival (OS) benefit of short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ST-ADT) when delivered with radiation therapy (RT) for the subset of patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (IR-PCa). However, because of inclusion criteria, several studies such as NRG/RTOG 0815, GETUG-14, and DFCI 95–096 were excluded. Thus, we conducted the present analysis, inclusive of all studies to define the current role of ST-ADT in IR-PCa.

Methods and Materials

A systematic review was conducted of phase 3 RCTs published or presented between January 1980 and October 2024 which profiled the comparative efficacy of radiation therapy ± ST-ADT in patients with IR-PCa. A study-level, random-effects meta-analysis was performed. The primary endpoint of this meta-analysis was OS, with secondary endpoints of time-to-biochemical failure (BF) ± biochemical-progress-free survival (bPFS). Meta-regression was used to explore trial-level factors associated with treatment effects. Synthetic individual patient-level OS data were pooled for confirmation and used to estimate the relative and absolute survival benefit.

Results

Seven RCTs (NRG/RTOG 9408, DFCI 95–096, TROG 96.01, PCS III, EORTC 22991, NRG/RTOG 0815, and GETUG-14) reporting outcomes of 6179 patients were identified. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for HR OS, HR BF, and HR BF+ bPFS were 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.79–0.97; p = 0.01), 0.50 (95% CI, 0.37–0.68; P < .001), and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.46–0.65; P < .001), respectively. ST-ADT duration, RT dose, and Gleason score trial population composition were each associated with an increased benefit of ST-ADT for biochemical disease control (all P < .05) but not for OS (all P > .05). Pooling of simulated, patient-level data confirmed the presence of a survival benefit (HR OS, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.76–0.96], log-rank P = 0.021), corresponding to an absolute survival benefit of 5% benefit at 10 years.

Conclusions

The present analysis confirms current knowledge that ST-ADT improves both OS and prostate-specific antigen-based outcomes for unselected patients with IR-PCa to a clinically significant degree.

### Reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases after bariatric surgery based on the new predicting risk of cardiovascular disease EVENTs equations [^1114DsnB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

We observed the greatest CVD benefit in HF prevention, with a 47% to 56% risk reduction within 1 to 2 years after surgery. Several studies have suggested reduced HF risk after bariatric surgery, including a 2018 meta‐analysis reporting a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.36–0.55) for incident HF following bariatric surgery compared with nonsurgical controls. The dramatic reduction of HF risk is likely driven by the decrease in BMI (47.3 kg/m 2 before surgery to 32.4 kg/m 2 at 1 year after surgery in our study sample), a strong predictor in the PREVENT equations for HF risk. In a pooled analysis of 10 prospective cohorts in the United States, obesity was significantly associated with increased CVD morbidity and death; of note, BMI showed the strongest association with incident HF, around a 5‐fold increase compared with other CVD subtypes.

c The E value is the minimum strength of association, on the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the treatment and outcome, conditional on the measured covariat to explain away a treatment-outcome association.

Laplace regression analyses reported that in comparison of individuals with 2 h/days spent in outdoor light in summer, people with below 2 h/days outdoor light developed incident depression 0.54 (50th PD, 95% CI: −0.84, −0.24) years earlier, and the time to incident depression was shortened by 0.49 (50th PD, 95% CI: −0.71, −0.27) years among individuals who spent > 2 h/day outdoor light. In the analyses of winter or average time spent in outdoor light, individuals with below or above the time of reference standard also developed incident depression slightly earlier (Table 2).

4 As measured in the 6 months preceding enrollment, unsuppressed at baseline indicates any detectable viral load during that time.

For the time-to-event analysis, there were 328 profiles confirmed to be suppressed at baseline for inclusion in time-to event analysis. In a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, low PL usage was associated with a higher probability of developing an unsuppressed viral load across 5,985 person-months in the unadjusted survival analysis (p < 0.001) with a median time to event of 30 months for low PL users after a one-month run-in period (Fig. 2). In the Cox proportional hazards model, (Table 3) low PL usage was associated with increasing probability of developing an unsuppressed viral load with a univariate hazard ratio of 4.22 (2.04–8.74, p < 0.001) and an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.54 (1.16–5.54, p = 0.019) when adjusting for age and income compared to FPL. FPL independently conveyed an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.995 (0.991–0.999, p = 0.007) for each additional income percentage compared with FPL; age had an adjusted HR of 0.96 (0.93–0.99, p = 0.006) for each additional year of age. Self-reported race and sex did not significantly influence sustained viral suppression.

### Antihypertensive medication classes and the risk of dementia over a decade of follow-up [^112DoaZW]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Short-term, with follow-up cut-off at 7 years (median follow-up of dementia cases), use of ARBs (hazard ratio = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.31–0.94), CCBs (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.37–0.97), dihydropyridine CCBs (hazard ratio = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.30–0.91) and ATII-stimulating AHM (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.47–1.00) was associated with reduced dementia risk (Supplementary Table 4). Results from the main analyses remained largely unchanged after additional adjustment for number of AHM and randomisation group (Supplementary Table 5) and when mutually adjusting for all main AHM classes in one model (Supplementary Table 6). When restricting analyses to participants in the stable-use group (Supplementary Table 7), use of ATII-stimulating AHM was associated with lower dementia incidence (hazard ratio = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.52–0.99). Use of ARBs, dihydropyridine CCBs and ATII-stimulating AHM were not associated with increased mortality rates (hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.77–1.14; hazard ratio = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.82–1.20; hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.81–1.11 respectively), suggesting no evident influence of competing risk of death (Supplementary Table 8). Finally, use of ARBs and CCBs combined was associated with a lower dementia incidence (hazard ratio = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.52–0.92, Supplementary Table 9).

Talazoparib versus standard single-agent chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer with germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation (EMBRACA) — efficacy, survival, toxicity, and patient-reported outcomes show randomization to talazoparib (n = 287) or standard chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine; n = 144). Median PFS favored talazoparib "(8.6 months v 5.6 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.71; P < .001)", with benefits "in patients with either triple-negative or ER-positive breast cancer". Final OS showed no significant improvement: "hazard ratio, 0.848, 95% CI 0.670 to 1.073; p = 0.17", with "Median OS… 19.3 months with talazoparib (95% CI, 16.6 to 22.5 months) compared with 19.5 months (95% CI, 17.4 to 22.4 months) with chemotherapy". Grade 3–4 AEs occurred in "69.6%" with talazoparib versus "64.3%" with chemotherapy. Patient-reported outcomes indicated overall improvement with talazoparib, with GHS/QoL change from baseline of "3.0 [95% CI 1.2 to 4.8] v −5.4 [95% CI −8.8 to −2.0]; between arms; P < .0001", and a longer time to deterioration "(hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.55)".

ii) Effect of time since randomization on relapse risk

We examined whether hazard ratios varied by time post-randomization. If the hazard ratio was greater at the start of the trial and this was accentuated for trials using an oral formulation, it would imply that the rapid withdrawal of oral medication may contribute to the risk of relapse. For all formulations, the converse was seen in that the protective effect of active treatment increased with time (figure 3A) and this was statistically significant when all trials were meta-analytically combined (figure 3B, interaction ratio estimate −0.003, SE = 0.0015, P = 0.04). The time interaction ratio did not differ significantly between oral and long-acting injection trials (P = 0.52, figure 3B).

Fig. 3.
Relationship between hazard ratio and time. (A) In all trials, a negative log hazard ratio means that the risk of relapse is greater in the active treatment arm compared to the placebo arm, in all trials the relative protective effect of active treatment increases with time since randomization. (B) This interaction with time is statistically significant when all trials are combined (P = 0.04).

iii) Effect of rate of change of receptor occupancy on relapse risk

We examined the rate of reduction in receptor occupancy in trials of long-acting injections. Faster occupancy reduction was not significantly associated with relapse, and periods of faster reduction were not associated with a reduced risk of relapse (P = 0.57) (figure 2B).

iv) Effect of absolute receptor occupancy on relapse risk

We examined trials of long-acting injectables to determine whether estimated receptor occupancy was associated with the risk of relapse. We found that lower receptor occupancy levels were associated with an increased risk of relapse (estimate = −0.34, SE = 0.17, P = 0.037) (figure 2C).

Sensitivity analyses using different initial receptor occupancies demonstrated similar results (see Supplementary File)

### 'Real-world' observational studies in arrhythmia research: data sources, methodology, and interpretation. A position document from European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), endorsed by Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), Asia-Pacific HRS (APHRS), and Latin America HRS (LAHRS) [^114QJPJ7]. Europace (2020). High credibility.

Observational defibrillator studies — model selection, discrimination metrics, and competing risk are outlined as follows: The statistical methods used should match the clinical question, and if the aim is to estimate survival benefit after 5 years a model addressing prediction is needed, whereas if it is sufficient to know the device does 'something', models providing hazard ratio, rate ratio, or odds ratio may suffice; integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification index (NRI) are not valid and the C-index from a Cox model should also not be used to indicate discriminative improvement at specific times; competing risk has no influence on the calculation of hazard ratios but complicates interpretation, and a significant hazard ratio does not ensure long-term prediction such as 5-year cardiovascular mortality, requiring dedicated prediction analysis when that is the goal.

### Overall survival, progression-free survival, and tumor response benefit supporting initial US food and drug administration approval and indication extension of new cancer drugs, 2003–2021 [^115M1ypM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Clinical trial evidence is routinely evaluated for initial drug approvals, yet the benefit of indication extensions remains uncertain. This study evaluates the clinical benefit supporting new cancer drugs' initial and supplemental US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indication approval.

Patients and Methods

Clinical trial evidence supporting each indication's FDA approval was collected from the Drugs@FDA database between 2003 and 2021. Drug, indication, and clinical trial characteristics are described. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and relative risk for tumor response were meta-analyzed.

Results

Out of 124 FDA-approved drugs, 78 were approved across multiple indications. Out of 374 indications, 141 were approved as combination therapies, 255 for solid cancers, 121 with biomarkers, and 182 as first-line therapy. Approval was mostly supported by open-label (267 [71%]) phase III (238 [64%]) concurrent randomized controlled trials (248 [66%]) with a median of 331 enrolled patients (interquartile range [IQR], 123–665 patients). Across 234 randomized controlled trials with available data, drugs' HRs were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.75; I² = 29.6%) for OS and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.60; I² = 90.6%) for PFS, whereas tumor response was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.33 to 1.42; I² = 80.7%). Novel pharmaceuticals increased patient survival by a median of 2.80 months (IQR, 1.97–4.60 months) for OS and 3.30 months (IQR, 1.50–5.58 months) for PFS. Initial indications more frequently received accelerated approval, supported by single-arm trials for advanced-line monotherapies, than indication extensions. Initial approvals provided a higher PFS (HR, 0.48 v 0.58; p = 0.002) and tumor response (relative risk, 1.76 v 1.36; P < .001).

Conclusion

New cancer drugs substantially reduce the risk of death and tumor progression, yet only marginally extend patient survival. The FDA, physicians, patients, and insurers must evaluate and decide on a drug's safety and efficacy approval, pricing, coverage, and reimbursement on an indication-specific level.

For PFS, 6 of 8 evaluable studies showed that PD-L1 expression effectively discriminated for longer PFS. Interestingly, all these studies used a PD-L1 cutoff of 50%. The pooled HR for PD-L1-positive patients treated with ICIs was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.49–0.90). In terms of TILs, 5 out of 8 studies demonstrated that TILs could also differentiate for longer PFS. However, overall, there was no significant PFS benefit for patients with TILs expression treated with ICIs compared to those without TILs expression (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.54–1.20). In contrast, when PD-L1 and TILs were combined, all 7 of 7 studies were able to predict longer PFS, with a p-value of < 0.01.

Regarding OS, neither PD-L1 nor TILs alone had a statistically significant impact on survival (PD-L1: HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.64–1.01; TILs: HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.54–1.09). However, the combination of PD-L1 and TILs was associated with a significant improvement in OS, with a pooled HR of 0.42 (95% CI: 0.31–0.56) and the test for overall effect showing significance at p < 0.05.

Eribulin versus capecitabine in previously treated metastatic breast cancer — In a phase III trial that was not restricted to triple-negative disease, median OS for eribulin and capecitabine was 15.9 and 14.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.00; p = 0.056), and median PFS was 4.1 and 4.2 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.25; p = 0.30). In the triple-negative subset, a prespecified secondary analysis suggested greater efficacy of eribulin with OS 14.4 v 9.4 months (hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91), while PFS was 2.9 v ≥ 2.3 months (hazard ratio = 0.80, 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.05).

Results

Included Studies

Five eligible studies were identified, encompassing 1388 participants (table 1). All compared paliperidone to placebo, two used an oral formulation, two used a 1-monthly long-acting injection, and one used a 3-monthly long-acting injection.

Table 1.
Characteristics of included studies

i) Effect of formulation on relapse risk

For all formulations, randomization to active treatment was associated with a reduced risk of relapse (P < .001, figure 2A). The hazard ratio did not differ between formulations (P > .4 for all pairwise comparisons).

Fig. 2.
Hazard ratios relating to randomization group, receptor occupancy, and rate of occupancy change. (A) For the "Group" set of points, a negative log hazard ratio represents a reduced risk of relapse for active compared to placebo treatment. All formulations show a similar reduction in relapse risk compared to placebo. (B) For the "Rate" set of points, a negative log hazard ratio indicates that a slower decline in receptor occupancy within a trial is associated with a reduced risk of relapse. The observed positive value for the LAI combined analysis indicates that periods in which occupancy is most rapidly declining (ie, the initial months of a trial) are non-significantly associated with a reduced risk of relapse compared to placebo (P = 0.57). (C) For the "Occupancy" set of points, a negative log hazard ratio indicates that higher receptor occupancy is associated with a reduced risk of relapse. The observed negative value for the LAI combined analysis indicates that the risk of relapse relative to placebo increases as receptor occupancy falls. Horizontal bars represent the 95% confidence interval.

Groups compared with Cox proportional hazards. e, Hazard ratios (mean ± 95% CI) for time to next treatment or death for patients with TMB < 10 mutations per megabase treated with immunotherapy based on SETD2 status. Left dashed line, hazard ratio for all cohorts in meta-analysis. Right dashed line, hazard ratio of 1.0.

We further examined whether SETD2 mutation was associated with response to specific antineoplastics. SETD2 mutation was associated with a longer time to next treatment or death following treatment with immune checkpoint blockade but not cytotoxic chemotherapy or molecularly targeted therapy (Fig. 5d). The association between SETD2 mutation and longer immunotherapy response held among only patients with low TMB (< 10 mutations per megabase) and in both validation cohorts (Fig. 5e). In summary, leveraging MSK-CHORD's size and rich annotations, we identified SETD2 as an uncommon but promising biomarker of immunotherapy response in LUAD not explainable by other histopathologic, clinical or genomic features. We corroborated these findings in independent datasets.

### Quality of survey responses at older ages predicts cognitive decline and mortality risk [^114iaccc]. Innovation in Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

Indirect Effects of LQR on Mortality Risk via Cognitive Trajectories

Before investigating evidence for indirect (mediated) effects, we examined the effects of participants' cognitive trajectories on mortality in models that did not include predictor variables. We found that a 1- SD (4.20 points) lower initial cognitive status was associated with a significantly higher mortality risk (hazard OR = 1.46; 99% CI = 1.37, 1.54). A 1- SD (0.36 points) more negative rate of cognitive change was also associated with a significantly higher mortality risk (hazard OR = 1.84; 99% CI = 1.66, 2.03).

Adjusting for age (Model 1), we found that participants' initial cognitive status and rate of cognitive change both partially explained the association between LQR and mortality. A 1- SD higher LQR was associated with a significantly higher mortality risk by a hazard OR of 1.11 (99% CI = 1.08, 1.14) via a lower initial cognitive status and by a hazard OR of 1.05 (99% CI = 1.03, 1.08) via a more negative rate of cognitive change. The combined indirect effect explained 78.0% of the total effect of LQR on mortality risk, whereby the specific indirect effects via initial cognitive status and via cognitive change explained 52.2% and 25.9% of the total effect, respectively. Both of these indirect effects remained significant after controlling for demographic characteristics, health variables, and depression scores (Models 2–4, Table 3). In the final model, the combined indirect effect explained 64.3% of the total effect of LQR on mortality risk, with the specific indirect effects via initial cognitive status and cognitive change explaining 35.0% and 29.4% of the total effect, respectively.

Among 3222 patients, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% ≥ 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer.

The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 and OS results for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and HERA are presented in Table 9. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC→TH arm is presented in Figure 4, and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC→TH arm is presented in Figure 5. The duration of DFS for BCIRG006 is presented in Figure 6. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow-up [AC→TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC→TH arm and 79.4% in the AC→T arm. The final OS analysis results from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients ≤ 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients > 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size ≤ 2 cm (n = 1604), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size > 2 cm (n = 2448), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.80).

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116wcqxJ]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Breast cancer risk with hormone therapy — WHI and duration effects: In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), daily continuous-combined conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) resulted in an increased risk of breast cancer, with nine additional breast cancer cases per 10,000 person-years of therapy, and the hazard ratio (HR) remained elevated at a median of 20 years' cumulative follow-up (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.13–1.45). Compared with placebo, CEE alone showed a nonsignificant reduction in breast cancer risk after an average of 7.2 years of randomization, with seven fewer cases of invasive breast cancer per 10,000 person-years of CEE (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61–1.02), and a significant reduction emerged in the postintervention phase with a median 20 years' cumulative follow-up (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93). Regarding duration, in a pooled analysis of observational data of women starting hormone therapy when aged 45 to 54 years, for estrogen therapy (ET) the HRs increased from 1.23 (95% CI, 1.11–1.35) for 1 to 4 years to 1.29 (95% CI, 1.21–1.37) for 5 to 9 years, 1.44 (95% CI, 1.35–1.53) for 10 to 14 years, and 1.61 (95% CI, 1.49–1.74) for 15 or more years; for estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) they were 1.66 (95% CI, 1.55–1.78) for 1 to 4 years, 1.96 (95% CI, 1.87–2.05) for 5 to 9 years, 2.31 (95% CI, 2.18–2.44) for 10 to 14 years, and 2.68 (95% CI, 2.44–2.95) for 15 or more years.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114MxwhT]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — comparative evidence on adjuvant chemoradiation versus chemotherapy after resection shows mixed results. A phase II randomized study reported no difference in overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) between adjuvant gemcitabine and gemcitabine-based chemoradiation (OS 24.4 months vs. 24.3 months; DFS 10.9 months vs. 11.8 months). A meta-analysis of 15 randomized trials found adjuvant chemoradiation did not improve DFS, 2-year survival, or OS (odds ratio [OR], 0.99; p = 0.93) versus surgery alone, while adjuvant chemotherapy improved OS (OR for OS, 1.98; P < .001). Another meta-analysis of 9 trials reported hazard ratios (HRs) versus no adjuvant treatment of 0.62 for 5-FU (95% CI, 0.42–0.88), 0.68 for gemcitabine (95% CI, 0.44–1.07), 0.91 for chemoradiation (95% CI, 0.55–1.46), 0.54 for chemoradiation plus 5-FU (95% CI, 0.15–1.80), and 0.44 for chemoradiation plus gemcitabine (95% CI, 0.10–1.81). In performance-status–matched NCDB comparisons to no adjuvant therapy, chemoradiation showed HR 0.70 (95% CI, 0.61–0.80) whereas chemotherapy showed HR 1.04 (95% CI, 0.93–1.18). A pooled analysis of 955 resected patients found improved OS with adjuvant chemoradiation versus chemotherapy alone (39.9 months vs. 27.8 months; P < .001).

### Introduction to the analysis of survival data in the presence of competing risks [^116jg9j7]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Lau et al suggest that cause-specific hazard models are "better suited for studying the etiology of diseases, where the [subdistribution hazard model] has use in predicting an individual's risk". (p245) Similarly, Koller and colleaguessuggested that subdistribution hazard-based methods are preferable when the focus is on estimating actual risks and prognosis. This echoes the previous distinction made between interpretation of the incidence rate and the hazard rate. Furthermore, the subdistribution hazard may be of greater interest if one is interested in the overall impact of covariates on the incidence of the outcome of interest, even when predictions of incidence are not of direct interest. These arguments suggest that subdistribution hazards models should be used for developing clinical prediction models and risk-scoring systems for survival outcomes, whereas cause-specific hazard models may be more appropriate for addressing epidemiological questions of etiology. The rationale for this suggestion is that the cause-specific hazard function denotes the instantaneous rate of the primary outcome in those subjects who are currently event free. Thus, a regression coefficient from a cause-specific hazard model can be interpreted as the relative effect of the corresponding covariate on the relative increase in the rate of the occurrence of the primary event in subjects who are currently event free. In contrast to this, clinical prediction models and risk-scoring systems are interested in estimating the absolute incidence of the event of interest. As the subdistribution hazard model allows one to model directly the effect of covariates on the incidence of the primary event after accounting for competing events, it lends itself naturally to risk prediction. The need to carefully consider which model is appropriate to address the research question is illustrated in the case study below, in which the effect of cancer is shown to have a different effect on the subdistribution hazard of cardiac death in comparison with its effect on the cause-specific hazard of cardiac death. Cancer was associated with a substantial decrease in the incidence of cardiac death (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.82), whereas it had no association with the rate of cardiac death in subjects who were still alive (cause-specific hazard ratio, 0.96). An important point to grasp is that in the presence of competing risks, the simple 1-cause Cox model is inadequate. Instead, researchers must be aware of the different hazard functions that are available in the presence of competing risks and decide which one is best suited to their research objectives.

### Impact of frailty on mortality and hospitalization in chronic heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YhTyK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background Although frailty has been associated with increased risks for hospitalization and mortality in chronic heart failure, the precise average effect remains uncertain. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the hazards for mortality and incident hospitalization in patients with heart failure and frailty compared with those without frailty and explored the heterogeneity underlying the effect size estimates. Methods and Results MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were queried for articles published between January 1966 and March 2018. Predefined selection criteria were used. Hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled for meta-analyses, and where odds ratios were used previously, original data were recalculated for HR. Overlapping data were consolidated, and only unique data points were used. Study quality and bias were assessed. Eight studies were included for mortality (2645 patients), and 6 studies were included for incident hospitalization (2541 patients) during a median follow-up of 1.82 and 1.12 years, respectively. Frailty was significantly associated with an increased hazard for mortality (HR, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–1.75; P < 0.001) and incident hospitalization (HR, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.78; P < 0.001) in chronic heart failure. The Fried phenotype estimated a 16.9% larger effect size than the combined Fried/non-Fried frailty assessment for the end point of mortality (HR, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.41–2.28; P < 0.001), but not for hospitalization (HR, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.30–1.89; P < 0.001). Study heterogeneity was found to be low (I 2 = 0%), and high quality of studies was verified by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Conclusions Overall, the presence of frailty in chronic heart failure is associated with an increased hazard for death and hospitalization by ≈1.5-fold.

### The risk of dementia in relation to cognitive and brain reserve [^116Niz8M]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Individual differences in the risk to develop dementia remain poorly understood. These differences may partly be explained through reserve, which is the ability to buffer cognitive decline due to neuropathology and age.

Objective

To determine how much early and late-life cognitive reserve (CR) and brain reserve (BR) contribute to the risk of dementia.

Methods

4,112 dementia-free participants (mean age = 66.3 years) from the Rotterdam Study were followed up for on average 6.0 years. Early-life CR and BR were defined as attained education and intracranial volume, respectively. Late-life CR was derived through variance decomposition based on cognition. Late-life BR was set as the total non-lesioned brain volume divided by intracranial volume.

Results

Higher early-life CR (hazard ratio = 0.48, 95% CI = [0.21; 1.06]) but not early-life BR associated with a lower risk of incident dementia. Higher late-life CR (hazard ratio = 0.57, 95% CI = [0.48; 0.68]) and late-life BR (hazard ratio = 0.54, 95% CI = [0.43; 0.68]) also showed lower levels of dementia. Combining all proxies into one model attenuated the association between early-life CR and dementia (hazard ratio = 0.56, 95% CI = [0.25; 1.25]) whereas the other associations were unaffected. These findings were stable upon stratification for sex, age, and APOEɛ4. Finally, high levels of late-life CR and BR provided additive protection against dementia.

Conclusion

The findings illustrate the importance of late-life over early-life reserve in understanding the risk of dementia, and show the need to study CR and BR conjointly.

### Chemotherapy and targeted therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer that is either endocrine-pretreated or hormone receptor-negative: ASCO guideline update [^114EtwnD]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

PARP inhibitors in metastatic breast cancer with BRCA1/2 germline mutation — OlympiAD and EMBRACA trials reported progression-free survival (PFS) benefits versus physician's choice single-agent chemotherapy with specified safety and subgroup effects. In OlympiAD (n = 302), median PFS favored olaparib ('7.0 months v 4.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.80; P < .001'), grade ≥ 3 adverse events were lower ('36.6% in the olaparib group and 50.5% in the standard therapy group'), treatment discontinuations for toxicity were ('4.9% and 7.7%, respectively'), and in the metastatic triple-negative subset ('102 patients') the PFS effect was greater ('PFS hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.57'). In EMBRACA (n = 431), talazoparib improved median PFS ('8.6 months v 5.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.71; P < .001'), hematologic grade 3–4 adverse events occurred in ('55%') vs ('38%') with standard therapy, and among ('190 patients with triple-negative disease') talazoparib improved PFS ('hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.87').

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117NYBbf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer — risk signals differ by source and remain uncertain: In the 50- to 59-year age group of the WHI, the HR of ovarian cancer with EPT was 0.30 (two vs six cases; 95% CI, 0.06–1.47), with 1.5 fewer cases/1000 per 5 years of treatment; no data have been reported for ET. A meta-analysis of 52 observational studies showed an increase of 0.52 cases/1000 in women starting MHT at age 50 and continuing therapy for 5 years, with risk persisting 5 years after stopping MHT at 0.37 cases/1000 when ages 55 to 59. Overall WHI estimates for EPT showed HR, 1.41 and in cumulative follow-up HR, 1.24, and adequately powered RCTs are needed to ascertain risk.

### Antihypertensive medication classes and the risk of dementia over a decade of follow-up [^113TQ5sW]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Use of angiotensin II (ATII)-stimulating antihypertensive medication (AHM), including angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), has been associated with lower dementia risk. Previous studies had relatively short follow-up periods. The aim of this study is to investigate if these effects are sustained over longer periods.

Methods:

This post hoc observational analysis was based on data from a dementia prevention trial (preDIVA and its observational extension), among Dutch community-dwelling older adults without prior diagnosis of dementia. Differential associations between AHM classes and incident dementia were studied after 7.0 and 10.4 years, based on the median follow-up durations of dementia cases and all participants.

Results:

After 7 years, use of ATII-stimulating antihypertensives [hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47–1.00], ARBs (hazard ratio = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.31–0.94) and dihydropyridine CCBs (hazard ratio = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.30–0.91) was associated with lower dementia risk. After 10.4 years, associations for ATII-stimulating antihypertensives, ARBs and dihydropyridine CCBs attenuated (hazard ratio = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.61–1.04; hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.53–1.07; hazard ratio = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.51–1.04 respectively), but still suggested lower dementia risk when compared with use of other AHM classes. Results could not be explained by competing risk of mortality.

Conclusion:

Our results suggest that use of ARBs, dihydropyridine CCBs and ATII-stimulating antihypertensives is associated with lower dementia risk over a decade, although associations attenuate over time. Apart from methodological aspects, differential effects of antihypertensive medication classes on incident dementia may in part be temporary, or decrease with ageing.

### Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) [^1128EjnX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

At the time of PFS analysis, 223 patients had died. More deaths occurred in the lapatinib plus capecitabine arm (26%) compared with the KADCYLA arm (19%), however the results of this interim OS analysis did not meet the pre-specified stopping boundary for statistical significance. At the time of the second interim OS analysis, 331 events had occurred. The co-primary endpoint of OS was met; OS was significantly improved in patients receiving KADCYLA (HR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.85, p = 0.0006). This result crossed the pre-specified efficacy stopping boundary (HR = 0.73 or p = 0.0037). The median duration of survival was 30.9 months in the KADCYLA arm vs. 25.1 months in the lapatinib plus capecitabine arm. See Table 7 and Figure 2.

A treatment benefit with KADCYLA in terms of PFS and OS was observed in patient subgroups based on stratification factors, key baseline demographic and disease characteristics, and prior treatments. In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (n = 426), the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.72) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.03), respectively. In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (n = 545), the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.91) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.85), respectively. In the subgroup of patients with non-measurable disease (n = 205), based on IRC assessments, the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.42) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.68), respectively; in patients with measurable disease the hazard ratios were 0.62 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.75) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.82), respectively. The PFS and OS hazard ratios in patients who were younger than 65 years old (n = 853) were 0.62 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.74) and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.83), respectively. In patients ≥ 65 years old (n = 138), the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 1.06 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.66) and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.91), respectively.

### Trastuzumab (Herzuma) [^116uCJZg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Among 3222 patients, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% ≥ 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer.

The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 and OS results for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and HERA are presented in Table 9. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC→TH arm is presented in Figure 4, and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC→TH arm is presented in Figure 5. The duration of DFS for BCIRG006 is presented in Figure 6. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow up [AC→TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC→TH arm and 79.4% in the AC→T arm. The final OS analysis results from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients ≤ 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients > 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size ≤ 2 cm (n = 1604), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size > 2 cm (n = 2448), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.80).

### How to understand the 95% confidence interval around the relative risk, odds ratio, and hazard ratio: as simple as It gets [^1125t5wE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistics such as the mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD), relative risk (RR), odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), and others are meant to be examined along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and their significance can be understood by viewing these CIs as compatibility intervals. The 95% CIs around the MD and SMD are easily understood because they are expressed along a linear scale. The 95% CIs around the RR, OR, and HR are harder to understand because they are expressed along an exponential scale; however, when the numbers are log-transformed, they are linearized, and understanding becomes easy. Another approach to understanding the CIs around the RR, OR, or HR is to examine the reciprocal of the lower limit of the CI; however, because the reciprocal also lies along an exponential scale, this method is inferior to the log-transformation method. These approaches may seem daunting, but the difficulty is an illusion because log transformation or reciprocal transformation takes only a few seconds when a statistical calculator is opened. All terms and concepts are explained with extreme simplification and with the help of examples.

### Sorafenib (Nexavar) [^113ciRp6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

NOTE: 	HR is from Cox regression model with the following covariates: MSKCC prognostic risk category and country. P-value is from two-sided Log-Rank test stratified by MSKCC prognostic risk category and country.

The median PFS for patients randomized to NEXAVAR was 167 days compared to 84 days for patients randomized to placebo. The estimated hazard ratio (immediate risk of progression or death with NEXAVAR compared to placebo) was 0.44 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.55).

A series of patient subsets were examined in exploratory univariate analyses of PFS. The subsets included age above or below 65 years, ECOG PS 0 or 1, MSKCC prognostic risk category, whether the prior therapy was for progressive metastatic disease or for an earlier disease setting and time from diagnosis of less than or greater than 1.5 years. The effect of NEXAVAR on PFS was consistent across these subsets, including patients with no prior IL-2 or interferon therapy (N = 137; 65 patients receiving NEXAVAR and 72 placebo), for whom the median PFS was 172 days in the NEXAVAR arm compared to 85 days in the placebo arm.

Tumor response was determined by independent radiologic review according to RECIST criteria. Overall, of 672 patients who were evaluable for response, 7 (2%) patients in the NEXAVAR and no (0%) patients in the placebo arms had a confirmed partial response. Thus the gain in PFS primarily reflects the stable disease population.

At the time of a planned interim survival analysis, based on 220 deaths, overall survival was longer for those randomized to NEXAVAR compared with placebo with a hazard ratio of 0.72. This analysis did not meet the prespecified criteria for statistical significance. Additional analyses are planned as the survival data mature.

Selected baseline characteristics of patients with Type 1 and 2 myocardial infarctions

Mean LDL-C levels were reduced by 54% with alirocumab vs. placebo, from 2.39 mmol/L (92 mg/dL) to 1.24 mmol/L (48 mg/dL), at 12 months. Alirocumab reduced the occurrence of post-randomization MI vs. placebo [6.8% vs. 7.9%; hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77–0.95; P = 0.003]. Both Type 1 MIs (P = 0.032) and Type 2 MIs (P = 0.025) were reduced with alirocumab (Table 2). There was no apparent effect on Type 3, 4, or 5 MIs.

Table 2
Types of myocardial infarctions and effects of alirocumab

Take home figure shows the Kaplan–Meier curve of the occurrence of Type 1 and Type 2 MIs after randomization by treatment group. A benefit of alirocumab treatment on Type 1 MI was apparent after year 1 and increased after year 2, whereas the treatment effect on Type 2 MI appeared more constant over time (Figure 1). These observations are supported by post hoc model results: allowing the treatment HR to change for each of the time intervals indicated in Figure 1 fit the data better than a constant HR for Type 1 MI (P = 0.05) but not for Type 2 MI (P = 0.34).

Adjusted hazard ratios for coronary heart disease per‐C (A) and apolipoprotein A‐I (B) quartile in the‐Norfolk Study. Data are shown as hazard ratios and corresponding 95% CI for the risk of future coronary heart disease events. Hazard ratios were calculated by quartile, using the lowest quartile as reference category, and were adjusted for sex, age, smoking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, apolipoprotein B, C‐reactive protein, and triglyceride levels. ApoA‐I indicates apolipoprotein A‐I; EPIC, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer;‐C, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Individuals in the top quartile for apoA‐I had a hazard ratio for CHD events of 0.55 (95% CI 0.49–0.62, P for linear trend < 0.001) using an unadjusted model. In a fully adjusted model the hazard ratio was 0.75 (95% CI 0.66–0.86, P for linear trend < 0.001).

Table 5 shows the distribution of participants, CHD event rates, and hazard ratio and corresponding 95% CI across HDL‐C and apoA‐I quartiles. The event‐free survival curves per HDL‐C and apoA‐I quartile are shown in Figure 2. In the majority of study participants (n = 9478, 54%), HDL‐C quartiles corresponded with apoA‐I quartiles. However, for 8183 participants, the HDL‐C quartile and apoA‐I quartile were discordant.

### Adherence to antihypertensive agents improves risk reduction of end-stage renal disease [^116CqpyH]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Intensified blood pressure control may slow progression of chronic kidney disease; however, the impact of antihypertensive agent adherence on the prevention of ESRD has never been evaluated. Here we assessed the impact of antihypertensive agent adherence on the risk of ESRD in 185,476 patients in the RAMQ databases age 45 to 85 and newly diagnosed/treated for hypertension between 1999 and 2007. A case cohort study design was used to assess the risk of and multivariate Cox proportional models were used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio of ESRD. Adherence level was reported as a medication possession ratio. Mean patient age was 63 years, 42.2% male, 14.0% diabetic, 30.3% dyslipidemic, and mean follow-up was 5.1 years. A high adherence level of 80% or more to antihypertensive agent(s) compared to a lower one was related to a risk reduction of ESRD (hazard ratio 0.67; 95% confidence intervals 0.54–0.83). Sensitivity analysis revealed that the effect is mainly in those without chronic kidney disease. Risk factors for ESRD were male, diabetes, peripheral artery disease, chronic heart failure, gout, previous chronic kidney disease, and use of more than one agent. Thus, our study suggests that a better adherence to antihypertensive agents is related to a risk reduction of ESRD and this adherence needs to be improved to optimize benefits.

### Effect of calcium supplementation on fracture risk: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^116vEGZn]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of supplementation with calcium alone on risk fractures in a healthy population is not clear.

Objective

The objective was to determine whether 4 y of calcium supplementation would reduce the fracture risk during treatment and subsequent follow-up in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Design

The participants were aged < 80 y at study entry (mean age: 61 y), were generally healthy, and had a recent diagnosis of colorectal adenoma. A total of 930 participants (72% men; mean age: 61 y) were randomly assigned to receive 4 y of treatment with 3 g CaCO(3) (1200 mg elemental Ca) daily or placebo and were followed for a mean of 10.8 y. The primary outcomes of this analysis were all fractures and minimal trauma fractures (caused by a fall from standing height or lower while sitting, standing, or walking).

Results

There were 46 fractures (15 from minimal trauma) in 464 participants in the calcium group and 54 (29 from minimal trauma) in 466 participants in the placebo group. The overall risk of fracture differed significantly between groups during the treatment phase [hazard ratio (HR): 0.28; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.85], but not during the subsequent posttreatment follow-up (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.69). Minimal trauma fractures were also less frequent in the calcium group during treatment (HR: 0; 95% CI: 0, 0.50).

Conclusion

Calcium supplementation reduced the risk of all fractures and of minimal trauma fractures among healthy individuals. The benefit appeared to dissipate after treatment was stopped. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00153816.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^113u2eLQ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Preterm birth — Multiple meta-analyses and systematic reviews have evaluated the potential association of antiretroviral (ARV) drug use and preterm birth (PTB), and most have not demonstrated a significant association between ARV use and PTB. The sample sizes for the meta-analyses ranged from 13 to 90 studies and included 11,224 to 37,877 women and/or infants. A large meta-analysis of 61 observational studies (n = 409,781) compared ART-naive women with women with HIV who were prescribed zidovudine (ZDV) single-drug therapy or antiretroviral therapy (ART); although the risk of any PTB was not significantly different, women who were prescribed ART were less likely to experience spontaneous PTB (relative risk 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.67). Another meta-analysis compared outcomes for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)–based regimens versus regimens without TDF and found no difference in the risk of PTB. In an observational study in British Columbia, women with HIV were twice as likely to experience PTB as the general population, while women with HIV on any ART were less likely than women with HIV not on ART to have spontaneous PTB (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54; 95% CI, 0.29–1.04), and the protective effect for each week of ART was cumulative (HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96–0.99). Neither preconception nor first-trimester ARV use was associated with PTB.

Among 3222 patients, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% ≥ 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer.

The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 and OS results for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and HERA are presented in Table 9. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC → TH arm is presented in Figure 4, and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC → TH arm is presented in Figure 5. The duration of DFS for BCIRG006 is presented in Figure 6. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow-up [AC → TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC → TH arm and 79.4% in the AC → T arm. The final OS analysis results from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients ≤ 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients > 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80).

### Biologic prescribing decisions following serious infection: results from the British Society for Rheumatology biologics register-rheumatoid arthritis [^115qmy9Q]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To establish whether the decision to stop, continue or switch TNF inhibitor (TNFi) therapy to a biologic drug with an alternative mode of action following a serious infection (SI) impacts upon the risk of recurrent SI in patients with RA.

Methods

Patients recruited to the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register-RA with at least one episode of SI while on TNFi were included. The biologic treatment decision following SI was considered. A multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify predictors of recurrent SI and whether biologic treatment choices influenced future SI risk.

Results

In total, 1583 patients suffered at least one SI while on TNFi. Most patients (73%) were recorded as continuing TNFi 60 days after an index SI. The rate of recurrent SI was 25.6% per annum (95% CI: 22.5, 29.2%). The rate of recurrent SI was highest in patients who stopped their TNFi (42.6% per annum, 95% CI: 32.5, 55.7%) and lowest in those who switched biologic drug class (12.1% per annum, 95% CI: 3.9, 37.4%). Compared with patients stopping biologic therapy, patients who continued or switched drug class had significantly lower risk of recurrent SI (drug continuation hazard ratio = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.74; drug switch hazard ratio = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.95).

Conclusions

Patients who continued or switched their TNFi post-index SI had a lower risk of recurrent SI infection compared with those who stopped the drug. This may be explained by better control of disease activity with reintroduction of biologic therapy, a driving factor for SI or alternatively channelling fitter patients to restart biologic therapy.

The authors previously reported that within a patient cohort from Victoria, Australia, women who had early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) diagnosed while participating in screening [active screeners (AS), comprising both screen-detected and interval cancers] receive less intensive treatment than those not recently screened (NRS). This study reports mortality and subsequent cancer events for that cohort.

Methods

Follow-up data were collected for 766 (97.1%) of the 789 women in the original cohort (612 [79.9%] AS and 154 [20.1%] NRS), with a median follow-up time of 11.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 9.8–13.8 years). Mortality and subsequent cancer diagnosis data were derived from linkage with the Victorian Cancer Registry. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between groups, with sensitivity analyses for potential overdiagnosis and lead time bias.

Results

The 10-years BCSS was 95.4% (95% confidence interval, 93.2–96.8%) for AS versus 86.4% (95% CI 79.7–91.0%) for NRS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; 95% CI 0.17–0.48; p < 0.001). A survival benefit persisted after adjustment for estimated overdiagnosis (HR 0.38; 95% CI 0.21–0.66; p = 0.001) and lead time bias (HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.19–0.58; p < 0.001). The 10-year OS also was superior for AS, at 90.6% (95% CI 87.9–92.7%) compared with 82.5% (95% CI 75.4–87.8%) for NRS (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36–0.79; p = 0.002).

Discussion

Patients who have ESBC diagnosed while participating in screening experience improved BCSS and OS while receiving less intensive treatment. These findings are robust to adjustment for potential overdiagnosis and lead time bias. As treatment for ESBC becomes more tailored, with emerging opportunities for reduced treatment intensity, the benefits of screening are likely to improve further.

### Explainable, federated deep learning model predicts disease progression risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [^111qmbBA]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Lastly, we joined the informative factors of our clinico-pathological parameters with the deep learning model's output to predict survival using a multivariable model. To this end we combined the deep learning models' predicted risk scores and clinico-pathological parameters that showed a p -value below 0.1 in univariate analyses in multivariable Cox regression models. These combined models showed that the image data carries more information than the clinico-pathological variables (global p < 0.01, Fig. 3B, D). In fact, classification of patients in the Cologne cohort as high-risk using the model trained on Bonn and Munich carries a hazard ratio of 5.96 even when adjusting for additional variables (multivariable p -value = 0.001). Similarly, patients classified as high-risk in the Bonn cohort using a model trained on Cologne only have a hazard ratio of 7.42 in a multivariate analysis (multivariable p -value = 0.01). Only the Cologne cohort model exhibits other variables that remain significant: invasion beyond subcutaneous tissue (hazard ratio = 4.53, multivariable p -value = 0.007), and tumor thickness greater than 6 mm (hazard ratio = 2.54, multivariable p -value = 0.026).

Considering that only a fraction of patients shows perineural invasion, vascular invasion, or invasion beyond subcutaneous tissue, and that clinico-pathological information is frequently incomplete, these analyses highlight the potential of our image-based model to reliably identify patients at high risk of disease progression for intensified clinical follow-up.

### Survival and disease-progression benefits with treatment regimens for advanced colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis [^112nWxtJ]. The Lancet: Oncology (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

Many randomised trials have compared different systemic treatment regimens in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. While survival advances have apparently been achieved, the magnitude of these incremental benefits across diverse regimens is less clear. The aim of our study was to estimate the magnitude of survival and disease progression benefits with the use of different regimens in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

Methods

We systematically reviewed randomised trials comparing systemic treatment regimens in advanced colorectal cancer. Treatment was categorised by use of or no use of fluorouracil-based regimens, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, and cetuximab. We used multiple-treatment meta-analysis methodology to combine information from direct comparisons (ie, treatments compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (ie, treatments compared between trials by combining results on how effective they are against a common comparator treatment) of different chemotherapy regimens. The primary endpoint was death and the secondary endpoint was disease progression. Monte Carlo simulations were used to establish which regimen offered the most benefit for these endpoints. We did analyses of all trials and analysed separately trials that studied first-line treatments and non-first-line treatments.

Findings

242 trials published in 1967–2007 (N = 56 677 patients) involved 137 different chemotherapy regimens. 37 of these trials were eligible for the multiple-treatment meta-analysis, according to our categorisation, including 47 comparisons of data on death (N = 13 875 patients) and 48 comparisons of data on disease progression (N = 15 158 patients). Compared with fluorouracil plus leucovorin alone, the risk of death was most decreased with the addition of irinotecan plus bevacizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% credibility intervals (CrI) 0.44–0.84) and considerable benefits were also noted with addition of irinotecan plus oxaliplatin (HR 0.72 [95% CrI 0.54–0.97]); oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab (HR 0.72 [0.57–0.90]); bevacizumab alone (HR 0.78 [0.60–1.03]); and oxaliplatin alone (HR 0.87 [0.78–0.98]). The disease progression benefits were even more prominent for the addition of irinotecan plus bevacizumab (HR 0.41 [0.28–0.60]); irinotecan plus oxaliplatin (0.53 [0.38–0.73]); oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab (0.46 [0.34–0.61]); bevacizumab alone (0.56 [0.41–0.76]); oxaliplatin alone (0.64 [0.56–0.73]); irinotecan plus cetuximab (HR 0.62 [0.42–0.92]); and irinotecan alone (HR 0.73 [0.65–0.82]). Findings were similar for first-line and non-first-line treatment analyses although data were sparse for non-first-line treatment analyses. Compared with a patient with an anticipated 1-year survival who is treated with fluorouracil and leucovorin, the absolute survival benefit is estimated at 8 months' prolongation with addition of irinotecan plus bevacizumab, 4.7 months' prolongation with addition of oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab or irinotecan plus oxaliplatin, and 1–1.8 months' prolongation with addition of irinotecan alone or oxaliplatin alone.

Interpretation

Distinct incremental benefits are noted for diverse chemotherapy regimens in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, with more prominent effects on disease progression than on death. More data are needed at least for the newest drugs to estimate more accurately the magnitude of the benefit derived from their use.

### Mendelian randomisation study of age at menarche and age at menopause and the risk of colorectal cancer [^115TzhxZ]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large MR study we aimed to clarify the inconsistent findings from observational studies regarding the association of age at menarche and age at menopause with CRC risk and thereby the role of endogenous oestrogen exposure. We investigated the association of GRS for age at menarche and age at menopause as surrogates for endogenous oestrogen exposure on CRC risk. Our results do not support an association between GRS for age at menarche and age at menopause and CRC risk, which under MR assumptions can be interpreted as absence of a causal effect.

In line with the findings of our study, several prospective studies and one meta-analysis reported no association, between self-reported age at menarche and CRC risk, although some studies found an inverse association. Two more recent prospective studies reported inverse associations with CRC risk for age at menarche only among never users of any MHT. In never users of hormone therapy, Zervoudakis et al.reported a hazard ratio of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.57–0.94) for age at menarche (> 15 vs. 11–12 years) in association with risk of CRC and Murphy et al.found a hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.54–0.96) for age at menarche (> 15 vs. 11–12 years). We therefore assessed the association of GRS for age at menarche with CRC risk stratified by ever/never use of MHT, separately for combined oestrogen–progesterone therapy and for oestrogen monotherapy. No difference in the association according to either combined oestrogen–progesterone therapy or oestrogen-alone therapy was found.

Among 3222 patients, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% ≥ 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer.

The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 and OS results for the integrated analysis of NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and HERA are presented in Table 9. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC→TH arm is presented in Figure 4, and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC→TH arm is presented in Figure 5. The duration of DFS for BCIRG006 is presented in Figure 6. For NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow-up [AC→TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC→TH arm and 79.4% in the AC→T arm. The final OS analysis results from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients ≤ 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients > 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor‑negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size ≤ 2 cm (n = 1604), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size > 2 cm (n = 2448), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.80).

### Intravascular ultrasound guidance is associated with better outcome in patients undergoing unprotected left main coronary artery stenting compared with angiography guidance alone [^112Va4yP]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Small observational studies have indicated better outcome with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance when performing unprotected left main coronary artery (LMCA) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but the overall picture remains inconclusive and warrants further investigation. We studied the impact of IVUS guidance on outcome in patients undergoing unprotected LMCA PCI in a Swedish nationwide observational study.

Methods and Results

Patients who underwent unprotected LMCA PCI between 2005 and 2014 because of stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome were included from the nationwide SCAAR (Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry). Of 2468 patients, IVUS guidance was used in 621 (25.2%). The IVUS group was younger (median age, 70 versus 75 years) and had fewer comorbidities but more complex lesions. IVUS was associated with larger stent diameters (median, 4 mm versus 3.5 mm). After adjusting for potential confounders, IVUS was associated with significantly lower occurrence of the primary composite end point of all-cause mortality, restenosis, or definite stent thrombosis (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.50–0.84) and all-cause mortality alone (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.47–0.82). In 340 propensity score-matched pairs, IVUS was also associated with significantly lower occurrence of the primary end point (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.37–0.80).

Conclusions

IVUS was associated with an independent and significant outcome benefit when performing unprotected LMCA PCI. Potential mediators of this benefit include larger and more appropriately sized stents, perhaps translating into lower risk of subsequent stent thrombosis. Although residual confounding cannot be ruled out, our findings indicate a possible hazard when performing unprotected LMCA PCI without IVUS guidance.

Hazard Odds Ratios for Development of the Composite Renal Outcome Among Participants With Glomerular Disease

Circles represent hazard odds ratios from baseline blood pressure (BP) models; squares, hazard odds ratios from time-varying BP models. Model 1 is unadjusted; model 2, adjusted for age, sex, black race, antihypertensive use, estimated glomerular filtration rate, body mass index z score, and immunosuppressant use; and model 3, adjusted for all covariates in model 2 plus proteinuria. DBP indicates diastolic BP; SBP, systolic BP. Error bars indicate 95% CIs.

A similar phenomenon was observed among those with glomerular CKD. Specifically, in unadjusted models, for baseline only SBP of the 90th percentile or greater compared with less than the 50th percentile, the HOR was 2.85 (95% CI, 1.64–4.94), whereas the corresponding estimate for time-varying SBP was substantially higher (HOR, 5.96 [95% CI, 3.37–10.54]). When including proteinuria, the associations with BP were substantially attenuated for baseline BP (≥ 90th percentile compared with < 50th percentile adjusted HOR for baseline, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.39–2.36]) and time-varying BP (≥ 90th percentile compared with < 50th percentile adjusted HOR for time-varying, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.65–3.03]), indicating the importance of proteinuria in this group.

Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Analysis of Demographic and Clinical Factors in the Study Cohort a

Abbreviations: HR, hazard ratio; NA, not applicable.

Stage IV disease was the strongest factor associated with mortality (HR, 17.47; 95% CI, 15.28–19.96). Bone (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.23–1.38) and liver metastases (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.35–1.54) were associated with increased risk, while brain metastases were not associated with a significantly increased risk. Squamous cell carcinoma (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.33–1.51) and other or unspecified histological subtypes (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10–1.39) were linked to poorer survival compared with adenocarcinoma. Patients who received chemotherapy (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.64–0.73) or underwent surgery (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74–0.86) had lower mortality. Full univariable and multivariable model results are presented in the Table.

To complement the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, which assumes linear effects of covariates on the log-hazard, an RSF model was developed to capture nonlinear associations and assess their performance. The Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated slightly higher discrimination (C-index, 0.774; 95% CI, 0.769–0.779) compared with the RSF model (0.765; 95% CI, 0.759–0.771), although both showed comparable accuracy. While the Cox proportional hazards model provided interpretable HRs, the RSF model captured complex interactions. SHAP-enhanced feature importance analysis identified overall stage, radiation therapy, household income, and time from diagnosis to treatment initiation as the most influential factors associated with survival in both models (Figure 3 and eFigure 6 in Supplement 1).

### Prednisone, lupus activity, and permanent organ damage [^114ZfQQq]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the effect of corticosteroids (prednisone dose) on permanent organ damage among persons with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

We identified 525 patients with incident SLE in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort. At each visit, clinical activity indices, laboratory data, and treatment were recorded. The study population was followed from the month after the first visit until June 29, 2006, or attainment of irreversible organ damage, death, loss to follow-up, or receipt of pulse methylprednisolone therapy. We estimated the effect of cumulative average dose of prednisone on organ damage using a marginal structural model to adjust for time-dependent confounding by indication due to SLE disease activity.

Results

Compared with non-prednisone use, the hazard ratio of organ damage for prednisone was 1.16 (95% CI 0.54, 2.50) for cumulative average doses > 0–180 mg/month, 1.50 (95% CI 0.58, 3.88) for > 180–360 mg/month, 1.64 (95% CI 0.58, 4.69) for > 360–540 mg/month, and 2.51 (95% CI 0.87, 7.27) for > 540 mg/month. In contrast, standard Cox regression models estimated higher hazard ratios at all dose levels.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that low doses of prednisone do not result in a substantially increased risk of irreversible organ damage.

hazard ratioListen to pronunciationA measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group, over time. In cancer research, hazard ratios are often used in clinical trials to measure survival at any point in time in a group of patients who have been given a specific treatment compared to a control group given another treatment or a placebo. A hazard ratio of one means that there is no difference in survival between the two groups. A hazard ratio of greater than one or less than one means that survival was better in one of the groups.

### Definition of odds ratio-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^1145qhWn]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

odds ratio A measure of the odds of an event happening in one group compared to the odds of the same event happening in another group. In cancer research, odds ratios are most often used in case-control studies to find out if being exposed to a certain substance or other factor increases the risk of cancer. For example, researchers may study a group of individuals with cancer and another group without cancer to see how many people in each group were exposed to a certain substance or factor. They calculate the odds of exposure in both groups and then compare the odds. An odds ratio of one means that both groups had the same odds of exposure and, therefore, the exposure probably does not increase the risk of cancer. An odds ratio of greater than one means that the exposure may increase the risk of cancer, and an odds ratio of less than one means that the exposure may reduce the risk of cancer. Also called relative odds.

### Definition of risk ratio-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^116tw6aB]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

risk ratio A measure of the risk of a certain event happening in one group compared to the risk of the same event happening in another group. In cancer research, risk ratios are used in prospective studies, such as cohort studies and clinical trials. A risk ratio of one means there is no difference between two groups in terms of their risk of cancer, based on whether or not they were exposed to a certain substance or factor, or how they responded to two treatments being compared. A risk ratio of greater than one or of less than one usually means that being exposed to a certain substance or factor either increases or decreases the risk of cancer, or that the treatments being compared do not have the same effects. Also called relative risk.

### Estimating risk ratios and risk differences… [^112TvXxJ]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The goal of many medical research studies is to estimate the direction and magnitude of the effect of an intervention or treatment on a clinical outcome or the association between an exposure and an outcome. This effect or association can be presented in various forms, depending on the measured outcome. For example, if the outcome is a continuous measure, the effect or association could be represented as a mean difference between the groups. If the outcome is a time-to-event outcome, the effect or association is often expressed as a hazard ratio. Holmberg MJ, Andersen LW.

### Principles of epidemiology | Lesson 3-section 5… [^116hkdAD]. archive.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk ratio Definition of risk ratio A risk ratio, also called relative risk, compares the risk of a health event among one group with the risk among another group. It does so by dividing the risk in group 1 by the risk in group 2. Method for Calculating risk ratio The formula for risk ratio is: A risk ratio of

1. 0 indicates identical risk among the two groups. A risk ratio greater than 1. 0 indicates an increased risk for the group in the numerator, usually the exposed group. A risk ratio less than 1. 0 indicates a decreased risk for the exposed group, indicating that perhaps exposure actually protects against disease occurrence. To calculate the risk ratio, first calculate the risk or attack rate for each group.

Here are the formulas: Attack Rate Attack rate for exposed = [a/(a + b)] Attack rate for unexposed = [c/(c + d)] For this example: Risk of tuberculosis among East wing residents = [28/157] = 0. 178 = 
17. 8%. The interpretation of the value of a rate ratio is similar to that of the risk ratio. That is, a rate ratio of 1. 0 indicates equal rates in the two groups, a rate ratio greater than

1. 0 indicates an increased risk for the group in the numerator, and a rate ratio less than 1. 0 indicates a decreased risk for the group in the numerator. EXAMPLE: Calculating Odds Ratios Use the data in Table 3. 15 to calculate the risk and odds ratios. Risk ratio5. 0 ⁄
2. 0 = 5. 0 Odds ratio ⁄ = 5.
2. Notice that the odds ratio of 5. 2 is close to the risk ratio of 5.
0. That is one of the attractive features of the odds ratio — when the health outcome is uncommon, the odds ratio provides a reasonable approximation of the risk ratio.

Another attractive feature is that the odds ratio can be calculated with data from a case-control study, whereas neither a risk ratio nor a rate ratio can be calculated.
