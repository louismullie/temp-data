## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the initial workup for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect COPD and the role of active case-finding versus screening. Then, I should verify the core elements of history and physical examination. Next, I will confirm the diagnostic gold standard and the correct spirometry protocol. After that, I need to check how to classify severity and risk using the ABE approach and blood eosinophils. Then, I will review when to add advanced testing such as lung volumes, DLCO, exercise testing, and imaging. Finally, I should consider the differential diagnosis, comorbidity screening, and initial management steps, and close with documentation and follow-up planning.

> Let me first confirm when to suspect COPD and the stance on screening versus case-finding. Suspect COPD in adults with dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum, recurrent lower respiratory infections, or risk exposures such as smoking, occupational or environmental pollutants, and consider early-life events like prematurity or low birth weight. Routine screening of asymptomatic adults is not recommended, but active case-finding in symptomatic patients or those with risk factors is appropriate and can improve diagnostic yield and outcomes in targeted populations [^a2c0283c] [^1e3cef74] [^a409dfde].

> Wait, let me verify the core history elements I must elicit. I need to quantify tobacco exposure in pack-years, document occupational and environmental exposures, and ask about early-life events, asthma or atopy, prior respiratory infections, and family history of chronic lung disease. I should also characterize symptom evolution, prior exacerbations or hospitalizations, and the impact on activities, work, and psychosocial functioning, while screening for common comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, anxiety, depression, and malignancy, because these shape prognosis and management [^5018b6c7] [^1c83303e].

> Hold on, I should verify the physical examination priorities. In early disease the exam may be normal, but as disease progresses I expect diminished breath sounds, hyperresonance, prolonged expiration, and signs of hyperinflation. I should also look for accessory muscle use, cyanosis, edema, and features of comorbidities such as cardiac disease or osteoporosis, noting that a normal exam does not exclude COPD in mild stages [^c84d9841].

> I will now examine the diagnostic gold standard. Spirometry is mandatory to confirm COPD, and I should use post-bronchodilator values to establish persistent airflow limitation, defined as FEV1/FVC less than 0.70. Pre-bronchodilator obstruction alone is insufficient for diagnosis, and if the post-bronchodilator ratio is borderline, I should repeat spirometry to confirm persistence before labeling the patient as having COPD [^6788fdd0] [^623c2680] [^f1623d80].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I should always stop inhaled therapy before spirometry, but I should double-check that. Current guidance advises that bronchodilators do not need to be held for routine follow-up spirometry, and assessing acute reversibility to distinguish COPD from asthma is not recommended because variability is high and does not predict long-term treatment response. So I should not rely on a bronchodilator response to differentiate COPD from asthma or to guide therapy [^fd579588] [^853c720a].

> Next, I should review how to classify severity and risk. I need to grade airflow obstruction by post-bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted into GOLD 1 through 4, assess symptom burden with CAT or mMRC, and quantify exacerbation risk by prior-year history and blood eosinophil count. The ABE grouping combines symptoms and exacerbation risk, replacing the older ABCD scheme, and eosinophil thresholds guide inhaled corticosteroid decisions in appropriate patients [^c5c7a102] [^51c31d75] [^2c18b2cd].

> Let me consider when to pursue advanced testing. If symptoms are disproportionate to spirometry, if there is diagnostic uncertainty, or if I suspect alternative or additional pathology, I should add lung volumes, DLCO, and exercise testing such as a 6-minute walk or shuttle test. CT is indicated for persistent exacerbations, symptoms out of proportion to disease, severe hyperinflation, or when lung cancer screening or surgical evaluation is relevant, and it can reveal emphysema, bronchiectasis, or other contributors to symptoms [^9f7f0fde] [^4a2bd7a0] [^fb681582].

> I should confirm the key differentials and how to approach them. Asthma can mimic COPD but typically shows variable airflow and atopy. Heart failure may present with dyspnea and edema with restrictive physiology. Bronchiectasis features chronic purulent sputum and airway dilation. Pulmonary embolism can masquerade as an exacerbation, so I need a low threshold to evaluate when presentation is atypical or high risk, using clinical probability tools and selective imaging rather than routine PE workups in all exacerbations [^f9b1b6d5] [^f8aebf54] [^e4512e51].

> Hold on, I should verify comorbidity screening and its implications. COPD commonly coexists with cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, anxiety, depression, and lung cancer, and these should be actively identified and treated per standard care because they independently affect outcomes. This means I need to check blood pressure, glucose, lipids, bone health, mood, and cancer risk, and align screening with age and risk profile [^1c83303e] [^07ef5f42].

> Next, I should review initial management steps once COPD is confirmed. Smoking cessation is the highest-yield intervention. Vaccinations including influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 are essential. I should provide inhaler technique training, self-management education, and encourage physical activity. Pharmacotherapy initiation follows the ABE grouping, starting with a LAMA for group A and LABA+LAMA for group B, with ICS reserved for exacerbation-prone phenotypes or elevated eosinophils, and I should reassess symptoms, exacerbations, adherence, and technique at follow-up to guide escalation or de-escalation [^a87b8c6c] [^fa4dd13d] [^2c18b2cd].

> I need to ensure documentation is complete and actionable. I should record exposures, symptom scores, spirometry with post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC and FEV1 percent predicted, GOLD grade, ABE group, eosinophil count, comorbidities, and the initial treatment plan. I should also set a follow-up interval, typically every 3 to 6 months initially, with annual spirometry and periodic reassessment of symptoms, exacerbations, adherence, and risk factors to adjust therapy and detect complications early [^228b737a] [^ddd5bdb4].

> But wait, what if the patient presents during an acute exacerbation. In that case, I should stabilize first, then confirm the diagnosis with spirometry once recovered, because acute illness can transiently worsen obstruction and confound interpretation. I should also actively evaluate for pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and other mimics during the acute episode using clinical judgment and selective testing rather than assuming a pure COPD exacerbation [^0acbfb0a] [^853af532].

The initial workup for COPD centers on **confirming airflow limitation with post-bronchodilator spirometry** (FEV1/FVC < 0.70) [^6788fdd0] and **assessing symptoms and exacerbation risk** to guide therapy [^8e9bc9b3]. Key steps include a focused history of symptoms and exposures (smoking, occupational/environmental) [^5018b6c7], a physical exam for signs of airflow limitation and comorbidities, and spirometry with bronchodilator response [^623c2680]. If spirometry is inconclusive or symptoms are disproportionate, consider lung volumes, DLCO, or CT [^9f7f0fde] [^4a2bd7a0]. Routine labs are not required unless clinically indicated; evaluate for comorbidities and complications as needed [^1c83303e].

---

## Clinical history and risk assessment

A detailed clinical history is essential to identify **risk factors**, **symptom patterns**, and **comorbidities** that influence diagnosis and management [^5018b6c7].

- **Risk factors**: Document smoking history (pack-years), occupational and environmental exposures, and early-life events (prematurity, low birth weight, maternal smoking) [^5018b6c7].
- **Symptoms**: Assess dyspnea, chronic cough, sputum production, wheeze, and recurrent lower respiratory infections [^a2c0283c].
- **Exacerbations**: Record frequency, severity, and hospitalizations [^51c31c75].
- **Comorbidities**: Screen for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, anxiety/depression, diabetes, and lung cancer [^1c83303e].

---

## Physical examination

Physical examination findings vary with disease severity; **early COPD may be normal**, whereas advanced disease shows:

- **General signs**: Barrel chest, accessory muscle use, pursed-lip breathing, cyanosis, edema.
- **Lung exam**: Diminished breath sounds, prolonged expiration, wheeze, hyperresonance.
- **Comorbidities**: Signs of heart failure, osteoporosis, or malignancy [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic testing

### Spirometry

Spirometry is the **gold standard** for diagnosing COPD and must be performed with adequate quality control [^5e5eb428].

- **Pre-bronchodilator spirometry**: Initial test to assess airflow limitation.
- **Post-bronchodilator spirometry**: Confirms persistent airflow limitation if FEV1/FVC < 0.70 [^6788fdd0].
- **Severity grading**: Based on post-bronchodilator FEV1% predicted (GOLD 1–4) [^0dae66a8].

---

### Additional pulmonary function tests

Consider additional testing when spirometry is inconclusive or symptoms are disproportionate to airflow limitation:

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Lung volumes (plethysmography) | Suspected hyperinflation or air trapping | - Increased TLC <br/> - RV <br/> - FRC |
| Diffusing capacity (DLCO) | Suspected emphysema or gas exchange abnormality | Decreased DLCO |
| Exercise testing (6-minute walk) | Functional impairment assessment | Reduced distance, desaturation |

---

### Imaging

Routine chest radiography is not required for stable COPD but is indicated to exclude alternative diagnoses or evaluate acute symptoms. Chest CT is considered for **persistent symptoms**, **unexplained exacerbations**, or when **lung volume reduction** or **lung cancer screening** is contemplated [^4a2bd7a0] [^60ccee04].

---

### Laboratory tests

Routine laboratory tests are not required for initial diagnosis but may be used to assess comorbidities or acute presentations:

- **Blood eosinophils**: Guide inhaled corticosteroid use in exacerbation-prone patients [^2c18b2cd].
- **Alpha-1 antitrypsin**: Consider in early-onset COPD or family history.
- **Arterial blood gases**: Assess for chronic respiratory failure in advanced disease [^810af859].

---

## Differential diagnosis

COPD must be differentiated from other causes of chronic respiratory symptoms:

- **Asthma**: Variable airflow, eosinophilia, atopy [^f8aebf54].
- **Heart failure**: Orthopnea, edema, cardiomegaly [^f8aebf54].
- **Bronchiectasis**: Chronic purulent sputum, recurrent infections [^f8aebf54].
- **Interstitial lung disease**: Crackles, restrictive pattern on PFTs [^notfound].

---

## Initial assessment summary

The initial workup for COPD should include:

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Post-bronchodilator spirometry (FEV1/FVC < 0.70) [^6788fdd0].
- **Assess severity**: Grade airflow limitation (GOLD 1–4) [^0dae66a8].
- **Evaluate symptoms**: Use mMRC or CAT score [^c5c7a102].
- **Identify exacerbation risk**: History of exacerbations and blood eosinophils [^51c31c75].
- **Screen comorbidities**: Cardiovascular, osteoporosis, anxiety/depression, diabetes, lung cancer [^1c83303e].

The initial workup for COPD centers on **confirming airflow limitation with post-bronchodilator spirometry** and assessing symptoms and exacerbation risk to guide therapy [^8e9bc9b3]. Key steps include a focused history of symptoms and exposures, a physical exam for signs of airflow limitation and comorbidities, and spirometry with bronchodilator response. If spirometry is inconclusive or symptoms are disproportionate, consider lung volumes, DLCO, or CT. Routine labs are not required unless clinically indicated; evaluate for comorbidities and complications as needed.

Patients presenting with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are initially assessed to ensure that a proper diagnosis has been made and that relevant differential diagnoses are excluded. Although guidelines provide indicators for use, very little systematic research has been done in initial assessment of COPD exacerbations. Next, the assessment should aim at stratifying patients for risk of poor outcome. For this, predictors of poor prognosis as well as knowledge of favorable treatments can be used. However, no formal and validated staging system exists today. Given the frequency and impact of COPD exacerbations, there seems to be a need for systematic research in this area.

Initial Evaluation

A careful medical history and physical examination complemented by the rational measurement of objective variables can help establish, with a degree of certainty, that an ECOPD is the most likely diagnosis (Table 1), particularly in patients with mild events seen in the outpatient setting. However, in many patients, the signs and symptoms of an ECOPD (especially if more severe) are not specific, and other diseases may mimic an ECOPD and/or aggravate its clinical presentation (Figure 1). Most of these patients are seen in an acute care setting, and we developed an initial practical algorithm to help reach a more precise diagnosis (Figure 2).

Clinical presentation and initial assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include suspicion when patients report cough, sputum production, dyspnea, or recurrent lower respiratory infections, exposure to cigarette smoke or environmental/occupational pollutants, or an acute exacerbation; history should assess evidence that COPD is present versus alternatives, comorbidities, ability to perform activities of daily living, other effects of the condition, and social support; on examination, a normal exam is common in mild COPD with signs emerging as disease progresses, and detection of diminished breath sounds and hyperresonance has a positive likelihood ratio of greater than 5.0, a moderately strong predictor that COPD is present; routinely measured parameters include respiratory rate, oxygen saturation at rest and with exertion, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), breathlessness using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score [mMRC], and functional capacity, which is best determined by an exercise test such as timed walking distances or walking speed; exercise tests have been shown to predict mortality particularly well in patients with COPD.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to suspect COPD in any patient with dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, a history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: diagnosis and management [^e5ac46ef]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects nearly 6% of Americans. Routine screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults is not recommended. Patients with suspected COPD should have the diagnosis confirmed with spirometry. Disease severity is based on spirometry results and symptoms. The goals of treatment are to improve quality of life, reduce exacerbations, and decrease mortality. Pulmonary rehabilitation improves lung function and increases patients' sense of control, and it is effective for improving symptoms and reducing exacerbations and hospitalizations in patients with severe disease. Initial pharmaceutical treatment is based on disease severity. For mild symptoms, initial treatment with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist is recommended. If symptoms are uncontrolled with monotherapy, dual therapy with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting beta2 agonist combination should be initiated. Triple therapy with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting beta2 agonist/inhaled corticosteroid combination improves symptoms and lung function more than dual therapy but increases pneumonia risk. Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors and prophylactic antibiotics can improve outcomes in some patients. Mucolytics, antitussives, and methylxanthines do not improve symptoms or outcomes. Long-term oxygen therapy improves mortality in patients with severe resting hypoxemia or with moderate resting hypoxemia and signs of tissue hypoxia. Lung volume reduction surgery reduces symptoms and improves survival in patients with severe COPD, whereas a lung transplant improves quality of life but does not improve long-term survival.

VA/DoD COPD 2014 recommendations — spirometry to confirm diagnosis: We recommend that spirometry demonstrating airflow obstruction, specifically post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC] < 70% with age adjustment for more elderly individuals, be used to confirm all initial diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); this recommendation is categorized in 2021 as Reviewed, New-replaced.

---

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: diagnosis and management [^00978286]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be suspected in patients with risk factors (primarily a history of smoking) who report dyspnea at rest or with exertion, chronic cough with or without sputum production, or a history of wheezing. COPD may be suspected based on findings from the history and physical examination, but must be confirmed by spirometry to detect airflow obstruction. Findings that are most helpful to rule in COPD include a smoking history of more than 40 pack-years, a self-reported history of COPD, maximal laryngeal height, and age older than 45 years. The combination of three clinical variables-peak flow rate less than 350 L per minute, diminished breath sounds, and a smoking history of 30 pack-years or more-is another good clinical predictor, whereas the absence of all three of these signs essentially rules out airflow obstruction. Pharmacotherapy and smoking cessation are the mainstays of treatment, and pulmonary rehabilitation, long-term oxygen therapy, and surgery may be considered in select patients. Current guidelines recommend starting monotherapy with an inhaled bronchodilator, stepping up to combination therapy as needed, and/or adding inhaled corticosteroids as symptom severity and airflow obstruction progress.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^51c31d75]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Initial assessment — Once the diagnosis of COPD has been confirmed by spirometry, assessment to guide therapy must focus on determining five fundamental aspects: severity of airflow obstruction, nature and magnitude of current symptoms, previous history of moderate and severe exacerbations, blood eosinophil count, and presence and type of other diseases (multimorbidity).

---

### Screening for and early detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^5e5eb428]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a substantially underdiagnosed disorder, with the diagnosis typically missed or delayed until the condition is advanced. Spirometry is the most frequently used pulmonary function test and enables health professionals to make an objective measurement of airflow obstruction and assess the degree to which it is reversible. As a diagnostic test for COPD, spirometry is a reliable, simple, non-invasive, safe, and non-expensive procedure. Early diagnosis of COPD should provide support for smoking cessation initiatives and lead to reduction of the societal burden of the disease, but definitive confirmation of both proves elusive. Despite substantial effort and investment, implementation of quality spirometry is deficient because of several hurdles and limitations, described in this Review. All in all, spirometry is recognised as the essential test for diagnosis and monitoring of COPD.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^60ccee04]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Imaging in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) indicates that chest radiography is generally performed initially to exclude other diseases and establish concomitant respiratory diseases, is frequently normal in early COPD, shows lung hyperinflation and hyperlucent areas with peripheral trimming of vascular markings when abnormal, and is not performed during routine follow-up of a stable patient; computed tomography (CT) can estimate the degree and distribution of emphysema and identify bronchial wall thickening and gas trapping, correlates with lung function but has substantial interpreter variability, and quantitative techniques have not become routine clinical practice due to analytic complexity, software/algorithm differences, segmentation requirements, and lack of standardized protocols or agreement on complex measurements; CT can also help differentiate structural causes of airflow limitation, identify phenotype-associated abnormalities, and detect pulmonary and nonpulmonary comorbidities including lung cancer, with lung cancer risk increased in COPD but inversely related to the degree of airflow obstruction, and the presence of airflow obstruction should raise awareness of this risk and patients with COPD are considered good candidates to be screened for lung cancer.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^89aa16ee]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer from acute episodes of worsening dyspnea, often associated with increased cough, sputum, and/or sputum purulence. These exacerbations of COPD (ECOPDs) impact health status, accelerate lung function decline, and increase the risk of hospitalization. Importantly, close to 20% of patients are readmitted within 30 days after hospital discharge, with great cost to the person and society. Approximately 25% and 65% of patients hospitalized for an ECOPD die within 1 and 5 years, respectively. Patients with COPD are usually older and frequently have concomitant chronic diseases, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, interstitial lung diseases, bronchiectasis, asthma, anxiety, and depression, and are also at increased risk of developing pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax. All of these morbidities not only increase the risk of subsequent ECOPDs but can also mimic or aggravate them. Importantly, close to 70% of readmissions after an ECOPD hospitalization result from decompensation of other morbidities. These observations suggest that in patients with COPD with worsening dyspnea but without the other classic characteristics of ECOPD, a careful search for these morbidities can help detect them and allow appropriate treatment. For most morbidities, a thorough clinical evaluation supplemented by appropriate clinical investigations can guide the healthcare provider to make a precise diagnosis. This perspective integrates the currently dispersed information available and provides a practical approach to patients with COPD complaining of worsening respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea. A systematic approach should help improve outcomes and the personal and societal cost of ECOPDs.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^ae4ce767]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Pre- or post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic approach — notes that, in line with other National and International guidelines, GOLD has recommended using post-bronchodilator values when considering a diagnosis of COPD; however, it is now recognised that the bronchodilator response has little value in differentiating asthma from COPD, that pre-bronchodilator values are reproducible, and that obstruction only found on post-bronchodilator measurements is uncommon. Obtaining post-bronchodilator values is more time consuming. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry can be used as an initial test in symptomatic patients, and if it does not show obstruction, performing post-bronchodilator spirometry is not necessary unless there is a very high clinical suspicion of COPD.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to assess the severity of airflow obstruction, the impact of disease on the patient's health status, and the risk of future events (such as exacerbations, hospital admissions, or death) in the initial evaluation to guide therapy.

Conclusions

Combining a thorough clinical history and examination with currently available clinical biomarkers, most patients with COPD who have a classic presentation may be diagnosed with reasonable confidence as having an ECOPD. However, in other patients, acute decompensations of coexisting morbidities or the development of acute events such as acute HF, pneumonia, or PE can contribute to or cause those events. Thus, all patients with COPD who have worsening respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea without infective evidence, should be investigated for the frequent morbidities that may complicate those events. It is extremely important that trial planners adopt a more objectively supported system of determining the cause of admissions labeled as COPD exacerbations, given that prior trials may have incorrectly labeled hospitalized deteriorations as COPD exacerbations when, in fact, these events were driven by other comorbidities. With the knowledge and resources available to us, the time for precise diagnosis of these episodes is now.

### Clinical and organizational factors in the initial evaluation of patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^8c16caff]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial evaluation scope and core questions in suspected or known lung cancer focuses on patients who present with a relatively high probability of cancer and does not necessarily apply to patients with a very low probability of cancer, such as those identified with a lung nodule during CT screening. On the basis of this framework, the initial evaluation must provide information with regard to three basic questions: (1) What is the extent of disease, and is there evidence of metastases? (2) Are there comorbidities (ie, COPD) present that might limit treatment options? (3) Are there symptoms or paraneoplastic syndromes present that need to be identified and treated early?

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^8ccb2345]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

COPD diagnosis — A diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be considered in any patient who has dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, a history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease, but forced spirometry that demonstrates the presence of a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) < 0.7 is mandatory to establish the diagnosis of COPD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^f9b1b6d5]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — differential diagnosis emphasizes that, in some patients with COPD, distinguishing COPD from asthma is difficult using current imaging and physiological testing techniques because the two conditions share common traits and clinical expressions, whereas most other potential differential diagnoses are easier to distinguish from COPD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^6788fdd0]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain spirometry to establish the diagnosis of COPD by eliciting a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70 confirming the presence of persistent airflow limitation.

### Assessment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^0959262f]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Assessment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is important to establish an accurate diagnosis, assist in making therapeutic decisions, measuring outcomes for clinical and research purposes, and determining prognosis. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans are useful in patients who present with airflow limitation and clinical features suggestive of COPD but in whom other diagnoses are being considered. In such cases, a chest CT may indicate another diagnosis. The amount and distribution of emphysema can identify outcomes from lung volume reduction surgery, and chest CT scans are mandatory in assessment of patients for this surgery. Quantitative parameters from chest CT scans have been used to define longitudinal progression of disease. Assessment of patients with COPD for both clinical and research purposes should incorporate a variety of different outcomes. There are outcome measures that have been successfully incorporated in large clinical trials, and the design and outcomes of these trials can be used to plan future clinical investigations in COPD.

### Preventing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: what is known and what needs to be done to make a difference to the patient? [^280ff31e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable systemic disease with symptoms that overlap other respiratory illnesses. An estimated 24 million adults in the United States have COPD, but > 50% of them are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Spirometry remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing COPD and for monitoring the progression of the disease. Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD; therefore, smoking cessation is an integral component of any program to reduce COPD risk and delay or limit the progression of airflow obstruction. Influenza vaccinations will also reduce acute respiratory illness in patients with COPD. With increasing awareness of COPD and earlier diagnosis, implementation of treatment guidelines and smoking-cessation efforts may lead to more effective management of this disease, which is projected to be the third leading cause of death in the United States by 2020.

### Undiagnosed (or unrecognized) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma: does active case finding identify clinically impaired patients with treatment potential? [^6791577e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite clear recommendations on when to suspect and how to diagnose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, there is still substantial underdiagnosis. Whereas the prevalence of underdiagnosis in asthma ranges from 20% to 70% depending on the age of the study population and the clinical setting, the prevalence in COPD seems to be approximately 80%. Patients are often diagnosed and begin treatment very late in their disease course, often when severe airflow limitation has already developed and symptoms have become unbearable, and this is perhaps also the reason that undiagnosed and untreated patients display significant healthcare use and are subject to increased risks of acute exacerbations and early death. Early diagnosis of mild disease will likely create a greater potential for treatment and lead to a lower disease burden by improving long-term prognosis. The reasons for underdiagnosis seem manifold and reflect not only the insufficient use of spirometry by physicians but also patients not recognizing their symptoms. An obvious question therefore arises whether screening or perhaps a targeted case-finding strategy could lower the burden of underdiagnosis and improve the long-term prognosis in asthma and COPD. In 2022, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force updated its 2016 recommendations against screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults because of a lack of evidence that screening would lead to any benefit such as smoking cessation, and now instead encourages the pursuit of active case finding in symptomatic patients with relevant risk factors such as smoking. Case-finding strategies in COPD and asthma are being investigated, and results from these trials are much appreciated.

VA/DoD COPD primary care algorithm — Module A begins when a "Patient with chief compliant suggestive of COPD presents to primary care", followed by "Perform brief clinical assessment to determine if patient is clinically stable". It asks, "Is the patient having an acute exacerbation? (see Sidebar 1)"; if "Yes", proceed to "Management of an acute exacerbation (see Module B)", and if "No", "Complete clinical assessment including consideration of common co-occurring conditions (see Sidebar 2)" including history, exam, evaluation for comorbid conditions, and to "Obtain diagnostic spirometry if available (see Recommendation 1)". Next it asks, "Is there a confident clinical diagnosis of COPD?"; if "Yes", "Offer prevention and risk reduction methods including smoking cessation, vaccination, and patient education; suggest spirometry if not already completed", and if "No", "Treat or refer as clinically indicated". It then asks, "Is patient chronically symptomatic and/or has patient had a moderate to severe exacerbation in the past year? (see Sidebar 1)"; if "Yes", "If symptoms persist, consider need to initiate/adjust medication and assess inhaler techniques (see Appendix G); ensure patient is on SABA (PRN), then use following steps for increasing intensity: First line LAMA; Add LABA for severe symptoms (preferably combination inhaler); Add ICS only for continued moderate to severe exacerbations (see Sidebar 1)".

### Diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^cd10e1e0]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affects more than 26 million adults in the United States. Family physicians provide care for most of these patients. Cigarette smoking is the leading risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although other risk factors, including occupational and environmental exposures, account for up to one in six cases. Patients presenting with chronic cough, increased sputum production, or progressive dyspnea should be evaluated for the disease. Asthma is the disease most often confused with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is based on clinical suspicion and spirometry confirmation. A forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio that is less than 70 percent, and that is incompletely reversible with the administration of an inhaled bronchodilator, suggests chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Disease severity is classified by symptomatology and spirometry. Joint guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society recommend a single quantitative test for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency in patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who remain symptomatic despite bronchodilator therapy. Other advanced testing is usually not necessary.

### Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^011efcbc]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacts a heavy toll on society, yet its prevention, diagnosis and treatment receives inadequate attention from both the medical community and from society at large. Guidelines released in 2001 from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are aimed at redressing this inequity. In this review, we integrate information from the GOLD guidelines with recent updates on the prevention, treatment and management as related specifically to the most severe form of this disease. In order to help distinguish COPD from other disorders that may mimic or confound its treatment, we place particular emphasis on the definition, underlying pathophysiology and diagnosis of COPD. In addition, we discuss future directions in pharmacotherapy.

Radiology

Chest radiography is insensitive in mild or early COVID-19 infection and is not routinely indicated as a screening test for COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals. Chest radiography is indicated in patients with COPD who have moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 and for those with evidence of worsening respiratory status (Figure 1). COVID-19 pneumonia changes are mostly bilateral. Chest radiography can be useful for excluding or confirming alternative diagnoses (e.g. lobar pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion). Point-of-care lung ultrasound can also be used to detect the pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.

CT screening may show evidence of pneumonia in asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and false-negative RT-PCR tests have been reported in patients with CT findings of COVID-19 who eventually tested positive. Recommendations have been made on the use of CT scans as part of diagnostic testing and severity assessment in COVID-19, and there are no special considerations for patients with COPD. The initial features of COVID-19 on CT scans and their progression over time have been reviewed. Patients with COPD and COVID-19 have an increased prevalence of ground-glass opacities, local patchy shadowing, and interstitial abnormalities on CT scans than patients without COPD. A small case series of patients with emphysema and COVID-19 found that many had bilateral ground-glass opacities with areas of consolidation; however, the pattern was variable, and patients had more pronounced disease in the lung bases.

The availability of CT scans may be limited by infection-control requirements, and where access to CT scans are limited, chest radiography may be preferred for patients with COVID-19 unless features of respiratory worsening warrant the use of CT scans. An increased occurrence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism has been reported in patients with COVID-19; if pulmonary embolism is suspected, chest CT angiography should be performed.

### Delay in diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: reasons and solutions [^1aa7d131]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a crippling disease with a high worldwide prevalence. It is the fifth-leading cause of death worldwide and estimated to become the third-leading cause of death by 2030. This review highlights recent studies that discuss reasons for and possible solutions to the delay in diagnosis of COPD.

Recent Findings

Delay in COPD diagnosis is multifactorial and can be grouped into healthcare provider-related factors, patient-related factors, and heterogeneity in the disease itself. The current literature strongly supports the lack of awareness and knowledge about COPD among healthcare providers as an important factor in misdiagnosis and/or delays in diagnosis. Ironically, COPD is both underdiagnosed and overdiagnosed.

Summary

Achieving the goal of early diagnosis in COPD needs a major overhaul and culture change in primary care settings. Respiratory symptoms in a smoker 40 years or above should trigger automatic health alert and spirometry indications. Awareness of tobacco-related injury is the first building block in prevention and cure.

### Pulmonary embolism work-up in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: what is the best strategy for clinicians? [^74ca9bdf]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events in the natural course of COPD, as they increase morbidity and mortality. Acute pulmonary embolism may mimic the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. However, the exact prevalence of pulmonary embolism in unexplained exacerbations of COPD is unclear based on the current data. This review provides a practical approach to patients with COPD complaining of worsening respiratory symptoms.

Recent Findings

A randomized clinical trial has shown that a routine pulmonary embolism diagnostic work-up does not improve care of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. However, review of the recent literature suggests that a nonnegligible proportion of otherwise unexplained exacerbations of COPD may be caused by pulmonary embolism. To date, nevertheless, there are limited studies developing and validating clinical models that might aid in the identification of patients requiring additional tests for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

Summary

Until new evidence becomes available, we believe that a routine diagnostic strategy for pulmonary embolism is not appropriate for patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Recommendations for routine pulmonary embolism diagnostic work-up necessitate further development of prognostic models and conduct of clinical trials that assess important health outcomes.

### Patient phenotyping and early disease detection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^b2c62a74]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

The traditional physiological definition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is of practical use in encompassing the overlapping syndromes of COPD in routine clinical practice, and underpins the continued use of spirometry for diagnosis, screening, staging, and monitoring. However, the diagnostic criteria for COPD have not evolved in step with advances in understanding of pathogenesis, and this approach of including all the components of COPD under one umbrella is under question. The characterization of phenotypic variation is currently recognized to hold the key to better understanding of COPD pathogenesis and the identification of effective novel therapies. COPD demonstrates considerable heterogeneity, and, consequently, patient characterization requires a varied approach and the use of multiple modalities. This review discusses the methodologies that are currently used for patient phenotyping and the approaches that have been advocated for the identification of clinically meaningful phenotypes.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up assessment — smoking status, measurements, imaging, and comorbidities — includes the following: At each visit, the current smoking status and smoke exposure should be determined followed by appropriate action. Decline in FEV1 can be tracked by spirometry performed at regular intervals (e.g., yearly) and a timed walking test (6-minute walking distance or shuttle-walking test) provides additional information regarding prognosis. Measurement of oxygenation at rest in an arterial blood gas sample may help identify patients who will benefit from supplemental oxygen to improve both symptoms and survival in those with severe resting hypoxemia. If there is a clear worsening of symptoms, imaging may be indicated, and when exacerbations are repeatedly characterized by purulent sputum, patients should be investigated for bronchiectasis. Symptoms that may indicate the development or worsening of a comorbid condition should be recorded and, if present, an appropriate diagnostic work-up should follow.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^05df0017]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis — spirometric criteria and thresholds emphasize that diagnosis requires confirmation of an airflow limitation that is not fully reversible via spirometry and the history of a potentially causative exposure, with airflow limitation defined by a low post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio. The threshold FEV1/FVC ratio to confirm airflow limitation is described as uncertain; a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.7 has traditionally been the criterion, which may identify airflow limitation more often in the elderly and less among young adults less than 45 years of age compared with a threshold based on the lower limit of normal of FEV1/FVC. The page notes that advocates for the fixed ratio argue it identifies patients with significant pulmonary pathology not detected by the lower limit of normal, whereas advocates for the lower limit of normal argue the fixed ratio is more likely to yield false-positive results.

Leveraging incidental lung imaging abnormalities for COPD screening — Airflow obstruction or emphysema are described as markers of an increased risk for lung cancer, and the severity of airflow obstruction and the presence of emphysema are both independent risk factors that may be useful indicators for triaging patients for more careful lung cancer surveillance. In individuals imaged outside of lung cancer screening, CT scans can be used to help identify individuals at increased risk for COPD and prompt consideration for spirometry. Emphysema is a hallmark of COPD and is easily detected on chest imaging by visual inspection by a radiologist or through quantitative lung density, and lung imaging may also reveal air trapping, airway wall thickening and mucus plugging; these abnormalities may not only indicate airflow obstruction but also patients that might have a more rapid decline in lung function and worse quality of life. Because quantitative LDCT analysis is often not available in clinical settings, the presence of emphysema and other airway abnormalities should raise clinical suspicion for COPD and lead to detailed assessment of symptoms and consideration for pulmonary function testing if not previously performed. The use of spirometry in targeted patients undergoing lung cancer screening or when incidental imaging abnormalities consistent with parenchymal or airway manifestations of airways disorders are found is recommended by GOLD.

Pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic algorithm for COPD: Measure pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC; if FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7, classify as not COPD, with consideration to measure post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC if a volume responder is suspected (e.g., low FEV1 or high symptoms). If pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7, measure post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC; if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7, interpret as flow response needing follow-up with repeat assessment, and if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7, COPD is confirmed. If the pre-bronchodilator values show obstruction the diagnosis of COPD should be confirmed using post-bronchodilator measurements, and individuals whose pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC shows obstruction but whose post-bronchodilator ratio does not show obstruction have an increased risk of future development of COPD and should be followed closely.

Combined initial COPD assessment — In 2011, GOLD proposed moving from a simple spirometric grading system to a combined assessment based on the level of symptoms (mMRC or CAT™), the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1–4), and the frequency of previous exacerbations to guide initial pharmacological treatment, incorporating patient-reported outcomes and highlighting exacerbation prevention. The initial version relied on both the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1–4) and the frequency of previous exacerbations to assess exacerbation risk, but the severity of airflow obstruction was subsequently removed considering its lower precision at the individual level to predict outcomes and drive treatment decisions, while complexifying the use of the classification by clinicians. In the 2023 GOLD report, GOLD proposed a further evolution of the ABCD combined assessment tool in which the A and B groups remained unchanged and the C and D groups were merged into a single group termed "E", recognizing the clinical relevance of exacerbations; it was acknowledged that this proposal would have to be validated by appropriate clinical research.

### Characterizing undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^528dc849]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung disorder that is characterized by persistent airflow limitation and associated with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Patients with COPD generally seek medical attention when they experience respiratory symptoms, most notably dyspnea that is persistent and progressive. However, owing to under-utilization of lung function measurements and non-specific nature of the symptoms, COPD is often not recognized until late in the disease process. Indeed, many patients do not receive a diagnosis of COPD until after being hospitalized due to a severe exacerbation.

Lamprecht et al. reported an average underdiagnosis rate of 81% in a prevalence study that included 30,874 participants across 44 countries. Reducing risk factors such as smoking and occupational risk factors while the disease is early in its progression is an important component of treatment for COPD. As such, late diagnosis of COPD represents a missed opportunity to modify the course of the disease through evidence-informed risk factor management and treatment. The extent of this missed opportunity is a function of the number of COPD patients who are undiagnosed, and the burden of disease (e.g. symptom burden, lung function status) in this population.

Quantifying the true burden of undiagnosed COPD and the benefit of screening and case detection can be informed by a comparative assessment of patient- and disease-factors between diagnosed and undiagnosed patients. Numerous studies have compared the characteristics of patients with undiagnosed and diagnosed COPD, but to the best of our knowledge, these studies have never been systematically compiled and pooled. We hypothesized that the characteristics of patients, their risk factors, respiratory symptoms, and disease stage influence the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of COPD.

Refer for specialized investigations — indications for referral: Referral for expert advice and further diagnostic evaluation is advised for patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite treatment, for diagnostic uncertainty (especially if an alternative diagnosis needs to be investigated), for patients with suspected asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have atypical or additional symptoms or signs suggesting an additional pulmonary diagnosis, when chronic airways disease is suspected but syndromic features of either asthma or COPD are few, and for patients with comorbidities that may interfere with assessment and management. When atypical or additional symptoms or signs suggest an additional pulmonary diagnosis, this should prompt early referral, without waiting for a trial of treatment for asthma or COPD. Referral may also be appropriate for issues arising during ongoing management of asthma, COPD or asthma-COPD overlap, as outlined in the GINA and GOLD strategy reports.

### Causes of misdiagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic scoping review [^3fe207e8]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has serious implications at both the individual and the societal level. It is crucial that COPD is diagnosed correctly to ensure provision of the right treatment. However, the current diagnostic procedures may lead to misdiagnosis.

Aim

The aim of this scoping review was to disseminate knowledge about potential causes of misdiagnosis of COPD.

Methods

A systematic, comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Cinahl.

Results

A thorough review produced a sample of 73 articles. The synthesis revealed five potential causes of misdiagnosis of COPD, including: the threshold for defining COPD (n = 36), errors made in primary care (n = 15), errors linked to the spirometry test (n = 13), differential diagnoses (n = 10), and patient-related factors (n = 8).

Conclusions

The causes of misdiagnosis of COPD are attributable mainly to spirometry and to the healthcare professional performing the diagnostic assessment. With a view to limiting misdiagnosis of COPD, future research should help clarify strategies for alternative objective tests for determining if a patient has COPD and explore how to better support primary care in the diagnosing of COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis and classification — recommendation and spirometric confirmation: We suggest post-bronchodilator spirometry to confirm clinical diagnosis of COPD (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Expiratory flow obstruction is confirmed by presence of FEV1/FVC less than 70% or less than lower limit of normal (LLN) based upon age appropriate cut-offs in post-bronchodilator spirometry, and post-bronchodilator spirometry improves the accuracy of COPD diagnosis over pre-bronchodilator spirometry. Evidence suggests that a post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV1/FVC less than 70% is acceptable confirmation of the presence of COPD in older patients without a prior history of asthma; however, clinicians must use caution when applying this criteria to elderly patients because FEV1/FVC less than 70% can be a normal part of aging, and using lower FEV1/FVC threshold may exclude more patients from being considered as "obstructed" and therefore diminish the sensitivity but increase the specificity. Reversibility to acute inhalation of short-acting bronchodilators may vary in repeated testing in COPD patients, the absence of acute reversibility after treatment with a bronchodilator may not predict response to long-term pharmacotherapy, and thus, reversibility testing should not be used to gauge the potential benefits of treatment. The Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up triage should help decide: i) whether to offer an in-person as opposed to a remote (telephone or virtual/online) consultation, and ii) who to prioritize. Remote follow-up could be considered when the patient or caregiver can understand the process and provide information clearly, when this is a regular COPD follow-up or the patient is followed for a known condition, when medical records and laboratory test results are accessible to the healthcare professionals, and when prescription and access to medication is possible and follow-up to the prescription can be arranged if necessary. In-person follow-up should be prioritized when the patient and caregiver have difficulty providing information, when the patient needs immediate attention due to the presence of severe medical symptoms, when changes in the patient's symptoms require a differential diagnosis work-up with the need for a physical exam and/or laboratory testing, or when patient treatment can only be given in person and cannot be given at home. Prioritization of in-person visits should take into consideration the COPD patient disease severity (symptom burden and risk of exacerbations), recent emergency department visit and/or hospital admission, associated significant comorbidities, age, and/or living alone at home.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review and comparison of current resources [^eeb5b207]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the assessment and management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were published 30 years ago. These and subsequent CPGs issued by professional societies and other groups prior to 2000 were consensus recommendations based on expert opinion and available studies, and they have been criticized for being inconsistent and not explicitly evidence-based. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, released the first of a new generation of rigorous, evidence-based COPD guidelines in 2001. Since that time several other CPGs, notably those developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and by the British National Collaborating Center for Chronic Conditions and Institute for Clinical Excellence, have also become available. While previous COPD guidelines had different severity-grading systems and differed in their therapy recommendations, the new CPGs are remarkably consistent and have very few areas of clinically relevant discrepancy. All are available free via the Internet, provide for regular revision and updating, and include materials for patients and the public, as well as for health-care providers. Although the GOLD and ATS-ERS guidelines both have international authorship and are intended for worldwide use, implementation of many of their recommendations (such as the requirement for spirometry in diagnosis and staging, an escalating management scheme that includes expensive inhaled medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration for lung-volume reduction surgery) remains beyond the reach of many patients and health care systems.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up pharmacological treatment (Figure 3.9) presents suggested escalation and de-escalation strategies based on available efficacy and safety data and can be applied to any patient already taking maintenance treatment(s) irrespective of the GOLD group allocated at treatment initiation. The response to treatment escalation should always be reviewed, and when treatment modification, in particular de-escalation, is considered, patients should be under close medical supervision. The report notes that treatment escalation has not been systematically tested and that trials of de-escalation are limited and only include ICS. If response to initial treatment is appropriate, maintain it; if not, check adherence, inhaler technique and possible interfering comorbidities, evaluate whether dyspnea/activity limitation or prevention of exacerbations is the predominant treatable trait, use the exacerbation pathway if both need to be targeted, then select the corresponding algorithm and identify the box matching the current treatment to follow the suggested algorithm.

Algorithms for initial pharmacological management of COPD — A proposal for the INITIATION of pharmacological management of COPD according to the individualized assessment of symptoms and exacerbation risk following the ABE scheme, and also accounting for blood eosinophil count, is presented as clinical guidance, and there is no high-quality evidence such as randomized controlled trials to support initial pharmacological treatment strategies in newly diagnosed COPD patients. For Group A, all Group A patients should be offered bronchodilator treatment based on its effect on breathlessness; this can be either a short- or a long-acting bronchodilator, and if available and affordable a long-acting bronchodilator is the preferred choice except in patients with very occasional breathlessness; this should be continued if benefit is documented. For Group B, treatment should be initiated with a LABA+LAMA combination; in a randomized controlled trial in patients with ≤ 1 moderate exacerbation in the year before the study and a CAT™ ≥ 10 LABA+LAMA is superior to a LAMA with regard to several endpoints; therefore, providing there are no issues regarding availability, cost and side-effects LABA+LAMA is the recommended initial pharmacological choice; if a LABA+LAMA combination is not considered appropriate, there is no evidence to recommend one class of long-acting bronchodilators over another (LABA or LAMA) for initial relief of symptoms in this group, and in the individual patient, the choice should depend on the patient's perception of symptom relief.

### Characterisation and prognosis of undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients at their first hospitalisation [^1b75e66c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study population

A diagnosis of COPD was confirmed by spirometry at least three months after discharge when the patient had reached clinical stability. COPD was identified as a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV₁/FVC) of less than 0.7. At recruitment (first hospitalisation due to COPD exacerbation), patients were asked about their diagnosis with "any respiratory disease" using the following questions: "Are you suffering from any respiratory disease?", "What is the name of your respiratory disease?", "When were you diagnosed with this respiratory disease?", and "Who diagnosed your respiratory disease?". These questions were previously designed and pilot-tested in COPD patients from the same geographical area. Patients reported any pharmacological treatments they were taking regularly (previous to hospitalisation) for any chronic disease. We defined "undiagnosed COPD" as the absence of any self-reported diagnosis of respiratory disease. In addition, to reduce a potential misclassification due to poor recall, we assumed that patients regularly using any pharmacological respiratory treatment had been previously diagnosed. Once stable conditions were reached and the diagnosis of COPD was confirmed, patients were identified as "newly diagnosed" COPD patients. Details on the exact wording of patients when describing their respiratory disease, time from diagnosis, diagnosing doctor, and respiratory treatment are reported in Additional file 1: Table S1.

For our analysis, disease severity was classified according to FEV₁ levels as mild, moderate, severe and very severe following the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) criteria.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up pharmacological management uses a separate follow-up algorithm based on two key treatable traits — persistence of dyspnea and occurrence of exacerbations — and is designed to facilitate management of patients taking maintenance treatment(s), whether early after initial treatment or after years of follow-up; these recommendations incorporate evidence from clinical trials and the use of peripheral blood eosinophil counts as a biomarker to guide the use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy for exacerbation prevention.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up and monitoring — Patients should be reviewed after a suitable interval (shorter in more severe patients and longer in less severe patients) with assessment of symptoms using either the CAT or mMRC scores and exacerbation frequency; the effect of treatment and possible adverse effects should be evaluated and comorbidities reassessed. Inhaler technique, adherence, smoking status and continued exposure to risk factors should be regularly checked; physical activity should be encouraged; referral for pulmonary rehabilitation considered in severe patients; and the need for oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilatory support, lung volume reduction and palliative approaches considered individually with the action plan updated. Spirometry should be repeated at least annually, and if the patient is already receiving bronchodilator treatment, the latter should not be interrupted for performing spirometry. The report states that we no longer refer to asthma and COPD overlap (ACO) and emphasizes that asthma and COPD are different disorders; asthma and COPD may coexist, and if a concurrent diagnosis of asthma is suspected, pharmacotherapy should primarily follow asthma guidelines.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^22664f95]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^a409dfde]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Screening and case-finding — indications and approaches: The role of screening spirometry for the diagnosis of COPD in the general population is controversial. In asymptomatic individuals without any significant exposures to tobacco or other risk factors, screening spirometry is probably not indicated; whereas in those with symptoms or risk factors (e.g., > 20 pack-years of smoking, recurrent chest infections, early life events), the diagnostic yield for COPD is relatively high and spirometry should be considered as a method for early case finding. Both FEV1 and FVC predict all-cause mortality independent of tobacco smoking, but data to support that population-based screening spirometry is effective in directing management decisions or in improving COPD outcomes in patients who are identified before the development of significant symptoms is weak. An randomized controlled trial (RCT) using community case-finding reported that symptomatic individuals with undiagnosed COPD who received treatment by a pulmonologist and an educator had fewer respiratory events over one year and showed improvements in symptoms, lung function, and disease-specific quality of life, and these results suggest that such an approach, leading to early diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic COPD results in better clinical outcomes. GOLD advocates active case finding, i.e., performing spirometry in patients with symptoms and/or risk factors, but not screening spirometry, and systematic active case-finding in a primary care setting via mail-out of a screening questionnaire was also found to be an effective way to identify undiagnosed COPD patients.

### Characterizing undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fbcb5b45]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The findings from this systematic review have important implications for research and policy around COPD diagnosis, for example, in estimating the return on investment in screening and case detection strategies for COPD. The true burden of COPD is the sum of the disease burden in diagnosed and undiagnosed patients. Our results indicate that undiagnosed patients generally have milder disease and therefore a lower disease burden, meaning that strategies aiming to reduce the underdiagnosis problem are unlikely to result in immediate and dramatic improvements in patient-related outcomes such as symptoms. However, the gap in disease severity and symptom burden between diagnosed and undiagnosed patients also indicates a delay in COPD diagnosis. Given the potential for disease modification at early stages of COPD, reducing this delay could be associated with substantial improvement in long-term patient outcomes and a reduction in mortality and costs.

### Primary care of the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-part 1: frontline prevention and early diagnosis [^9f3f74f4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most important chronic respiratory illness affecting adults in the United States, yet it remains grossly underdiagnosed. This article translates key guideline recommendations for prevention and early diagnosis of COPD into the practical context of primary care. A literature review identified clinical trials with relevant information on COPD epidemiology, diagnosis, the role of primary care clinicians, the implementation of spirometry, and the impact of smoking cessation. After formal presentations to a panel of pulmonary specialists and primary care clinicians, key messages were identified and integrated to create this first report in a 4-part mini-symposium. The main points of the roundtable consensus were as follows: (1) ≥ 50% of smokers will develop some degree of COPD; (2) patients with earlier stages of COPD are often undiagnosed; (3) too many clinicians are not aware that COPD is partially reversible; (4) treatment of COPD can improve patient symptoms, exercise capacity, quality of life, and health status, and prevent exacerbations; (5) diagnosis can be easily accomplished with a careful history and in-office spirometry in symptomatic patients and those at risk (e.g., present and past smokers); and (6) all smokers should be identified and targeted for smoking cessation programs. We conclude that primary care clinicians see the vast majority of patients with early or mild COPD. These practitioners must become aware that COPD is an important problem in their patient population and that they need to integrate simple questions and in-office tools into their practice to increase their diagnosis of COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up after therapy initiation — following implementation of therapy, patients should be reassessed for attainment of treatment goals and identification of any barriers for successful treatment; following review of the patient's response to treatment initiation, adjustments may be needed. This is guided by the principles of first review and assess, then adjust if necessary, including to review symptoms (dyspnea) and exacerbation risk (previous history, blood eosinophils), assess inhaler technique and adherence and the role of non-pharmacological approaches, and adjust pharmacological treatment including escalation or de-escalation; switching inhaler device or molecules within the same class may be considered as appropriate, and any change in treatment requires a subsequent review of the clinical response, including side effects.

If symptoms persist, "consider need to initiate/adjust medication and assess inhaler technique", "ensure patient is on a SABA (PRN)", and escalate with "First line LAMA", "Add LABA for severe symptoms (preferably combination inhaler)", "Add ICS only for continued moderate to severe exacerbations (see Sidebar 1)", and "Pulmonology referral". For hypoxemia, "Consider need for oxygen if patient has resting hypoxemia (refer to home oxygen clinic if appropriate)". Ongoing care includes "Continue follow-up and monitoring", "Reassess severity periodically", "Consider pulmonary rehabilitation", "Consider medication adjustment if patient is on an inhaled corticosteroid (see Module C)", "Consider offering referral to a pulmonologist or a palliative care specialist as appropriate for patients with persistent refractory dyspnea", and "Carefully consider alternatives to beta blockers for non-cardiac indications (e.g. HTN)".

Follow-up of Patients with COPD Who Developed COVID-19

Approximately 30% of patients with SARS or MERS had persistent lung abnormalities and abnormal radiology that were consistent with fibrotic lung disease after their acute illness. There are not yet long-term studies on the follow-up of patients with COVID-19, nor recommendations for monitoring these patients, thus the follow up of patients with COPD who developed COVID-19 is still based on expert opinion and consensus. The intensity of the monitoring obviously depends on the severity of the COVID-19 episode.

Patients who developed mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual protocols used for patients with COPD. Patients who developed moderate COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia but no respiratory failure, should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

If chest X-ray abnormalities have not resolved at hospital discharge, a chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan should be considered at 6 months to 1 year. Complications occurring during/after the COVID-19 episode should also be monitored.

Patients with COPD are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and multimorbid survivors frequently have required prolonged ICU stays. Until we have evidence from prospective studies, survivors of severe COVID-19 with COPD should be considered at a high risk of developing a "critical illness" or a "chronic critical illness", a severe heterogeneous condition linked not only to the acute infectious episode but also to the underlying conditions before they became severely ill.

There are informative candidate models for the comprehensive management of complex care delivery that are already published and undergoing study in a primary care setting, and these may be adapted for application after COVID-19.

Hospitalization assessment and emergency department management in COPD exacerbations — potential indications for hospitalization assessment include severe symptoms such as sudden worsening of resting dyspnea, high respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, confusion, drowsiness; acute respiratory failure; onset of new physical signs (e.g., cyanosis, peripheral edema); failure of an exacerbation to respond to initial medical management; presence of serious comorbidities (e.g., heart failure, newly occurring arrhythmias, etc.); and insufficient home support. When patients with a COPD exacerbation come to the emergency department, if hypoxemic they should be provided with supplemental oxygen and undergo assessment to determine whether the exacerbation is life-threatening and if increased work of breathing or impaired gas exchange requires consideration for non-invasive ventilation; if so, healthcare providers should consider admission to an area where proper monitoring and care can be provided, whereas in less severe cases the patient may be managed in the emergency department or hospital ward unit. In addition to pharmacological therapy, hospital management of exacerbations includes respiratory support (oxygen therapy, ventilation), and we recommend that in hospitalized patients the severity of the exacerbation should be based on the patient's clinical signs.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. The 2022 GOLD guidelines define AECOPD as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy. However, it is increasingly recognized that AECOPD is heterogenous. Exacerbations have a range of underlying etiologies and clinicopathological processes manifesting with similar syndromic phenotypes, each of which could have different prognosis and response to therapy. A diagnosis of AECOPD relies on subjective symptoms, and non-specific clinical features, which can be confounded by several associated comorbidities that are highly prevalent in the COPD population. It is not uncommon that COPD patients presenting with dyspnea receive a diagnosis of AECOPD, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure all in one setting. This ambiguity leads to a broad, complex, and potentially unnecessary treatment regimen.

We aimed to identify clinical, radiographic, and laboratory characteristics that might help distinguish AECOPD from symptoms secondary to another dominant disease in patients with a history of COPD.

In the second study, usual care plus an active strategy for diagnosing PE was compared with usual care alone in 746 patients not suspected of having a PE by the physician in charge who were hospitalized because of an ECOPD, the primary outcome being a composite index of nonfatal venous thromboembolism, COPD readmission, or death within 90 days. Patients in the intervention group underwent D-dimer testing, with a negative D-dimer value (less than 500 ng/ml) used to exclude PE. A CTPA was performed only in patients with a positive D-dimer value. The primary outcome was similar in the two groups (29.7% and 29.2% in the intervention and control groups, respectively).

These studies show that in patients hospitalized with an ECOPD, overall PE prevalence is around 4–6%. In patients with suspected PE, the prevalence of venous thromboembolism was 11.7% and 4.3% among those in whom PE was not suspected. Given the high mortality with PE, evidence supports CTPA imaging in patients with a high clinical PE pretest probability (Geneva score of at least 11) and an atypical clinical presentation for ECOPD, with no need to assess D-dimer concentrations. If the pretest probability is low (Geneva score less than 11), a D-dimer less than 500 ng/ml would support ECOPD as the diagnosis and help avoid imaging testing. In addition, lower-limb compression ultrasonography (CUS) can diagnose DVT in patients with a negative CTPA (or when CTPA is contraindicated). In the setting of suspected PE, CUS can be limited to a simple four-point examination (bilateral groin and popliteal fossa). The probability of a positive proximal CUS in suspected PE is higher in patients with signs and symptoms related to the leg veins than in asymptomatic patients. The diagnostic approach for a patient with suspected PE is shown in Figure 4.

Fourth, while post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended. The degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate COPD from asthma (except when airflow limitation disappears following bronchodilators, which is incompatible with COPD), or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids. Accordingly, it is not necessary nor advised to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

Finally, the role of screening spirometry in the general population for the diagnosis of COPD is also controversial. In asymptomatic individuals without any significant exposure to tobacco or other risk factors, screening spirometry is probably not indicated. By contrast, in those with symptoms and/or risk factors (e.g. > 20 pack-years of smoking, recurrent chest infections, prematurity, or other significant early-life events), the diagnostic yield for COPD is relatively high, and spirometry should be considered as a method for case finding.

Introduction

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common inflammatory lung condition that is characterized by symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Although COPD is under-diagnosed in the community, several major guidelines, including from the influential US Preventive Services Task Force, have recommended against the use of spirometry to screen for COPD in asymptomatic individuals in the general population because the number-needed-to-screen (NNS) to prevent adverse disease outcomes is prohibitively large. Some have advocated for case finding strategies to improve the diagnosis rate in the community in a more cost-effective manner, for example by targeting spirometry only among symptomatic individuals. However, many patients with undiagnosed COPD have mild disease and may have few (if any) respiratory symptoms, and individuals without COPD can experience symptoms similar to those of COPD patients. In addition, symptomatic COPD patients tend to be diagnosed earlier and are therefore removed from the pool of cases that would be detected through a screening program. We determined the diagnostic performance of patient symptoms for screening in the general population to assess whether the yield of screening could be improved by restricting it to the symptomatic population.

Investigations

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Infection

Patients with COPD presenting with respiratory symptoms, fever, or other symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection, even if mild, should be tested for possible infection (Figure 1). False-negative RT-PCR tests have been reported in patients with computed tomographic (CT) scan findings of COVID-19, who eventually tested positive with serial sampling. If patients with COPD have been exposed to someone with a known COVID-19 infection, they should contact their healthcare provider to define the need for specific testing. Antibody testing may be used to support clinical assessment of patients who present late.

ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; BNP = brain natriuretic peptide; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; CRP = C-reactive protein; CT = computed tomography; CXR = chest radiograph; HFNT = high-flow nasal therapy; IMV = invasive mechanical ventilation; LDH = lactate dehydrogenase; NIV = noninvasive ventilation; PCT = procalcitonin; PFT = pulmonary function tests; PR = pulmonary rehabilitation; SIRS = systemic inflammatory response syndrome; SOB = shortness of breath; SpO₂ = peripheral oxygen saturation; VTE = venous thromboembolism.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 does not exclude the potential for coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. The U.S. CDC encourages testing for other causes of respiratory illness in addition to testing for SARS-CoV-2 depending on patient age, season, or clinical setting.

Some patients experience reactivation of long-lasting virus carriage or become reinfected, and this might be influenced by comorbidities or drugs that hamper the immune response. Repeat testing should be performed in patients with suspected recurrence or relapse of COVID-19.

The lung microbiome is different in patients with COPD versus healthy subjects. The lung microbiome can modify the immune response to viral infections but, to date, there is no direct evidence from human or animal studies on the role of lung microbiome in modifying COVID-19 disease nor on its potential effects in patients with COPD.

Pneumonia

In patients with COPD, the symptoms of pneumonia and ECOPD may be similar (worsened cough, sputum production, dyspnea, and fever). Physical examination may help in the differentiation, with signs of consolidation (localized crackles, crepitus, and dullness on percussion) more frequent in patients with pneumonia. However, because a diagnosis of COPD increases pneumonia risk (by 1.3- to 13.5-fold) and severity, pneumonia should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with symptoms of ECOPD.

If the clinical assessment deems the ECOPD to be mild or moderate and there are no signs of lung consolidation, no further diagnostic testing to differentiate the two diseases is indicated. However, if the episode is severe and/or prolonged, and there are abnormal chest exam findings, a proper diagnosis of pneumonia should be undertaken. Mortality after hospitalized pneumonia is higher than after hospitalized ECOPD. Although most patients without severe ECOPD can be safely treated on the basis of chest X-ray results alone, opacities not visible on a chest X-ray may be seen with more sensitive CT scans.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^855085ec]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Recognition that the burden of this disorder will continue to increase over the next 20 years despite medical intervention has stimulated new research into the underlying mechanisms, leading to a rational basis for evaluation of existing therapies, and has suggested novel treatment approaches. Tobacco exposure remains the main but not exclusive cause of COPD. Whether the lung is injured by changes in the balance of proteases and antiproteases, tissue damage by oxidative stress, or a combination of the two is still not known. The genetic basis of susceptibility to COPD is now being studied as is the role of computed tomography in the identification of structural damage in individuals with less symptomatic disease. Clinical diagnosis still relies heavily on an appropriate history confirmed by abnormal spirometry. Smoking cessation is possible in a substantial proportion of individuals with symptoms but is most effective if withdrawal is supported by pharmacological treatment. Treatment with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators and, in more severe disease, inhaled corticosteroids reduces symptoms and exacerbation frequency and improves health status. Rehabilitation can be even more effective, at least for a year after the treatment. Recent guidelines have made practical suggestions about how to optimise these treatments and when to consider addition of oxygen, surgery, and non-invasive ventilation. Regular review of this guidance is important if future management advances are to be implemented effectively.

Ultimately, whether features currently covered by the term pre-COPD really correspond to predisease or represent early stages of the disease itself can be questioned, keeping in mind that for now, an irreversible component (responsible for persistent airway obstruction) is currently mandatory to define COPD. Including patients with features currently corresponding to the pre-COPD concept within the COPD spectrum would require changing the very definition of COPD.

Two approaches could be imagined to support such a move. The first approach would be to keep the current definition but broaden the definition of airflow obstruction to include functional abnormalities other than low FEV 1 /FVC ratio (using spirometry, plethysmography, or forced oscillometry) or imaging (computed tomography [CT] based) markers of small airway disease. The second approach would be to define COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms due to abnormalities of the airways and/or alveoli that can cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction. This second option would explicitly allow early stages of COPD (before fixed airflow obstruction is present) to be reversible and/or curable, which is in complete opposition to how COPD is currently considered. Such a change would preserve the possibility of preventing the occurrence of permanent airway obstruction by intervening sufficiently early in the course of the disease.

This issue of pre-COPD and whether some corresponding features should be included in the definition of COPD is particularly relevant considering the recently identified developmental origins of COPD, the natural history of which remains to be fully deciphered.

Irrespective of how they are conceptually considered, one key issue to be solved is how individuals with pre-COPD/early COPD will be detected to facilitate the implementation of preventive measures, encourage research on the natural history of these conditions, and ultimately allow the development of novel disease-modifying therapies. These subjects usually have few symptoms and remain largely ignored. Identifying them requires the implementation of systematic screening or case-finding approaches, relying on four pillars: the identification of risk factors, symptoms, lung function abnormalities, and imaging features. The two first pillars are purely clinical and can rely on any healthcare professional or on the population itself, provided that awareness is raised and that appropriate tools/checklists/questionnaires are made widely available. However, although cumulative tobacco smoking is easy to quantify, the assessment of most other risk factors is poorly standardized.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be considered in patients who present with respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and a history of risk factors, especially smoking. Spirometry is required to confirm a chronic obstruction and to confirm the diagnosis, using the ratio of the post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) to less than 0.70. However, several studies from various countries show a substantial underuse of spirometry in the initial assessment of patients with suspected COPD –. Both over- and underdiagnosis of COPD may thus occur, leading to suboptimal COPD care –. In Sweden, COPD is mainly diagnosed and managed in primary care, where access to spirometers has increased during the last decades.

In 2005, the first Swedish PRAXIS study COPD cohort with patients from both primary and secondary care was created (PRAXIS I). In this cohort, 59% of patients had a spirometry performed at diagnosis of COPD.

In 2014, a new cohort of COPD patients (PRAXIS II) was recruited from the same geographic area. During the study period, the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Medical Agency published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with COPD based on the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommendations –.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether the proportion of performed spirometries at COPD diagnosis increased after the new national guidelines were implemented, and to investigate patient-related factors associated with a COPD diagnosis without a diagnostic spirometry. Secondary aims were to assess whether spirometries were correctly interpreted regarding COPD diagnosis, defined as airway obstruction FEV₁/FVC < 0.70, and whether the obstruction was persistent at follow-up.

Differential diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — suggestive features distinguishing COPD from common mimics are listed as follows. COPD presents with symptoms slowly progressive and a history of tobacco smoking or other risk factors. Asthma shows variable airflow obstruction with symptoms that vary widely from day to day, symptoms worse at night/early morning, allergy, rhinitis, and/or eczema also present, often occurs in children, and family history of asthma. Congestive heart failure is suggested by chest X-ray showing a dilated heart and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary function tests indicating volume restriction, not airflow obstruction. Bronchiectasis features large volumes of purulent sputum, is commonly associated with bacterial infection, and chest X-ray/HRCT shows bronchial dilation. Tuberculosis can have onset at all ages, chest X-ray shows lung infiltrate, microbiological confirmation, and high local prevalence of tuberculosis. Obliterative bronchiolitis can occur in children, is seen after lung or bone marrow transplantation, and HRCT on expiration shows hypodense areas. Diffuse panbronchiolitis is predominantly seen in patients of Asian descent; most patients are male and nonsmokers; almost all have chronic sinusitis; and chest X-ray & HRCT show diffuse small centrilobular nodular opacities & hyperinflation. These features are characteristic but not mandatory; for example, a person who has never smoked may develop COPD, especially in LMICs where other risk factors may be more important than cigarette smoking.
