## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are contraindicated or should be avoided in patients with glaucoma, and how to distinguish absolute from relative contraindications by glaucoma type. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the two major glaucoma phenotypes and their pathophysiology. Then, I should verify which drug classes and specific agents carry absolute contraindications versus warnings. Next, I will examine high-quality evidence for relative risks and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and monitoring steps, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework: glaucoma is broadly divided into open-angle glaucoma, where the trabecular meshwork is open but dysfunctional, and angle-closure glaucoma, where the iridocorneal angle is narrow or closed, often with pupillary block, and this distinction drives which medications are dangerous versus merely cautionary.

> I will now examine medications with absolute contraindications in angle-closure glaucoma, because these can precipitate an acute attack. Anticholinergics and adrenergic mydriatics can cause pupillary block and are contraindicated in narrow-angle or untreated angle-closure glaucoma; examples include homatropine ophthalmic, cyclopentolate, and systemic agents like glycopyrrolate, with explicit labeling to avoid in glaucoma or narrow angles [^1174hNkL] [^114x3jwz] [^114FudQC] [^115B6fb5].

> Wait, let me verify the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and triptans, because I recall conflicting guidance. Initially, I thought duloxetine might be absolutely contraindicated, but hold on, I should verify the FDA language: duloxetine carries a warning that it can cause pupillary dilation and precipitate angle-closure in susceptible individuals, and it advises screening for narrow angles rather than stating an absolute contraindication, so this is a strong relative warning rather than an absolute ban; similarly, sumatriptan and other serotonergic agents are associated with increased odds of acute angle-closure, reinforcing caution and pre-prescription gonioscopy in at-risk patients [^113gfyNY] [^115azxFr] [^113BUzNi] [^1132LEhf].

> Next, I should review systemic medications with anticholinergic burden that are relatively contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma. Antimuscarinics for overactive bladder, such as tolterodine, trospium, and oxybutynin, carry warnings to use extreme caution or avoid in patients with narrow angles due to risk of increasing intraocular pressure; clinicians should coordinate with ophthalmology before prescribing in this setting [^113LCnC4] [^117MfobY] [^112xaXAn] [^1116ELhQ] [^116T3cvX].

> Let me consider medications that are problematic in open-angle glaucoma, where the concern is steroid-induced IOP elevation. Systemic and especially topical corticosteroids can raise IOP and induce steroid-response glaucoma; risk is higher with topical steroids, and chronic use warrants IOP monitoring and consideration of alternatives or steroid-sparing strategies when possible [^111H8Bex] [^115fitvh].

> I should double-check the paradox around beta-blockers. Nonselective topical beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with reactive airway disease, bradyarrhythmias, or heart failure due to systemic effects, but wait, I need to clarify the hypertension guidance: the 2023 ESH hypertension guideline actually recommends preferring beta-blockers in patients with hypertension and open-angle glaucoma because they can lower IOP, so the contraindication is cardiorespiratory, not glaucoma-related; I almost misstated this as a glaucoma contraindication, but that would have been incorrect [^115fjTtj] [^1176optJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the anti-obesity agents. Phentermine/topiramate is contraindicated in glaucoma, particularly because topiramate can precipitate acute angle-closure, and bupropion/naltrexone carries a warning to use caution in glaucoma; these risks justify avoiding these combinations in patients with any glaucoma phenotype, especially angle-closure or anatomically narrow angles [^115WdAsg] [^1132LEhf] [^114jd5de] [^112kb62E].

> I need to ensure I cover indirect contributors. Bedtime dosing of antihypertensives can cause nocturnal hypotension and has been associated with visual field progression in glaucoma; therefore, avoiding bedtime antihypertensives is a reasonable precaution in patients with glaucoma, particularly those with advanced disease or low nocturnal blood pressure [^11217ogx] [^1157jZWz].

> Let me synthesize by risk category. Absolute contraindications apply primarily to untreated narrow-angle or angle-closure glaucoma and include anticholinergic ophthalmic agents, adrenergic mydriatics, and systemic anticholinergics with strong antimuscarinic effects; relative contraindications or strong warnings include SNRIs like duloxetine, triptans, and anti-obesity combinations containing topiramate or bupropion, with risk mitigated by pre-prescription gonioscopy and shared decision-making; in open-angle glaucoma, avoid steroid-induced IOP spikes and be mindful of topical beta-blocker systemic effects, while recognizing that cardioselective beta-blockers may be preferred in hypertensive glaucoma patients [^1174hNkL] [^114x3jwz] [^114FudQC] [^113gfyNY] [^1132LEhf] [^115WdAsg] [^11645Gei] [^1176optJ].

> But wait, what if the patient already has a patent iridotomy or is pseudophakic with an open angle? In that scenario, the absolute contraindications to anticholinergics and mydriatics no longer apply, though caution remains prudent; I should confirm angle status before overriding warnings and document ophthalmology input when uncertainty exists [^113gfyNY].

> Next, I should review practical steps. Before prescribing high-risk drugs, screen for angle-closure risk with gonioscopy or at minimum a careful anterior chamber assessment, ask about prior angle-closure symptoms, and coordinate with ophthalmology; if a high-risk medication must be used, consider prophylactic laser iridotomy in anatomically narrow angles and counsel patients to stop the drug and seek urgent care if they develop eye pain, halos, or blurred vision suggestive of angle-closure [^113gfyNY] [^115azxFr] [^113BUzNi].

> Finally, I should confirm that I have addressed special populations. In pregnancy, many glaucoma medications are category C, so minimize systemic exposure with punctal occlusion and consider procedural options when feasible; in children, avoid systemic anticholinergics when possible due to anticholinergic toxicity; in older adults with polypharmacy, prioritize once-daily, preservative-free regimens and simplify to improve adherence and reduce ocular surface toxicity, which itself can confound IOP control and adherence [^1156sb7M] [^113LvGW6] [^1122zVKp].

---

Medications that are contraindicated or require caution in glaucoma fall into two main groups: **angle-closure risk** and **steroid-induced IOP elevation**. Absolute contraindications include **anticholinergics** (e.g. atropine, cyclopentolate, glycopyrrolate) [^1174hNkL] [^114x3jwz] [^114FudQC], **sympathomimetics** (e.g. epinephrine, phenylephrine) [^111H8Bex], and **topiramate** [^1132LEhf] in narrow-angle or untreated angle-closure glaucoma because they can precipitate acute angle closure. Corticosteroids (especially topical) are contraindicated in steroid-responsive glaucoma due to **IOP elevation** [^111H8Bex] [^115fitvh]. Relative contraindications include **tricyclic antidepressants**, **SSRIs/SNRIs**, and **benzodiazepines** in narrow-angle glaucoma; use with caution and monitor IOP [^116vCFHq] [^113gfyNY] [^111gRDm8]. Always assess angle status before prescribing these agents and avoid in high-risk patients [^115fitvh].

## Medications contraindicated in angle-closure glaucoma

Angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by a **narrow anterior chamber angle**, which can lead to acute angle-closure attacks if certain medications are administered. The following medications are contraindicated in patients with angle-closure glaucoma:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of risk** |
|-|-|-|
| Anticholinergics | - Atropine <br/> - Cyclopentolate <br/> - Glycopyrrolate | Pupillary dilation and angle closure [^1174hNkL] [^114x3jwz] [^114FudQC] |
| Sympathomimetics | - Epinephrine <br/> - Phenylephrine | Pupillary dilation and angle closure [^111H8Bex] |
| Antidepressants | - Tricyclics (e.g. amitriptyline) <br/> - SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine) <br/> - SNRIs (e.g. duloxetine) | Pupillary dilation and angle closure [^116vCFHq] [^113gfyNY] [^115azxFr] |
| Benzodiazepines | - Alprazolam <br/> - Diazepam | Pupillary dilation and angle closure [^111gRDm8] |
| Anticonvulsants | - Topiramate | Ciliary body swelling and angle closure [^1132LEhf] |

---

These medications can precipitate **acute angle-closure glaucoma**, a medical emergency characterized by sudden IOP elevation, severe eye pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances. Immediate discontinuation of the offending medication and urgent ophthalmic intervention are required [^111H8Bex].

---

## Medications contraindicated in steroid-responsive glaucoma

Steroid-responsive glaucoma is a form of **open-angle glaucoma** characterized by elevated IOP in response to corticosteroid therapy. The following medications are contraindicated in patients with steroid-responsive glaucoma:

- **Corticosteroids**: Topical corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone, dexamethasone) are contraindicated due to their potential to significantly elevate IOP and worsen glaucomatous damage [^111H8Bex] [^115fitvh].

---

## Medications requiring caution in glaucoma

Certain medications are not absolutely contraindicated but require **cautious use and close monitoring** in patients with glaucoma:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Reason for caution** |
|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | - Timolol <br/> - Betaxolol | Systemic absorption can cause bradycardia, bronchospasm, and hypotension [^115fjTtj] |
| Alpha-agonists | - Apraclonidine <br/> - Brimonidine | Systemic absorption can cause hypotension, bradycardia, and CNS depression [^notfound] |
| Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors | - Acetazolamide <br/> - Dorzolamide | Systemic side effects include metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbances, and sulfa allergy reactions [^116z5pP9] |
| Anticholinergics | - Oxybutynin <br/> - Tolterodine | Can cause pupillary dilation and angle closure in susceptible individuals [^113LCnC4] [^117MfobY] [^112xaXAn] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Healthcare providers should thoroughly assess a patient's **glaucoma status** before prescribing medications that may exacerbate the condition. Strategies to mitigate risks include:

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma and advise immediate medical attention if symptoms occur [^113gfyNY].
- **Regular monitoring**: Schedule regular IOP checks and ophthalmic evaluations for patients on medications with potential glaucoma risks [^1156NsQT].
- **Alternative medications**: Consider alternative therapies with lower glaucoma risk profiles whenever possible [^115fjTtj].

---

## Conclusion

Medications contraindicated in glaucoma include **anticholinergics**, **sympathomimetics**, **certain antidepressants**, **benzodiazepines**, and **topiramate** for angle-closure glaucoma, and **corticosteroids** for steroid-responsive glaucoma. Other medications require cautious use with regular monitoring. Healthcare providers must carefully assess patient risk factors and educate patients to prevent serious complications.

### Iatrogenic glaucoma secondary to medications [^111H8Bex]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy with primary and secondary forms. Iatrogenic glaucoma secondary to medications is potentially blinding but preventable. Most drug profiles listing glaucoma as a contraindication or an adverse effect are concerned with inducing acute angle-closure glaucoma. Anticholinergic or adrenergic agents are the most common for inducing "pupillary block" angle-closure glaucoma. Patients with a narrow irido-corneal angle are at high risk. Sulfa drugs induce "non-pupillary block" angle-closure glaucoma as an idiosyncratic reaction to the drug in patients with an open or narrow irido-corneal angle. Steroids and a few antineoplastic agents induce open-angle glaucoma. The risk is higher with topical rather than systemic steroids. The first step in the management is discontinuation of the drug, followed by medical, laser, and, if necessary, surgical intervention.

### Use of glaucoma medications: state of the science and directions for observational research [^111Z9KiH]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To summarize observational studies that focus on the use of glaucoma medications and to identify gaps in knowledge to guide future investigation.

Design

Literature study.

Methods

We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed for English language articles published through December 2009 using the search terms physician's practice patterns, drug prescriptions, pharmaceutical services, medication adherence, ophthalmology, glaucoma, and ophthalmic solutions. We categorized studies by areas of focus and extracted and summarized key features: study population, data sources, and main findings.

Results

We identified 2224 articles by the search. Fifty-five described glaucoma medication use using large databases. Predominant areas of focus were: trends in prescription choices (n = 13); adherence, persistence, or both (n = 31); rational use of medications (n = 9); and policy-related issues (n = 2). Over the last decade, use of β-blockers and miotics has decreased substantially, whereas new agents, particularly prostaglandin analogs, have become more popular. Nonadherence was an issue in more than 25% of patients. A significant proportion of patients with comorbidities, contraindications, or both had received topical β-blockers.

Conclusions

To date, most studies have focused on adherence to glaucoma medications and changes in treatment choices. Major gaps in knowledge include prescribing patterns by prescriber specialty (ophthalmologists, primary care physicians, and optometrists), medication-related problems, and subsequent adverse health outcomes. Well-designed longitudinal observational studies addressing these gaps are warranted to improve patient safety.

### Care of the patient with primary open-angle glaucoma [^114jHtka]. AOA (2010). Medium credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OH) — prostaglandin analogs (PGAs) should be considered as an initial therapy in patients with ocular hypertension (OH) or primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), unless contraindicated, with Evidence Quality: Grade A based on Systematic Reviews, Level of Confidence: High, and a Clinical Recommendation Level of Strong Recommendation that should be followed unless clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Evidence statements indicate PGAs provide the best intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering among monotherapy topical drugs, combining a PGA with another topical drug category further enhances IOP decrease, and adverse effect incidents should be considered; overall PGAs are more efficacious in lowering IOP at three months than beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, with bimatoprost, latanoprost and travoprost among the most efficacious and within-class differences small and possibly not clinically meaningful. Potential benefits are preventing and/or minimizing vision loss; potential risks/harms are side effects of medication; benefits significantly outweigh harms; the role of patient preferences is moderate; and gaps in evidence include the need for research on current medical treatments compared with surgery, particularly for people with severe glaucoma and in ethnic groups.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^114x8sem]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma — adjustment of therapy is guided by the following indications: Target intraocular pressure (IOP) is not achieved and the benefits of a change in therapy outweigh the risks for the patient; a patient has progressive optic nerve damage despite achieving the target IOP; the patient is intolerant of the prescribed medical regimen; the patient does not adhere to the prescribed medical regimen; contraindications to individual medicines develop; and when stable optic nerve status and low IOP occur for a prolonged period in a patient taking topical ocular hypotensive agents, a carefully monitored attempt to reduce the medical regimen may be appropriate. Downward adjustment of target pressure can be made in the face of progressive optic disc, imaging, or visual field change. Upward adjustment of target pressure can be considered if the patient has been stable and if the patient either requires (because of side effects) or desires less medication. A follow-up visit in 2 to 8 weeks, depending on disease severity, may help to assess the response and side effects from washout of the old medication or onset of maximum effect of the new medication.

### Care of the patient with primary open-angle glaucoma [^112LPxdY]. AOA (2010). Medium credibility.

Summary listing of action statements — examination and initial management for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG): The examination of a person suspected of having POAG should include all aspects of a comprehensive eye and vision examination, with emphasis on the evaluation of the anterior chamber angle, optic nerve head (ONH), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), macula and visual fields (VF), and measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) and central corneal thickness (CCT) (Evidence Grade: B, Recommendation). The use of prostaglandin analogs (PGAs) should be considered as an initial therapy in patients with ocular hypertension (OH) or POAG, unless contraindicated (Evidence Grade: A, Strong Recommendation). Patients prescribed topical IOP lowering therapy may experience decreased tear film stability and elevated tear osmolarity and should be evaluated for ocular surface disease (OSD) (Evidence Grade: C, Recommendation). Pharmacological treatment of POAG should be used with caution during pregnancy and lactation (Consensus Statement). Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) should be considered as an initial/alternative or additive therapy to medication for achieving IOP control in patients with OH or POAG (Evidence Grade: A, Strong Recommendation).

Strength of Clinical Recommendation Levels — definitions and clinician guidance are as follows: Strong Recommendation states that the benefits clearly exceed the harms and the quality of evidence is excellent (Grade A or B), and "This recommendation should be followed unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". Recommendation indicates benefits exceed harms but the evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C), and "This recommendation should generally be followed but remain alert for new information". Discretional notes that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms, and "There should be an awareness of this recommendation but a flexibility in clinical decision-making, as well as remaining alert for new information".

### Association between the use of glaucoma medications and mortality… [^112K9LHz]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Graph of glaucoma medication use in beneficiaries taking glaucoma medications on January 1, 2006. AA indicates α-agonist; BB, β-blocker; other, topical and oral anhydrase inhibitors, miotics, and epinephrine compounds; and PGA, prostaglandin analogue. Objective To evaluate the relationship between glaucoma medication use and death. Studies that have assessed the relationship between use of glaucoma medications, specifically, topical β-blockers, and mortality include 2 clinical trials and 2 population-based studies. In 2 of these studies, the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study19 and the Rotterdam Study, 15 no association was found between topical β-blocker use and mortality. In the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial, 18 the rate of death was nonsignificantly lower in untreated persons with open-angle glaucoma than in patients with open-angle glaucoma receiving topical betaxolol hydrochloride, a difference the investigators attributed to chance.

Finally, the Blue Mountains Eye Study3 demonstrated an increased hazard of death in participants taking topical β-blockers. An editorial21 that accompanied the Blue Mountains Eye Study report questioned why topical β-blockers would be associated with an elevated risk of death given the voluminous evidence in the medical literature supporting the survival benefits of β-blockers. The editorialist recommended that additional studies be performed to better understand the relationship between glaucoma medication use and death. The numbers of beneficiaries taking oral CAIs, epinephrine compounds, and miotics were insufficient to include in the univariable and multivariable analyses. Glaucoma medication use was defined as filling 1 or more prescriptions for a 30-day-or-more supply of the drug during the study period. The combination agent dorzolamide hydrochloride–timolol maleate was recorded as a β-antagonist and as a topical CAI.

Additional models of time to death were evaluated for different combinations of glaucoma medications as predictors of death, with adjustment for demographic variables and comorbid medical conditions. The use of PGAs, alone or combined with other glaucoma medication classes, was associated with a decrease in mortality compared with individuals who did not receive PGAs.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^115XUXVU]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect — medication adjustment and regimen planning emphasize that if a drug fails to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) sufficiently, switching to an alternative monotherapy or adding another medication is appropriate until the desired IOP level is attained, and fixed combination therapy may improve patient adherence even though it is not recommended for initial treatment in most circumstances. The patient and the ophthalmologist together decide on a practical regimen considering dosing, cost, adherence, age, and preferences; the ophthalmologist should assess local ocular and systemic side effects and toxicity, including interactions and potential life-threatening adverse reactions, and patients can be educated about eyelid closure or nasolacrimal occlusion to reduce systemic absorption after instillation.

### Glaucoma in adults-screening, diagnosis, and management: a review [^115fitvh]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Glaucoma is the most common cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Many patients with glaucoma are asymptomatic early in the disease course. Primary care clinicians should know which patients to refer to an eye care professional for a complete eye examination to check for signs of glaucoma and to determine what systemic conditions or medications can increase a patient's risk of glaucoma. Open-angle and narrow-angle forms of glaucoma are reviewed, including a description of the pathophysiology, risk factors, screening, disease monitoring, and treatment options.

Observations

Glaucoma is a chronic progressive optic neuropathy, characterized by damage to the optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer, that can lead to permanent loss of peripheral or central vision. Intraocular pressure is the only known modifiable risk factor. Other important risk factors include older age, nonwhite race, and a family history of glaucoma. Several systemic medical conditions and medications including corticosteroids, anticholinergics, certain antidepressants, and topiramate may predispose patients to glaucoma. There are 2 broad categories of glaucoma, open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma. Diagnostic testing to assess for glaucoma and to monitor for disease progression includes measurement of intraocular pressure, perimetry, and optical coherence tomography. Treatment of glaucoma involves lowering intraocular pressure. This can be achieved with various classes of glaucoma medications as well as laser and incisional surgical procedures.

Conclusions and Relevance

Vision loss from glaucoma can be minimized by recognizing systemic conditions and medications that increase a patient's risk of glaucoma and referring high-risk patients for a complete ophthalmologic examination. Clinicians should ensure that patients remain adherent with taking glaucoma medications and should monitor for adverse events from medical or surgical interventions used to treat glaucoma.

### Duloxetine [^113gfyNY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- Angle-Closure Glaucoma

Advise patients that taking duloxetine can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle-closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle-closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle-closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible.

3.3.4 Second Line Drugs

3.3.4.1 Prostaglandin Analogues

Since their development in the 1990s, prostaglandin derivatives (latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost and tafluprost) (Table 3.3) have progressively replaced beta-blockers as first-choice/first line therapy. This is mainly because they are the most effective IOP- lowering agents, lack relevant systemic side effects and require just once-daily administration. Recently, a number of latanoprost generics as well as preservative-free and BAC-free prostaglandin formulations have entered the glaucoma market.

The primary mechanism of action of prostaglandins is to increase uveoscleral outflow, reducing IOP by 25%-35%. Reduction of IOP starts approximately 2–4 h after the first administration, with the peak effect within approximately 8–12 h. Thus, IOP measurements taken in the morning represent the peak effect of the prostaglandin analogues for patients administering the drug in the evening. Clinical trials that measured 24-hour IOP suggested that evening administration is generally preferable because it gave a better circadian IOP profile[II, B]. These studies also reported that eyes treated with PG derivatives have reduced short-term IOP variability as compared to eyes treated with other classes of drugs.

Maximum IOP lowering is often achieved 3–5 weeks from commencement of treatment. Differences among drugs within this class in the capability of reducing IOP did not exceed 1 mmHg. When combined with most of the other antiglaucoma drug classes, prostaglandin agents provide additive IOP lowering.

Non-responders to prostaglandin analogues (e.g. eyes with IOP reductions of less than 10% or 15% from baseline) are fewer than 10%. Some reports indicate that poor responders to one prostaglandin agent might respond to another agent within the same class. Conjunctival hyperemia, generally mild, is a common finding with slight difference in frequency and level among agents within this drug class. It usually decreases over time. Other PG side effects are reported in Table 3.3.

Details on the mode of action, IOP lowering effect, contraindications and side effects of other first line drugs (□-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha-2 selective adrenergic agonists) and second line drugs are listed in Tables 3.5–3.10.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^111S9TkY]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma medical treatment — medical therapy is the most common initial intervention to lower IOP; prostaglandin analogs are the most frequently prescribed because they are efficacious, well tolerated, and instilled once daily, and are often selected as initial therapy unless factors such as contraindications, cost, side effects, intolerance, or patient refusal preclude this. Topical beta adrenergic antagonists are commonly prescribed with good efficacy and tolerability; nonselective agents (e.g., timolol) block both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, while cardioselective beta-blockers (e.g., betaxolol) target beta-1 receptors and minimize, but do not completely eliminate, pulmonary risk in obstructive airway disease. Topical beta-blockers may be dosed once or twice daily, whereas nighttime dosing is associated with limited efficacy and may contribute to visual field progression via nocturnal reduction of systemic blood pressure. Other options include alpha2 adrenergic agonists, parasympathomimetics, rho-kinase inhibitors, and topical and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

Findings In this case-crossover study of data from Korea's Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database, the prescription records of 13 531 patients with AAC were analyzed, and 61 drugs were found to be associated with AAC. Among these, sumatriptan, topiramate, and duloxetine were found to have the highest odds of AAC development, and several drugs not previously reported to be associated with AAC, such as lactulose and metoclopramide, were identified. Meaning These findings suggest a need to consider these associations in patients taking any of the 61 drugs found to be associated with AAC. Importance Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a sight-threatening disease and can reportedly occur in association with various drugs. Objective To identify drugs that are associated with AAC glaucoma occurrence and evaluate the risk of AAC associated with each drug. A total of 61 drugs were found to be associated with AAC, among which sumatriptan was associated with the highest odds of AAC development, followed by topiramate and duloxetine. Conclusions and Relevance Results of this case-crossover study suggest a need to consider AAC risk in patients taking any of the 61 drugs found to be associated with AAC.

### Glycopyrrolate [^115B6fb5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Precipitation of Acute Glaucoma

Glycopyrrolate may cause increased intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma and reduce the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Instruct patients to discontinue glycopyrrolate and promptly seek medical care if they experience symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma (pain and reddening of the eyes accompanied by dilated pupils) [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Partial or Complete Mechanical Intestinal Obstruction

Glycopyrrolate may worsen intestinal mechanical obstruction, and diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. If partial or complete intestinal obstruction is suspected, discontinue the use of glycopyrrolate and evaluate for potential intestinal obstruction [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Due to Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility

Glycopyrrolate reduces gastrointestinal motility and may result in delayed gastric emptying, constipation, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction and may precipitate or aggravate paralytic ileus and toxic megacolon [see Contraindications (4)]. The risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions is further increased with the use of other anticholinergics and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis.

Monitor patients for symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Concomitant use of glycopyrrolate and other anticholinergics or other medications that decrease GI peristalsis is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.4 Cognitive and Visual Adverse Reactions

Glycopyrrolate may produce drowsiness and blurred vision and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery, or performing other hazardous work [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Concomitant use of other drugs that have anticholinergic properties may increase these effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or perform other hazardoustasks until they are reasonably certain that glycopyrrolate does not affect them adversely.

Discontinue glycopyrrolate if signs or symptoms of cognitive or visual impairment develop.

3.3.1.2 Add Second Drug / Combination Therapy

If the first choice monotherapy is well tolerated and has effective IOP lowering but has not succeeded in reaching the target pressure, the addition of a second drug should be considered [II, D]. While individualizing adjunctive therapy, issues to consider in selecting an adjunctive agent include additive efficacy, safety, frequency of dosing and cost. It is recommended to combine agents with different modes of action, one that affects production of aqueous humour and another that influences outflow [II, D]. In general, treatment with a combination of agents of different classes is associated with superior IOP lowering efficacy compared to each of the components used alone [I, A] (see Tables 3.1–3.2). However poly- drug regimens for glaucoma pose several important clinical challenges: multiple topical treatments may jeopardize adherence, result in reduced efficacy through wash-out of earlier medications with later medications, and increase exposure to preservatives.

Therefore, fixed combination therapy, when available, should be preferable to two separate instillations of agents [I, B].

Currently, all fixed combinations available in Europe contain a beta-blocker. However, beta-blocking agents can be associated with systemic side effects and need to be used cautiously in patients with serious concomitant cardiopulmonary diseases. It is therefore mandatory to exclude patients with these contra-indications before prescribing fixed combinations [I, D]. It is not recommended to combine two bottles of fixed combinations as both will contain a □-blocker and double the amount of this active drug with the risk of more systemic side effects [I, D]. On the other hand, fixed combinations containing timolol may be associated with a better local tolerability in some patients, though data are limited.

### Managing adverse effects of glaucoma medications [^115cVo4Z]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

As with any medication, glaucoma eye drop therapy would ideally maximize IOP-lowering efficacy and minimize adverse reactions. Due to adverse reactions, some patients' medication compliance may decrease because of bothersome cosmetic adverse reactions (eg, conjunctival hyperemia, eyelid pigmentation, DUES); some patients may choose to discontinue glaucoma medications on their own. Therefore, adverse reactions should be thoroughly explained to patients before beginning a new glaucoma eye drop and their presence should be checked at every clinic evaluation. As each patient responds differently to eye drops, each patient's general and ocular condition should be considered before beginning a new therapy.

### Minimally invasive surgery in mild-to-moderate glaucoma patients in Italy: is It time to change? [^112zzpVc]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Glaucoma Filtering Surgery

Conventional surgery has been the standard alternative to medical therapy and the mainstay of treatment for glaucoma patients: i) who have failed to have IOP controlled with less invasive options; ii) who are contraindicated to medical therapy; iii) for whom a lower target IOP must be achieved; iv) who have early-onset and/or rapidly progressing glaucoma. The primary goal of surgery is to reduce IOP and medication.

Conventionally, incisional surgery is classified into two main categories: i) anterior filtering surgery, and ii) posterior filtering surgery. Trabeculectomy is by far the most common of (penetrating) anterior filtering technique and is extensively used in OAG. Robust clinical evidence has shown that trabeculectomy is an effective treatment to achieve sustained IOP reduction without medical therapy.–However, as for any surgical approach, safety remains a concern. Despite technological advancements, there is a periprocedural and postprocedural "ineliminable" risk of adverse events, such as hemorrhage, endophthalmitis (filtering post-procedure incidence ranges from 0.12% to 8.33%), ocular infections, hypotony, visual loss (8.3% of patients showed loss of visual acuity after the first 3 months post-surgery), cataract development (the risk of requiring cataract surgery is reported as ranging between 20% and 52% up to 7 years postoperatively). Also, the impact on QoL is non-negligible, with patients reporting post-surgical pain, and overall reluctance or fear to undergo surgery. Other non-penetrating techniques have been used as alternatives to trabeculectomy to potentially reduce the burden of complications, but with less satisfactory IOP outcomes and other technical issues.–

Finally, posterior filtering surgery is used as a rescue option for those refractory patients who are still uncontrolled despite anterior filtering surgery ± medical therapy, or in patients in whom anterior filtration is not possible or has a high risk of failure.–The use of tube shunts has grown in recent years. However, despite clinical evidence has shown favorable outcomes associated with posterior filtering surgery, uncertainty remains on the risks of surgical complications. Many glaucoma specialists still consider posterior filtration as a second option.

3.3.8 Management of Glaucoma During Pregnancy and Breast-feeding

Pregnancy-related changes in ocular physiology can influence IOP as well as the reliability of its measurements. Changes in hormonal levels, are thought to induce an IOP-lowering effect that increases throughout pregnancy (but particularly during the 24 th -30 th week) and can last for months after delivery.

The most sensitive period is the first trimester due to concerns relating teratogenicity, as the majority of IOP-lowering medications are within class C (See Table 3.10) meaning that adverse effects have been seen in animals or that there are no human or animal data (See Table 3.11). Therefore, for a woman with glaucoma who is of child bearing age, who might wish to conceive, the treatment strategy during pregnancy should be discussed [I, D]. The patient should be instructed to inform the ophthalmologist when pregnancy occurs. The potential risks to the fetus (and neonate) of continuing anti-glaucoma medications must be balanced against the risk of vision loss in the mother [I, D]. As IOP levels generally decrease during pregnancy, temporary treatment discontinuation can be considered under strict follow-up in some patients. However, if continuation of treatment is mandated, the lowest effective dosage of medication should be used. Moreover, systemic absorption should be reduced by punctal occlusion, eyelid closure, and blotting excess drops away during administration[I, D].

### Update on the role of α-agonists in glaucoma management [^112kaAo4]. Experimental Eye Research (2011). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is the second most common cause of world blindness (following cataract) with estimated cases reaching 79.6 million by 2020. Although the etiology of glaucoma is multi-factorial, intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable factor in glaucoma management proven to alter the natural course of the disease. Among various classes of IOP-lowering medications currently available, alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists are used either as monotherapy, as second-line therapy, or in fixed combination with beta-blockers. Non-selective adrenergic agonists such as epinephrine and dipivefrin are infrequently used today for the treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and have been replaced by the alpha-2-selective agonists. The use of apraclonidine for IOP reduction in glaucoma or OHT is limited due to a high rate of follicular conjunctivitis. The alpha-2-selective agonist in use today is brimonidine. The brimonidine-purite formulations are preferred to brimonidine-benzalkonium chloride (BAC) formulations due better tolerability while maintaining similar efficacy. Brimonidine is also effective when used in combination with a beta-blocker. Using brimonidine-timolol fixed combination (BTFC) as first-line therapy has an added potential for neuroprotection. This would be a valuable strategy for glaucoma treatment, for patients who are intolerant of prostaglandin analogs, or for patients where prostaglandin analogues are contraindicated as first-line therapy, such as in patients with inflammatory glaucoma.

### Epidemiology and treatment of patients with primary open angle glaucoma in Germany: a health claims data analysis [^116WjjbX]. Journal of Glaucoma (2024). Medium credibility.

Consistent with a recent analysis based on administrative health databases from Italy, we found that the majority of patients with prevalent POAG are multimorbid. Moreover, we observed a higher prevalence among patients with POAG for other diseases compared with the age- and sex-matched control sample. Among others, we observed a higher prevalence of arterial hypertension, disorders of lipoprotein metabolism and other lipidemias, and diabetes in patients with POAG, all of which are associated with an increased risk of developing higher intraocular pressure and glaucoma. – The high occurrence of these comorbidities is also reflected in the observed frequencies of concomitant drug dispensations. For example, several medications used to treat hypertension (beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors) were among the most commonly observed dispensed concomitant medications. It is known that the coexistence of multiple diseases in individuals can complicate the management of affected patients and is associated with increased HCRU including a greater medication use. Management of multimorbid patients requires special caution as some medications may be contraindicated with certain comorbid conditions or concomitant medications. Moreover, some medications have been associated with an increased prevalence of glaucoma (eg, corticosteroids and beta-blockers). Thus, our results highlight the importance of comprehensive patient care in this patient population.

3.2.1.1 Setting the Target IOP

There is little evidence base to support any particular algorithm to set the Target IOP, but data from clinical trials may be used as a guide. As clinical trials have shown that progression occurs in eyes that have an IOP within the statistically normal range (< 21 mmHg), older recommendations that treated IOP should be simply within the statistically normal range are no longer regarded as sufficiently ambitious.

In newly diagnosed patients, the Target IOP is initially determined according to stage of disease and the starting IOP, with the treatment goal being a specific IOP level or a percentage reduction, whichever is the lower[II, D]. For instance, in early glaucoma, an IOP of < 21 mmHg with a reduction of at least 20% may be sufficient. In moderate glaucoma, an IOP < 18 mmHg with a reduction of at least 30% may be required [II, D]. Lower Target pressures may be needed in more advanced disease [I, D]. The Target IOP based on stage of disease and IOP then needs to be refined according to the presence of other risk factors, expected longevity of the patient, the burden of therapy and the patient preferences (See FC X)[II, D].

3.2.1.2 Achieving the Target IOP

Initial therapy may be with topical medication or laser trabeculoplasty [I, A]. The principles of adjusting therapy to achieve treatment targets are shown in Flow Charts IX - X - XI. To minimize side effects, the least amount of medication required to achieve the desired therapeutic response should be given. If a patient fails to attain the Target IOP during follow-up, and additional therapy is being considered, then the Target IOP should be reaffirmed to ensure that it is still appropriate [II, D].

Theme 2: prescribing medications to patients with a visual impairment

In response to a query regarding the factors considered when prescribing medications to patients living with a VI, some physicians indicated that no specific distinction is made for this patient population. The criteria considered are therefore general and include allergies, potential side effects, contraindications, drug interactions, the benefit/risk ratio, life expectancy, STOPP/START criteria (specific to geriatrics) and response to treatment. Conversely, other physicians discussed the consideration of factors more specific to individuals with a VI, including their disability, lifestyle, frailty, manual dexterity, and the presence of ocular pathologies (eg, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy).

No, I don't think I make any difference in prescribing medication for the visually impaired compared to other patients, insofar as, the ones I have in mind are patients who had treatment before and we continue the treatments as they were before their sight problem. IPhy7 (19 years' experience)

Visual impairment is not homogeneous, it's something that gives you several different contraindications depending on the pathology found in the eye. IPhy12 (38 years' experience)

The physicians addressed elements related to the medication itself. In particular, three principal factors were identified with respect to the selection of medications for patients with a VI.

First, the physicians proposed adaptations to the treatment plan with the objective of simplifying the process of taking the medications as much as possible. In certain cases, they attempt to minimise the number of pharmaceutical agents consumed by patients with polypharmacy. This is achieved by prioritising combinations of molecules or eliminating medications that are deemed superfluous. Other physicians favour treatments that only require administration once a day, to minimise the risk of errors associated with each dose. They also ensure consistency of treatment, prescribing the same specialty or generic medication consistently, to avoid confusion for patients, who often identify their medications by the colour or shape of the packaging. Furthermore, they avoid prescribing medications with similar names, to prevent any risk of confusion.

### Reducing the risk of withdrawal symptoms and relapse following clozapine discontinuation-is It feasible to develop evidence-based guidelines? [^115WF31k]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

Strategies to Reduce the Risk of Cholinergic Discontinuation Symptoms

Clozapine-induced cholinergic rebound has not been widely studied, with evidence limited to case reports and case series. For example, it is unclear whether the risk of cholinergic discontinuation symptoms is related to the duration of clozapine treatment. A small case series suggests that patients treated with medication that has anticholinergic properties, such as tricyclic antidepressants and Parkinson's disease medications, at the time of clozapine discontinuation may be less susceptible to cholinergic rebound.

There is minimal evidence regarding the optimal regimen for stopping clozapine to avoid cholinergic rebound. Although the current advice is that clozapine should be tapered off over at least 1−2 weeks, there have been cases of cholinergic rebound occurring when patients have been stopped on clozapine flowing this regime; therefore, a more gradual tapering regimen should be considered. Furthermore, lower doses of clozapine do not appear to prevent the onset of cholinergic rebound. Whilst hyperbolic tapering has been advocated to prevent withdrawal symptoms in other psychiatric medications, it is unclear whether this reduces the risk of clozapine-induced cholinergic rebound. Similarly, the clinical usefulness of prophylactic anticholinergic medication remains unknown. Clozapine has a greater affinity to muscarinic receptors than other antipsychotics with anticholinergic properties, such as olanzapine and quetiapine. This may explain why switching from clozapine to these antipsychotics does not appear to prevent cholinergic discontinuation symptoms.

Strategies to Treat Cholinergic Discontinuation Symptoms

If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary, the current literature suggests anticholinergic medication may prevent, or reduce the severity of cholinergic rebound. Case reports have found an association between trihexyphenidyl, benztropine, and biperideninitiation and an improvement in clozapine-induced cholinergic rebound symptoms. However, the optimal drug, dose, and duration remains unknown. When considering anticholinergic medication, it is also important to consider clinical factors such as cholinergic load, addiction vulnerability, and contraindications, such as glaucoma.

Retrospective evidence suggests that re-initiation of clozapine is effective in treating cholinergic rebound. In one case series, re-introducing clozapine at relatively low doses (25–50 mg daily) was sufficient to improve symptoms. However, in the absence of studies incorporating a comparison group, it is difficult to evaluate treatment strategies. Furthermore, clozapine re-initiation may not always be feasible (table 3).

### Glaucoma and dry eye disease: opportunity to assess and treat [^112PnXk5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to modifications to antiglaucoma medications, treatment for DED should be considered to restore the homeostasis of the ocular surface. A variety of treatments are available for DED, the choice of which depends on the severity and subtype of DED. Topical treatments for DED that may be considered for either evaporative or aqueous-deficient DED include ocular lubricants and topical anti-inflammatory treatments. Ocular lubricants come in a variety of formulations, some of which have lipids to supplement the lipid layer of the tear film, and some of which are preservative-free. Topical anti-inflammatory treatments include corticosteroids (for short-term treatment, as long-term use is associated with numerous complications), cyclosporine A, and lifitegrast. For patients with evaporative DED related to meibomian gland dysfunction, topical or oral antibiotics may be considered as well as procedures such as therapeutic meibomian gland expression, thermal pulsation, intraductal probing, and intense pulsed light. Notably, risks of dermatologic side effects with intense pulsed light may be greater for darker skin types. A recently approved perfluorohexyloctane ophthalmic solution (Miebo TM) has shown promise for the treatment of DED associated with meibomian gland dysfunction, and although it is not contraindicated for glaucoma patients, its safety and efficacy have yet to be evaluated in patients concomitantly administering IOP-lowering drugs. Therapies to promote tear retention or tear production for aqueous-deficient DED include punctal plugs and varenicline solution nasal spray, respectively. Several treatments for DED have been associated with improvements in OSDI and/or ocular surface signs for patients receiving antiglaucoma medications, including certain ocular lubricants, topical immunomodulatory treatments, and punctal plugs. For patients who do not respond to a given treatment, additional or alternative treatments may be considered. Because patients with glaucoma typically already have a medication burden, patient education on the importance of DED medications for addressing symptoms may help improve compliance with DED medications. Table 2 provides a summary of assessment and treatment considerations for addressing DED in patients with glaucoma.

### Minimally invasive surgery in mild-to-moderate glaucoma patients in Italy: is It time to change? [^116ySumR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Place in Therapy Considerations for Emerging Glaucoma Treatments in Italy

We tried to schematize our suggested place in therapy of current and emerging glaucoma treatments using the chart showed in Figure 3. Within this concept, identification of the optimal therapy by disease stage is based on the triangulation of: i) likelihood of the treatment to modify ocular surface (thus influencing the choice of future treatments); ii) efficacy of the treatment, intended as the potential to reduce IOP, iii) optimized use of medical therapy, intended as potential to reduce high-doses and/or frequency of combination therapy (≥ 2 drugs to control IOP).

Suggested place in therapy° of glaucoma treatments in Italy. -no place in therapy; ○ place in therapy for selected patient subgroups; ● clear place in therapy. °Place in therapy to be adapted according to available economic resources of the INHS and financial affordability. * Often achieved with combination of medical therapies. Given its better level of safety, second-generation trabecular micro-bypass stent has been differentiated from the other MIGS. MIGS, Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery.

In summary, we believe that a more individualized approach should be adopted when selecting the optimal therapy for early-stage patients while filtering surgery should remain the preferred option in patients with advanced and severe glaucoma, and in selected patients with early-onset and rapidly evolving glaucomatous damage, despite treatment with medical therapy and less-invasive options.

Within this algorithm, the role of medical therapy would be significantly revised. Pharmacological treatment would be still an option in the early stages of the disease, but only in those situations where IOP control can be achieved with low-dose monotherapy and other situations where other-than medical treatment is contraindicated or is not practically feasible.

In other words, our suggested approach is to flexibly switch to SLT or MIGS options as early as possible, when there is a clear perception that pharmacological treatment will hardly be effective.

### Fixed-combination brinzolamide 1% / brimonidine 0.2% vs monotherapy with brinzolamide or brimonidine in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension: results of a pooled analysis of two phase 3 studies [^112ygnnu]. Eye (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pharmacological therapy is the most common first-line approach for patients with glaucoma requiring intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. More than one medication is necessary in many cases, with one study reporting that a 20% reduction in IOP to ≤ 24 mm Hg required two medications in 30% of patients and ≥ 3 medications in an additional 9%. Patients requiring two medications can either concomitantly administer two separate medications or use a single fixed-combination medication. Fixed-combination therapy may be preferred due to reduced exposure to ocular preservatives, avoidance of the potential for washout of the first medication by administration of the second, and increased patient convenience resulting from having only one bottle of medication, which could increase the likelihood of adherence to glaucoma therapy and potentially lower cost from fewer copays.

Brinzolamide 1%/brimonidine 0.2% (BBFC) is an investigational fixed-combination therapy that contains a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and an alpha agonist. All currently available fixed-combination therapies contain the beta blocker timolol. Although beta blockers are among the most commonly used ocular antihypertensive medications, they are contraindicated for patients with certain respiratory or cardiac conditions. Thus, BBFC will provide a non-beta blocker-containing fixed-combination alternative to current fixed-combination therapies for these patients.

Two phase 3 studies (C-10-033 and C-10-039) were recently conducted that assessed the efficacy and safety of BBFC using a nearly identical, randomized, 3-month, contribution-of-elements design. The only difference between the two trials was that the C-10-039 study collected additional safety information during a 3-month safety extension. The aim of the current analysis was to more robustly describe the efficacy and safety of BBFC by pooling the data from these two studies.

### Glycopyrrolate orally disintegrating tablets (Dartisla odt) [^1155pBcD]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Precipitation of Acute Glaucoma

Glycopyrrolate may cause increased intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma and reduce the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Instruct patients to discontinue DARTISLA ODT and promptly seek medical care if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (pain and reddening of the eyes accompanied by dilated pupils) [see Contraindications (4)]

5.2 Partial or Complete Mechanical Intestinal Obstruction

DARTISLA ODT may worsen intestinal mechanical obstruction, and diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. If partial or complete intestinal obstruction is suspected, discontinue use of DARTISLA ODT and evaluate for potential intestinal obstruction [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Due to Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility

Glycopyrrolate reduces gastrointestinal motility and may result in delayed gastric emptying, constipation, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction and may precipitate or aggravate paralytic ileus and toxic megacolon [see Contraindications (4)]. The risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions is further increased with use of other anticholinergics and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis. Monitor patients for symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Concomitant use of DARTISLA ODT and other anticholinergics or other medications that decrease GI peristalsis is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.4 Cognitive and Visual Adverse Reactions

Glycopyrrolate may produce drowsiness and blurred vision and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or performing other hazardous work [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Concomitant use of other drugs that have anticholinergic properties may increase these effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or perform other hazardous tasks until they are reasonably certain that DARTISLA ODT does not affect them adversely. Discontinue DARTISLA ODT if signs or symptoms of cognitive or visual impairment develop.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^113JRVgv]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect — management planning and initial medical therapy are outlined. The goal of treatment is to monitor or lower IOP through treatment if an eye is likely to progress to POAG; monitor for structural changes in optic disc and retina; and monitor for functional changes of the optic nerve assessing the visual field. The decision to treat a glaucoma suspect patient may arise in various settings, and target IOP is an estimate and must be individualized and/or adjusted during the course of the disease. Medical therapy is presently the most common initial intervention to lower IOP; clinicians should consider balance between side effects and effectiveness in choosing a regimen of maximal effectiveness and tolerance to achieve the desired IOP reduction for each patient, and if a medical therapy fails to reduce IOP sufficiently, then either switching to an alternative medication as monotherapy or adding additional medication is appropriate until the desired IOP level is attained.

3.2.1.3 Re-evaluating Target IOP

If the visual field is worsening at a rate that may threaten Quality of Life during the patient's expected lifetime, then the Target IOP, if previously met, should be lowered; a further 20% reduction has been shown to be effective. If the Target IOP had not previously been met, then additional therapy should be considered, in consultation with the patient, weighing the risks and benefits of the additional intervention (See FC XI) [I, D].

If there are sufficient visual fields to judge the rate of progression, and this rate is sufficiently slow not to impact on the patient's quality of life, then the Target IOP may be revised upward if the Target IOP has not been met or if the patient is on excessive therapy or is experiencing side effects [II, D].

If there are insufficient visual fields to judge the rate of progression and the Target IOP has not been met, then additional therapy should be considered, as above [II, D].

3.3 - Antiglaucoma Drugs

Several prospective randomized multi-centre controlled clinical studies have clearly established the benefits of IOP reduction in managing POAG at various stages of the disease whether of the 'high pressure' or "normal pressure' variety as well as reducing the conversion of OHT to POAG,[I, A].

Most forms of open-angle glaucoma and many types of chronic angle-closure glaucoma are initially treated with topical and occasionally orally administrated agents that act either on the reduction of aqueous humour production or enhancement of the aqueous outflow or on both. An uncommon exception to initiating treatment with medical therapy is for eyes with a very high level of IOP at presentation causing an immediate threat to sight. Additionally many forms of childhood glaucoma are managed with early surgery [I, D].

Although acute angle closure with or without glaucoma needs rapid laser or incisional surgery, medical treatment usually will be initiated as a first step in most cases.

Laser treatment may be a suitable first option for patients with known intolerance or allergy to topical agents or suspected poor compliance [I, A].

When initially selecting medical therapy it is important to consider some relevant patient's characteristics as well as features related to the drug (See FC XII and XIII).

### Systemic medication and intraocular pressure in a British population: the EPIC-Norfolk eye study [^113hVsDi]. Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Systemic nitrate medication is a common and established treatment for chronic stable coronary artery disease. The effect of systemic nitrate use on IOP is not well-documented, and the evidence in the literature is dated and conflicting. In the first half of the 20th century, nitrate medication was considered to be contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, in part as a result of early studies demonstrating an increase of IOP after inhalation of amyl nitrate. Evidence contrary to the belief that nitrates raised IOP emerged in 1964, when a study of 34 individuals demonstrated no increase in IOP and often a transient decrease in IOP after sublingual glyceryl triturate or oral pentaerythritol tetranitrate. In a later study, it was reported that oral administration of 40 mg isosorbide dinitrate twice daily resulted in a reduction of IOP lasting for 6 hours in normal individuals and in patients with open- or closed-angle glaucoma. However, in a more recent masked, randomized, crossover trial of a single oral dose of isosorbide mononitrate in 10 healthy volunteers, no significant change in IOP was observed in comparison with placebo. Our study is the first to report the association between nitrate medication use and IOP at a population level, and to demonstrate that the effect is statistically independent of changes in BP or heart rate. We found participants taking nitrate medication to have around 1 mmHg lower IOP than those not taking the medication, reducing to around a 0.7-mmHg difference after taking oral β-blocker use into account. Again, this magnitude of IOP-lowering is relatively large on a population level, translating to a 10% decreased risk of incident glaucoma, or 200 fewer people aged > 55 years developing definite or probable open-angle glaucoma per year in the UK, based on the assumptions we have detailed herein. The confidence intervals were wider for the nitrate effect estimate compared with the β-blocker effect estimate, likely owing to the fewer number of participants using nitrates.

Methods

This was a Phase IV, randomized, multicenter, investigator-masked study, registered with(NCT01243567) and the EU Clinical Trials Register (2009-012799-28). Patients were eligible for inclusion if they fulfilled all of the following criteria: i) aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 85 years (male or female); ii) diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma (POAG or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma), with baseline IOP ≥ 27 mmHg and ≤ 34 mmHg in one or both eyes; iii) no previous ocular hypotensive medications; iv) at least one of the following risk factors for rapid progression: pseudoexfoliation, family history of glaucoma, pigment dispersion, optic disc hemorrhage, visual field mean deviation worse than −6 dB, IOP ≥ 27 mmHg in both eyes; v) best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of Snellen equivalent 20/60 or better in each eye. To be included, patients also needed to give informed consent to participate in the study, and to have two reliable visual field tests: one performed within 6 months prior to baseline (day 0) visit and another at baseline prior to randomization.

Patients were excluded from participation if they had any of: i) a history of refractive surgery; ii) intraocular surgery within 3 months prior to baseline; iii) a visual field defect requiring medical intervention; iv) any contraindication to β-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy; v) any other known allergy or sensitivity to the study medications or their components; vi) any ocular inflammation or infection within 3 months prior to baseline, apart from mild blepharitis, or any history of uveitis; vii) any corneal abnormalities in either eye that would preclude accurate IOP readings with an applanation tonometer; viii) an ocular trauma in either eye within 6 months prior to baseline; ix) a requirement for chronic use during the study of ocular medications other than the study medications, in either eye; x) intermittent use of oral, injectable, or topical ophthalmic steroids within 21 days prior to baseline, or anticipated use during the study; xi) any other condition or situation that might put the subject at significant risk, confound the study results, or significantly impede participation. Female patients who were pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy, or who were of childbearing potential and not using a reliable means of contraception, were also excluded.

### Glaucoma therapy: preservative-free for all? [^113LvGW6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Preservatives used in topical glaucoma medications have a plethora of well-described toxic effects on the ocular surface. Such ocular toxicity is manifest clinically as ocular surface disease (OSD) and has been confirmed in epidemiologic, prospective clinical trials and studies in which patients are switched from preservative-added to preservative-free topical therapy. Such toxicity has implications not only for tolerability, but also for adherence and persistence with therapy that is known to be poor in glaucoma. Glaucoma medication is now widely available in preservative-free formulations, and the question arises as to which patients should receive preservative-free glaucoma therapy in preference to preservative-added medication. A case can be made for several subpopulations of patients who might particularly benefit from preservative-free medication: patients with existing OSD, older patients, younger adult patients, female patients, pediatric and juvenile patients, patients who work in air-conditioned environments or who use electronic screens frequently, patients with medical risk factors for OSD, patients in whom trabecular surgery may become indicated in the future, contact lens users, perhaps patients with Asian ethnicity and patients with severe or treatment-refractory glaucoma. Whilst arguments could be made for selecting patients for preservative-free medication on the basis of their existing risk of OSD, collectively, these patients form a significant proportion of the glaucoma patient population as a whole and, in the absence of any cost premium or positive indication for preservative-added medication, preservative-free glaucoma medication for all patients seems an appropriate strategy.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^113LCnC4]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU guideline — antimuscarinic precautions in idiopathic overactive bladder states that clinicians should use antimuscarinic medications with extreme caution in patients with OAB who have narrow-angle glaucoma, impaired gastric emptying, or a history of urinary retention (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should prescribe these medications with extreme caution in narrow angle glaucoma in consultation with a treating ophthalmologist, and the drugs can affect cholinergic receptors on the ciliary muscle and sphincter pupillae, potentially causing increases in intraocular pressures. Because muscarinic receptors are present throughout the gastrointestinal tract, clinicians also should use caution in patients with conditions that affect gastric emptying, and antimuscarinic medications are relatively contraindicated in those taking oral potassium supplementation due to reduced gastric motility causing prolonged potassium retention with intestinal irritation and ulceration. Additional considerations include diabetes, prior abdominal surgery, narcotic use, scleroderma, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other conditions that may impact gastric emptying; a thorough medication review should identify agents that may delay gastric emptying, including GLP-1 receptor agents and its analogs. Consultation with a gastroenterologist may be helpful, and if a patient has a history of urinary retention or is at risk for retention, a PVR should be obtained with careful weighing of risks and benefits regarding potential worsening of bladder emptying.

### Open angle glaucoma treatment preferences of glaucoma specialists in the United States [^113zRzJA]. Journal of Glaucoma (2025). Medium credibility.

Prcis

This cross-sectional survey study evaluated the current treatment preferences of US glaucoma specialists for open-angle glaucoma, finding that most preferred selective laser trabeculoplasty over topical medications for treatment-naïve patients with ocular hypertension and open-angle glaucoma.

Purpose

To describe US glaucoma specialists' preferences regarding the use of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) versus topical glaucoma medications for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma.

Methods

Actively practicing glaucoma specialists from the American Glaucoma Society were invited to participate in a survey assessing treatment preferences and influencing factors. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to determine predictors of preference for SLT.

Results

Of 136 eligible respondents, 65–71% preferred SLT for treatment-naïve patients with ocular hypertension, mild-to-moderate primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, or pigmentary glaucoma. For mild-to-moderate POAG on one medication, 75% of respondents favored SLT. For advanced POAG on maximum medical therapy, 57% of respondents favored surgery and 38% preferred SLT. Respondents indicated that reducing medication non-adherence (93%), suitable glaucoma type or stage (88%), and experience performing SLT (83%) were key facilitators in recommending SLT to their patients. In contrast, patients' inability to position for the procedure (78%), unsuitable glaucoma type or stage (67%), and comorbidities or contraindications to SLT (55%) were primary reasons to not recommend SLT. Physicians in private practice, those who completed fellowship training more recently, and those who see more treatment-naïve glaucoma patients were significantly more likely to prefer SLT over medication.

Conclusion

The majority of US glaucoma specialists report a preference for SLT over medication for open-angle glaucoma treatment, demonstrating that acceptance of SLT has increased over the past several years, especially for treatment-naïve patients. Statistically significant predictors of SLT preference were practice setting, practice duration, and patient volume.

### Maximum medical therapy: brinzolamide / brimonidine and travoprost / timolol fixed-dose combinations in glaucoma and ocular hypertension [^113GAUVs]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Maximal medical therapy (MMT) is the use of 3 or more different classes of anti-glaucoma agents to achieve a maximal lowering of IOP.MMT attempts to achieve the best possible therapeutic outcome with medications while minimizing adverse effects and compliance challenges to the patients. Availability of FDCs helps to achieve MMT with different classes of medications but with a simplified instillation regimen.–Thus, MMT can serve as a convenient medical treatment option for patients requiring additional lowering of IOP.

Travoprost 40 μg/mL (0.004%)/timolol 5 mg/mL (0.5%) FDC (TTFC; DuoTrav ®, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) is approved as a once daily regimen for the decrease of IOP in patients with OAG or OHT who are insufficiently responsive to topical ß-blockers or PGAs. The efficacy and safety of TTFC in patients diagnosed with OAG or OHT has been previously established in well-controlled clinical studies.–Brinzolamide 10 mg (1%)/mL/brimonidine 2 mg/mL (0.2%) FDC (BBFC; Simbrinza ®, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) is approved in the EU as a twice-daily regimen for decreasing IOP in patients with OAG or OHT for whom monotherapy is insufficient. Use of BBFC has been effective as a twice- daily regimen in lowering IOP in patients with OAG or OHT inadequately controlled with PGA monotherapy.

A combination therapy with BBFC+TTFC can provide clinicians with the option of managing glaucoma with all 4 classes of medications (PGAs, ß-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and α-agonists) in patients with OAG or OHT who are not contraindicated against the use of ß-blockers and in whom the IOP-lowering is inadequate with TTFC alone. This combination offers clinicians a simplified solution with 2 bottles of eye drops and instillation of 3 drops per day. This is the first study investigating the additive IOP-lowering effect achieved when BBFC, dosed twice daily, is used adjunctively with once-daily TTFC in patients with OAG or OHT inadequately controlled with TTFC.

### Treating patients presenting with advanced glaucoma – should we reconsider current practice? [^111CpumM]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

The management of patients presenting with advanced glaucoma presents a challenge to glaucoma clinicians. Presentation with advanced visual field loss is an important risk factor for progression to blindness in the affected eye(s) during the patients' lifetime. Maximising intraocular pressure (IOP) control in such situations is likely to minimise the risk of further visual field deterioration thus either preventing or slowing progression to blindness. Currently most patients presenting with advanced disease in the UK are managed on an escalating regime of medical treatment. Should this fail glaucoma surgery is usually employed to further lower IOP. Although glaucoma surgery is generally a safe and successful intervention it carries a small risk of severe visual loss and is considered by many clinicians as an intervention only to be used following failure of medical treatment. Recently however the National Institute for Clinical Excellence has suggested in its clinical guidelines for management of ocular hypertension and glaucoma that primary surgery should be offered to patients presenting with advanced glaucomatous visual field loss. This is contrary to the practice of most UK ophthalmologists. In this review the current available evidence underlying the management of presentation with advanced disease is examined.

### The pathophysiology and treatment of glaucoma: a review [^1174dhL6]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Glaucoma is a worldwide leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Because it may be asymptomatic until a relatively late stage, diagnosis is frequently delayed. A general understanding of the disease pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment may assist primary care physicians in referring high-risk patients for comprehensive ophthalmologic examination and in more actively participating in the care of patients affected by this condition.

Objective

To describe current evidence regarding the pathophysiology and treatment of open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma.

Evidence Review

A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and manuscript references for studies published in English between January 2000 and September 2013 on the topics open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma. From the 4334 abstracts screened, 210 articles were selected that contained information on pathophysiology and treatment with relevance to primary care physicians.

Findings

The glaucomas are a group of progressive optic neuropathies characterized by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and resulting changes in the optic nerve head. Loss of ganglion cells is related to the level of intraocular pressure, but other factors may also play a role. Reduction of intraocular pressure is the only proven method to treat the disease. Although treatment is usually initiated with ocular hypotensive drops, laser trabeculoplasty and surgery may also be used to slow disease progression.

Conclusions and Relevance

Primary care physicians can play an important role in the diagnosis of glaucoma by referring patients with positive family history or with suspicious optic nerve head findings for complete ophthalmologic examination. They can improve treatment outcomes by reinforcing the importance of medication adherence and persistence and by recognizing adverse reactions from glaucoma medications and surgeries.

There is no evidence that nasolacrimal duct obstruction may increase the efficacy of a topical drughowever it may reduce systemic side effects particularly from beta-blockers by minimizing the drainage into the highly vascularised nasopharyngeal mucosa,[I, D].

Patients should be advised to shake the bottle before use as micro-suspensions tend to settle to the bottom of the bottle leaving the vehicle at the surface. Thus, patients may be simply applying mainly vehicle to the eye, rather than the active drug ingredient [I, D].

GENERAL RECOMMANDATIONS [L, D]:

Monotherapy is the first choice when initiating therapy
Baseline IOP should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of a therapy Fixed Combination therapy should be considered when patients fail to achieve their individualized intraocular pressure (IOP) targets with monotherapy
The prescription of more than two bottles of IOP lowering eye drops for simultaneous use should be avoided as it can lead to noncompliance
Fixed combination preparations may be preferable to the use of separate instillation of two agents
However Fixed Combination are not first-line medications and they are only indicated in patients who need adjunctive therapy, when IOP is not sufficiently controlled by one single agent
Ocular surface should be evaluated and considered in clinical management of glaucoma patients. In case of ocular surface disease, preservative-free formulations should be considered
Generic drops can differ from brand drops and it may be necessary to monitor patients more closely after switching
During pregnancy, the potential risks of continuing anti-glaucoma medications to the fetus (and neonate) must be balanced against the risk of vision loss in the mother

### Managing adverse effects of glaucoma medications [^115A22LC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of vision loss worldwide after cataracts. In industrialized countries, cataract surgeries are conducted promptly and cataract-related vision loss is rare. In Japan, glaucoma is the primary cause of visual acuity loss, while in the United States, age-related macular degeneration is the primary cause of visual acuity loss. In Japan, glaucoma occurs in 5% of people 40 years or older and increases in prevalence with age. Therefore, the number of patients with glaucoma is expected to increase in the future as the Japanese population ages.

Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive disease in which retinal ganglion cells degenerate, and subsequent, gradual reductions in the visual field ensues. The ultimate objective of glaucoma treatments is to preserve the remaining visual field (ie, to stop visual field defect progression). Intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction is the only proven treatment to prevent visual field defect progression. Eye drops, oral medications, laser therapy, and surgery have all been used to decrease IOP in glaucoma patients. Among these therapies, topical treatments are the first choice because they have the highest efficacy and the lowest incidence of adverse reactions. When using eye drop therapies, it is important that IOP reductions last for 24 hours and are preserved in the long-term.–Different therapies have different IOP-lowering capabilities and associated adverse reactions. In some cases, multi-drug regimens are administered with no adverse reactions. Other times, glaucoma mono-therapies induce them. Therefore, evaluation of adverse reactions can be difficult.

Eye drop characteristics

In patients using β-blockers, the incidence of corneal epithelium disorders differs with different medications. By switching from one β-blocker to the other, it is often possible to improve adverse reactions and maintain IOP control.

In patients using prostaglandin analogs, the incidence and severity of conjunctival hyperemia differs among the different medications. In a meta-analysis, conjunctival hyperemia incidence with latanoprost use was low. Therefore, physicians may want to consider prescribing latanoprost first or switching patients with conjunctival hyperemia to latanoprost. The incidence of DUES also differs among use of the different prostaglandin analogs. Bimatoprost was highly associated with DUES and when bimatoprost patients with DUES switched to latanoprost, the condition improved or resolved in 85% of patients. Tafluprost can also be considered. For patients who only use a prostaglandin analog in one eye, eyelid pigment changes and/or DUES can be particularly bothersome. These conditions in only one eye cause an asymmetrical facial appearance, and for that reason, administration in only one eye should be avoided.

Ocular medication contraindications in certain diseases

The use of β-blockers is contraindicated in patients with asthma, bronchospasms, chronic obstructive lung disease, heart failure, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and cardiogenic shock. Respiratory function asymptomatically decreases in patients with undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly in the elderly. Consequently, for elderly patients, it is safer to prescribe other types of anti-glaucoma eye drops that are associated with fewer systemic adverse reactions. Serious nephropathy is a contraindication of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. In cases where it is difficult to determine whether or not a particular type of eye drop is safe to use, the patient's general physician should be consulted.

Patient education on eye drop instillation

Systemic adverse reactions occur because of systemic exposure to a topical ocular medication. Therefore, it is possible to decrease systemic adverse events by minimizing the amount of drug that gets into the bloodstream. Instructing the patient to close their eyes and to gently press on the lacrimal duct for 5 minutes after drop instillation is recommended. It has been reported that timolol maleate blood levels decreased by 65% and 67% when the eyelid was closed for 5 minutes and when the lacrimal passage was pressed, respectively.

PRECAUTIONS

Information for Patients

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with doxepin and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for doxepin. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking doxepin.

Patients should be advised that taking doxepin hydrochloride capsules can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle-closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy.

Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle-closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible.

3.4.1 Terminology

The commonly used term "compliance" has been increasingly replaced in recent times by the term "adherence". Both are defined as the 'cooperation of the patient with the recommendations given by the doctor'. However, the former is more passive ("I am taking the medication"), while the latter implies the active part of the patient in the process ("I am taking the medication exactly as you told me").

"Persistence" is defined as the length of time during which the patient is taking the medication as prescribed.

Finally three terms should be mentioned:

– "White coat compliance" means that the patient's adherence rises a week before the consultation and drops quickly afterwards
– "Dyscompliance" is used when physical problems of a patient, like arthritis, lead to difficulties in correctly applying a therapy
– "Alliance" is a special form of adherence meaning that the people around the patient ensure the correct application of the medication

3.4.2 Measured Adherence

Despite easier medication schemes (for example drugs which require application once- daily) and more information for the patients about the disease, the rate of non-adherence has remained almost the same over the last 25 years; between 30%-70%.

It is important to mention that the patients themselves overestimate their adherence and persistence rate (GAPS).

3.4.3 Factors Associated with Non-Adherence

Four groups of factors encountered as common obstacles to glaucoma medication adherence have been described:

Situational / environmental (for example a major event in the patients life, unsteady life-style with many travels)
Medication (for example costs of the drugs, side effects, complicated dosing regimen)
Patients (for example comorbidity, poor understanding of the disease)
Provider (for example lacking communication with the doctor)

Other influencing factors:

– Gender (men are more likely to be non adherent)
– Stage of the disease (patients with a less advanced disease tend to be less adherent)

3.4.4 Types of Non-Adherence

Every patient is different and there are several types of non-adherence.

– Failure to take the medication as prescribed (including under- and overdosing, inadequate doses and wrong timing of dosages)
– Failure to use the correct medication (including the application of the wrong medication or the self administration of not prescribed drugs)
– Failure to apply the medication correctly (including incorrect self administration of the medication)
– Failure to continue applying the medication (including problems with side-effects, issue of costs and missed refills)

### Alternatives to topical glaucoma medication for glaucoma management [^116nupRz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

With chronic exposure to BAK in glaucoma medications, 30–70% of patients will develop signs and symptoms of ocular surface disease over time, which increases the risk of nonadherenceand decreases quality of life. Furthermore, chronic exposure to topical glaucoma medication increases the risk of failure of future glaucoma surgeries. And lastly, although systemic side effects of topical medications are uncommon, they can be very serious.

In addition to side effects and nonadherence, topical medical therapy is limited by the inherent difficulty of penetrating the corneal surface, the eye's natural barrier, to deliver medication in a consistent 24/7 manner. This difficulty may contribute to the fact that although all glaucoma medications have proven IOP-lowering efficacy, they are still not a sure-fire way to eliminate the risk of glaucoma progression. In clinical trials, 25–27% of patients receiving topical medical therapy experienced disease progression over 6–8 years despite protocols that mandated the addition of adjunctive medications if target IOP was not achieved. The landmark population-based study from Olmsted County, MN, showed that despite being prescribed glaucoma medications, there was a 13.5% unilateral and 4.3% bilateral blindness rate in patients over the course of 20 years, with average time to blindness of 5.8 years. In such studies, the fact that glaucoma progressed despite topical medical therapy underscores some of the fundamental limitations observed with topical agents: for example, the self-reinforcing negative cycle (discussed previously) that transpires from nonadherence, medication side effects, elevated IOP, dosage escalation, and invasive interventions; and the IOP fluctuations (peaks and troughs) of topical medications, which increase risk of glaucoma progression. Regarding this latter point about IOP fluctuation, it is not surprising that studies have consistently shown less IOP variability and lower disease progression with procedural rather than topical medication-based treatments.

3.4.5 Improving Adherence

There are different ways for improving the adherence of patients. The most important measures are informing the patient about his/her disease and finding a therapeutic regimen which fits into the patient's life-style[I, D].

Other factors which should improve adherence [I, D]:

– The therapy should be simple i.e. not more than two bottles and an application not more than twice a day
– The patient should be instructed how to apply the drops correctly. If necessary, hints reminders should be given like a daily routine which the patient can connect to the application of the drops. If a patient has physical problems applying the drops as arthritis of the fingers, the therapy should be adjusted accordingly or switched to laser/surgery
– The doctor should inquire at every visit if the patient has side effects of the medication and switch if necessary. A patient who complains about side effects is usually not adherent to therapy.

The patient's cooperation, described as adherence and persistence, with the prescribed glaucoma management is mandatory to obtain effective IOP lowering and to prevent glaucoma progression. No drug can work unless it is taken.

3.5 - Laser Surgery

3.5.1 Laser Iridotomy >

Indications: [I, C]

Clinically relevant or suspected pupillary block.

Potential prevention of acute and chronic angle closure (See FC X and XI).

Preoperative preparation:

To reduce iris thickness and facilitate perforation instil 1 drop of Pilocarpine 2%-4% [I, D]. If the cornea is edematous, like acute angle closure, use topical glycerin 10% if available, systemic acetazolamide, intravenous mannitol or oral hyperosmotic agents (See FC XI). For prevention of IOP spikes use topical alpha 2 agonist 1 hour prior to the procedure and immediately afterwards [I, B].

Procedure:

After instillation of topical anesthetic a contact lens with contact lens fluid is placed onto the cornea. The lens keeps the eyelids open, stabilizes the eye, provides additional magnification, focuses the laser beam and acts as a heat sink.
