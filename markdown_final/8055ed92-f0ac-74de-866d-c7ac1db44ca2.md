## Question

Sunscreen for oily skin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about choosing and using sunscreen for oily skin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core skin-care goals for oily, acne-prone skin. Then, I should verify which sunscreen filters and vehicles are most compatible with oily skin. Next, I will review formulation features that reduce shine and comedogenicity. After that, I need to check application technique and reapplication realities that preserve protection despite oil breakthrough. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like makeup layering, skin of color, and acne treatments, and close with a concise, practical recommendation summary anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical priorities for oily skin: minimize excess sebum and shine, avoid pore-clogging ingredients, and maintain broad-spectrum UV protection without triggering acne or irritation. I should also remember that many patients with oily skin are acne-prone, so non-comedogenic, lightweight textures matter for adherence and outcomes [^116wx7zR] [^115AyWUX].

> Wait, let me verify the filter choices before jumping to vehicles. Mineral filters (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) are generally less irritating and less likely to cause allergic or photoallergic reactions, which is helpful for sensitive, oily skin; however, classic mineral formulations can feel thick or leave a white cast, so micronized or tinted versions are preferable in practice [^111SRk7d] [^1174YPjs]. Chemical filters like avobenzone, octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene can be formulated in lightweight, non-greasy vehicles and are often well tolerated, but I need to ensure the product is labeled non-comedogenic and oil-free to reduce acne risk [^111SRk7d].

> I will now examine vehicle and texture, because this is where adherence hinges for oily skin. Lightweight liquids, gels, serums, and alcohol-based sprays tend to be favored for their fast absorption and matte finish; a split-face trial showed an alcohol-based spray was rated less greasy and more acceptable, supporting real-world usability for oily skin types [^112ZeANW]. Hold on, I should verify that alcohol content does not imply irritation by default; formulation context matters, and many modern gel-lotions balance alcohol with humectants to maintain barrier comfort while keeping oiliness down.

> Next, I should review key product features that specifically address oily-skin concerns. Non-comedogenic and oil-free labeling are essential to reduce acne flares; matte or semi-matte finishes help control shine; water-based or gel vehicles enhance spreadability and comfort; and water resistance is important when sweating, though I need to remind users that "water-resistant" does not mean "waterproof" and reapplication is still needed after towel drying or heavy perspiration [^116VJn8N] [^116omrT9]. Let me double-check that these features align with dermatologic guidance for acne patients; yes, water- or light liquid–based sunscreens are emphasized for young, oily, acne-prone skin to improve tolerability and use [^116wx7zR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about application amount and reapplication. Real-world use is often suboptimal, with typical application around 0.5–1.2 mg/cm² versus the 2 mg/cm² used in testing, which can drop actual SPF substantially; higher-labeled SPF can partially compensate for underapplication, but I should still counsel on generous, even coverage and timely reapplication [^114Ebn3v] [^116pkojr]. I should confirm reapplication guidance: every 2 hours during sun exposure, and after swimming, sweating, or towel drying; some modeling suggests earlier reapplication around 15–30 minutes after initial exposure may further reduce cumulative UV dose, but I need to frame that as optional rather than replacing the 2-hour rule [^117Jr54S] [^116omrT9].

> Let me consider layering with makeup and other topicals. For oily skin, a lightweight, fast-absorbing sunscreen under makeup improves compliance; mineral powders with SPF can help with midday touch-ups and oil control, though they do not replace the need for a base sunscreen layer. I should confirm that layering does not compromise protection; when done thoughtfully, it can enhance usability without sacrificing photoprotection [^114mktzr].

> I need to ensure I address skin of color considerations. Darker skin tones often face white cast and ashy tones with mineral sunscreens; tinted mineral formulations or chemical-mineral hybrids with sheer finishes improve acceptability, and recent data show high cosmetic acceptability for a tinted SPF 35 moisturizer across Fitzpatrick IV–VI without visible residue, which supports recommending tinted or well-blending options for melanin-rich oily skin [^112RRsBv] [^1174YPjs].

> But wait, what if the patient is using acne treatments that increase photosensitivity. With retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or alpha hydroxy acids, strict photoprotection is essential to prevent irritation and hyperpigmentation; I should reinforce daily broad-spectrum sunscreen as part of the regimen and remind patients that some acne systems explicitly require concurrent sunscreen use during and after treatment to avoid rebound darkening or irritation [^1165exiW].

> I should double-check safety and absorption concerns, because patients often ask. Systemic absorption of certain chemical filters has been demonstrated under maximal-use conditions, but the FDA and expert reviews emphasize that these findings do not negate the benefits of sunscreen and call for more research; for oily, acne-prone skin, if concern persists, mineral-only formulations provide effective protection with minimal absorption and are a reasonable alternative [^113cj5tW] [^111Kubqd].

> Let me synthesize a practical, evidence-aligned recommendation. For oily skin, choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30–50, prioritize non-comedogenic, oil-free, and matte or semi-matte finishes, and prefer lightweight vehicles such as gels, serums, or alcohol-containing sprays if tolerated; mineral or hybrid formulations with micronized zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, or chemical filters in water-based gels, are good options. Apply generously to the face and other exposed areas 15 minutes before sun exposure, reapply every 2 hours and after sweating or towel drying, and consider tinted mineral powders for midday oil control and touch-ups. If using acne treatments, maintain consistent sunscreen use to mitigate photosensitivity and dyspigmentation risks [^116VJn8N] [^116omrT9] [^116wx7zR] [^112RRsBv].

---

For oily skin, use **oil-free, non-comedogenic, broad-spectrum sunscreens** with SPF 30–50 and a lightweight, gel or fluid texture to avoid clogged pores and excess shine [^116VJn8N] [^116wx7zR]. Mineral sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are preferred for their low irritation and matte finish; if using chemical filters, choose water-based, lightweight formulas labeled non-comedogenic [^111SRk7d] [^116wx7zR]. Apply **2 mg/cm²** (about a nickel-sized amount for the face) 15 minutes before sun exposure, and reapply every 2 hours or after sweating/swimming [^115PbPhc] [^116omrT9]. These choices balance protection, oil control, and acne prevention [^115AyWUX].

## Recommended sunscreen formulations for oily skin

Key characteristics to look for include **oil-free, non-comedogenic, lightweight, and broad-spectrum protection** [^116VJn8N] [^116wx7zR].

| **Attribute** | **Recommended features** |
|-|-|
| Texture | - Lightweight <br/> - Gel-based <br/> - Fluid <br/> - Non-greasy [^116wx7zR] |
| Formulation | - Oil-free <br/> - Non-comedogenic <br/> - Water-based [^116wx7zR] |
| SPF | - SPF 30–50 <br/> - Broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) [^116VJn8N] [^116omrT9] |
| Ingredients | - Mineral filters (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) <br/> - Or chemical filters with low irritation potential (e.g. avobenzone, octisalate, octinoxate) [^111SRk7d] [^112fSQ58] |

---

## Mineral vs. chemical sunscreens

Mineral sunscreens (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) are **less likely to irritate** or clog pores and often have a matte finish, making them ideal for oily, acne-prone skin [^notfound]. Chemical sunscreens can be suitable if they are oil-free and non-comedogenic; however, some chemical filters may irritate sensitive skin, so patch testing is advisable [^114BqXrh].

---

## Application techniques and tips

Proper application ensures **effective protection** and minimizes oiliness:

- **Amount**: Apply approximately 2 mg/cm² (about a nickel-sized amount for the face) [^11368RA1].
- **Timing**: Apply 15 minutes before sun exposure [^11368RA1].
- **Reapplication**: Reapply every 2 hours, or after swimming, sweating, or towel drying [^116omrT9].
- **Layering**: Allow the sunscreen to absorb before applying makeup or other skincare products.

---

## Potential drawbacks and considerations

- **White cast**: Mineral sunscreens may leave a white cast, especially on darker skin tones. Tinted formulations can help mitigate this issue [^112RRsBv].
- **Irritation**: Some chemical sunscreens may cause irritation or allergic reactions. Patch testing is recommended for sensitive skin [^114BqXrh].
- **Cost**: Higher-quality formulations may be more expensive, but effectiveness and skin compatibility are crucial for long-term use [^111bhzuc].

---

## Clinical evidence and expert recommendations

Clinical studies and expert consensus support the use of **broad-spectrum sunscreens** with SPF 30–50 for effective photoprotection, including oily skin [^116VJn8N]. Regular sunscreen use prevents photoaging, hyperpigmentation, and skin cancer without significantly impacting vitamin D synthesis [^117Bu76q] [^115xnr1L].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **SPF**: Use broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30–50 [^116VJn8N].
- **Formulation**: Choose oil-free, non-comedogenic, lightweight gels or fluids [^116wx7zR].
- **Filters**: Prefer mineral filters (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) or low-irritancy chemical filters [^111SRk7d].
- **Application**: Apply generously 15 minutes before exposure; reapply every 2 hours or after swimming/sweating [^11368RA1] [^116omrT9].
- **Considerations**: Test for irritation, especially with chemical filters; consider tinted formulations to avoid white cast [^114BqXrh] [^112RRsBv].

---

Sunscreens for oily skin should be **oil-free, non-comedogenic, and lightweight**, with SPF 30–50 and broad-spectrum protection. Mineral sunscreens are often preferred for their matte finish and low irritation, while proper application and reapplication are essential for effective protection [^116VJn8N] [^116wx7zR].

### Cleansing and moisturizing in acne patients [^116wx7zR]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Affecting over 80% of adolescents, acne is a widespread condition with substantial negative physical and emotional effects, and significant societal cost. Cleansing the acne patient involves several considerations, including matching skin type to the right type of cleanser, optimal times and methods of cleansing, treating parts of the body other than the face, and patient perceptions of the cause and treatment of acne. Moisturizing prevents and alleviates skin irritation, soothing the skin by slowing the evaporation of water. Many liquid face cleansers also moisturize, which may be all that is needed for a patient with oily skin. Protection from sun and environmental damage is important for all patients. While sunscreens are often irritants, the best options for young, oily, acne-prone skin tend to have a water or light liquid base. Moisturizing sunscreens are appropriate for patients with dry, sun-damaged skin, as well as those who wear makeup, have other skin diseases, or are easily irritated by products. Overall, treating acne patients should include education in patient-friendly terms and promoting healthy daily skin care practices, including cleansing and protection against environmental damage.

### Photo visualization of skintone compatibility of an SPF 35 sunscreen [^112RRsBv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Visual casts and discoloration are common barriers to sunscreen use in melanin-rich populations. However, photoprotective measures are essential for individuals with all skin types, including darker skin.

Methods

Single-center, 7-day, open-label study of healthy adult females with Fitzpatrick Skin Types (FST) IV to VI and sensitive skin treated with once-daily daily facial moisturizer sun protection factor 35 (DFM SPF35). Subjects completed a cosmetic acceptability questionnaire at days 1 and 7. Photography using VISIA&nbsp; CR was performed at day 7. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study.

Results

Thirty-two (32) subjects participated; 31.3% had FST IV, 53.1% V, and 15.6% VI skin. DFM SPF35 was viewed as cosmetically elegant. At day 1, 96.7% of subjects agreed product was easy to apply; 90.0% reported soft skin after product use; 86.7% said it had a lightweight, non-greasy feel and hydrated the skin. At day 7, 93.7% reported no visible white residue on their skin and said the product applied easily/absorbed well. The majority (90.6%) would continue using and would recommend the product; and 87.5% reported the product blended seamlessly into their skin, which agreed with clinical photography. Responses were consistent among subjects with normal, oily, or combination skin. No adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

DFM SPF35 blended well into the skin and was perceived favorably among subjects with SOC after 1 and 7 days of use. Subjects felt it had good cosmetic acceptability without unacceptable white residues or a greasy feeling. Dermatologists need to be versed in products that can be used on a variety of skin types.J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(7):515–518.&nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.8223.

### Sunscreens: mechanisms and safety in depth [^111Kubqd]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sunscreens play an essential role in preventing skin cancer and photoaging. Nevertheless, concerns about their systemic absorption and environmental impacts persist. In this extensive literature review, we discuss the mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety concerns related to sunscreen use, aiming to clarify current understandings and dispel prevalent myths. Despite ongoing debates regarding certain ingredients, the scientific consensus supports the use of sunscreens as a critical defense against ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Continued research is necessary to address safety concerns and to refine sunscreen formulations for optimal protection and minimal adverse effects.

### Cost analysis of sunscreens targeted towards skin of color [^112Rp6A3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Skin cancer most commonly affects fair-skinned individuals1; however, it can appear in individuals of all skin tones. Photoprotective behaviors such as applying sunscreen should be practiced by all individuals regardless of skin tone. Herein, the authors discuss the cost and protection of popular sunscreens targeted towards patients with darker skin or skin of color (SOC), and suggest important considerations providers should take into account when advising about sunscreen recommendations for patients with skin of color.

### Sunscreen product formulation [^116zXMKG]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

On the surface, sunscreen products are pretty simple. They consist of a delivery vehicle containing one or more sunscreen active ingredients. When applied to the skin, these sunscreen actives intercept solar ultraviolet (UV) rays before they can damage the underlying skin. However, while conceptually simple, a detailed analysis reveals that sunscreen formulations are quite complex, requiring careful selection of sunscreen active and vehicle components to control multiple performance and in-use parameters. Thus, to enable a better understanding and appreciation of sunscreen products, the typical steps in formulating a sunscreen product are described. Throughout this process, the key is to apply scientific principles together with a bit of formulation art to holistically create the best sunscreen product that meets the design targets — a sunscreen product that people will use regularly and properly.

### Do sunscreens have a role in preventing skin cancer? [^113qyCrh]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2011). Low credibility.

Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is largely responsible for the harmful effects of sun exposure, notably sunburn, photosensitivity and skin cancer. UV radiation is, for example, implicated in malignant melanoma (the most serious form of skin cancer), the incidence of which has risen in the UK over the last 30 years. Such risks make it crucial to know whether measures aimed at reducing sun damage offer worthwhile benefit. Here we assess whether the sunscreen products commonly used to prevent sunburn have a place in the prevention of skin cancer.

### Skin nonpenetrating sunscreens for cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations [^111LB4nS]. Clinics in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation produces harmful effects on the skin including sunburn, local immunosuppression, skin photoaging, and cutaneous malignancies. Although application of sunscreens is the "gold standard" for protecting the skin from UV radiation, studies have shown that currently used sunscreens can cause adverse skin and systemic reactions, owing to their penetration into the viable cutaneous strata and to transdermal absorption. This paper presents new nonpermeating sunscreens (NPSUN) suitable for use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. The basic idea behind the design of the new photoprotectors was to immobilize UV-absorbing moieties in the Jojoba oil chemical backbone. The physicochemical characteristics of NPSUNs allow these derivatives to remain confined to the upper stratum corneum where the sunscreen molecule acts, with no further clearance to deeper dermal strata or systemic circulation. As an example, no permeation across the skin of methoxycinnamate-NPSUN was observed during 24-hour in vitro experiments, after topical application of either unformulated substances or of methoxycinnamate-NPSUNs formulated in oil-in-water cream, in water-in-oil cream, or in Jojoba oil. Another approach to increase the photoprotective effect against the UV radiation is targeting the delivery of alpha tocopherol into the deeper skin layers and across the cell membranes. This is necessary for optimal photoprotection and prevention of malignant processes. For this purpose, ethosomal vitamin E compositions were designed, characterized, and tested. Efficient intracellular and dermal accumulation of vitamin E from ethosomes was demonstrated. A good clinical strategy could be the use of NPSUNs during direct UV exposure followed by the application of alpha-tocopherol compositions after short- or long-term solar radiation.

### Sunscreen practices and preferences of skin of color patients [^113Tu8H8]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sunscreen is an essential way to protect against photodamage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Despite the recognized benefits of sunscreen in preventing skin damage from UV light, its use varies across different patient groups. This cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study aims to uncover the sunscreen usage patterns, preferences, and barriers among non-Hispanic White (NHW) and skin of color (SOC) individuals. Our findings demonstrate that NHW individuals are more likely to wear sunscreen daily (31% NHW vs 25% SOC) and reapply sunscreen at least once a day (76% NHW vs 45% SOC) compared with SOC individuals. SOC individuals demonstrate a willingness to use sunscreen, but they face barriers such as cost (2% NHW vs 16% SOC), lack of knowledge in finding suitable products (22% NHW vs 41% SOC), and concerns about white cast (7% NHW vs 25% SOC). SOC individuals are less likely to know the difference between mineral and chemical sunscreen (49% NHW vs 29% SOC), less likely to learn about sunscreen from dermatologists (36% NHW vs 22% SOC), and more likely to prefer sunscreen from brands owned by people of color (13% NHW vs 47% SOC).&nbsp; In addition to analyzing the broader categories of NHW and SOC, subgroup analysis was conducted on specific subgroups, including Black, Asian, and Hispanic groups. Herein, we highlight differences in motivations, sunscreen preferences, sources of information, and knowledge levels about sun protection between NHW and SOC individuals. By uncovering the unique needs and challenges faced by SOC individuals, we aim to improve culturally competent patient education and promote effective sun protection practices across diverse populations.

### Photoprotection for people with skin of colour: needs and strategies [^1174YPjs]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Skin of colour or pigmented skin has unique characteristics: it has a higher eumelanin-to-pheomelanin ratio, more mature melanosomes, an increased amount of melanin distributed in the upper layers of the epidermis, and more efficient DNA repair compared with lighter skin. However, individuals with skin of colour are at a significant risk of skin damage caused by ultraviolet radiation, including the development of photodermatoses and photoageing changes such as uneven skin tone, and are predisposed to pigmentary disorders. In fact, one of the most common conditions leading to dermatology consultations by patients with skin of colour is photoexacerbated pigmentary disorders. Unfortunately, individuals with skin of colour may be less prone to engage in photoprotective measures, including the use of sunscreens. Physicians are also less likely to prescribe sunscreens for them. There is thus a clear need for better education on photodamage and for more efficient and suitable photoprotection in populations with skin of colour. However, this need has thus far only partially been met, and the development of sunscreen products designed to provide optimal photoprotection for people with skin of colour remains a challenge. Targeted sunscreens for individuals with skin of colour require optimal cosmetic appeal (leaving no white residue and not disrupting skin tone). They should include broad-spectrum [ultraviolet (UV)B/UVA] protection with high sun protection factor, as well as protection against long-wave UVA (UVA1) and visible light, as these wavelengths are capable of inducing or augmenting pigmentary disorders. They may also contain depigmenting agents for patients with pigmentary disorders.

### Skincare ingredients recommended by cosmetic dermatologists: a Delphi consensus study [^116xZe2M]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is ambiguity regarding the topical cosmetic ingredients preferred for common skin complaints.

Objective

To determine which topical ingredients are frequently recommended by cosmetic dermatologists for fine lines and wrinkles, acne, redness, dark spots, large pores, dry skin, and oily skin.

Methods

Literature review to develop long list of ingredients. Reduced by expert panel to most salient ingredients. Two rounds of Delphi consensus survey with second expert panel of clinicians and teachers. Comparative literature review to summarize published evidence supporting each consensus ingredient.

Results

List of 318 ingredients reduced by a panel of 17 dermatologists to 83. Two Delphi rounds completed by 62 dermatologists at 43 centers. Consensus achieved for 23 ingredients, including the following: azelaic acid (acne, dark spots); benzoyl peroxide (acne, oily skin); glycolic acid (acne, dark spots); mineral sunscreen (fine lines and wrinkles, redness); niacinamide (redness, dark spots); retinoids (fine lines and wrinkles, acne, dark spots, large pores, oily skin); salicylic acid (acne, oily skin); vitamin C (fine lines and wrinkles, dark spots). Most consensus ingredients supported by level 1b or 2b evidence.

Limitations

Some ingredients based on expert opinion.

Conclusion

Consensus exists among expert cosmetic dermatologists regarding ingredients most useful for common dermatologic concerns.

### Sunscreens: obtaining adequate photoprotection [^114DXZEU]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Adequate photoprotection plays a paramount role in reducing the burden of both photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. The scope of photoprotective strategies employed by the public, from most to least effective, includes: sun avoidance, seeking shade, the use of protective clothing, and the application of sunscreen. Among these options, sunscreen use remains the strategy most frequently employed by the public — a reversal of the preferred order of photoprotection. Given this trend, it is clear why sunscreens invariably take center stage in any discussion regarding obtaining adequate photoprotection.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^111SRk7d]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Sunscreens for children — because no UV filter is approved for children < 6 months of age, infants should have very limited direct sun exposure, especially at midday, and can be protected with shade, clothing, and covered strollers or similar shelters rather than sunscreen; children > 6 months of age can be protected by applying commercial sunscreens that contain only physical (mineral) UV filters (titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, or both), which are less likely to irritate sensitive skin. Teens may prefer oil‑free face sunscreens to avoid acne flares, and adults can safely use sunscreens marketed for children.

### Sunscreen photoprotection and vitamin D status [^1153z4Qq]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, effective sunscreens must attenuate UVB to prevent erythema. In theory, this should inhibit vitamin D 3 biosynthesis. However, the doses of UVB necessary are low (i.e. substantially suberythemal) so that typical sunscreen use does not lead to vitamin D insufficiency in practice in healthy people. Indeed, even optimal sunscreen use allows good vitamin D synthesis under high UVI conditions. Better UVA protection for a given SPF results in a de facto reduction of UVB protection. UVA protection will have no impact on vitamin D synthesis (see Fig. 3 b), and indeed may prevent photodegradation. Increased UVB for a given SPF should in theory and in practice result in better vitamin D synthesis. Studies done to date have been with lighter‐skinned individuals, and conclusions may not apply to those with darker skin types IV–VI who use sunscreens. In such cases, oral supplementation may be advisable.

### Sunscreens: misconceptions and misinformation [^111MsPUg]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the past 70 years, sunscreens have evolved from beach products designed to prevent sunburn to more cosmetically elegant skincare products intended to protect against multiple long-term adverse consequences of characteristically low-intensity daily UV and visible light exposure. Sunscreen testing and labeling intended to quantify such protection are unfortunately often misunderstood by users and have also led to illegal misleading and potentially dangerous industry practices. Changes in regulatory requirements, better policing, and more informative sunscreen labeling would benefit users and their physician advisors.

### Nutritional skin care: health effects of micronutrients and fatty acids [^113LmhQ7]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Human skin is continuously exposed to internal and external influences that may alter its condition and functioning. As a consequence, the skin may undergo alterations leading to photoaging, inflammation, immune dysfunction, imbalanced epidermal homeostasis, or other skin disorders. Modern nutritional science is developing new insights into the relation between food intake and health, and effects of food ingredients may prove to be biologically relevant for optimal skin condition. The objective of this review was to evaluate the present knowledge about the interrelation of nutrients and skin, particularly the photoprotective effects of nutrients, the influences of nutrients on cutaneous immune responses, and therapeutic actions of nutrients in skin disorders. The nutrients of focus were vitamins, carotenoids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Supplementation with these nutrients was shown to provide protection against ultraviolet light, although the sun-protection factor was relatively small compared with that of topical sunscreens. An increase in delayed-type hypersensitivity skin responses after supplementation with nutrients has proven beneficial, especially in elderly people, and may boost cell-mediated immunity. Dietary consumption of certain plants or fish oil is known to modulate the balance of lipid inflammatory mediators and, therefore, is valuable in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders. It was concluded that nutritional factors exert promising actions on the skin, but information on the effects of low-to-moderate doses of nutrients consumed long term by healthy individuals is obviously lacking, as are data on direct effects on basal skin properties, including hydration, sebum production, and elasticity.

### When should sunscreen be reapplied? [^117Jr54S]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

A common recommendation by many public health agencies is to reapply sunscreen every 2 to 3 hours. Is this recommendation effective in minimizing ultraviolet exposure of the skin during time in the sun?

Objective

The purpose of this article is to determine how the time of sunscreen reapplication affects the solar ultraviolet exposure of the skin.

Methods

A mathematical model was derived that took into account typical amounts of sunscreen application and sunscreen substantivity to determine how these factors, when combined with the time of sunscreen reapplication, influence the photoprotection provided by sunscreen during exposure for several hours around mid day in strong sunshine.

Results

Using a sunscreen that is readily removed from the skin achieves little in the way of sun protection, no matter when it is reapplied. For sunscreens that bind moderately or well to skin, typical of modern waterproof or water-resistant products, the lowest skin exposure results from early reapplication into the sun exposure period, and not at 2 to 3 hours, after initial application. Typically reapplication of sunscreen at 20 minutes results in 60% to 85% of the ultraviolet exposure that would be received if sunscreen were reapplied at 2 hours.

Conclusions

Advice given to sunscreen users should be to apply sunscreen liberally to exposed sites 15 to 30 minutes before going out into the sun, followed by reapplication of sunscreen to exposed sites 15 to 30 minutes after sun exposure begins. Further reapplication is necessary after vigorous activity that could remove sunscreen, such as swimming, toweling, or excessive sweating and rubbing.

### Photoprotection for skin of all color: consensus and clinical guidance from an expert panel [^116bDsYw]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The negative effects of sun exposure have become better accepted among health care professionals and the lay public over recent decades. Most attention has been focused on the effects of UV light, particularly UVB wavelengths (290–320 nm). Accordingly, products to protect skin from sunlight-associated harm (sunscreens) have been developed to minimize UVB exposure. The effects of longer wavelengths, including UVA (320–400 nm) and visible light (VL, 400–700 nm), are increasingly appreciated. VL accounts for approximately half of the solar radiation that reaches the earth's surface and understanding of its effects on the skin is improving. Studies have shown that VL can induce hyperpigmentation in individuals with dark skin types (Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI). In addition, VL can contribute to the exacerbation of pigmentary disorders, including melasma. Because these findings are relatively new, there are gaps in understanding the needs for photoprotection and guidance for clinicians. A panel of dermatologists and photobiologists was convened to develop consensus recommendations and clinical guidance about sunscreen use relevant to the current understanding of risks associated with sun exposure using a modified Delphi method.

### Tips to stay safe in the sun: from sunscreen to sunglasses… [^116omrT9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Sun safety is always in season. It's important to protect your skin from sun damage throughout the year, no matter the weather. Why. Exposing your skin to the sun year-round means you are exposing it to ultraviolet radiation, which can cause sunburn, skin aging, eye damage, and skin cancer, the most common form of cancer in the U. S. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration continues to evaluate sunscreen products to ensure that they are safe and effective. Although all sunscreens help protect people from sunburn, only broad-spectrum sunscreens with a sun protection factor of at least 15 help protect us from skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun. Lower Your Risk for Sunburn, Skin Cancer, and Early Skin Aging Sun damage to the body is caused by invisible ultraviolet radiation. Sunburn is a type of skin damage caused by the sun.

Tanning is also a sign of the skin reacting to potentially damaging UV radiation by producing additional pigmentation that provides it with some, but often not enough, protection against sunburn.
- Using broad-spectrum sunscreens with an SPF value of 15 or higher regularly and as directed. Consult a health care professional before applying sunscreen to infants younger than 6 months. In general, the FDA recommends using broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher, even on cloudy days. In addition:

- Apply sunscreen liberally to all uncovered skin, especially your nose, ears, neck, hands, feet, and lips.
- Reapply at least every two hours. Apply more often if you're swimming or sweating.
- Only products that pass the FDA's broad-spectrum requirements, and therefore protect against UVA exposure, can be labeled "broad spectrum. "
- Sunscreens that are not broad spectrum or are broad spectrum but lack an SPF of at least 15 must carry a warning: "Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, not skin cancer or early skin aging".

### Sunscreens: an update [^116GLtAT]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Sunscreens have been widely used by the general public for their photoprotective properties, including prevention of photocarcinogenesis and photoaging and management of photodermatoses. It is important to emphasize to consumers the necessity of broad-spectrum protection, with coverage of both ultraviolet A (320–400 nm) and ultraviolet B (290–320 nm) radiation. This review discusses the benefits of sunscreen, different ultraviolet filters, sunscreen regulations and controversies, the importance of broad-spectrum protection, issues of photostability and formulation, and patient education and compliance.

### Sunscreens: safety, efficacy and appropriate use [^112fSQ58]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Promoting sunscreen use is an integral part of prevention programmes aimed at reducing ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced skin damage and skin cancers. Protection against both UVB and UVA radiation is advocated. Most sunscreens combine chemical UV absorbing sunscreens and physical inorganic sunscreens, which reflect UV, to provide broad-spectrum protection. Newer triazole and camphor-derivative based sunscreens, also provide broad-spectrum protection and are more cosmetically acceptable than many traditional agents. Currently licensed sunscreen ingredients in common use rarely cause allergic or photoallergic reactions. Vitamin D levels are not significantly affected by regular use of a sunscreen. Sunscreen use reduces both the development of precancerous solar keratosis and the recurrence of squamous cell carcinomas. Sunscreen use early in life may be important in prevention of basal cell carcinomas. Increased melanoma risk is influenced by the behaviour patterns of regular sunscreen users, as opposed to any direct effect of sunscreens. Sun protection factor (SPF) is affected by application density, water resistance and other factors. An adequate SPF for an individual should be balanced to skin phenotype and exposure habits. The correct use of sunscreens should be combined with the avoidance of midday sun and the wearing of protective clothing and glasses, as part of an overall sun protection regimen.

### Assessment and clinical implications of absorption of sunscreens across skin [^1123zBRi]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Topical sunscreen products are widely used for protection of the skin against the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Sunscreen agents are incorporated into many everyday-use cosmetics as well as so called 'beach' products. An ideal sunscreen product will provide effective protection against UV radiation with minimal skin absorption of the active ingredients. There is now clear evidence that a common sunscreen chemical, benzophenone-3, is absorbed systemically following topical application to the skin. Other more lipophilic sunscreens are absorbed into the skin, but penetration to deeper tissues and the cutaneous circulation appears to be limited. However, the extent to which sunscreens that are absorbed into the stratum corneum are absorbed to deeper tissues and the systemic circulation over time is currently unknown. The formulation vehicle in which the sunscreen is presented to the skin has a significant effect on absorption into and through the skin. Alcohol-based formulations appear to increase sunscreen absorption. In addition, some sunscreen chemicals may enhance the skin absorption of other sunscreens when applied in combination. Clearly, further research into the influence of sunscreen and formulation properties on skin absorption could lead to optimal design of sunscreen products with respect to efficacy and minimizing absorption. Despite the extensive use of sunscreen products, there have been few reports of adverse effects, and these tend to be limited to acute dermatitis and allergies. Some recent reports have raised concerns that sunscreen chemicals may damage tissues, particularly in the presence of UV radiation. Further research into the toxicity of sunscreens is urgently required. Given the information currently available and the importance of protecting the skin against sun damage, there is no clear justification for restricting the use of sunscreen products at this time.

### The effect of sunscreen on melanoma risk [^112oycrc]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The usage of sunscreens has grown dramatically worldwide over the past decade. Current data suggest that a regimen of sun protection that includes protective clothing, avoiding midday sun, and regular use of broad-spectrum high SPF sunscreen (such as practiced in Australia [19]) seems to be reducing melanoma incidence rates. This is the current recommendation of the American Academy of Dermatology and it is also the recommendation that is best supported by existing data. Except for total sun avoidance, sunscreens remain the best individual method of protection from UV-induced damage to the skin. It is hoped there will be even more definitive answers to questions related to the effectiveness of sunscreens for reducing melanoma risk as better sunscreen components are developed and as evaluations are performed in the future that overcome the problems better in existing studies.

### Patient preferences for facial sunscreens: a split-face, randomized, blinded trial [^112ZeANW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Sunscreen use is a widely accepted method of primary prevention against skin cancer, sunburn, and photoaging. However, many people do not routinely apply sunscreen because they find application objectionable.

Objective

To determine which types of sunscreen subjects are willing to use on more than one occasion.

Methods

A split-face, randomized, blinded trial of commercially available sunscreens was performed among 139 community members in Rochester, Minnesota.

Results

Subjects were significantly more likely to indicate that they would use alcohol-based spray sunscreen again than two of the seven sunscreens assessed (P < .05). This sunscreen was endorsed as being less greasy, less likely to leave a film, and less likely to leave them feeling hot and sweaty than at least two of the other sunscreens.

Limitations

Only a representative selection of commonly available sunscreens was tested.

Conclusion

An alcohol-based spray formulation of sunscreen was rated more favorable. Recommendations to use alcohol-based spray sunscreens may increase patient compliance.

### IOC consensus statement on recommendations and regulations for sport events in the heat [^113k2xjo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Officials and athletes with low metabolic heat production should wear light-coloured, loose-fitting, sun-protective clothing.
Athletes with a higher metabolic heat production should wear clothing that does not impair direct sweat evaporation from the skin.

Sunscreen

Using sunscreen is one of the main preventive strategies to protect the skin from UVR. Sunscreen application recommendations are to apply ~2 mg per cm 2 of protection to exposed skin, indicating that adult athletes may need ~15–20 mL of sunscreen per application. It has been recommended that athletes use water-based sunscreen (ie, non-greasy) over oil-based sunscreen that may affect sweating. However, there are large differences in the sweating response to different water-based sunscreens. Sunscreen can work as a chemical sun filter or as a physical sunblock. Chemical sunscreen absorbs into the skin and then absorbs UV rays, converts the rays into heat before releasing from the body. The active ingredients in chemical sunscreens include avobenzone, octinoxate and oxybenzone. Physical sunblock sits on top of the skin and reflects the sun's rays. The minerals titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are the main active ingredients in physical blocks. When comparing an organic chemical sun filter (oxybenzone) and an inorganic physical sunblock (titanium dioxide), both water-based with an SPF 50, Aburto-Corona reported that the latter may impair sweating. While the study design was different from real-world utilisation, athletes should be encouraged to use sunscreen when necessary given the importance of sunscreen in preventing skin cancer. Future studies are needed to identify the specific ingredients in sunscreens that interfere with sweating and their interactions with the thermoregulatory response.

Recommendation

Based on the limited studies in athletes but the well-known health risk associated with UV exposure, athletes are advised to protect the exposed part of their body using sunscreen of SPF ≥ 25 using a water-based organic chemical sun filter.

### Public health challenges in sun protection [^1171DmvB]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

Sunscreens are a popular choice for protection from ultraviolet radiation, and hence, important components in the public health campaign to reduce the burden of skin cancer. Public health messages in skin cancer prevention have been used effectively in educational campaigns. The benefits of sunscreen extend beyond skin cancer prevention into other aspects of health and disease prevention: sunscreen decreases the risk for sunburn during physical activity outdoors and seems not to increase the risk for osteoporosis. Public health efforts have laid a solid foundation on which to face the continuing challenge of promoting and developing effective public health campaigns and health policies that encourage sunscreen use, sun protection, and the primary prevention of skin cancer. In this article, the controversies, concerns, and challenges of sunscreen use as it relates to public health are discussed.

### Novel emerging sunscreen technologies [^111Y4wCQ]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

Because of increases in the number of skin cancers diagnosed annually, adverse effects of ultraviolet (UV) rays are being recognized, and major public education programs have been undertaken concerning photoprotection, including the use of sunscreen. In daily life, UV exposure is unavoidable; therefore sunscreen should be used regularly. Development in sunscreen manufacturing has grown tremendously in the last decade. Sunscreen active ingredients now are incorporated into cosmetics products to minimize photoaging changes. With the advances in technologies, many new UV filters have been developed recently. These have improved efficacy and safety. This article reviews these new filters, along with regulatory issues in the United States.

### The latest on skin photoprotection [^1144B9th]. Clinics in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

UV radiation is the main etiological agent of most types of skin cancer and a key factor responsible for photoaging. Photoprotection is thus critical to avoid these undesired effects. Sunscreens rank among the best photoprotective measures. Sunscreens are the main components of lotions and creams used to prevent UV-induced damage or to ameliorate its harmful effects. There are 3 types of sunscreens: physical photon blockers, antioxidants, and stimulators of repairing mechanisms. This review summarizes current topics in the development of sunscreens, with special emphasis on substances of natural origin bearing photoscreening, antioxidant, or repairing properties. The characterization of different parameters to evaluate the effects of sunscreens, such as the sunscreen protection factor, is discussed. Finally, the effect of public awareness and public health campaigns are also reviewed.

### Sunscreen allergy and its investigation [^114BqXrh]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Allergic reactions to sunscreens are relatively rare. However, as the public become more conscious of the dangers of excessive sunlight exposure, the use of sunscreens is increasing. They are also being incorporated into general cosmetics on a more frequent basis. Sunscreens contain a variety of potential sensitizers which may lead to contact and/or photocontact allergic dermatitis, and as pharmaceutical companies continue to manufacture and incorporate new UV filters it is crucial that we remain up to date and aware of these agents to include in patch and photopatch testing batteries. Furthermore, the creation of a European consensus statement regarding methodology in photopatch testing has enabled greater standardization and comparison of patch test results across centers.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^11368Nim]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Applying sunscreen — Sunscreen guidelines recommend using sunscreens that provide broad-spectrum protection from both UVA and UVB. The average adult needs 1 fluid ounce (equivalent to 2 US tablespoons or 1 shot glass full) with each application. For optimal effectiveness, sunscreens that contain chemical UV filters should be applied 15 minutes before going outside, whereas sunscreens that have only physical UV filters do not require a 15-minute delay. Sunscreen should be reapplied to all exposed areas every 2–4 hours. In general, lotion- or cream-based sunscreens can be applied in the most reliable manner, while stick or roll-on sunscreens are easy to apply but are often applied unevenly; people who use stick or roll-on sunscreens should gently spread the product after application. Spray sunscreens are not highly recommended, and Consumer Reports (2020) recommends that one should hold the spray nozzle 1 inch from the skin; spray until the skin glistens.

### Sunscreens and photoaging: a review of current literature [^112iJfAW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Sunscreens have been on the market for many decades as a means of protection against ultraviolet-induced erythema. Over the years, evidence has also shown their efficacy in the prevention of photoaging, dyspigmentation, DNA damage, and photocarcinogenesis. In the USA, most broad-spectrum sunscreens provide protection against ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and short-wavelength ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation. Evidence suggests that visible light and infrared light may play a role in photoaging and should be considered when choosing a sunscreen. Currently, there is a paucity of US FDA-approved filters that provide protection against long UVA (> 370 nm) and none against visible light. Additionally, various sunscreen additives such as antioxidants and photolyases have also been reported to protect against and possibly reverse signs of photoaging. This literature review evaluates the utility of sunscreen in protecting against photoaging and further explores the requirements for an ideal sunscreen.

### An overview of ultraviolet radiation, sunscreens, and photo-induced dermatoses [^112wJbEH]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

The incidence of sunlight-induced skin aging and skin cancers, particularly melanoma skin cancer, has been increasing in many parts of the world. Authorities are recommending primary prevention programs to reduce cutaneous photodamage and skin carcinogenesis. An integral component of these programs is the use of protective clothing and effective sunscreens. Most modern sunscreens have highly efficient absorption or reflecting capabilities throughout ultraviolet B, partly ultraviolet A, and in some instances infrared wavelengths. Over the last several years, more efficient sunscreening ingredients have been developed for improved skin protection. More recently, direct evidence has demonstrated the effectiveness of sunscreens in their ability to reduce the incidence of solar keratoses. This article reviews the protectiveness of sunscreens and assays that predict their levels of protection.

### What's new in photoprotection: a review of new concepts and controversies [^1144xqNt]. Dermatologic Clinics (2019). Medium credibility.

Cumulative ultraviolet exposure plays a critical role in photodamage. Recent advancements in photomedicine have resulted in a more thorough understanding of these mechanisms. Despite this, the adoption of routine sun protective practices is commonly not undertaken regularly by a large proportion of the public. Various obstacles exist that contribute to the public's nonadherence to these practices. Sunscreens, which are an integral component in all photoprotective regimens, have been questioned recently in terms of their safety. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of new concepts in photoprotection and also address current controversies pertaining to sunscreens.

### Realistic sunscreen durability: a randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical study [^114bF6Si]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Studies show that sunscreen under real-life conditions is often not reapplied and/or applied insufficiently. This study investigated the durability of 2 current sunscreens with different SPF protection over an 8-hour period under simulated real-life conditions.

Methods

Participants (n = 24) were randomized into two study groups utilizing either 2 mg/cm2 (FDA testing concentration) or 1 mg/cm2 (real-life application levels) of sunscreen. Two current SPF 15 and 70 sunscreens were applied to test spots on each participant's back. SPF values were obtained at baseline, 3.5, and 8 hours after initial application, during which subjects completed 30 minutes of moderate exercise followed by 80 minutes of water exposure.

Results

Participants in both dose study groups revealed only a 15–40% overall decrease in their SPF protection 8 hours after application. The study group that received half the FDA test concentration of sunscreen achieved approximately half or less the labeled SPF. At 8 hours, the test sites that received SPF 70 maintained an average SPF greater than 64 (2 mg/cm2 application) and 26 (1 mg/cm2 application). Similarly, the SPF 15 product test sites revealed an in vivo protection of 13 (2 mg/cm2) and 7 (1 mg/cm2).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that current sunscreens may be durable on skin even following significant exercise and water exposure, suggesting that reapplication intervals may be longer than currently recommended. In addition, the higher SPF sunscreen maintained a skin cancer-protective level of SPF following extended use. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(1):116–117. </em>.

### Sunscreen photoprotection and vitamin D status [^115PbPhc]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sunscreens and sun protection indices

Sunscreens are topical formulations that contain chemicals that attenuate solar UVR. 31, 32 Global regulatory authorities have defined the sun protection factor (SPF) of a sunscreen as a universal quantitative index of protection against erythema, assessed after a single exposure of solar‐simulated radiation (SSR; Fig. 3 a). In effect, the SPF is the ratio of SSR dose necessary for a minimal erythema dose (MED) with and without sunscreen application. SPF should be the primary driver of sunscreen choice. These authorities also require UVA protection (see Spectral considerations: Ultraviolet A). A given sunscreen, applied according to prescribed SPF test conditions at 2 mg cm −2, transmits 1⁄SPF of the erythemally effective UVR. One MED is equivalent to about three standard erythema doses (1 SED = 100 J m −2 of erythemally weighted UVR 33) in a fair‐skinned person. 34 Thus, assuming a possible ambient exposure of 30 SED during a sunbathing session, the correct use of SPF 20 sunscreen will allow a suberythemal 1.5 SED to reach the skin. However, people typically apply very much less with a commensurate reduction of actual labelled SPF. For example, a study of Danes on holiday in Egypt reported a mean application thickness of 0.79 mg cm −2. 35 This paradoxically means that sunscreen use may be associated with sunburn as a result of more time in the sun. 36, 37 Additional protection factors have been proposed, such as immune protection factor, DNA protection factor 31 and a protection factor for visible light. 38

### Hydroquinone (OBAGI-C Rx system C-CLARIFYING SERUM NORMAL TO oily) [^116Jx3s7]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

- Hydroquinone is a skin-bleaching agent, which may produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this product.

- Test for skin sensitivity before using by applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin and check within 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication, but where there is itching or vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory response, the product should be discontinued and a physician consulted. Close patient supervision is recommended.

- Avoid contact with eyes, nose, mouth, and lips. In case of accidental contact, the patient should rinse thoroughly with water and contact a physician.

- Sunscreen use is an essential aspect of hydroquinone therapy because even minimal sunlight exposure sustains melanocytic activity.

The Obagi-C ® Rx System C-Therapy Night Cream contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.

### Topical dermocosmetics and acne vulgaris [^115AyWUX]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Acne is a highly common skin disease especially among teenagers. Modern acne treatments are based also on the use of moisturizers, cleansers and sunscreens. In choosing the right cleanser, it is important to consider some aspects: the interaction between skin type and the cleanser, the optimal time and method of cleaning and the cosmetic perception of the patient. The aim of our review is to highlight the importance of choosing the most suitable topical dermocosmetics for the different skin types, as well as the most effective timing and method to combine dermocosmetics with the standard acne treatment. A search in literature for selected key words was performed using PubMed. Additional papers were identified based on author expertise. Treatment of acne patients should include education for proper daily skin hygiene, including protection from environmental damage. However, given the low number of clinical studies on cleansers, it is difficult to make reliable recommendations. The correct choice and use of topical dermocosmetics are fundamental in the management of acne patients. Daily use of moisturizers, cleansers and sunscreens can reduce both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesion counts and may be helpful for acne treatment if combined with specific drugs.

### Sunscreen and prevention of skin aging: a randomized trial [^117Bu76q]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sunscreen use and dietary antioxidants are advocated as preventives of skin aging, but supporting evidence is lacking.

Objective

To determine whether regular use of sunscreen compared with discretionary use or β-carotene supplements compared with placebo retard skin aging, measured by degree of photoaging.

Design

Randomized, controlled, community-based intervention. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12610000086066).

Setting

Nambour, Australia (latitude 26° S).

Patients

903 adults younger than 55 years out of 1621 adults randomly selected from a community register.

Intervention

Random assignment into 4 groups: daily use of broad-spectrum sunscreen and 30 mg of β-carotene, daily use of sunscreen and placebo, discretionary use of sunscreen and 30 mg of β-carotene, and discretionary use of sunscreen and placebo.

Measurements

Change in microtopography between 1992 and 1996 in the sunscreen and β-carotene groups compared with controls, graded by assessors blinded to treatment allocation.

Results

The daily sunscreen group showed no detectable increase in skin aging after 4.5 years. Skin aging from baseline to the end of the trial was 24% less in the daily sunscreen group than in the discretionary sunscreen group (relative odds, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.98]). β-Carotene supplementation had no overall effect on skin aging, although contrasting associations were seen in subgroups with different severity of aging at baseline.

Limitation

Some outcome data were missing, and power to detect moderate treatment effects was modest.

Conclusion

Regular sunscreen use retards skin aging in healthy, middle-aged men and women. No overall effect of β-carotene on skin aging was identified, and further study is required to definitively exclude potential benefit or potential harm.

### Sunscreen photoprotection and vitamin D status [^115xnr1L]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Global concern about vitamin D deficiency has fuelled debates on photoprotection and the importance of solar exposure to meet vitamin D requirements.

Objectives

To review the published evidence to reach a consensus on the influence of photoprotection by sunscreens on vitamin D status, considering other relevant factors.

Methods

An international panel of 13 experts in endocrinology, dermatology, photobiology, epidemiology and biological anthropology reviewed the literature prior to a 1‐day meeting in June 2017, during which the evidence was discussed. Methods of assessment and determining factors of vitamin D status, and public health perspectives were examined and consequences of sun exposure and the effects of photoprotection were assessed.

Results

A serum level of ≥ 50 nmol L −1 25D is a target for all individuals. Broad‐spectrum sunscreens that prevent erythema are unlikely to compromise vitamin D status in healthy populations. Vitamin D screening should be restricted to those at risk of hypovitaminosis, such as patients with photosensitivity disorders, who require rigorous photoprotection. Screening and supplementation are advised for this group.

Conclusions

Sunscreen use for daily and recreational photoprotection does not compromise vitamin D synthesis, even when applied under optimal conditions.

What's already known about this topic?

Knowledge of the relationship between solar exposure behaviour, sunscreen use and vitamin D is important for public health but there is confusion about optimal vitamin D status and the safest way to achieve this.
Practical recommendations on the potential impact of daily and/or recreational sunscreens on vitamin D status are lacking for healthy people.

What does this study add?

Judicious use of daily broad‐spectrum sunscreens with high ultraviolet (UV) A protection will not compromise vitamin D status in healthy people.
However, photoprotection strategies for patients with photosensitivity disorders that include high sun‐protection factor sunscreens with high UVA protection, along with protective clothing and shade‐seeking behaviour are likely to compromise vitamin D status.
Screening for vitamin D status and supplementation are recommended in patients with photosensitivity disorders.

### Understanding and treating various skin types: the baumann skin type indicator [^112BKSRE]. Dermatologic Clinics (2008). Low credibility.

The categories used to describe skin types have changed little over the last century, whereas the skin care product market has undergone rapid innovation and exponential growth. There are four basic dichotomies or parameters that have recently been introduced in the Baumann Skin Type Indicator (BSTI) that more accurately characterize skin types. By evaluating skin according to these parameters — dry or oily, sensitive or resistant, pigmented or nonpigmented, and wrinkled or unwrinkled — and thus differentiating among the 16 permutations of possible skin types, consumers can more easily identify the most suitable topical treatments for their skin. This article describes the four parameters that make up the BSTI, focusing on basic science and defining characteristics and summarizing the 16 skin-type variations.

### The rationale of anti-aging cosmetic ingredients [^111PeXaq]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Anti-aging cosmetics are a mainstay in the skin care regimen irrespective of gender or human ethnics. Skin aging involves functional slowdown combined with environmental induced alterations. This paper focuses on cosmetic ingredients that aim at alleviating the signs of skin aging, with proven/controlled results of efficacy. Anti-aging skin care widely benefits from new ingredients and modern evaluation methods that can substantiate the effects of innovative products in a perceivable and sensitive manner. Our approach in controlling skin aging consists of following steps: 1) Developing novel testing methods; 2) Preventing photo-aging by sunscreens that protect from UV damage; 3) Protecting and restoring skin from damage induced by environmental exposure through active ingredients; 4) Boosting the cell metabolism and cell renewal to restore skin mechanical properties and improved appearance. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(6 Suppl):s94-97. </em>.

### Sunscreens: a review of health benefits, regulations, and controversies [^115CNqi5]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

Ultraviolet radiation plays a major role in the development of nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers. Photoprotection by sunscreens has been shown to prevent the development of actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and photoaging. However, these benefits are only derived if the users apply sunscreen appropriately and practice other sun protection measures. This review discusses the health benefits provided by sunscreen use, updates the latest regulatory landscape on sunscreen, and addresses the controversies and limitations associated with sunscreen use.

### Cosmetic versus medicine: how does your country define sunscreen? [^112modvn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Skin cancer (melanoma and non-melanoma) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States of America, and non-melanoma skin cancer is the most common cause of Australian hospitalisations with cancer as the principle diagnosis, having a huge cost to the country's health care system. Primary and secondary skin cancer prevention is globally inadequate, with only 3 in 10 American adults using sun protection routinely. Evidence suggests that regular sunscreen use in Australians prevents both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, and American research has found that daily sunscreen use reduced the incidence of melanoma - the most skin cancer deaths - by half. Despite this, in many countries and regions around the world, a major ongoing divergence remains on the classification of sunscreen as either a cosmetic product or a form of medical therapy, which in turn affects the consumers' attitudes towards the use of sunscreen. This is also affected by the increasing use of the internet, which has made the purchasing of products internationally convenient and easy for consumers worldwide, including sunscreen products, which are frequently marketed online. There is variation between each country or region and their regulations of sunscreen affect the consequent labelling claims of sunscreen products. This affects the unsuspecting consumer's choices in purchasing sun protection, which may be misinformed. Australia, Canada, and the US are the only countries to classify sunscreen as a form of medical therapy. This paper explores the current classification of sunscreen products in countries and regions around the world and discusses the impact of these discrepancies and similarities on the attitudes of consumers towards sunscreen use. Finally, we make suggestions on changes that can be made to encourage sunscreen use and safe sunscreen purchasing. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(8):899–904.

### Ultraviolet A radiation: testing and labeling for sunscreen products [^117JnfX3]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

Conceptually, sunscreen products are quite simple. The ultraviolet (UV) filters in these products reduce the "dose" of solar energy to which the skin is exposed. Underlying this empirical notion are many complexities including measures of product efficacy and how to communicate this to consumers. The sun protection factor (SPF) test is and should remain the singular in vivo method for evaluating sunscreens. Additionally, substrate spectrophotometric measure of absorbance/transmittance and the calculation of the summary statistic, such as the critical wavelength (ie, lambda(c)), should be used as a means of evaluating broad-spectrum (ie, UVA) protection. Ideally, the photoprotective efficacy of sunscreen products will be communicated to consumers as an SPF no greater than 50 and a single designation of "broad-spectrum" to indicate long-wavelength UVA protection.

### Sunscreen photoprotection and vitamin D status [^113YGj6v]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Global concern about vitamin D deficiency has fuelled debates on photoprotection and the importance of solar exposure to meet vitamin D requirements.

Objectives

To review the published evidence to reach a consensus on the influence of photoprotection by sunscreens on vitamin D status, considering other relevant factors.

Methods

An international panel of 13 experts in endocrinology, dermatology, photobiology, epidemiology and biological anthropology reviewed the literature prior to a 1-day meeting in June 2017, during which the evidence was discussed. Methods of assessment and determining factors of vitamin D status, and public health perspectives were examined and consequences of sun exposure and the effects of photoprotection were assessed.

Results

A serum level of ≥ 50 nmol L -1 25(OH)D is a target for all individuals. Broad-spectrum sunscreens that prevent erythema are unlikely to compromise vitamin D status in healthy populations. Vitamin D screening should be restricted to those at risk of hypovitaminosis, such as patients with photosensitivity disorders, who require rigorous photoprotection. Screening and supplementation are advised for this group.

Conclusions

Sunscreen use for daily and recreational photoprotection does not compromise vitamin D synthesis, even when applied under optimal conditions. What's already known about this topic? Knowledge of the relationship between solar exposure behaviour, sunscreen use and vitamin D is important for public health but there is confusion about optimal vitamin D status and the safest way to achieve this. Practical recommendations on the potential impact of daily and/or recreational sunscreens on vitamin D status are lacking for healthy people. What does this study add? Judicious use of daily broad-spectrum sunscreens with high ultraviolet (UV) A protection will not compromise vitamin D status in healthy people. However, photoprotection strategies for patients with photosensitivity disorders that include high sun-protection factor sunscreens with high UVA protection, along with protective clothing and shade-seeking behaviour are likely to compromise vitamin D status. Screening for vitamin D status and supplementation are recommended in patients with photosensitivity disorders.

### Hydroquinone, octinoxate, oxybenzone and zinc oxide (Nu-derm starter set normal-oily) [^111SKWxf]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Caution

Hydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent which may produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this medication.

Test for skin sensitivity before using by applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin and check in 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication, but where there is itching or vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory response, further treatment is not advised. Close patient supervision is recommended.

Avoid contact with eyes. In case of accidental contact, patient should rinse eyes thoroughly with water and contact physician. A bitter taste and anesthetic effect may occur if applied to lips.

Sunscreen use is an essential aspect of hydroquinone therapy because even minimal sunlight exposure sustains melanocytic activity. Obagi Sunfader is formulated for use as a skin bleaching agent and should not be used for the prevention of sunburn.

Warning

Contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause serious allergic type reactions (e.g., hives, itching, wheezing, anaphylaxis, severe asthma attacks) in certain susceptible persons.

### Greater efficacy of SPF 100 + sunscreen compared with SPF 50 + in sunburn prevention during 5 consecutive days of sunlight exposure: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial [^115xKfce]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Beach vacations are high-risk settings for overexposure to ultraviolet radiation.

Objective

To compare the sunburn protective efficacy of SPF 50+ and SPF 100+ sunscreens under actual use at the beach.

Methods

A prospective, randomized, double-blind, single-center, split-body/face study of 55 healthy individuals. Each participant applied both sunscreens to randomized sides of the face/body for up to 5 consecutive days. Blinded clinical evaluation of erythema by a single grader and objective instrumental assessments, colorimetry, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy were performed the morning after each sun exposure.

Results

After 5 days, 31 (56%) participants had more sunburn on the SPF 50+ side compared to 4 (7%) on the SPF 100+ side. Overall, mean erythema intensity showed statistically significantly less erythema on the SPF 100+ side compared with the SPF 50+ side. The first observation of sunburn exclusively on the SPF 50+ side occurred after 1 day of sun exposure, whereas that for SPF 100+ occurred after 3 days of sun exposure.

Limitations

Only initial sunscreen application was monitored, only 1 participant with skin phototype I was recruited, and participants were recruited from a local beach area.

Conclusion

SPF 100+ was significantly more effective in protecting against ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema and sunburn than SPF 50+ in actual use in a beach vacation setting.

### Effect of sunscreen application under maximal use conditions on plasma concentration of sunscreen active ingredients: a randomized clinical trial [^113cj5tW]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided guidance that sunscreen active ingredients with systemic absorption greater than 0.5 ng/mL or with safety concerns should undergo nonclinical toxicology assessment including systemic carcinogenicity and additional developmental and reproductive studies.

Objective

To determine whether the active ingredients (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, and ecamsule) of 4 commercially available sunscreens are absorbed into systemic circulation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial conducted at a phase 1 clinical pharmacology unit in the United States and enrolling 24 healthy volunteers. Enrollment started in July 2018 and ended in August 2018.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 sunscreens: spray 1 (n = 6 participants), spray 2 (n = 6), a lotion (n = 6), and a cream (n = 6). Two milligrams of sunscreen per 1 cm2 was applied to 75% of body surface area 4 times per day for 4 days, and 30 blood samples were collected over 7 days from each participant.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the maximum plasma concentration of avobenzone. Secondary outcomes were the maximum plasma concentrations of oxybenzone, octocrylene, and ecamsule.

Results

Among 24 participants randomized (mean age, 35.5 [SD, 1.5] years; 12 (50%] women; 14 [58%] black or African American; 14 [58%]), 23 (96%) completed the trial. For avobenzone, geometric mean maximum plasma concentrations were 4.0 ng/mL (coefficient of variation, 6.9%) for spray 1; 3.4 ng/mL (coefficient of variation, 77.3%) for spray 2; 4.3 ng/mL (coefficient of variation, 46.1%) for lotion; and 1.8 ng/mL (coefficient of variation, 32.1%). For oxybenzone, the corresponding values were 209.6 ng/mL (66.8%) for spray 1, 194.9 ng/mL (52.4%) for spray 2, and 169.3 ng/mL (44.5%) for lotion; for octocrylene, 2.9 ng/mL (102%) for spray 1, 7.8 ng/mL (113.3%) for spray 2, 5.7 ng/mL (66.3%) for lotion, and 5.7 ng/mL (47.1%) for cream; and for ecamsule, 1.5 ng/mL (166.1%) for cream. Systemic concentrations greater than 0.5 ng/mL were reached for all 4 products after 4 applications on day 1. The most common adverse event was rash, which developed in 1 participant with each sunscreen.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this preliminary study involving healthy volunteers, application of 4 commercially available sunscreens under maximal use conditions resulted in plasma concentrations that exceeded the threshold established by the FDA for potentially waiving some nonclinical toxicology studies for sunscreens. The systemic absorption of sunscreen ingredients supports the need for further studies to determine the clinical significance of these findings. These results do not indicate that individuals should refrain from the use of sunscreen.

### Skin protection by sunscreens is improved by explicit labeling and providing free sunscreen [^114sB4dp]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Whatever the improvement in the protection spectrum of sunscreens (SCs), actual skin protection mainly depends on the way they are used, especially on the quantity applied. This prospective randomized study assessed how much sun protection factor (SPF) labeling, which is hardly understandable by a layman, and high cost account for misuse of SCs. In three beach resorts in France, 364 individuals were blindly randomized during their holidays to three arms (1) free SCs intervention (FS) = four types of SCs with their usual SPF label (60B-A, 20B-A, 12B-A, 6B-3A) at free disposal; (2) same free SCs with an explicit labeling (FNL), including sunburn protection, likely protection against long-term effects of UV, and possibility to get a tan; and (3) no intervention (NI). As compared to FS, FNL increased the quantity of SCs applied, mainly in the minority of people who were not "tan-seekers", reduced sunburns particularly in sun-sensitive individuals (25.6 vs 58.3%, P = 0.005), and induced a shift in the level of SCs chosen. Free delivery SCs were associated with a more systematic application of SCs in case of exposure, and a decreased sunburn occurrence, without increase of exposure. These results suggest that a labeling more explicit for the public would result in a better protection in SC users and that cost could be a limiting factor to use SC as often as necessary.

### Foundations and self-tanning products: Do they provide any protection from the sun? [^116DBHcF]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

As soon as the weather turns sunny, everyone wants a tan. People with skin phototypes III and IV, called melanocompetent, have no problem meeting this fashion requirement. But things are quite different for people with phototypes I and II and so these individuals look for alternative solutions. In essence, light skin burns easily when exposed to the sun. Therefore, light-skinned people are offered a cosmetic solution through self-tanning products or foundations. It seemed interesting to us to evaluate the sun protection power of this type of product. To do this, we used an in vitro method to determine the typical indicators related to sunscreen products, such as sun protection factor (SPF), ultraviolet (UV)-A protection factor (PF-UVA), UV-B/UV-A ratio as well as the critical wavelength because these artificial tanning products could be considered sunscreen products by users. It is important to know whether a self-tanning product and/or a foundation provide sun protection and whether they meet the standards set for other sunscreen products. Protection which is imbalanced for either UV-B or UV-A radiation is potentially harmful for users believing themselves adequately protected. To do this, we assembled the requisite conditions for forming melanoidins in the cosmetic itself. We tested seven amino acids found in the corneal cells of the epidermis. Regardless of the amino acid used, the corresponding SPF was essentially zero (approximately SPF 2). Foundations, on the other hand, proved to be much more interesting because they possess a non-negligible SPF as well as good photostability making these products safe in terms of their mode of application (applied once daily).

### Sunscreen photoprotection and vitamin D status [^116Dintz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The benefits of sunscreens in photoprotection strategies

The acute and chronic adverse effects of solar UVR, especially to those with fair skins, are well established and can be inhibited by effective sun protection. 22, 25, 39, 40 This includes (i) sun avoidance or seeking shade; (ii) clothing; and (iii) sunscreen use. When used optimally sunscreens can prevent erythema during a week‐long holiday, even when the UVI is very high. 41 Laboratory studies have shown than sunscreens can prevent UVR‐induced immunosuppression 42 and the formation of DNA damage 43, 44 [specifically cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), the action spectrum of which is very similar to erythema]. 45 CPD are thought to be important in many skin cancers. Those with cancer‐prone fair skin are especially sensitive to CPD formation, whereas the higher melanin content in dark skin affords much better protection against CPD, especially in the basal layer. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 A recent study with a high SPF sunscreen and high‐dose SSR for 5 consecutive days showed significant protection against CPD, even when the sunscreen was applied at 0.75 mg cm −2 to simulate typical use. 44 A large Norwegian cohort showed that sunscreen use reduced the risk of melanoma. 51 Extensive randomized controlled trials in Australia, with long‐term follow‐up, have demonstrated the protective properties of a sunscreen against photoageing, melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but not basal cell carcinoma. 52, 53, 54, 55, 56

Spectral considerations

Ultraviolet B

Action spectroscopy shows that UVB is orders of magnitude more effective than UVA for erythema (see Fig. 3 b 57, 58). 45 This means that the SPF is primarily, but not exclusively, a measure of UVB protection. 31 Such protection is essential when UVB doses are high with recreational solar exposure, and in countries with high UVI.

### Sunscreen: how to help protect your skin from the sun… [^111D7xZm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the recognized public health benefits of sunscreen use, Americans should continue to use sunscreen with other sun protective measures as this important effort moves forward.
- Reapply sunscreen at least every two hours, and more often if you're sweating or swimming. Questions About Sunscreen General directions:

- Apply 15 minutes before sun exposure. This allows the sunscreen to have enough time to provide the maximum benefit.
- Use enough to cover your entire face and body. An average-sized adult or child needs at least one ounce of sunscreen to evenly cover the body from head to toe. Sunscreens are made in a wide range of SPFs. Higher SPF values provide greater sunburn protection. Because SPF values are determined from a test that measures protection against sunburn, SPF values primarily indicate a sunscreen's UVB protection.

To get the most protection out of sunscreen, choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Broad spectrum Broad spectrum sunscreens help protect against both forms of UV radiation
- UVA and UVB. However, not all sunscreens are broad spectrum, so it is important to look for this description on the label. A sunscreen product's SPF value is primarily an indicator of the level of protection that product provides against UVB radiation, but broad-spectrum sunscreens also protect against UVA radiation. It is important to always use other sun protection measures, along with your broad spectrum sunscreen, when spending time in the sun. Sunscreen provides protection against both by providing a chemical barrier that absorbs or reflects UV radiation before it can damage the skin. Every FDA-regulated drug product has active ingredients and inactive ingredients.

In the case of sunscreen, active ingredients are the ones that are protecting your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. Inactive ingredients are all other ingredients that are not active ingredients, such as water or oil that may be used in formulating sunscreens. Below is a list of commonly used active ingredients in products that are labeled as sunscreen:

- Aminobenzoic acid
- Avobenzone
- Cinoxate
- Dioxybenzone
- Homosalate
- Meradimate
- Octocrylene
- Octinoxate
- Octisalate
- Oxybenzone
- Padimate O
- Ensulizole
- Sulisobenzone
- Titanium dioxide
- Zinc oxide.

### Optimal sunscreen use, during a sun holiday with a very high ultraviolet index, allows vitamin D synthesis without sunburn [^114UZY9Q]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The sun protection factor (SPF) of a sunscreen is a quantitative measure of its ability to inhibit erythema. Regulatory authorities specify many requirements for SPF determination, one of which is an application thickness of 2 mg cm −2. 20 However, people typically apply much less, for example 0.8 mg cm −2, with a commensurate reduction in SPF. 21, 22 Furthermore, application is often patchy with, for example, missing facial coverage. 23 Additionally, people use sunscreens to prolong their intentional solar exposure time. 24, 25

The SPF primarily quantifies protection from UVB, because this waveband is much more erythemogenic than UVA. 1 However, regulatory bodies require UVA protection, the definition of which varies with regional domain. 20 This UVA protection factor (PF) is typically a qualitative index that describes the spectral profile of the sunscreen. One de facto consequence of increased UVA protection is a decrease in UVB protection for a given SPF. This would be expected to have a beneficial effect on vitamin D synthesis.

### Photoprotection in specific populations: children and people of color [^112Tes1Q]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Improved education on appropriate photoprotection in children is vital. Photoprotection for these individuals should include seeking shade, the use of physical agents (clothing, hat, sunglasses), and application of sunscreens on exposed areas. Avoidance of the use of tanning beds is an important component of education for teenagers. Ultraviolet radiation exposure induces DNA damage and photoaging in all skin types, including people of color. The extent of such damage is inversely related to constitutive skin pigmentation. Therefore, personalized photoprotection recommendations concerning skin cancer risk factors, desired treatment outcomes, health needs (eg, vitamin D), and photoaging based on the needs and preferences of the patient are essential. It is clear that additional research is needed on optimal levels of protection against ultraviolet radiation for people of color.

### Update on photoprotection [^113pvwcL]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Photoprotection is an effective method for preventing damaging effects from ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Photoprotection is accomplished through the use of sunscreens, protective clothing, and safe sun practices. Sunscreens are composed of various UV filters, including inorganic/physical blockers and organic/chemical sunscreen agents. New technologies are emerging in sunscreen development and may soon be available to U.S. consumers. General guidelines for sunscreen use should be reinforced to improve patient compliance and sunscreen efficacy. Habitual use of sunscreen is recommended with UV exposure, and concerns for vitamin D deficiency with sunscreen use should not supersede proper photoprotective behavior.

### Healthy lifestyles are associated with better vitamin D status in community-dwelling older men: the health in men study (HIMS) [^114YurJo]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Bioactive vitamin D is a hormone that stimulates the gut absorption of calcium and phosphate and is essential for bone and muscle health. There are two major forms of vitamin D. Vitamin D 3 is mainly synthesized in the skin after the exposure to sunlight, whereby 7‐dehydrocholesterol in the skin is converted to pre‐vitamin D 3 during ultraviolet B radiation and is then immediately converted to vitamin D 3. Latitude, season, skin pigmentation, use of sunscreen and clothing cover, and outdoor activities that affect sunlight exposure can influence dermal synthesis of vitamin D 3. Small amounts of vitamin D are found in food such as oily fish, meat, eggs, mushrooms (a source of the other form, vitamin D 2) and vitamin D fortified food. The blood concentration of the intermediate metabolite, 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), is used to determine vitamin D status. Severe deficiency of vitamin D, characterized by 25OHD levels below 25 nmol/L, can have detrimental effects on health, including impaired bone mineralization.

Endogenous synthesis of vitamin D declines with aging partly due to a reduction in skin 7‐dehydrocholesterol, with effects on calcium absorption further exacerbated by reduced renal production of the bioactive form, 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D). Furthermore, decreased endogenous synthesis of vitamin D is accentuated in older people with sedentary behaviours and limited sunlight exposure, particularly those who are institutionalized, or house bound. The decrease in vitamin D production and calcium absorption together lead to increased risk of negative calcium balance and bone loss in older‐aged populations. In recent years, vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has been recognized as an important public health issue worldwide. Australia is known for its abundance of sunshine, with most of the population obtaining vitamin D through cutaneous synthesis during sun exposure. However, the national survey indicated a lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25OHD < 50 nmol/L) in older age groups compared to younger groups. This difference can be partially attributed to the higher likelihood of older individuals taking vitamin D supplements. However, a significant number of falls‐ and hip fracture‐related hospitalizations in the elderly Australian population remain attributable to vitamin D deficiency.

### Optimal sunscreen use, during a sun holiday with a very high ultraviolet index, allows vitamin D synthesis without sunburn [^116qArTW]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

All nonvitamin D parameters have been previously reported 31 and were normally distributed. There was no overall difference in age between the groups (P = 0.20,), but the sunscreen B group was just significantly older (mean ± SD, 4.8 ± 2.4 years) than the discretionary sunscreen group C (P = 0.047, post hoc test). The BSA and mean sunscreen application thicknesses of the intervention sunscreens are given in Tables 1 and 3. There was no difference (P > 0.1) in BSA between any of the groups (male, female and male + female participants), although this was significantly greater in male participants. There was no difference in the amount of sunscreen applied in the intervention groups (P = 0.60), based on the first application from each tube over 85% BSA. The participants had FST II (60%), III (38%) and IV (3%). There was a borderline significant difference in skin type between all groups (P = 0.047), which was lost when the control group was excluded (P = 0.15). Erythema, quantified by area under the curve with time, showed virtually no change in both sunscreen intervention groups, and no difference between these groups (P ≥ 0.36), but was marked in the discretionary sunscreen use group. The differences were highly significant (P < 0.001), showing that the sunscreen interventions inhibited erythema.

### Sunscreen product performance and other determinants of consumer preferences [^111bhzuc]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Sunscreen use is a modifiable behavior that can help reduce the risk for skin cancer, prevent sunburns, mitigate photoaging, and treat photosensitive dermatoses. A better understanding of consumer sunscreen preferences would inform dermatologists in their own recommendations.

Objective

To determine the characteristics and the most commonly cited positive and negative features of highly rated sunscreens described by consumers.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The top 1 percentile of sunscreen products on Amazon.com as of December 2015 was selected according to average consumer review (≥ 4 stars) and the highest number of consumer reviews. Descriptive data for each product were collected from the product page and manufacturer claims. The top 5 "most helpful" reviews (positive and critical) were analyzed and coded by a consensus qualitative coding scheme, which included positive and negative descriptors in 6 major categories according to consumer comments: affordability, cosmetic elegance, separate ratings, product ingredients, product performance, and skin compatibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to determine whether characteristics of each product (eg, American Academy of Dermatology [AAD] criteria, sun protection factor [SPF], or vehicle) could be used to predict price per ounce. The number (percentage) of comments categorized by major themes and subthemes was determined. Illustrative consumer comments were also collected.

Results

There were 6500 products categorized as sunscreens in the Amazon.com, online catalog. Of the 65 products evaluated, the median price per ounce was $3.32 (range, $0.68-$23.47). Of products, 40% (26 of 65) did not adhere to AAD guidelines (broad spectrum, SPF ≥ 30, and water resistant) for sunscreens. Vehicles, AAD, and sunscreen type predicted a higher price per ounce. Cosmetic elegance was the most cited positive feature (198 of 325 [61%] comments) followed by product performance (146 of 325 [45%] comments) and skin type compatibility (78 of 325 [24%] comments).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort of highly rated sunscreen products, a significant proportion did not adhere to AAD guidelines, mostly attributable to a lack of water resistance. The most striking variation in this cohort was price, which varied by more than 3000%. Dermatologists should balance the importance of cosmetic elegance, cost, and AAD guidelines for sun protection in making their recommendations to consumers.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^116VJn8N]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Choosing a sunscreen (United States) — The most effective sunscreens are broad-spectrum, combining agents that filter ultraviolet A and B (UVA and UVB), and the American Academy of Dermatology Practice Safe Sun guidelines recommend using products with a sun protection factor (SPF) ≥ 30. Labeling guidelines adopted by the FDA in 2010 permit broad-spectrum sunscreen products with an SPF ≥ 15 to state, "If used as directed with other sun-protection measures, [this product] decreases the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun", and sunscreens may be labeled "water resistant for up to [either 40 or 80] minutes"; the FDA neither defines nor uses the terms waterproof or sweatproof. A product's SPF is a ratio of UVB doses causing sunburn on protected vs unprotected skin, and SPF measures protection from UVB only, not UVA; in theory, an SPF of 30 means that only 1/30th of the UVB reaches the skin — or that a person can remain in the sun 30 times as long — when the sunscreen is applied. The FDA's approval process for UV filters is under review and will most likely begin with systematic human toxicity testing of UV filters currently approved in the United States before testing UV filters used elsewhere in the world.

### Quantity of sunscreen used by European students [^114jgCAV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The ability of sunscreen products to delay sun-induced skin erythema is indicated by the sun protection factor (SPF), which is measured using an internationally agreed sunscreen thickness of 2 mg cm(-2).

Objectives

To determine the thickness of sunscreen used under practical conditions.

Methods

In two double-blind randomized trials performed in five different places in Europe in 1997 and 1998, 148 18–24-year-old students received either an SPF 10 or an SPF 30 sunscreen to be used during their summer holidays.

Results

Complete, detailed data on quantities of sunscreen used and skin areas on to which sunscreen was applied were available for 124 students. The median thickness of sunscreen applied was 0.39 mg cm(-2). We found no variation in sunscreen thickness according to sex, skin phototype, study place or SPF.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that most consumers do not benefit from the SPF indicated on sunscreen bottles, and do not support the idea that thickness of sunscreen applied would be greater if these products were cheaper. We suggest that information on ability of a sunscreen product to prevent sunburn should be adapted in order to reflect actual usage patterns.

Background/Objectives

Anti-aging strategies utilizing stem cells are in the forefront. Alpha and beta defensins are natural immune peptides that have been shown to activate an LGR6-positive stem cell locus in the hair follicle, identified as the source of most new epidermal cells during acute wound healing. We investigated the ability of biomimetic alpha and beta defensin molecules, supplemented with supportive cosmetic ingredients, formulated into three skin care products, at improving the structure and function of aging skin.

Methods

A participant- and investigator -blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial was performed in outpatient settings. Forty-four healthy female subjects, aged 41–71 years, skin types I-V, completed the study with 2/3 receiving full formula and 1/3 receiving the placebo formula. A skin care regimen of 3 products (serum, cream, and mask) containing alpha-defensin 5 and beta-defensin 3, and other cosmetic ingredients, was applied to the face, post-auricular, and neck skin two times per day for 12 weeks in those receiving full formula, whereas the placebo group received the identically packaged regimen without the active ingredients. Methods of evaluation included histopathology and immunohistochemistry (7 subjects), clinical evaluation of pores, superficial and deep wrinkles based on Griffiths scale, and high-resolution photography (all subjects). In addition, a subset of 15 patients were evaluated with the QuantifiCare system (3-dimensional imaging and skin care scores for evenness, pores, oiliness) and Cortex measurements (high-resolution skin ultrasound, TEWL, elasticity, color, and hydration). Data points for evaluation included baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. All patients used the same sunscreen and cleanser, which was provided to them.

Results

The full formula regimen caused a significantly (P equals 0.027) increased thickness of the epidermis as seen in histology, not seen in the placebo group, with no signs of inflammation. No excessive cell proliferation was detected in either group as measured by Ki67-immunohistochemistry. Reduction in visible pores, superficial wrinkles, oiliness, pigmentation, and improvement of skin evenness, were statistically significant. A trend for improvement was also observed in skin elasticity, TEWL, and hydration; these did not achieve statistical significance. Ultrasound and histopathology demonstrated increases in dermal thickness in individual patients, without statistical significance. Comprehensive improvement in all 5 parameters, including visible pores, hyperpigmentation, superficial and deep wrinkles, and epidermal thickness, was statistically significant when the subset of participants assigned for histology in full formula group was compared with the placebo group participants.

Conclusions

A 3-product skin care regimen containing alpha and beta defensins globally improves the visual appearance and structure of aging skin without irritation, dryness, or inflammation. Specifically, this regimen increases epidermal thickness, reduces appearance of pores, reduces wrinkles, and reduces melanin. This skin care regimen stimulates rejuvenation without evidence of increase of a marker of carcinogenic stimulation. This data is consistent with the hypothesis that a defensin-containing skin care regimen activates the body's own dormant stem cells to generate healthy new epidermal cells. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(4):426–441. </em> THIS ARTICLE HAD BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE.

### Screening for skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^11581gwd]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Skin cancer burden and prevention — US epidemiology: Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the US, while most skin cancers do not cause serious health problems or death, and melanoma constitutes about 1% of skin cancers. An estimated 98,000 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the US in 2023, with 8,000 associated deaths. Preventive behaviors to reduce skin cancer risk include minimizing sun exposure, using sunscreen, and wearing protective clothing, and the USPSTF has a recommendation on behavioral counseling for skin cancer prevention.

### Optimal sunscreen use, during a sun holiday with a very high ultraviolet index, allows vitamin D synthesis without sunburn [^116ZXJTe]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, there was an increase of 25(OH)D 3 during a week of cloudless weather with very high UVI, even when sunscreens were used to achieve their labelled SPFs and inhibit sunburn. We estimate that the measured increases of 25(OH)D 3 occur with ~0.4 SED per day through the sunscreens, which is equivalent to ~0.1 MED per day in fair‐skinned people. Although labelled as SPF 15, the products used in the current study were in the region of SPF 18–19. A sunscreen with SPF 50+ (mean ± SD 64 ± 15.8) used at 0.75 mg cm −2 has an SPF of 20.9 ± 3.3. 30 This means that typical use of high SPF sunscreens probably has a limited impact on vitamin D synthesis. However, the use of high SPF sunscreens in a way that achieves their labelled SPF may have an impact on vitamin D synthesis, but this needs to be tested under field conditions. There is interaction between the BSA exposed and UVR dose 46 and this is probably complicated by the addition of sunscreens.

Significantly more 25(OH)D 3 synthesis occurred with a high UVA‐PF (broad‐spectrum) sunscreen when compared with a low UVA‐PF sunscreen for a given SPF. This is what would be expected based on the action spectrum for previtamin D 3 and the optical properties of the sunscreens. Thus, sunscreens can be designed to optimize the balance between the adverse and beneficial effects of solar UVR exposure as suggested by theoretical calculations. 64 Our data support the use of sunscreens to prevent adverse effects of UVR, without compromising vitamin D synthesis. This is in agreement with the conclusions of two recent reviews of a wide range of different types of studies on the effect of sunscreen use on vitamin D synthesis. 65, 66

### Sunscreen photoprotection and vitamin D status [^1157dUBc]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Cutaneous vitamin D 3 synthesis is initiated by terrestrial‐range UVB and can be achieved with suberythemal exposures to a relatively small BSA. Daily sunscreen use, for nonintentional solar exposure, is mainly based on products with low SPF and high UVA‐PF. This is unlikely to impact on vitamin D production. In fact, most studies published to date have shown no association between sunscreen use and vitamin D deficiency, even with regular use of SPF > 15. Some studies have even reported a positive association between sunscreen use and 25(OH)D 3, suggesting that their use may have increased sun exposure. Indeed, time spent outdoors and BSA exposed to sun have been positively correlated with vitamin D status. Overall, other photoprotection behaviours (such as seeking shade, wearing protective clothing and long sleeves) may have more impact on vitamin D status than sunscreen use. The recommendations of the panel for daily and recreational photoprotection, as well as the need for vitamin D screening and supplementation, are summarized in Table 5.

### Sunscreen photoprotection and vitamin D status [^1169d49B]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Ultraviolet A

There has been an increasing trend over recent years for better UVA protection, with the aim of designing the ideal 'neutral density' sunscreen with 'spectral homeostasis' that mimics shade, i.e. it does not distort the natural solar UVR spectrum. 59 There is no global standard for UVA protection and requirements vary with regulatory domain. 31 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently proposed greater UVA protection. 60 A UVA protection factor (UVA‐PF) can be obtained using a sunscreen's ability to inhibit persistent pigment darkening in vivo. 61 Spectral approaches, based on UVB/UVA absorption ratios and bandwidth cover, give qualitative but not quantitative information on UVA protection.

UVA irradiance is at least 20‐fold greater than UVB in sunlight. 62 Furthermore, because UVA is not attenuated by the ozone layer, it is much less prone than UVB to daily, seasonal and geographical variation. Efficient UVA protection is highly recommended in recreational and daily photoprotection strategies, because good UVB protection, which inhibits sunburn, enables prolonged solar exposure and the accumulation of unnaturally high UVA doses. UVA1 (340–400 nm) preferentially induces CPD in the basal layer, which contains stem cells and melanocytes, 63 as well as damaging DNA repair enzymes. 64 Increasing UVA protection for a given SPF results in a de facto reduction of UVB protection, which might be expected to be beneficial for vitamin D synthesis.

Studies in vivo or in 3D skin models, have shown that for a given SPF a high UVA‐PF sunscreen offers better protection against pigmentation, photoageing and DNA damage compared with low UVA‐PF, and that low SPF sunscreens with high UVA‐PF offer such protection (Table 1). 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70 One study, on a reconstructed skin model exposed to daily SSR, showed that a sunscreen with a lower SPF but strong UVA protection was more effective in preventing photodamage compared with a sunscreen with a higher SPF but low UVA protection. 66 Thus, overall there seems to be biological and clinical advantages from increasing UVA protection for a given SPF.

### Skin cancer in skin of color: an update on current facts, trends, and misconceptions [^114CPdZQ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

For many fair-skinned individuals around the world, skin cancer is the leading malignancy. Although skin cancer comprises only 1% to 2% of all malignancies in those with darker complexions, the mortality rates in this subgroup are substantially higher when compared with their Caucasian counterparts. This discrepancy is largely as a result of delayed detection/treatment, and a false perception among patient and physician that brown skin confers complete protection against skin cancer. Recent studies show that 65% of surveyed African Americans never wore sunscreen, despite living in sunny climates, and that more than 60% of minority respondents erroneously believed that they were not at risk for skin cancer. Dark skin offers some protection from ultraviolet (UV) light. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in skin of color, a phenomenon that is accentuated by mixed heritage. Ethnicity does not confer skin type anymore. People of color do experience sunburn, and from a biological point of view, all skin types appear to be sensitive to UV-induced DNA damage, with an inverse relationship between skin color and sensitivity to UV light. Our population is changing rapidly, and within the next few decades minority populations will become the majority. It is therefore imperative to educate both physicians and patients on the perceived immunity against cutaneous malignancies, the need for sun protection, and the clinical signs of skin cancer in non-Caucasian people, so that future unnecessary mortality can be avoided.

Fig. 4

The concept of sunscreen homeostasis also considers the homeostasis with our environment. As shown by Ramos et al. who reviewed the presence of organic UVR filters in wastewater treatment plants in Portugal, there is a need for the development of ecological solar UVR filters, based on naturally occurring filters. Natural compounds can offer photostable wide-spectrum filters, with reduced ecotoxicity and adverse effects. Several species, including aquatic organisms, produce small molecules that protect them from the sun by absorbing harmful UVR, such as UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino (MMA) acids.

Besides, it should be remembered that sunscreens do not address a homogeneous target population. Skins of different phototypes differ in their photobiological responses, including DNA repair, immunosuppression, apoptosis, anti-oxidative capabilities, and photoaging. Differences in the melanocortin 1 receptor and in skin pigments are involved in the susceptibility to skin cancer. Personalized photoprotection recommendations concerning skin cancer risk factors, desired treatment outcomes, health needs (e.g. vitamin D), and photoaging, based on the needs and preferences of the patient, are therefore essential.

Last but not least, on our way to sun–skin homeostasis, we should not forget that the most imponderable aspect is the human factor, based on beliefs, behaviors, and conduct. With individual exposure ranging from nearly total to minimal skin coverage, the challenge will surely require improved photoprotection strategies such as systemic photoprotectants and, ideally, universal photoeducation campaigns.

### SPF 100 + sunscreen is more protective against sunburn than SPF 50 + in actual use: results of a randomized, double-blind, split-face, natural sunlight exposure clinical trial [^111GATiT]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The value of additional photoprotection provided by use of high-sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreens is controversial, and limited clinical evidence exists.

Objective

To compare the sunburn protection provided by SPF 100+ and SPF 50+ sunscreen in conditions of actual use.

Methods

A total of 199 healthy men and women (≥ 18 years) participated in a natural sunlight, single-exposure, split-face, randomized, double-blind study in Vail, Colorado. Each participant wore both sunscreens simultaneously during activities, with no use restrictions other than designation of the treatment area. Erythema was clinically assessed on the day following exposure. Comparative efficacy was evaluated through bilateral comparison of sunburn between treatment areas and erythema score, as evaluated separately for each treatment area.

Results

Following an average 6.1 ± 1.3 hours of sun exposure, investigator-blinded evaluation identified 55.3% of the participants (110 of 199) as more sunburned on the SPF 50+ protected side and 5% (10 of 199) on the SPF 100+ protected side. After exposure, 40.7% of the participants (81 of 199) exhibited increased erythema scores (by ≥ 1) on the SPF 50+ protected side as compared with 13.6% (27 of 199) on the SPF 100+ protected side.

Limitations

Single-day exposure may not extrapolate to benefits of longer-term protection.

Conclusion

SPF 100+ sunscreen was significantly more effective in protecting against sunburn than SPF 50+ sunscreen in actual use conditions.

### Are in-market control systems for sunscreens adequate for consumer protection? A review of the legal framework regulating sun protection factor labels in Europe [^114Ebn3v]. BMJ Public Health (2023). High credibility.

The impact of in-market controls and public health initiatives to the public

Beyond, and regardless of, the variabilities encountered in SPF laboratory tests, several factors contribute to making the SPF value determined in a laboratory to be an overestimation of the actual SPF achieved in real conditions. For instance, the amount of product applied in real-world settings (estimated at 0.4–1.2 mg/cm 2) is less than the amount used in laboratory tests (2 mg/cm 2). A 50% reduction in the amount of product applied can lower the actual SPF value by a factor of four. Sweat, rubbing and environmental factors also diminish the efficacy of a sunscreen over time, and users often miss out on adequately covering certain parts of exposed areas. Besides the SPF, which is primarily a measure of the protection capacity of a sunscreen against UVB radiation (290–320 nm), protection against UVA (320–400 nm) is likewise important. Multiple other factors (eg, the contribution of visible light to erythema, the time of the day and solar zenith angle) further contribute to making the SPF achieved in natural sun exposure conditions differ from that measured in the laboratory. Consequently, public health efforts aim at improving sun protection by, among other considerations (eg, seeking shade, using protective clothing and sunglasses), incentivising and conveying messages about the correct use of sunscreens.

The consistency of public health messages through mainstream programmes and advertising campaigns, as well as the systematic use of sunscreen at a population level, have demonstrated to be highly effective in improving the population's sun protectionand saving healthcare costs. These efforts rely on the robustness of sunscreen labels and are undertaken by bodies such as governmental agencies, healthcare institutions and medical associations.

Nonetheless, official public health messages compete with (sometimes conflicting) messages about sunscreen use delivered by other stakeholder groups. In fact, with the uptake of social media and other content delivery platforms, there has been an increase of commentary from non-official sources promoting sunscreen related content with no scientific backup. For the average consumer, the number of impacts received and the variety of sources involved is large and diverse, to the extent that consumers are often confused, may have misconceptions about the factors important in a sunscreen, and may even not always understand the meaning of sunscreen labels.

### The relation between the amount of sunscreen applied and the sun protection factor in Asian skin [^116pkojr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The measurement of the sun protection factor (SPF) is the usual method in the examination of the effectiveness of sunscreen. The declared SPF is based on the use of a sunscreen layer of 2 mg/cm(2). However, only around a quarter (0.5 mg/cm(2)) of this amount is generally used in real life. Theoretical calculations have suggested that the effectiveness of SPF is related to sunscreen quantity in an exponential way but this was not confirmed in Asian skin.

Objectives

This study was performed to investigate the change in SPF values when less than the recommended amount of sunscreen was applied.

Methods

A board divided into 10 areas measuring 7 x 4 cm was placed on the back of 15 healthy volunteers. Low- and high-SPF standard reference sunscreens, and two types of sunscreen (SPF 30 and 35) were each applied on 4 areas, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/cm(2), respectively, and were left to dry for 20 minutes. The irradiation was conducted at a distance of 50 cm using a template (1 x 1 cm) placed directly on the skin with 10 windows allowing ultraviolet (UV) radiation to pass through with a dose increment of 20%. Erythema was evaluated 20 to 24 hours after exposure to UV radiation.

Results

Sunscreen showed its expected SPF value when 2.0 mg/cm(2) was applied. The SPF values of the different amounts were significantly different from each other and decreased when less was applied (P < .05). The relation between the amount of sunscreen applied and the SPF provided was most likely to follow exponential growth.

Limitations

Spectral differences between our solar simulator and the UV sources of commercial laboratories are likely to be important. In addition, differences in sunscreen application techniques may have influenced the ultimate SPF values.

Conclusions

This study concludes that to get the expected SPF value, it is important to apply the UV protective sunscreen precisely in the amount of 2.0 mg/cm(2) on Asian skin as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration. In addition, it was difficult to predict the SPF values when the usual amount of 0.5 mg/cm(2) was applied.

### Optimal sunscreen use, during a sun holiday with a very high ultraviolet index, allows vitamin D synthesis without sunburn [^114jQDRM]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on measurements from 21 tubes per person, 31 the intervention sunscreens were applied at a mean thickness of 2.4 mg cm −2, resulting in SPFs of at least 15. Thus, assuming a constant level of protection, the average cumulative UVR dose received through the sunscreen was ~40/15 (SPF) = 2.7 SED (or ~0.4 SED per day). This results in an increase of 7.0 and 4.8 nmol L −1 25(OH)D 3 per SED through the high and low UVA‐PF sunscreens, respectively. A recent study, with an acute exposure of fluorescent solar‐simulated radiation over 35% BSA, showed an estimated increase of ~3 and ~2.5 nmol L −1 per SED in people of FST II and III, respectively (L. Rhodes, personal communication). 49 These results are compatible with ours given that the relationships between 25(OH)D 3 synthesis and UVR dose and the BSA exposed are complex. 46 It was not possible to estimate the doses received by the discretionary sunscreen use group C.

### High-SPF sunscreens (SPF ≥ 70) may provide ultraviolet protection above minimal recommended levels by adequately compensating for lower sunscreen user application amounts [^114gJx3E]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The manner in which consumers apply sunscreens is often inadequate for ultraviolet protection according to the labeled sun protection factor (SPF). Although sunscreen SPFs are labeled by testing at an application density of 2 mg/cm(2), the actual protection received is often substantially less because of consumer application densities ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg/cm(2). High-SPF sunscreens may provide more adequate protection even when applied by consumers at inadequate amounts.

Objective

We sought to measure the actual SPF values of various sunscreens (labeled SPF 30–100) applied in amounts typical of those used by consumers.

Methods

Actual SPF values were measured on human volunteers for 6 sunscreen products with labeled SPF values ranging from 30 to 100, applied at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/cm(2).

Results

There was a linear relationship between application density and the actual SPF; sunscreens with labeled SPF values of 70 and above provided significant protection, even at the low application densities typically applied by consumers. Sunscreens labeled SPF 70 and 100 applied at 0.5 mg/cm(2) provided an actual SPF value of, respectively, 19 and 27.

Limitations

The study was conducted in a laboratory setting under standardized conditions and results are extrapolated to actual in-use situations.

Conclusion

Sunscreens with SPF 70 and above add additional clinical benefits when applied by consumers at typically used amounts, by delivering an actual SPF that meets the minimum SPF levels recommended for skin cancer and photodamage prevention. In contrast, sunscreens with SPF 30 or 50 may not produce sufficient protection at actual consumer usage levels.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^111CD6AL]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Sunscreen and midday sun exposure — effects on cutaneous vitamin D synthesis and use are detailed as follows: A sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 8 can decrease vitamin D3 synthetic capacity by 95%, and SPF 15 can decrease it by 98%; in adults who apply sunscreen properly the amount of vitamin D3 produced is decreased 95%. For adequate vitamin D synthesis, exposure to the midday sun (between 1000 and 1500 hours) for 10 to 15 minutes in the spring, summer, and fall is considered sufficient for light-skinned people, after which application of a sunscreen with an SPF of ≥ 15 is recommended to prevent damaging effects of chronic excessive exposure to sunlight. In a 2003 study in Maine, 48% of white girls aged 9 to 11 years had 25(OH)-D levels of < 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) at the end of winter, and 17% continued to have vitamin D insufficiency at the end of summer because of sunscreen use and the practice of complete sun protection.

### Photoprotection by sunscreens [^113aV4oN]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is an etiologic factor for the development of nonmelanoma skin cancers and also possibly melanoma. The American Academy of Dermatology currently recommends the daily use of sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or above. The SPF numerical rating is an in vivo, standardized measure of sunscreen efficacy. SPF assessment predominantly reflects the ability of a product to screen UVB radiation. The physical and biologic properties of UVA radiation are relevant as UVA contributes to photoimmunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis. An ideal sunscreen assessment system would address both UVB and UVA protection. However, the SPF rating should continue to serve as the major determinant of sunscreen efficacy.

### Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (non-metastatic) [^1166h6Cp]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumour of keratinocytes arising in the epidermis, with histological evidence of dermal invasion. Incidence varies by country, skin colour, and outdoor behaviour, and is as high as 400/100,000 in Australia. People with fair skin colour who have high sun exposure and sunburn easily with little or no tanning, people with xeroderma pigmentosum, and people who are immunosuppressed are most susceptible to squamous cell carcinoma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: Does the use of sunscreen help prevent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and actinic (solar) keratosis? What is the optimal margin for primary excision of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (non-metastatic)? Does radiotherapy after surgery affect local recurrence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in people with squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (non-metastatic)? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found five studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: sunscreens, primary excision, and radiotherapy after surgery.

Summary of actual sun protection factor (SPF), sunscreen application, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, erythema and 25‐dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [25(OH)D 3] and study results

Sun‐exposure behaviour was monitored half‐hourly in diaries, 34, 35 which included clothing cover to estimate the percentage body surface area (BSA) exposed. The time of sunscreen application was monitored, and application thickness was estimated (by weighing tubes before and after use) in cases when the first application per tube was on 85% BSA exposed (i.e. in swimwear). Participants with discretionary use of sunscreen, group C (n = 22), were instructed to bring their own sunscreens to use as normal. No instructions were given, and use was not monitored. Control group D (n = 17) remained in Łódź (51.8° N). The allocation of individuals to the four groups depended on several factors. Group C agreed to invasive procedures, which have previously been reported, 31 and group D was unwilling or unable to travel. Groups A and B were randomized as room‐sharing pairs by being sequentially allocated to sunscreen A or B as they entered the study. Pairs were given the same sunscreen to avoid inadvertent mixing of product.

The full details of the holiday, participants, sunscreens, personal UVR exposures and sunburn have been previously published. 31 Briefly, standard erythema doses (SEDs) 35 were measured using personal wrist‐worn electronic dosimeters and erythema was assessed at the end of each day by reflectance spectroscopy on five exposed body sites.

The incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is dramatically increasing worldwide, despite the increased use of improved sunscreens. In 2014, the Surgeon General estimated that 2.2 to 5.0 million people are treated annually for NMSC.1–3 For decades, recommendations for sun protection have remained insufficient; subsequently, the numbers of newly diagnosed skin cancers continue to rise, and there is a need for additional preventative measures beyond sunscreens. The objective of this article is to review current oral prescription medications as well as supplements that may play an important role in skin cancer prevention.

### The relation between sunscreen layer thickness and vitamin D production after ultraviolet B exposure: a randomized clinical trial [^111dLWFV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Sunscreens absorb ultraviolet B (UVB) and it is a major concern that sunscreen use may lead to vitamin D deficiency.

Objectives

To investigate the relation between the amount of sunscreen applied and the vitamin D serum level in humans after UVB exposure under controlled conditions.

Methods

Thirty-seven healthy volunteers with fair skin types were randomized to receive an inorganic sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) 8 of 0 mg cm(-2), 0.5 mg cm(-2), 1 mg cm(-2), 1.5 mg cm(-2), or 2 mg cm(-2) thickness on the upper body, approximately 25% of the body area. Participants were irradiated with a fixed UVB dose of 3 standard erythema doses 20 min after sunscreen application. This procedure was repeated four times with a 2- to 3-day interval. Blood samples were drawn before the first irradiation and 3 days after the last to determine the serum vitamin D level expressed as 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) [25(OH)D].

Results

The vitamin D serum level increased in an exponential manner with decreasing thickness of sunscreen layer in response to UVB exposure. For all thicknesses of sunscreen, the level of 25(OH)D increased significantly after irradiation (P < 0.05), except for the group treated with 2 mg cm(-2), in which the increase in 25(OH)D was not statistically significant (P = 0.16).

Conclusions

Vitamin D production increases exponentially when thinner sunscreen layers than recommended are applied (< 2 mg cm(-2)). When the amount of sunscreen and SPF advised by the World Health Organization are used, vitamin D production may be abolished. Re-evaluation of sun-protection strategies could be warranted.

### Rationale for sunscreen development [^114iwmm8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The risks associated with cumulative or overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation are now well identified. They involve both UVB (290–320 nm) and UVA (320–400 nm) components. UVB radiation is still considered to be the major factor responsible for most harmful effects of solar exposure. But the detrimental role of UVA has been increasingly documented. As a result, the development of a new generation of sunscreens that provide effective protection throughout the whole UV radiation spectrum has become a prime concern and a major issue. These full-spectrum protections must be carefully designed by selecting UV filters with highly reliable stability to ensure optimal safety and efficiency during the entire period of sun exposure. For this purpose, extensive research on the photochemical behavior of various classes of UV filters has been carried out. This has led to the discovery of safe systems that prevent sun-induced degradation of potent UVA filters and to the development of new UVA filters with a high photostability.

### Development of a sun protection factor for contact lenses (CL-SPF) [^116bV6Sy]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

To be comparable with the approach taken to generate SPF for sunscreens, it is proposed that the original skin-based SPF bands are retained, which separates CLs into three categories:

CL-SPF with no UV blocker = 1.0–2.0 — equivalent to using no sunscreen.

CL-SPF equivalent to Class 2 UV blocker = 12.2–24.8 — equivalent to sunscreen SPF 15, taken as the level used by many adults in moderately sunny conditions.

CL-SPF equivalent to Class 1 UV blocker = 59.6–66.2 — equivalent to sunscreen 50+ (adopted as a labelling restriction maximum by the European Union and Australia, as well as being proposed by the Food and Drug Administration), generally applied to children and people with fair skin.

In conclusion, this study provides a CL-SPF quantification technique for CLs which differentiates between no UV blocker, Class 1 and Class 2 UV blocking and uses classifications known and accepted by consumers. While ocular cells seem to have a similar (relative damage profile to the skin, they seem to be more susceptible to UV damage, making a higher CL-SPF even more critical. Further investigations are needed to determine whether there are potential differences between a cellular culture model compared with in vivo measurement. However, the present study shows that CL-SPF is a viable metric to communicate the protection from the transmission of UV that some CLs offer wearers.

Sunscreen Spectrum Homeostasis

Sunscreens are used to provide 'adequate' protection against the damage induced by EMR. Current sunscreens, based on combinations of filters, are able to block almost all the UVR spectral range, nearly as efficiently as protection by clothing (Fig. 3). Protection against VL can be provided by compact powders, which are added in blemish balm or color-correcting creams (Fig. 4). However, what about IR? No standardized tests provide a basis for the claims made for some products. Solar protection should not impede the beneficial functional skin responses, which result from EMR and skin interactions. The advent of the concept of skin homeostasis calls, therefore, for the development of sunscreens ensuring uniform spectral absorbance across the UV and global solar spectrum (Fig. 4). The recognition that the addition of VL and IRA to the regular solar-simulated radiation (SSR) used in sun protection factor (SPF) testing may influence the minimal erythema dose and SPF results further emphasizes the importance of global spectrum protection.

Protection profile of optimal daily UVR protection versus other day creams or sunscreens (all SPF 15), with various UVA1-PF, corresponding to various CW. Red line: day cream focused on UVB protection; yellow line: sunscreen with CW 360 nm; purple line: sunscreen with CW 370 nm; light blue line: optimal daily UV protection CW 380 nm; dark blue line: ideal sunscreen profile (protection by clothing and garments). Numbers in boxes stand for UVA1-PF. Logos stand for various UVA standards depending on countries [US FDA: US standards (CW = 370 nm only); EU: Europe (CW ≥ 370 nm and UVA-PF:SPF ratio > 0.33); AUS: transmission < 10% (320–360 nm); UK: United Kingdom (CW ≥ 370 nm and Boots 5-star rating UVA/UVB ≥ 0.9)].

The skin-damaging effects of the UV part of solar radiation are well known and therefore are a focus of photobiological research. However, UVR is only a small part of the solar radiation flux that reaches the earth's surface. In this issue, Liebel et al. shed light on the biological effects of visible solar radiation on human skin.
