## Question

Treatment of sensorineural hearing loss

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing sudden sensorineural hearing loss from chronic or progressive SNHL. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and timing. Next, I will examine first-line therapies for sudden cases, including steroids and hyperbaric oxygen, and their evidence. After that, I need to check salvage strategies and rehabilitation. Then, I will consider chronic SNHL management with amplification and cochlear implants. Finally, I should review emerging therapies, special populations, and synthesize a practical algorithm with shared decision-making and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical categories because treatment hinges on this distinction. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is typically defined as a 30 dB or greater drop in at least three contiguous frequencies within 72 hours, and most cases are idiopathic, whereas chronic or progressive SNHL includes age-related, noise-induced, genetic, and other non-acute etiologies, which are managed differently and often require rehabilitation rather than acute medical therapy [^113YDpA5] [^112oREWC].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is correct before discussing treatment. For suspected SSNHL, I should distinguish SNHL from conductive loss at the bedside and confirm with audiometry as soon as possible, ideally within 14 days, while avoiding routine head CT and routine labs; I should also evaluate for retrocochlear pathology with MRI or ABR and document baseline hearing to quantify recovery, because this shapes both acute management and salvage decisions [^111VjD1k] [^1122s78U] [^112xiXre].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about steroids; I should verify the strength of evidence. The highest-quality randomized trial shows intratympanic methylprednisolone is noninferior to oral prednisone for primary treatment of idiopathic SSNHL, with mean PTA gains around 30 dB in both arms at 2 months, supporting either route as acceptable first-line therapy within about 2 weeks of onset [^111GUaQd] [^113P4DyD]. But wait, what if I'm overstating certainty? The Cochrane review concludes that intratympanic steroids may have little to no advantage over systemic steroids as primary therapy, and combined therapy shows only small, uncertain benefits, so I should frame this as an option with shared decision-making rather than a mandate [^112G3C3F] [^11571GAC].

> Next, I should review hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Meta-analyses suggest that adding HBOT to standard medical therapy improves odds of complete or any hearing recovery, with larger effects in severe baseline loss and when used as salvage; however, evidence quality varies and access can be limited, so I should present HBOT as a reasonable adjunct within 2 weeks for initial therapy or within 1 month as salvage, acknowledging uncertainty and the need for standardized protocols [^112joU8h] [^114uxCP6] [^116DcUoV].

> I will now examine salvage therapy for incomplete recovery. Intratympanic steroids are recommended as salvage 2 to 6 weeks after onset, and observational data suggest a meaningful proportion may benefit; importantly, I should confirm that patients understand the local risks such as tympanic membrane perforation, pain, and dizziness, and that we use consistent outcome definitions to judge recovery [^112mKSKW] [^1177F8FD] [^112xiXre].

> Let me consider chronic or non-sudden SNHL, because this is where rehabilitation dominates. For mild to moderate losses, hearing aids are first-line; for severe to profound losses, cochlear implantation is the standard of care, with candidacy expanding to include single-sided deafness and asymmetric losses in selected patients, and pediatric pathways emphasizing early intervention for language development [^117BcMZG] [^112V4nYu] [^1134gFNj].

> But wait, what about emerging therapies; I should double-check the status. Gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotides, and regenerative approaches are in early clinical or preclinical stages, with a recent phase I/IIa trial of an intratympanic gamma-secretase inhibitor signaling feasibility and safety, yet no pharmacologic therapy is FDA-approved for SNHL, so these remain investigational and should not replace standard care outside trials [^112RMzar] [^111GYkiV] [^115JDcgf].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed. In children with SSNHL, evidence is limited and adult protocols are often extrapolated; given the critical period for language, urgent audiometry and empiric steroids are reasonable, with close follow-up and early rehabilitation if recovery is incomplete. In patients exposed to radiation or teprotumumab, cochlear injury mechanisms differ and steroids may be ineffective, so early consideration of hearing aids or implants and disease-specific strategies is prudent [^112C3Jqb] [^114vzhyi] [^116ZHc7k].

> Next, I should review a practical, time-sensitive algorithm and confirm alignment with guidelines. Within 0 to 2 weeks of SSNHL onset, offer systemic or intratympanic steroids and consider HBOT; between 2 and 6 weeks, offer intratympanic salvage; beyond 6 weeks, pivot to rehabilitation and consider cochlear implant candidacy if criteria are met, with MRI-based retrocochlear evaluation and structured follow-up audiometry to document outcomes and guide next steps [^112i7Fz6] [^111VjD1k] [^116nD5yV].

> I should confirm the role of shared decision-making and counseling. Patients should be educated about the natural history of SSNHL, the possibility of spontaneous recovery, the uncertain magnitude of treatment benefit, and the risks and logistics of steroids, intratympanic injections, and HBOT; this is a strong recommendation in the guideline and helps align choices with patient values and comorbidities [^114hJQXE] [^114GZ1mE].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and quality metrics are explicit. Obtain audiometry at the conclusion of treatment and again within 6 months to detect delayed recovery or progression, counsel on rehabilitation options for residual deficits, and track delays in presentation, diagnosis, and treatment because system delays worsen outcomes; these steps are supported by the guideline and quality-indicator frameworks derived from it [^116nD5yV] [^115uT16F] [^113dDgWM].

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is managed with a **stepwise approach** based on severity and etiology. For sudden SNHL, **prompt systemic corticosteroids** within 2 weeks [^113fkLNL] is first-line, with intratympanic steroids as salvage if recovery is incomplete [^112mKSKW]; hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an adjunct in select cases [^112wpQuY] [^112joU8h]. For chronic SNHL, **hearing aids** are first-line for mild-to-moderate loss [^117BcMZG], while cochlear implants are indicated for severe-to-profound loss or when aids are insufficient [^112V4nYu]. Emerging therapies such as gene therapy [^112RMzar] and regenerative drugs are under investigation but are not yet standard care [^111GYkiV]. Management should be individualized, with shared decision-making and follow-up audiometry to track outcomes [^114hJQXE] [^116nD5yV].

## Acute sensorineural hearing loss

### Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL)

SSNHL is an **otologic emergency** defined as a ≥ 30 dB sensorineural loss in three contiguous frequencies within 72 hours [^113YDpA5]. Early intervention improves outcomes [^111LLmK3].

---

#### Initial evaluation

- **Confirm SNHL**: Distinguish from conductive loss with exam and audiometry within 14 days [^111VjD1k] [^1122s78U].
- **Exclude retrocochlear pathology**: MRI or ABR if indicated [^111VjD1k] [^1122s78U].
- **Avoid routine CT/labs**: Do not order routine head CT or labs unless clinically indicated [^1122s78U] [^116pBiNg].

---

#### Medical management

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: First-line within 2 weeks; prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg) for 7–14 days with taper [^113fkLNL] [^1163dBDE].
- **Intratympanic steroids**: Salvage therapy 2–6 weeks after onset if incomplete recovery [^112mKSKW] [^1166JvBr].
- **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)**: Adjunct within 2 weeks, especially for severe/profound loss or salvage [^112wpQuY] [^112joU8h].

---

#### Prognosis

Approximately **two-thirds recover spontaneously**; early steroids improve recovery odds [^112oREWC] [^113P4DyD].

---

## Chronic sensorineural hearing loss

### Non-surgical management

- **Hearing aids**: First-line for mild-to-moderate loss; improve communication and quality of life [^117BcMZG] [^112AkgZe].
- **Assistive listening devices**: FM systems, captioned phones, and loop systems enhance function.
- **Auditory rehabilitation**: Counseling and communication strategies support adaptation [^111nPgcT].

---

### Surgical management

Cochlear implants are indicated for **severe-to-profound SNHL** or when hearing aids are insufficient; candidacy depends on residual hearing, speech recognition, and medical suitability [^112V4nYu]. Bone-anchored hearing systems are options for conductive/mixed loss or single-sided deafness when conventional aids are unsuitable [^111qwRJg].

---

## Emerging therapies

- **Gene therapy**: Preclinical and early clinical trials target genetic SNHL; not yet standard care [^112RMzar] [^111GYkiV].
- **Regenerative medicine**: Stem cell and hair cell regeneration research is ongoing [^115JDcgf].
- **Pharmacologic agents**: Investigational drugs targeting oxidative stress and cell death pathways are in trials [^114jW5PX].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric SNHL**: Early identification and intervention are critical; cochlear implants are standard for severe-to-profound loss [^1171hKta].
- **Autoimmune SNHL**: High-dose steroids and immunosuppressive therapy may be indicated [^115dZAZd].
- **Noise-induced SNHL**: Prevention and hearing conservation are key; management follows standard rehabilitation [^115xLdkQ].

---

## Follow-up and rehabilitation

Follow-up audiometry should be performed at the **conclusion of treatment and within 6 months** to assess outcomes and guide rehabilitation [^116nD5yV] [^1118sMYX]. Audiologic rehabilitation, including amplification and counseling, is recommended for residual hearing loss or tinnitus [^111nPgcT] [^113XZGwG].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Severity/etiology** | **First-line treatment** | **Second-line/salvage** | **Rehabilitation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Sudden SNHL | Systemic steroids within 2 weeks | Intratympanic steroids; HBOT | Audiometry; rehabilitation |
| Mild-to-moderate chronic SNHL | Hearing aids | Assistive devices | Auditory rehabilitation |
| Severe-to-profound SNHL | Cochlear implants | Bone-anchored systems | Audiologic rehabilitation |

---

Treatment of SNHL is **multidisciplinary and individualized**, combining acute medical therapy, amplification, and surgical options, with emerging therapies on the horizon. Early diagnosis, evidence-based intervention, and rehabilitation optimize outcomes and quality of life.

Objective

To critically review and evaluate the proposed mechanisms and documented results of the therapeutics currently in active clinical drug trials for the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss.

Data Sources

US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Trials registry, MEDLINE/PubMed.

Study Selection & Data Extraction

A review of the NIH Clinical Trials registry identified candidate hearing loss therapies, and supporting publications were acquired from MEDLINE/PubMed. Proof-of-concept, therapeutic mechanisms, and clinical outcomes were critically appraised.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-two active clinical drug trials registered in the United States were identified, and six potentially therapeutic molecules were reviewed. Of the six molecules reviewed, four comprised mechanisms pertaining to mitigating oxidative stress pathways that presumably lead to inner ear cell death. One remaining therapy sought to manipulate the cell death cascade, and the last remaining therapy was a novel cell replacement therapy approach to introduce a transcription factor that promotes hair cell regeneration.

Conclusion

A common theme in recent clinical trials registered in the United States appears to be the targeting of cell death pathways and influence of oxidant stressors on cochlear sensory neuroepithelium. In addition, a virus-delivered cell replacement therapy would be the first of its kind should it prove safe and efficacious. Significant challenges for bringing these bench-to-bedside therapies to market remain. It is never assured that results in non-human animal models translate to effective therapies in the setting of human biology. Moreover, as additional processes are described in association with hearing loss, such as an immune response and loss of synaptic contacts, additional pathways for targeting become available.

### Oral vs intratympanic corticosteroid therapy for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss… [^113P4DyD]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

All subgroup analyses used 95% confidence intervals. Several subgroups show a 95% upper confidence interval that exceeds the 10 dB noninferiority margin, indicating inferiority of intratympanic to oral is not rejected. Conversely, point estimates below the 0 dB suggest a trend for intratympanic treatment to be better than oral treatment. PTA indicates pure tone average. Intervention One hundred twenty-one patients received either 60 mg/d of oral prednisone for 14 days with a 5-day taper and 129 patients received 4 doses over 14 days of 40 mg/mL of methylprednisolone injected into the middle ear. Main Outcome Measures Primary end point was change in hearing at 2 months after treatment. Noninferiority was defined as less than a 10-dB difference in hearing outcome between treatments. Results In the oral prednisone group, PTA improved by 30.

7 dB compared with a
28. 7-dB improvement in the intratympanic treatment group. Mean pure tone average at 2 months was 56. 0 for the oral steroid treatment group and
57. 6 dB for the intratympanic treatment group. Recovery of hearing on oral treatment at 2 months by intention-to-treat analysis was 2. 0 dB greater than intratympanic treatment. Per-protocol analysis confirmed the intention-to-treat result. Thus, the hypothesis of inferiority of intratympanic methylprednisolone to oral prednisone for primary treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss was rejected. Conclusion Among patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, hearing level 2 months after treatment showed that intratympanic treatment was not inferior to oral prednisone treatment. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00097448.

The current standard treatment for idiopathic hearing loss is a tapering course of oral corticosteroid. This practice is based on a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oral steroid therapy in 67 patients that showed significantly higher rates of improvement in the steroid-treated group. 12 In this study, hearing recovery was seen in 32% of participants in the placebo group and in 61% of the steroid-treated group. The large effect size observed with this treatment led to its rapid and widespread adoption. In a subsequent large retrospective study of 266 patients also treated with oral corticosteroids, 13 improvement was observed in 46% of the entire study population and in 55% of patients presenting with a hearing threshold of 60 dB or worse. For this subset with moderate to severe hearing loss, a large effect size was observed. The steroid-treated group showed a mean 28.

0 dB threshold improvement compared with the 22 untreated patients presenting with comparable hearing levels who had a mean improvement of
12. 9 dB. Over the last 15 years, intratympanic corticosteroid treatment by direct injection into the middle ear has gained wide popularity. One theoretical advantage of intratympanic treatment is an increased drug concentration at the target organ. Pharmacokinetic studies in the guinea pig model have shown substantially increased concentration of corticosteroids administered intratympanically compared with systemic administration. 14, 15 However, no adequately powered prospective randomized controlled trial has compared oral and intratympanic steroid treatments to demonstrate that increased local drug concentration leads to improved hearing outcome. In fact, uncontrolled case series have reported intratympanic success rates similar to those reported for oral therapy. One retrospective case series of 26 intratympanically treated patients showed a 27.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^111ZAz6N]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Guideline scope and purpose — this multidisciplinary update provides evidence-based recommendations for evaluating sudden hearing loss (SHL), with emphasis on sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), and is intended for clinicians who diagnose and manage adults aged ≥ 18 years in any setting. Initial recommendations address distinguishing sensorineural from conductive hearing loss (CHL) at the time of presentation, including the use of tuning forks, and the purpose is not to present an exhaustive approach to managing CHL. The recommendations are not intended to represent the standard of care or to limit treatment for individual patients, and the guideline is not intended to replace individualized patient care or clinical judgment. This is a multidisciplinary and interprofessional update that will provide evidence-based recommendations based on multidisciplinary consensus and careful consideration of benefits versus harms, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease inappropriate variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^1122s78U]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sudden hearing loss is a frightening symptom that often prompts an urgent or emergent visit to a health care provider. It is frequently but not universally accompanied by tinnitus and/or vertigo. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss affects 5 to 27 per 100,000 people annually, with about 66,000 new cases per year in the United States. This guideline update provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients who present with sudden hearing loss. It focuses on sudden sensorineural hearing loss in adult patients aged ≥ 18 years and primarily on those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Prompt recognition and management of sudden sensorineural hearing loss may improve hearing recovery and patient quality of life. The guideline update is intended for all clinicians who diagnose or manage adult patients who present with sudden hearing loss.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline update is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations in evaluating patients with sudden hearing loss and sudden sensorineural hearing loss, with particular emphasis on managing idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The guideline update group recognized that patients enter the health care system with sudden hearing loss as a nonspecific primary complaint. Therefore, the initial recommendations of this guideline update address distinguishing sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss at the time of presentation with hearing loss. They also clarify the need to identify rare, nonidiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to help separate those patients from those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, who are the target population for the therapeutic interventions that make up the bulk of the guideline update. By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, this guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

Methods

Consistent with the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's "Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual, Third Edition" (Rosenfeld et al. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2013;148[1]:S1-S55), the guideline update group was convened with representation from the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, otology, neurotology, family medicine, audiology, emergency medicine, neurology, radiology, advanced practice nursing, and consumer advocacy. A systematic review of the literature was performed, and the prior clinical practice guideline on sudden hearing loss was reviewed in detail. Key Action Statements (KASs) were updated with new literature, and evidence profiles were brought up to the current standard. Research needs identified in the original clinical practice guideline and data addressing them were reviewed. Current research needs were identified and delineated.

Results

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following: (KAS 1) Clinicians should distinguish sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss when a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss. (KAS 7) Clinicians should educate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss about the natural history of the condition, the benefits and risks of medical interventions, and the limitations of existing evidence regarding efficacy. (KAS 13) Clinicians should counsel patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus about the possible benefits of audiologic rehabilitation and other supportive measures. These strong recommendations were modified from the initial clinical practice guideline for clarity and timing of intervention. The guideline update group made strong recommendations against the following: (KAS 3) Clinicians should < u > not < /u > order routine computed tomography of the head in the initial evaluation of a patient with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 5) Clinicians should < u > not < /u > obtain routine laboratory tests in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 11) Clinicians should < u > not < /u > routinely prescribe antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, or vasoactive substances to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following: (KAS 2) Clinicians should assess patients with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss through history and physical examination for bilateral sudden hearing loss, recurrent episodes of sudden hearing loss, and/or focal neurologic findings. (KAS 4) In patients with sudden hearing loss, clinicians should obtain, or refer to a clinician who can obtain, audiometry as soon as possible (within 14 days of symptom onset) to confirm the diagnosis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 6) Clinicians should evaluate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss for retrocochlear pathology by obtaining magnetic resonance imaging or auditory brainstem response. (KAS 10) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, intratympanic steroid therapy when patients have incomplete recovery from sudden sensorineural hearing loss 2 to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. (KAS 12) Clinicians should obtain follow-up audiometric evaluation for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss at the conclusion of treatment and within 6 months of completion of treatment. These recommendations were clarified in terms of timing of intervention and audiometry and method of retrocochlear workup. The guideline update group offered the following KASs as options: (KAS 8) Clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss within 2 weeks of symptom onset. (KAS 9a) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy within 2 weeks of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 9b) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy as salvage therapy within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporation of new evidence profiles to include quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, and differences of opinion Included 10 clinical practice guidelines, 29 new systematic reviews, and 36 new randomized controlled trials Highlights the urgency of evaluation and initiation of treatment, if treatment is offered, by emphasizing the time from symptom occurrence Clarification of terminology by changing potentially unclear statements; use of the term sudden sensorineural hearing loss to mean idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to emphasize that > 90% of sudden sensorineural hearing loss is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and to avoid confusion in nomenclature for the reader Changes to the KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1-When a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss, conductive hearing loss should be distinguished from sensorineural. KAS 2-The utility of history and physical examination when assessing for modifying factors is emphasized. KAS 3-The word "routine" is added to clarify that this statement addresses nontargeted head computerized tomography scan that is often ordered in the emergency room setting for patients presenting with sudden hearing loss. It does not refer to targeted scans, such as temporal bone computerized tomography scan, to assess for temporal bone pathology. KAS 4-The importance of audiometric confirmation of hearing status as soon as possible and within 14 days of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 5-New studies were added to confirm the lack of benefit of nontargeted laboratory testing in sudden sensorineural hearing loss. KAS 6-Audiometric follow-up is excluded as a reasonable workup for retrocochlear pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scan if magnetic resonance imaging cannot be done, and, secondarily, auditory brainstem response evaluation are the modalities recommended. A time frame for such testing is not specified, nor is it specified which clinician should be ordering this workup; however, it is implied that it would be the general or subspecialty otolaryngologist. KAS 7-The importance of shared decision making is highlighted, and salient points are emphasized. KAS 8-The option for corticosteroid intervention within 2 weeks of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 9-Changed to KAS 9A and 9B. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy remains an option but only when combined with steroid therapy for either initial treatment (9A) or salvage therapy (9B). The timing of initial therapy is within 2 weeks of onset, and that of salvage therapy is within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. KAS 10-Intratympanic steroid therapy for salvage is recommended within 2 to 6 weeks following onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The time to treatment is defined and emphasized. KAS 11-Antioxidants were removed from the list of interventions that the clinical practice guideline recommends against using. KAS 12-Follow-up audiometry at conclusion of treatment and also within 6 months posttreatment is added. KAS 13-This statement on audiologic rehabilitation includes patients who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus who may benefit from treatment. Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs Enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making with tools provided to assist in same.

Incorporation of new evidence profiles to include quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, and differences of opinion Included 10 clinical practice guidelines, 29 new systematic reviews, and 36 new randomized controlled trials Highlights the urgency of evaluation and initiation of treatment, if treatment is offered, by emphasizing the time from symptom occurrence Clarification of terminology by changing potentially unclear statements; use of the term sudden sensorineural hearing loss to mean idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to emphasize that over 90% of sudden sensorineural hearing loss is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and to avoid confusion in nomenclature for the reader Changes to the key action statements (KASs) from the original guideline: KAS 1: When a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss, conductive hearing loss should be distinguished from sensorineural. KAS 2: The utility of history and physical examination when assessing for modifying factors is emphasized. KAS 3: The word routine is added to clarify that this statement addresses a nontargeted head computed tomography scan that is often ordered in the emergency room setting for patients presenting with sudden hearing loss. It does not refer to targeted scans such as a temporal bone computed tomography scan to assess for temporal bone pathology. KAS 4: The importance of audiometric confirmation of hearing status as soon as possible and within 14 days of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 5: New studies were added to confirm the lack of benefit of nontargeted laboratory testing in sudden sensorineural hearing loss. KAS 6: Audiometric follow-up is excluded as a reasonable workup for retrocochlear pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography scan if magnetic resonance imaging cannot be done, or, secondarily, auditory brainstem response evaluation are the modalities recommended. A time frame for such testing is not specified, nor is it specified which clinician should be ordering this workup; however, it is implied that it would be the general or subspecialty otolaryngologist. KAS 7: The importance of shared decision making is highlighted, and salient points are emphasized. KAS 8: The option for corticosteroid intervention within 2 weeks of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 9: Changed to KAS 9a and 9b; hyperbaric oxygen therapy remains an option but only when combined with steroid therapy for either initial treatment (9a) or for salvage therapy (9b). The timing is within 2 weeks of onset for initial therapy and within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss for salvage therapy. KAS 10: Intratympanic steroid therapy for salvage is recommended within 2 to 6 weeks following onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The time to treatment is defined and emphasized. KAS 11: Antioxidants were removed from the list of interventions that the clinical practice guideline recommends against using. KAS 12: Follow-up audiometry at conclusion of treatment and also within 6 months posttreatment is added. KAS 13: This statement on audiologic rehabilitation includes patients who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus who may benefit from treatment. Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs Enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making with tools provided to assist in the same.

### Sudden hearing loss [^114EVcZf]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a medical emergency in search of an appropriate treatment. Almost all aspects of this disease process are disputed in the literature. The natural course of the disease process has not been well defined, although spontaneous recovery in a percentage of patients appears well accepted. Little scientific data exist to develop an evidence-based treatment protocol. The more common elements of treatment in the United States include oral steroid therapy, transtympanic steroid therapy, and potentially oral antiviral therapy. Other therapies are used with great frequency, and their potential should not be discounted.

Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in developed societies. Hearing impairment in children, particularly of prelingual onset, has been shown to negatively affect educational achievement, future employment and earnings, and even life expectancy. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), which refers to defects within the cochlea or auditory nerve itself, far outweighs conductive causes for permanent hearing loss in both children and adults. The causes of SNHL in children are heterogeneous, including both congenital and acquired causes. This article identifies potential mechanisms of intervention both at the level of the hair cell and the spiral ganglion neurons.

### New treatment options for hearing loss [^115JDcgf]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2015). Medium credibility.

Hearing loss is the most common form of sensory impairment in humans and affects more than 40 million people in the United States alone. No drug-based therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and treatment mostly relies on devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants. Over recent years, more than 100 genetic loci have been linked to hearing loss and many of the affected genes have been identified. This understanding of the genetic pathways that regulate auditory function has revealed new targets for pharmacological treatment of the disease. Moreover, approaches that are based on stem cells and gene therapy, which may have the potential to restore or maintain auditory function, are beginning to emerge.

### Treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss… [^114rrGBk]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

A total of 21 RCTs were identified regarding various treatments, including systemic and intratympanic steroids; antiviral and hemodilution agents; mineral, vitamin, and herbal preparations; batroxobin; carbogen; and hyperbaric oxygen. All studies used audiometric outcome measures. Only 2 studies used identical criteria to define SSHL. The method of randomization was described in 2 studies. Validity scores ranged from 2 to 8. Positive results were reported favoring systemic steroids, intratympanic steroids, batroxobin, magnesium, vitamin E, and hyperbaric oxygen, although there were serious limitations in each study with a positive finding. There was no difference in audiometric outcomes reported across all studies of antiviral and hemodilution agents and no difference in one study of systemic steroids vs placebo. Conclusions To our knowledge, no valid RCT exists to determine effective treatment of SSHL.

Systemic steroids cannot be considered the gold standard of treatment of SSHL, given the severe limitations of the landmark study supporting their use. Treatment of SSHL is widely variable and often regionally specific. Treatment regimens, administered on either an inpatient or outpatient basis, have included antiviral agents; hemodilution agents; mineral, vitamin, and herbal preparations; batroxobin; carbogen; and hyperbaric oxygen. 2–5 In addition, some otolaryngologists choose not to treat SSHL at all, citing spontaneous recovery rates of 32% to 70%. 6, 7 However, the most common approach to treatment of SSHL in North America is with systemic steroids, which has been deemed by some authors to be the gold standard of treatment.
3. Cinamon and colleagues16 administered prednisone, 1 mg/kg daily, to 11 treatment subjects and measured PTA, speech frequency, high-tone hearing levels, and discrimination scores at 6 days and 14 to 90 days after treatment.

Patients were categorized into "improvement" and "no improvement" groups with respect to average hearing level, average speech frequency, and average high-tone hearing level; however, categorical improvement of discrimination scores was not reported. They reported no significant differences between steroids and placebo on all outcome measures.
16. Tucci and colleagues17 administered valacyclovir, 1 g 3 times daily for 10 days, and tapering doses of prednisone for 12 days, to 39 patients. Twenty-nine control patients received the same course of prednisone plus placebo. Pure-tone average and speech discrimination scores were measured at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after treatment. Westerlaken et al19 treated 37 patients with acyclovir, 10 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 days, and tapering doses of prednisolone for 7 days. Thirty-three control group patients were treated with prednisolone alone.

Outcomes measured at 12 months after treatment included PTA, as well as subjective presence of pressure, vertigo, and tinnitus. Patients with any lesser degree of hearing loss at 12 months after treatment compared with baseline were considered to have shown "recovery. " There were no statistically significant differences reported. Uri and colleagues20 treated 29 patients with acyclovir, 15 mg/kg per day, and hydrocortisone, 100 mg 3 times daily for 7 days, plus a tapering dose of hydrocortisone for an additional 7 days. They also administered hydrocortisone only to 31 control group patients. To determine whether steroid treatment might constitute the gold standard in the treatment of SSHL, all studies that compared steroid therapy with any other active treatment were reviewed. Two studies were identified. Active treatments of carbogen inhalation16 and fibrinolysis21 were compared with treatment with steroids alone.

### Toward personalized diagnosis and therapy for hearing loss: insights from cochlear implants [^115joSGG]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common sensory deficit, disabling nearly half a billion people worldwide. The cochlear implant (CI) has transformed the treatment of patients with SNHL, having restored hearing to more than 800,000 people. The success of CIs has inspired multidisciplinary efforts to address the unmet need for personalized, cellular-level diagnosis, and treatment of patients with SNHL. Current limitations include an inability to safely and accurately image at high resolution and biopsy the inner ear, precluding the use of key structural and molecular information during diagnostic and treatment decisions. Furthermore, there remains a lack of pharmacological therapies for hearing loss, which can partially be attributed to challenges associated with new drug development. We highlight advances in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for SNHL that will help accelerate the push toward precision medicine. In addition, we discuss technological improvements for the CI that will further enhance its functionality for future patients. This report highlights work that was originally presented by Dr. Stankovic as part of the Dr. John Niparko Memorial Lecture during the 2021 American Cochlear Implant Alliance annual meeting.

### Intratympanic vs systemic corticosteroids in first-line treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113JXUvu]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

To our knowledge, evidence-based recommendations on the intratympanic vs systemic administration of corticosteroids for the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss remain unestablished, and contradictory conclusions have been reported in previous meta-analyses.

Objective

To compare recovery from idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss based on systemic, intratympanic, or a combined treatment with corticosteroids as first-line treatment.

Data Sources

We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase, OvidSP, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from January 1, 1966, to July 1, 2018. This study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42018109314).

Study Selection

We included randomized studies. Included studies must have excluded identifiable causes. Corticosteroids must have been administered solitarily. We excluded studies that did not define hearing loss as a minimum 30 dB within 72 hours.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We identified 170 titles, of which 56 (32.9%) were eligible for full-text screening. We independently extracted data. We applied a fixed-effects model to investigate our objectives.

Main Outcomes and Measure

We aimed to (1) estimate the difference in mean pure tone average (PTA) gain in decibels from intratympanic treatment vs systemic treatment and (2) investigate odds ratios for recovery between the different treatment groups.

Results

We included 7 eligible studies. A total of 710 patients were allocated to receive either intratympanic treatment (IT group, 235 [33%]), systemic treatment (ST group; 325 [46%]) or combined intratympanic and systemic treatment (CB group; 150 [21%]). The PTA was measured by taking the mean of 4 frequencies: 4 studies measured at 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz and 3 studies measured at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The ST group had a 2.01-dB higher PTA gain (95% CI, -5.61 dB to 1.59 dB; P = 0.96; I2 = 0%) compared with the IT group and the odds for achieving complete recovery was not significantly different at an odds ratio of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.44; P = 0.19; I2 = 34.5%). For the CB group vs the ST group, the odds ratio was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.82; P = 0.75; I2 = 0%). The analysis of the CB group vs IT group comprised only 2 studies.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study does not suggest that corticosteroid delivered intratympanically is more beneficial than systemic treatment in the case of moderate to severe idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. There were no indications that combined treatment was associated with improved hearing outcomes compared with either systemic or intratympanic treatment.

### Gene therapy for hearing loss [^112RMzar]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common sensory disorder. Its underlying etiologies include a broad spectrum of genetic and environmental factors that can lead to hearing loss that is congenital or late onset, stable or progressive, drug related, noise induced, age related, traumatic or post-infectious. Habilitation options typically focus on amplification using wearable or implantable devices; however exciting new gene-therapy-based strategies to restore and prevent SNHL are actively under investigation. Recent proof-of-principle studies demonstrate the potential therapeutic potential of molecular agents delivered to the inner ear to ameliorate different types of SNHL. Correcting or preventing underlying genetic forms of hearing loss is poised to become a reality. Herein, we review molecular therapies for hearing loss such as gene replacement, antisense oligonucleotides, RNA interference and CRISPR-based gene editing. We discuss delivery methods, techniques and viral vectors employed for inner ear gene therapy and the advancements in this field that are paving the way for basic science research discoveries to transition to clinical trials.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy vs medical therapy alone for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss… [^112joU8h]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the benefit of the addition of hyperbaric oxygen therapy vs medical therapy alone for sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Findings Results of this meta-analysis including 2401 patients with SSNHL significantly favored HBOT plus standard medical therapy over MT alone for complete hearing recovery and any hearing recovery, as well as for absolute hearing gain. The benefit of HBOT was greater in groups with severe hearing loss at baseline, HBOT as a salvage treatment, and a total HBOT duration of at least 1200 minutes. Meaning The benefit of HBOT for SSNHL may be greater for those who had severe hearing loss at baseline or who failed to recover after MT; optimal criteria for patient selection and a standardized regimen for HBOT should be established in future trials. Importance Sudden sensorineural hearing loss causes substantial disease burden for both individuals and socioeconomic aspects.

The benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in addition to standard medical therapy for idiopathic SSNHL has been unclear. Objective To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare HBOT + MT with MT alone as a treatment for patients with SSNHL. Data Sources PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched up to February 2018. Study Selection Randomized clinical trials and nonrandomized studies comparing HBOT + MT with MT alone for SSNHL treatment. Three randomized clinical trials and 16 nonrandomized studies comparing outcomes after HBOT + MT vs MT alone in 2401 patients with SSNHL were included. The addition of HBOT to standard MT is a reasonable treatment option for SSNHL, particularly for those patients with severe to profound hearing loss at baseline and those who undergo HBOT as a salvage treatment with a prolonged duration.

Optimal criteria for patient selection and a standardized regimen for HBOT should be applied in routine practice, with future trials to investigate maximal treatment benefit. Quiz Ref IDCorticosteroids, antiviral agents, vasodilators, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are the currently available treatment options for SSNHL, but their comparative efficacy is unclear. 1 To date, the most widely used treatment for SSNHL is systemic and/or intratympanic corticosteroids. 1 As another option, HBOT is a treatment that may relieve edema and ischemia by administering high-pressure oxygen into the inner ear to restore hearing. 4 Since the first case report5 of HBOT for SSNHL treatment in the 1960s, a number of randomized clinical trials 6–8 and nonrandomized studies9-24 investigating the benefit of HBOT have been reported. As an adjunctive treatment to standard medical therapy that includes systemic corticosteroids, HBOT has been found to promote hearing gain.

25, 26 However, there is limited evidence that HBOT definitively improves the outcome of SSNHL. 25 Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 studies to compare HBOT + MT with MT alone as a treatment for patients with SSNHL. Studies reporting SSNHL treatment outcomes without comparator or control groups were excluded. Two investigators independently screened titles and abstracts, identified duplicates, reviewed full articles, and determined their eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. The last search was performed in February 2018. The primary outcome was complete hearing recovery, and secondary outcomes were any hearing recovery and absolute hearing gain. In a subgroup analysis for complete hearing recovery, the benefit of the strategy and protocols of HBOT on the outcome was apparent.

### Steroids for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^111Xc18x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 2006 and previously updated in 2009. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is a clinical diagnosis characterised by a sudden deafness of cochlear or retrocochlear origin in the absence of a clear precipitating cause. Steroids are commonly prescribed to treat this condition. There is no consensus on their effectiveness.

Objectives

To determine whether steroids in the treatment of ISSHL a) improve hearing (primary) and b) reduce tinnitus (secondary). To determine the incidence of significant side effects from the medication.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 22 April 2013.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials (with or without blinding) in which steroids were evaluated in comparison with either no treatment or a placebo. We considered trials including the use of steroids in combination with another treatment if the comparison control group also received the same other treatment. The two authors reviewed the full-text articles of all the retrieved trials of possible relevance and applied the inclusion criteria independently.

Data Collection and Analysis

We graded trials for risk of bias using the Cochrane approach. The data extraction was performed in a standardised manner by one author and rechecked by the other author. Where necessary we contacted investigators to obtain the missing information. Meta-analysis was neither possible nor considered appropriate because of the heterogeneity of the populations studied and the differences in steroid formulations, dosages and duration of treatment. We analysed and reported the quality of the results of each study individually. A narrative overview of the results is presented.

Main Results

Only three trials, involving 267 participants, satisfied the inclusion criteria and all three studies were at high risk of bias. One trial showed a lack of effect of oral steroids in improving hearing compared with the placebo control group. The second trial showed a significant improvement of hearing in 61% of the patients receiving oral steroid and in only 32% of the patients from the control group (combination of placebo-treated group and untreated control group). The third trial also showed a lack of effect of oral steroids in improving hearing compared with the placebo control. However, this trial did not follow strict inclusion criteria for participant selection and analysis of data was limited by significant exclusion of participants from the final analysis and lack of participant compliance to the treatment protocol. No clear evidence was presented in two trials about any harmful side effects of the steroids. Only one study declared that no patients suffered from adverse effects of the steroid treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The value of steroids in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss remains unclear since the evidence obtained from randomised controlled trials is contradictory in outcome, in part because the studies are based upon too small a number of patients.

### Radiation-induced sensorineural hearing loss and potential management [^114vzhyi]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The cochlear apparatus is one of the major organs at risk when considering radiation therapy (RT) for brain, head, and neck tumors. Radiation oncologists currently consider mean dose constraints of < 35 Gy for conventionally fractioned radiation therapy (RT), < 4 Gy for single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery, and < 17.1 or 25 Gy for 3- or 5-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery, respectively, as the standard of care. Indeed, dose adjustments are made in the setting of concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy or when prioritizing tumor coverage during treatment planning. Despite guidelines, in many patients, RT to the cochlea may still cause sensorineural hearing loss through progressive degeneration and ossification of the inner ear. There are several audiologic and otolaryngologic interventions for incident RT-induced hearing loss, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, or, in the context of vestibular schwannoma due to neurofibromatosis type 2, auditory brain stem implantation. Cochlear implants are the most effective at restoring hearing and improving quality of life for those with an intact cochlear nerve. An early multidisciplinary approach is essential to optimally manage RT-induced hearing loss, and this topic discussion serves as a guide for radiation oncologists on cochlear dosimetric considerations as well as how to address potential RT-induced adverse effects.

### Sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^112oREWC]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is usually unilateral and can be associated with tinnitus and vertigo. In most cases the cause is not identified, although various infective, vascular, and immune causes have been proposed. A careful examination is needed to exclude life threatening or treatable causes such as vascular events and malignant diseases, and patients should be referred urgently for further assessment. About half of patients completely recover, usually in about 2 weeks. Many treatments are used, including corticosteroids, antiviral drugs, and vasoactive and oxygen-based treatments. Although no treatment is proven, we recommend a short course of oral high-dose corticosteroids. There is much to learn about pathogenesis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and more clinical trials are needed to establish evidence-based management.

### Intratympanic steroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss: a systematic review [^1177F8FD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the evidence for efficacy of intratympanic (IT) steroid treatment for the management of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss through a systematic review of the existing literature.

Data Sources

Online databases consisting of PubMed, Medline, OVID, Google Scholar, Cochrane Review, and collected additional publications cited in bibliographies.

Review Methods

Literature search by both authors with structured criteria to select studies evaluated for systematic review.

Results

The authors identified 176 articles, of which 32 represented studies of initial or salvage intratympanic steroid injections for sudden hearing loss that included 6 randomized trials and only 2 randomized controlled trials. Despite the paucity of well-executed trials, the vast majority of studies of intratympanic steroids for salvage treatment in all tiers demonstrated a benefit of intratympanic steroid therapy. A limited meta-analysis of the higher quality studies revealed a mean difference in improvement of 13.3 dB (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.7–18.9; P < .0001). Although statistically significant, it is still unclear if this difference is clinically significant. Initial intratympanic therapy was equivalent to standard therapy in the existing literature of all qualities.

Conclusion

Intratympanic steroid treatment as primary treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss appears equivalent to treatment with high-dose oral prednisone therapy. As salvage therapy, intratympanic steroids offer the potential for some degree of additional hearing recovery, although it remains uncertain if this improvement is clinically significant and what percentage of patients is likely to show benefit.

Quality of the evidence

We largely assessed the certainty of the evidence in this review as low or very low. There was moderate‐certainty evidence for a small number of outcomes, but we identified no high‐certainty evidence. The main reasons for the uncertainty were a serious risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision in the effect estimates ‐ either due to a small number of included participants or few events, or because the wide confidence intervals overlapped the threshold for clinical relevance.

Nearly all the included studies had a small number of participants. This increases the risk that randomisation does not achieve balance across groups for important prognostic characteristics (both known and unknown) that may confound outcome estimates. One such characteristic is the propensity towards spontaneous recovery. This can have a large impact on pooled estimates for hearing threshold, and imbalance across groups may not be detected by a comparison of baseline parameters such as pre‐treatment hearing loss and delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of treatment. It is important, therefore, to make sure that trials have enough participants to achieve a balance across groups for the propensity towards spontaneous recovery, as well as other important prognostic factors. This is supported by meta‐analyses (Liebau 2017; Liebau 2018), which demonstrated (in primary and secondary treatment respectively) that variation in outcome estimates is reduced when there is a larger number of participants.

### Treatment of peripheral sensorineural hearing loss: gene therapy [^113gHJ3C]. Gene Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Noise, chemicals and genetic defects are all common causes of irreversible hearing loss, which at present have no cure. Gene therapy may soon be utilized in both the protection and the treatment of these exogenous and endogenous sources of hearing loss. Gene therapy technology is rapidly developing and the inner ear is a particularly feasible model for gene therapy. This review outlines our current understanding of the mechanisms behind deafness and prospects for treatment, discusses the inner ear model in detail and reviews the efforts that have been made in inner ear gene therapy. Finally, the proposed next steps will be discussed. The viral mediated delivery of neurotrophins and antioxidants offers imminent promise in preventing and treating exogenous hearing loss and improving cochlear implant therapy.

The action statement profile reports aggregate evidence quality as Grade B based on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, and lists benefits as avoidance of unnecessary treatment, avoidance of adverse events from unnecessary treatment, and cost saving, with risks, harms, and costs noted as none and a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of harm over benefit. The guideline highlights a quality improvement opportunity in avoiding ineffective treatments and associated risks, complications, side effects, costs, and potential adverse interactions with effective therapies, and clarifies intentional vagueness: the word "routine" is used because there may be patient-specific indications for ≥ 1 of these therapies that may be reasonable to try on an individualized basis with shared decision making. Supporting text states the purpose is to discourage clinicians from routinely using pharmacologic agents that have potential side effects and no documented efficacy in SSNHL.

### Quality indicators for the diagnosis and management of sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115uT16F]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is an ideal entity for quality indicator (QI) development, providing treatment challenges resulting in variable or substandard care. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery recently updated their SSNHL guidelines. With SSNHL demonstrating a large burden of illness, this study sought to leverage the updated guidelines and develop QIs that support quality improvement initiatives at an individual, institutional, and systems level.

Methods

Candidate indicators (CIs) were extracted from high-quality SSNHL guidelines that were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. Each CI and its supporting evidence were summarized and reviewed by a nine-member expert panel based on validity, reliability, and feasibility of measurement. Final QIs were selected from CIs using the modified RAND Corporation-University of California, Los Angeles appropriateness methodology.

Results

Fifteen CIs were identified after literature review. After the first round of evaluations, the panel agreed on 11 candidate indicators as appropriate QIs with 2 additional CIs suggested for consideration. An expert panel meeting provided a platform to discuss areas of disagreement before final evaluations. The expert panel subsequently agreed upon 11 final QIs as appropriate measures of high-quality care for SSNHL.

Conclusion

The 11 proposed QIs from this study are supported by evidence and expert consensus, facilitating measurement across a wide breadth of quality domains. With the recently updated SSNHL guidelines, and a greater focus on quality improvement opportunities, these QIs may be used by healthcare providers for targeted quality improvement initiatives.

Corticosteroids are standard treatment for a number of inflammatory and immune-mediated inner ear diseases. In recent years there has been growing interest in intratympanic administration of steroids as a means of achieving high inner ear drug concentration and low risk of systemic side effects. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss seems to be the condition with the greatest potential for both study and clinical use of intratympanic steroid treatment. Despite promising preliminary observations, there re-main many unanswered questions about this treatment modality.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for sudden sensorineural hearing loss… [^114uxCP6]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis included 3 prospective randomized controlled trials with a total of 88 participants who received HBOT in intervention groups and 62 participants who received routine treatment in the control groups. The meta-analysis found a significant mean difference in absolute hearing gain and odds ratio for hearing recovery following HBOT, favoring the intervention. Meaning The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that clinicians treating patients with SSNHL should consider including HBOT as part of a combination treatment regimen. Importance Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is an acute, usually unilateral deficit. Systemic and intratympanic steroids are accepted treatments. Although evidence suggests that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be beneficial, it is not widely offered.

Objectives To review and evaluate recent evidence of the association of HBOT with hearing outcomes in SSNHL and to determine if HBOT should be a single or part of a combination treatment regimen. Data Sources Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, CAB, ICTRP, Google Scholar, Clinicaltrials. gov, and ISRCTN databases were searched for randomized controlled trials published in English from January 1, 2000, and April 30, 2020. Three prospective RCTs with a total of 88 participants who received HBOT in the intervention groups and 62 participants who received only medical therapy in the control groups were studied. The intergroup difference in mean absolute hearing gain and the odds ratio of hearing recovery favored HBOT over the control therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance In this systematic review and meta-analysis, HBOT as part of a combination treatment was significantly associated with improved hearing outcomes in patients with SSNHL over control treatments. Trial Registration PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42020193191. Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat SSNHL and can be given systemically. 1, 6 Some clinicians favor IT steroids over systemic administration because the IT route can achieve a higher concentration of steroids at the site of damage and may. avoid systemic absorption. 7 Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is another treatment that may be used to improve outcomes in patients with SSNHL in conjunction with steroids or as salvage therapy. 6 Decreased oxygenation in the tissues of the cochlea is one suggested mechanism for SSNHL; therefore, by increasing oxygen supply to the cochlea, HBOT improves hearing. 8, 9.

A systematic review including 392 patients by Bennett and colleagues10 identified that HBOT increased the chance of any hearing improvement and achieved an absolute improvement in average pure-tone audiometric thresholds but questioned the clinical significance. A more recent systematic review including 2401 patients by Rhee and colleagues11 similarly reported that complete hearing recovery, absolute hearing gain, and any hearing recovery were significantly greater in the HBOT plus medical therapy group compared with the group that received only medical therapy. The present systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the recent literature and focused exclusively on prospective randomized controlled studies, while Rhee and colleagues11 included nonrandomized studies.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^112G3C3F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is common, and defined as a sudden decrease in sensorineural hearing sensitivity of unknown aetiology. Systemic corticosteroids are widely used, however their value remains unclear. Intratympanic injections of corticosteroids have become increasingly common in the treatment of ISSNHL.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intratympanic corticosteroids in people with ISSNHL.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2021, Issue 9); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials (search date 23 September 2021).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with ISSNHL and follow-up of over a week. Intratympanic corticosteroids were given as primary or secondary treatment (after failure of systemic therapy).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, including GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Our primary outcome was change in hearing threshold with pure tone audiometry. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of people whose hearing improved, final hearing threshold, speech audiometry, frequency-specific hearing changes and adverse effects.

Main Results

We included 30 studies, comprising 2133 analysed participants. Some studies had more than two treatment arms and were therefore relevant to several comparisons. Studies investigated intratympanic corticosteroids as either primary (initial) therapy or secondary (rescue) therapy after failure of initial treatment. 1. Intratympanic corticosteroids versus systemic corticosteroids as primary therapy We identified 16 studies (1108 participants). Intratympanic therapy may result in little to no improvement in the change in hearing threshold (mean difference (MD) -5.93 dB better, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.61 to -4.26; 10 studies; 701 participants; low-certainty). We found little to no difference in the proportion of participants whose hearing was improved (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 14 studies; 972 participants; moderate-certainty). Intratympanic therapy may result in little to no difference in the final hearing threshold (MD -3.31 dB, 95% CI -6.16 to -0.47; 7 studies; 516 participants; low-certainty). Intratympanic therapy may increase the number of people who experience vertigo or dizziness (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.54; 1 study; 250 participants; low-certainty) and probably increases the number of people with ear pain (RR 15.68, 95% CI 6.22 to 39.49; 2 studies; 289 participants; moderate-certainty). It also resulted in persistent tympanic membrane perforation (range 0% to 3.9%; 3 studies; 359 participants; very low-certainty), vertigo/dizziness at the time of injection (1% to 21%, 3 studies; 197 participants; very low-certainty) and ear pain at the time of injection (10.5% to 27.1%; 2 studies; 289 participants; low-certainty). 2. Intratympanic plus systemic corticosteroids (combined therapy) versus systemic corticosteroids alone as primary therapy We identified 10 studies (788 participants). Combined therapy may have a small effect on the change in hearing threshold (MD -8.55 dB better, 95% CI -12.48 to -4.61; 6 studies; 435 participants; low-certainty). The evidence is very uncertain as to whether combined therapy changes the proportion of participants whose hearing is improved (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.41; 10 studies; 788 participants; very low-certainty). Combined therapy may result in slightly lower (more favourable) final hearing thresholds but the evidence is very uncertain, and it is not clear whether the change would be important to patients (MD -9.11 dB, 95% CI -16.56 to -1.67; 3 studies; 194 participants; very low-certainty). Some adverse effects only occurred in those who received combined therapy. These included persistent tympanic membrane perforation (range 0% to 5.5%; 5 studies; 474 participants; very low-certainty), vertigo or dizziness at the time of injection (range 0% to 8.1%; 4 studies; 341 participants; very low-certainty) and ear pain at the time of injection (13.5%; 1 study; 73 participants; very low-certainty). 3. Intratympanic corticosteroids versus no treatment or placebo as secondary therapy We identified seven studies (279 participants). Intratympanic therapy may have a small effect on the change in hearing threshold (MD -9.07 dB better, 95% CI -11.47 to -6.66; 7 studies; 280 participants; low-certainty). Intratympanic therapy may result in a much higher proportion of participants whose hearing is improved (RR 5.55, 95% CI 2.89 to 10.68; 6 studies; 232 participants; low-certainty). Intratympanic therapy may result in lower (more favourable) final hearing thresholds (MD -11.09 dB, 95% CI -17.46 to -4.72; 5 studies; 203 participants; low-certainty). Some adverse effects only occurred in those who received intratympanic injection. These included persistent tympanic membrane perforation (range 0% to 4.2%; 5 studies; 185 participants; very low-certainty), vertigo or dizziness at the time of injection (range 6.7% to 33%; 3 studies; 128 participants; very low-certainty) and ear pain at the time of injection (0%; 1 study; 44 participants; very low-certainty). 4. Intratympanic plus systemic corticosteroids (combined therapy) versus systemic corticosteroids alone as secondary therapy We identified one study with 76 participants. Change in hearing threshold was not reported. Combined therapy may result in a higher proportion with hearing improvement, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.55; very low-certainty). Adverse effects were poorly reported with only data for persistent tympanic membrane perforation (rate 8.1%, very low-certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

Most of the evidence in this review is low- or very low-certainty, therefore it is likely that further studies may change our conclusions. For primary therapy, intratympanic corticosteroids may have little or no effect compared with systemic corticosteroids. There may be a slight benefit from combined treatment when compared with systemic treatment alone, but the evidence is uncertain. For secondary therapy, there is low-certainty evidence that intratympanic corticosteroids, when compared to no treatment or placebo, may result in a much higher proportion of participants whose hearing is improved, but may only have a small effect on the change in hearing threshold. It is very uncertain whether there is additional benefit from combined treatment over systemic steroids alone. Although adverse effects were poorly reported, the different risk profiles of intratympanic treatment (including tympanic membrane perforation, pain and dizziness/vertigo) and systemic treatment (for example, blood glucose problems) should be considered when selecting appropriate treatment.

### Sudden sensorineural hearing loss: an autoimmune disease? [^113g3vhK]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review our current knowledge of the pathogenesis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, including viral infection, vascular occlusion and immune system-mediated mechanisms, and to discuss the pathogenesis as it relates to pharmacotherapy.

Systematic Review Methodology

Relevant publications on the pathogenesis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss from 1944 to 2010 were analysed.

Results and Conclusions

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is defined as hearing loss of 30 dB in three sequential frequencies over 3 days or less. It can be an isolated symptom or the presenting symptom of a systemic disease. The aetiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. Detailed investigation typically reveals a specific cause in about 10% of patients. Proposed theories of causation include viral infections, vascular occlusion and immune system-mediated mechanisms. A variety of therapies have been proposed based on the various proposed aetiologies.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^111gL97u]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Differences from prior guideline — scope updates and KAS clarifications: The update included 10 clinical practice guidelines, 29 new systematic reviews, and 36 new randomized controlled trials, and clarified terminology to use the term sudden sensorineural hearing loss to mean idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to emphasize that > 90% of sudden sensorineural hearing loss is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. It highlights the urgency of evaluation and initiation of treatment, if treatment is offered, by emphasizing the time from symptom occurrence. Changes include KAS 1 stating that when a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss, conductive hearing loss should be distinguished from sensorineural; KAS 3 clarifying the word "routine" to address nontargeted head computerized tomography scans and that this does not refer to targeted scans such as temporal bone computerized tomography scan; KAS 4 emphasizing audiometric confirmation as soon as possible and within 14 days of symptom onset; and KAS 6 specifying retrocochlear workup modalities including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scan if magnetic resonance imaging cannot be done, and, secondarily, auditory brainstem response evaluation.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^112i7Fz6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden hearing loss clinical practice guideline algorithm — initial steps for a patient with sudden hearing loss (SHL) are Exclude Conductive Hearing Loss (CHL), Confirm Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL) by Audiogram, and Assess for Retrocochlear Pathology with Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Early directives include Do Not Obtain Routine Head Computed Tomography (CT) and Do Not Prescribe Antibiotics. Time-sensitive care uses onset-based branches: Is Patient Within Two Weeks of Onset of Hearing Loss? If yes, May Offer: Corticosteroids and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT), and Reassess Hearing Within Two to Six Weeks of Onset of Hearing Loss. Subsequent branching asks Is Patient Within One Month of Onset of Hearing Loss?, after which salvage options are Offer Transtympanic Steroids for Salvage Treatment and May Offer HBOT as Salvage Treatment If Not Done as Primary Treatment; the algorithm also includes Counsel Hearing Rehabilitation Options.

### Differential diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss [^115xLdkQ]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hearing loss is a common problem that can occur at any age and makes verbal communication difficult. The ear is divided anatomically into three sections (external, middle, and inner), and pathology contributing to hearing loss may strike one or more sections. Hearing loss can be categorized as conductive, sensorineural, or both. Leading causes of conductive hearing loss include cerumen impaction, otitis media, and otosclerosis. Leading causes of sensorineural hearing loss include inherited disorders, noise exposure, and presbycusis. An understanding of the indications for medical management, surgical treatment, and amplification can help the family physician provide more effective care for these patients.

### Antivirals for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^111yWiwb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is characterised by sudden loss of hearing of cochlear or retro-cochlear origin without an identifiable cause. Antivirals are commonly prescribed, but there is no consensus on the treatment regimen or their effectiveness.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and side effect profile of antivirals in the treatment of ISSHL.

Search Methods

We systematically searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and other databases to 12 June 2012. We also scanned the reference lists of identified studies for further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different antivirals versus placebo (both with or without other treatment).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data, met to resolve disagreements and contacted study authors for further information. We assessed study risk of bias independently. We considered meta-analysis inappropriate and ultimately not possible due to differing treatment protocols of varying dose and duration, together with differing inclusion criteria and outcome measures between studies. The results of each study are reported individually.

Main Results

We included four randomised trials (257 participants). The overall risk of bias in the included studies was low. Two trials compared the addition of intravenous acyclovir to a steroid (prednisolone). One included 43 participants, the other 70 patients. Neither demonstrated any hearing improvement with ISSHL. Another (84 patients) did not show any statistically significant difference between groups with the addition of valacyclovir to prednisolone (compared to steroid plus placebo) with respect to change in pure-tone audiogram. Comparing the addition of intravenous acyclovir to hydrocortisone with hydrocortisone alone, the final trial did not show any statistically significant difference between groups (60 patients). No trial documented any serious adverse effects related to the use of antiviral treatment. One study reported slight to moderate nausea equally in the acyclovir and placebo groups (one patient in each). Another reported insomnia, nervousness and weight gain with valacyclovir (number not specified). Even though no meta-analysis was possible, evidence from the four RCTs has demonstrated no statistically significant advantage in the use of antivirals in the treatment of ISSHL.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence to support the use of antiviral drugs in the treatment of ISSHL. The four trials included in this review were, however, small and with a low risk of bias. Further randomised controlled trials with larger patient populations, using standardised inclusion criteria, antiviral regimes and outcome measures, are needed in order for adequate meta-analysis to be performed to reach definitive conclusions. A uniform definition of ISSHL should also be established, together with what constitutes adequate recovery.

### Autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss: the otology-rheumatology interface [^115dZAZd]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a rare clinical entity characterized by a progressive fluctuating bilateral asymmetric SNHL that develops over several weeks to months. Vestibular symptoms, tinnitus and aural fullness are present in up to 50% of patients. Due to the lack of specific diagnostic tests, both clinical suspicion and responsiveness to corticosteroids are the pillars for the diagnosis of autoimmune SNHL. The evaluation of patients in whom this condition is suspected should include a detailed history and physical examination, an audiogram, an MRI and a limited laboratory workup to exclude secondary causes of hearing loss. The low frequency of this condition, the heterogeneity in the designs of the available studies and the absence of randomized trials comparing treatment responses and assessing long-term outcomes are some of the factors accounting for the limited evidence to guide the clinician in the approach to the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune SNHL.

### Bilateral cochlear implantation [^112V4nYu]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Cochlear implantation (CI) is the standard of care for the treatment of children and adults with bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss. Because the ultimate and continuous goal of CI teams is to improve patient performance, a potential method is bilateral CI. The potential benefits of bilateral CI include binaural summation, squelch, equivalent head shadow for each ear, improved hearing in noise, sound localization ability, and spatial release from masking. The potential disadvantages include additional or prolonged surgical procedure, unproven cost/benefit profile, and the elimination of the ability to use future technologies and/or medical therapies in the implanted ear.

### Idiopathic sensorineural hearing disorders in adults – a pragmatic approach [^113B3wUF]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Acute or progressive sensorineural hearing loss, with or without vertigo and tinnitus, has a considerable impact upon an individual's quality of life. Sensorineural hearing disorders are more commonly observed in patients with rheumatic disease than in the general population, are more likely to be accompanied by the presence of serum autoantibodies, and might respond to steroid therapy. A subgroup of these disorders seem to be immune mediated, but audiologic presentation and serologic testing do not enable this subgroup to be further defined. Rheumatologists should be prepared to manage patients with known rheumatic disease who develop acute hearing loss and to evaluate referred patients without known rheumatic illness experiencing progressive or refractory sensorineural hearing loss. In this article, we summarize the literature and outline a rational approach for the evaluation and treatment of such patients.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113Frj1s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and management

Study characteristics and data related to participants from each study were always independently extracted by at least three authors. Any discrepancies among the extracted data were discussed and resolved by consensus. Only treatment arms that met the comparisons defined in the review were included. If a study had more than one treatment arm matching the same type of intervention, we selected the one most widely used among included studies. In most studies, we extracted outcome data from the defined primary endpoint. When no time point was defined as the primary endpoint, we selected the latest time point for inclusion. Exceptionally, if the number of participants lost to follow‐up was very high at the final time point and the necessary outcome parameters and numbers of participants were reported for an earlier time point, we chose this earlier time point. This is documented in the Characteristics of included studies table.

We documented the following details for each study:

Methods (study design, country, year, setting, allocation, blinding).
Participants (inclusion and exclusion criteria, number of included participants, baseline parameters).
Interventions (treatment arms, time point of start of intervention, whether primary therapy or secondary/rescue therapy, dosage and type of steroid, drug delivery strategy, injection regime, duration of intervention, time to follow‐up, concomitant treatments).
Outcomes (defined primary and secondary outcomes in the review (see above), definition of PTA and successful hearing improvement, number of completed and analysed participants, type of analysis).
Funding sources and declarations of interest.

We always extracted outcome data based on intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis when they were reported, in preference to data based on per‐protocol (PP) analysis. We extracted the following summary statistics for each study and each outcome:

For continuous data: the mean values, standard deviations and number of patients for each treatment group.
For binary data: the number of participants experiencing an event and the number of patients assessed at the time point.

We took an exploratory approach to assessing adverse events and extracted data on all adverse events reported by the trialists.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115i3qdD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hearing recovery in patients with ISSNHL mostly occurs early, within a few days of onset, but can also occur after several weeks (Liebau 2017; Liebau 2018). It has been observed that the time course of hearing recovery can extend to six months (Kosyakov 2011). However, most of the hearing improvement will take place during the first weeks after onset. To estimate the treatment effect of an intervention for ISSNHL, it is desirable that the final outcome assessment is conducted after several weeks of follow‐up. Short evaluation periods may risk underestimation of treatment effects (Wycherly 2011). After the recovery period, the hearing thresholds reached can be assumed to be stable in most patients. A large randomised controlled trial (published protocol) assessed the primary outcome 30 days after onset with an initial assessment after 10 days and a follow‐up at six months (Plontke 2016).

Why it is important to do this review

There is still uncertainty as to 1) whether intratympanic corticosteroids are better than placebo or no treatment, 2) whether intratympanic administration of corticosteroids alone or in combination with systemic application of steroids will lead to better results than systemic drug administration alone, 3) if so, which treatment protocol will lead to the best outcome and 4) what risks of adverse events are associated with this approach in inner ear therapy. This Cochrane Review was therefore warranted to assess the benefits and harms of intratympanic corticosteroids treatment for ISSNHL.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^115gLMcf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) initial corticosteroids — Clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with SSNHL within 2 weeks of symptom onset, categorized as an Option based on systematic reviews of RCTs and new RCTs and a balance of benefit and harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C and the level of confidence in the evidence is Medium, with the benefit of hearing improvement. Risks for systemic steroids include suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and Cushing's-like syndrome (minimal with 10- to 14-day treatment), aseptic necrosis of the hip, and hyperglycemia, whereas IT corticosteroids have minimal systemic effect but can cause local reactions of pain, tympanic membrane perforation, and transient dizziness, and entail high cost and multiple office visits. Exceptions for systemic steroids include medical conditions affected by corticosteroids, such as insulin-dependent or poorly controlled diabetes, tuberculosis, and peptic ulcer disease. There is a large role for shared decision making with patients, and although several group members were reluctant to endorse the 2-week time frame, the time frame of 2 weeks was retained to encourage early care. The majority of trials use a 1- to 2-week window from symptom onset as the initial therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^112xiXre]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Outcomes assessment in sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — Unless a preevent asymmetry of hearing was known or suspected, the unaffected ear should be used as the standard against which recovery should be compared. A complete recovery requires return to within 10 dB HL of the unaffected ear and recovery of WRSs to within 5% to 10% of the unaffected ear. Partial recovery should be defined in 2 ways based on whether the degree of initial hearing loss after the event of SSNHL rendered the ear nonserviceable (per AAO-HNSF definition) or not. Anything less than a 10–dB HL improvement should be classified as no recovery. For ears that were rendered nonserviceable by the episode of SSNHL, return to serviceable hearing should be considered a significant improvement, and whether or not this level of recovery occurs should be recorded. For ears with SSNHL to hearing levels that are still in the serviceable range, an improvement of > 10 dB in pure tone thresholds or an improvement in WRS of ≥ 10% should be considered partial recovery and recorded. For future studies of treatment outcomes, the panel urges the use of the standardized format for reporting hearing outcomes detailed in Gurgel et al.

### Predictors of delays in the management of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113dDgWM]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is a medical emergency defined by the National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders as a sensorineural hearing loss of at least 30 dB in each of three or more consecutive speech frequencies occurring within the 3 days preceding presentation. These criteria were adopted by the 2019 Clinical Practice Guideline of Sudden Hearing Loss by the American Academy of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery. The reported incidence of ISSNHL is highly variable, with rates of 27 and 60 per 100,000/year in the United States and the European Union, respectively, have been cited. This number might be higher because many patients recover spontaneously without seeking medical attention. Steroids comprise the mainstay of treatment, and they can be administered either systemically or locally by injection through the middle ear.

Several prognostic factors have been defined regarding ISSNHL recovery, including the patient's age, audiogram configuration at presentation, presence of vertigo, comorbidities, and total delay. Total delay can be subdivided into patient‐dependent delay (also called "presentation" delay as well as "time from ISSNHL onset to seeking first medical advice"), diagnostic delay, and treatment delay. Although all factors other than total delay are defined by the patient or the pathology and are uncontrollable, total delay can be modified.

The combination of diagnostic and treatment delays is called a "system delay" (Fig. 1). Although several studies have aimed to reduce system delays in the setting of ISSNHL, none have similarly studied patient delay. The aim of this paper is to study correlations between epidemiological and demographic characteristics and various delays in order to better define the causes for total delay and identify patients with ISSNHL who are at high risk for total delay to initiating empiric treatment with steroids.

It is also mandatory to give a clear statement about which persons in the study are blinded and which are not. Blinding of outcome assessment is possible even in non‐placebo‐controlled studies. Without a clear statement of blinding a judgement on the risk of bias is not possible and remains unclear.

In some of the included studies, treatment arms actually differed considerably in their baseline parameters and these imbalances between groups may have influenced the reported outcomes. In addition, many studies have not reported important baseline parameters, or reported them in an inadequate way. In two studies the reporting of baseline parameters even differed between treatment arms. Such inconsistent reporting of data raises doubts about the transparency of studies. We also noted a number of studies where measures of variance (such as standard deviations or standard errors) were missing. A variance element is an essential component when reporting the mean.

### Gene therapy for deafness [^113Tp232]. Gene Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans and can result from genetic, environmental or combined etiologies that prevent normal function of the cochlea, the peripheral sensory organ. Recent advances in understanding the genetic pathways that are critical for the development and maintenance of cochlear function, as well as the molecular mechanisms that underlie cell trauma and death, have provided exciting opportunities for modulating these pathways to correct genetic mutations, to enhance the endogenous protective pathways for hearing preservation and to regenerate lost sensory cells with the possibility of ameliorating hearing loss. A number of recent animal studies have used gene-based therapies in innovative ways toward realizing these goals. With further refinement, some of the protective and regenerative approaches reviewed here may become clinically applicable.

Table 1. Definitions of common terminology — sudden hearing loss: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is defined as "a subset of SHL that (a) is sensorineural in nature, (b) occurs within a 72-hour window, and (c) consists of a decrease in hearing of ≥ 30 decibels affecting at least 3 consecutive frequencies", and salvage therapy is "any therapy offered after 2 weeks from symptom onset (even if initial therapy was observation)"; the guideline notes that "expanding the definition to cases with < 30 decibels of hearing loss may be considered". It also defines sudden hearing loss (SHL) as "a rapid-onset subjective sensation of hearing impairment in one or both ears", sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) as "hearing loss resulting from abnormal function of the cochlea, auditory nerve, or higher aspects of central auditory perception or processing", conductive hearing loss (CHL) as "hearing loss resulting from a problem conducting sound waves anywhere along the route through the outer ear, tympanic membrane, or middle ear", mixed hearing loss (MHL) as "hearing loss resulting from both SNHL and CHL occurring in the same ear", and idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) as "SSNHL with no identifiable cause despite adequate investigation".

### The current status of audiologic rehabilitation for profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss [^113FKmKj]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Audiologic rehabilitation of individuals with profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (USNHL) has traditionally been limited to the use of air-conduction contralateral routing of sound (CROS) hearing aids. Treatment for these individuals has expanded with new applications of the bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA), transcranial hearing aid (t-CROS), and the cochlear implant. In this article, the authors review the literature that addresses these various treatment options.

Study Design

Contemporary review

Results

Historical information is available that describes the limited efficacy of air-conduction CROS hearing aids in lifting hearing handicap associated with USNHL. Current investigations on providing cross hearing are generally focused on use of the BAHA. Little is known at present whether new developments in hearing aid technology can improve on conventional air-conduction CROS or t-CROS approaches. Interestingly, the cochlear implant seems to be a viable option for individuals with USNHL and tinnitus who also have intact auditory nerve pathways.

Conclusions

There is indication in the literature that BAHA provides greater relief of hearing handicap associated with USNHL than CROS hearing aids; however, both have been found to provide limited patient satisfaction and seemingly fall short of restoring true sound localization. Adequate trials have not been performed comparing BAHA with the best CROS hearing aid technology. Transcranial hearing aids and cochlear implants are experimental methods to treat USNHL and hold promise, although there remains a lack of studies available to fully support this.

Table 10 — general guidelines for corticosteroid therapy for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) present systemic and intratympanic options. Systemic therapy is described as "Immediate, ideally within first 14 days. Benefit has been reported up to 6 weeks postonset of SSNHL", with dosing such as "Prednisone, 1 mg/kg/d (usual maximal dose is 60 mg/d)" or "Methylprednisolone, 48 mg/d", given at "Full dose for 7 to 14 days, then taper over similar time period", with "Do not divide doses" and "Audiogram at completion of treatment course and at delayed intervals". Intratympanic therapy may be "Immediate" or used as "Salvage (rescue) after initial treatment fails or after 2 weeks of symptom onset", with dosing options "Dexamethasone 24 mg/mL (compounded) or 10 mg/mL (stock) if compounded concentration unavailable" and "Methylprednisolone 40 mg/mL or 30 mg/mL". Administration includes "Inject 0.4 to 0.8 mL into middle ear space up to 4 injections over a 2-week period" and "Keep head in otologic position (one side down, affected ear up) for 15–30 minutes", with monitoring that "Interval audiograms between injections may help direct early termination of therapy if hearing loss resolves", and postprocedure care to "Inspect tympanic membrane… May insert pressure-equalizing tube… but this increases risk of tympanic membrane perforation".

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss [^116aMHji]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Sudden hearing loss (SHL) is a frightening symptom that often prompts an urgent or emergent visit to a physician. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients who present with SHL. The guideline primarily focuses on sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in adult patients (aged 18 and older). Prompt recognition and management of SSNHL may improve hearing recovery and patient quality of life (QOL). Sudden sensorineural hearing loss affects 5 to 20 per 100,000 population, with about 4000 new cases per year in the United States. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who diagnose or manage adult patients who present with SHL.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations in evaluating patients with SHL, with particular emphasis on managing SSNHL. The panel recognized that patients enter the health care system with SHL as a nonspecific, primary complaint. Therefore, the initial recommendations of the guideline deal with efficiently distinguishing SSNHL from other causes of SHL at the time of presentation. By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, the guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) distinguish sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss in a patient presenting with SHL; (2) educate patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) about the natural history of the condition, the benefits and risks of medical interventions, and the limitations of existing evidence regarding efficacy; and (3) counsel patients with incomplete recovery of hearing about the possible benefits of amplification and hearing-assistive technology and other supportive measures. The panel made recommendations that clinicians should (1) assess patients with presumptive SSNHL for bilateral SHL, recurrent episodes of SHL, or focal neurologic findings; (2) diagnose presumptive ISSNHL if audiometry confirms a 30-dB hearing loss at 3 consecutive frequencies and an underlying condition cannot be identified by history and physical examination; (3) evaluate patients with ISSNHL for retrocochlear pathology by obtaining magnetic resonance imaging, auditory brainstem response, or audiometric follow-up; (4) offer intratympanic steroid perfusion when patients have incomplete recovery from ISSNHL after failure of initial management; and (5) obtain follow-up audiometric evaluation within 6 months of diagnosis for patients with ISSNHL. The panel offered as options that clinicians may offer (1) corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with ISSNHL and (2) hyperbaric oxygen therapy within 3 months of diagnosis of ISSNHL. The panel made a recommendation against clinicians routinely prescribing antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, vasoactive substances, or antioxidants to patients with ISSNHL. The panel made strong recommendations against clinicians (1) ordering computerized tomography of the head/brain in the initial evaluation of a patient with presumptive SSNHL and (2) obtaining routine laboratory tests in patients with ISSNHL.

### Analysis of adherence to AAO-HNSF clinical practice guidelines for sudden hearing loss [^116YJ1A6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Sudden hearing loss (SHL) is an emergent condition that requires prompt and thorough evaluation to determine the diagnosis. A common type of SHL is sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), which can occur in up to 27 out of 100,000 people. It is typically unilateral and may be accompanied by tinnitus or vertigo. For some patients, there is an identifiable cause, but in many cases, it is considered to be idiopathic. Early workup and treatment are critical, as individuals with hearing loss may be more likely to have emotional, social, and communication dysfunctions and decreased quality of life (QOL).

In 2019, the American Academy of Otolaryngology‐Head and Neck Surgery (AAO‐HNSF) released clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the diagnosis and management of SHL and SSNHL.CPGs are established to ensure adequate workup and optimal patient care. They include action statements accompanied by explanations and supporting evidence. Each statement is given a recommendation for or against it. These guidelines emphasize urgent workup with audiometric testing as a missed or late diagnosis and treatment may lead to a poorer prognosis. This study aimed to assess the adherence to clinical practice guidelines for SHL on a national scale.

### Oral vs intratympanic corticosteroid therapy for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss: a randomized trial [^111GUaQd]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss has been treated with oral corticosteroids for more than 30 years. Recently, many patients' symptoms have been managed with intratympanic steroid therapy. No satisfactory comparative effectiveness study to support this practice exists.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of oral vs intratympanic steroid to treat sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Prospective, randomized, noninferiority trial involving 250 patients with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss presenting within 14 days of onset of 50 dB or higher of pure tone average (PTA) hearing threshold. The study was conducted from December 2004 through October 2009 at 16 academic community-based otology practices. Participants were followed up for 6 months.

Intervention

One hundred twenty-one patients received either 60 mg/d of oral prednisone for 14 days with a 5-day taper and 129 patients received 4 doses over 14 days of 40 mg/mL of methylprednisolone injected into the middle ear.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary end point was change in hearing at 2 months after treatment. Noninferiority was defined as less than a 10-dB difference in hearing outcome between treatments.

Results

In the oral prednisone group, PTA improved by 30.7 dB compared with a 28.7-dB improvement in the intratympanic treatment group. Mean pure tone average at 2 months was 56.0 for the oral steroid treatment group and 57.6 dB for the intratympanic treatment group. Recovery of hearing on oral treatment at 2 months by intention-to-treat analysis was 2.0 dB greater than intratympanic treatment (95.21% upper confidence interval, 6.6 dB). Per-protocol analysis confirmed the intention-to-treat result. Thus, the hypothesis of inferiority of intratympanic methylprednisolone to oral prednisone for primary treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss was rejected.

Conclusion

Among patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, hearing level 2 months after treatment showed that intratympanic treatment was not inferior to oral prednisone treatment.

Trial Registration

clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00097448.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115JcuGS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Selection of studies

After scanning all search results and independent screening of titles and abstracts, we retrieved the full texts of reports that loosely met the inclusion criteria and where exclusion of studies could not be clearly inferred from the abstract. At least two authors reviewed these and applied the inclusion criteria independently. These were 1) intratympanic corticosteroid treatment of ISSNHL, 2) clinical study, 3) stated randomisation process and 4) studying at least one comparison included in the review.

Final decisions on inclusion were based on full‐text analysis of preselected studies for the following criteria: 1) a reported randomisation process in the main text of the study report, 2) studying comparisons included in the review, 3) the diagnosis of included patients was ISSNHL, 4) the proportion of included patients with bilateral ISSNHL was below 5%, and 5) the time point of final outcome assessment was at least one week (eight days or more) after the start of treatment. In order to include a high number of studies, we also included those performing outcome assessments with short follow‐up (less than four weeks). However, we considered a short follow‐up duration of two weeks or less to represent a high risk of bias in these studies.

We openly discussed any differences of opinion about which studies to include in the review. If consensus could not be reached, we planned to refer these studies to the Cochrane ENT Co‐ordinating Editor. However, this was not necessary in any case. Publications in languages that could not be read by the authors were fully translated by a professional translator. Further, if such studies were included in the meta‐analyses, two native speakers independently performed extraction of key data, co‐ordinated by Cochrane ENT.

### Guidelines for the audiologic management of adult hearing impairment [^112AkgZe]. AAA (2006). Medium credibility.

Guideline development process — The guideline was developed using an evidence-based approach that integrates clinical expertise with the best available clinical evidence derived from systematic research, and when evidence was ambiguous or lacking, clinical experience guided the development of consensus-based recommendations. Review of source guidelines identified four general process areas: (1) Assessment and Goal Settings; (2) Technical Aspects of Treatment; (3) Orientation, Counseling, and Follow-up; and (4) Assessing Outcomes. At least two task force members were assigned to each area to search for studies at the top of the hierarchy of study types; once definitive clinical studies that provided valid relevant information were identified, the search stopped, and the search was extended to studies/reports of lower quality (observational studies) only if there were no higher quality studies. Evidence was graded using the Quality of Evidence (QE) Levels: 1 Systematic reviews and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) or other high-quality studies; 2 Well-designed RCT; 3 Non-randomized treatment studies; 4 Cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional surveys, and uncontrolled experiments; 5 Case report; and 6 Expert opinion. In addition, it was decided if the evidence was "Effective" (EV) or "Efficacious" (EF), where "EV" is evidence measured in the "real world" and "EF" is evidence measured under laboratory or ideal conditions.

### Clinical practice guideline: age-related hearing loss [^112LubvV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — urgent management and evaluation: SSNHL is defined as "hearing loss that occurs rapidly within 72 hours" and "is an otologic emergency". "Initially, patients should be educated and can be offered steroids as soon as possible". For nonresponders or delayed presentation, "between 2 and 6 weeks after onset, intratympanic steroid therapy should be offered". "All patients should have an evaluation to rule out retrocochlear pathology such as a vestibular schwannoma or meningioma".

### Macrolide-associated sensorineural hearing loss: a systematic review [^114ErrTM]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the potential association of macrolide antibiotics with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and which agents and dosage may be related. To evaluate whether an optimal treatment exists for reversing SNHL that occurs after macrolide therapy.

Study Design

Systematic review of the literature.

Methods

Computerized (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) and manual searches were performed to identify human studies of all ages (patients) who received macrolides (intervention, with or without control) and documented SNHL (outcome). All study designs were assessed. Extracted data included macrolide regimen details, as well as the timing, severity, and reversibility of SNHL with drug cessation alone or with additional medical intervention. Study designs and the associated risk of bias were assessed.

Results

The 44 publications (3 prospective, 41 retrospective) that met these criteria described 78 cases of audiometrically confirmed SNHL. SNHL was associated with oral and intravenous macrolide administration at standard and elevated doses. SNHL was irreversible in six cases, despite macrolide cessation (n = 5) and oral steroid treatment (n = 1). Irreversible SNHL was observed following 2 to 3 days of exposure. SNHL was reversible with macrolide cessation alone in 70 cases. In two cases, macrolide cessation coupled with oral steroid administration restored hearing. Reversible cases improved within hours to days. Nine studies also described 42 cases of subjective patient-reported hearing loss. Limitations in the data arose from study design, related comorbidities, and concomitant drug administration.

Conclusion

SNHL may follow macrolide exposure, even at standard oral doses. Further research is needed to understand the incidence, prevalence, and biological mechanism of its ototoxicity. Laryngoscope, 128:228–236, 2018.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^116kv6QU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was undertaken independently by four authors with the following domains taken into consideration, as guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook 2011):

sequence generation;
allocation concealment;
blinding;
incomplete outcome data;
selective reporting; and
other sources of bias.

We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool in RevMan 5 (RevMan 2020), which involves scrutiny of each domain as reported in the trial and judgement about the adequacy of each entry. Discrepancies between raters' judgements were discussed and resolved by consensus. We judged the risk of bias to be 'high', 'low' or 'unclear' and documented this together with an explanation in the risk of bias tables in Characteristics of included studies. In non‐placebo‐controlled studies, we generally considered the risk of bias derived from a lack of blinding to be 'low' because we assumed that the ascertainment of outcomes was not influenced by open (non‐blind) administration. Studies that met the inclusion criteria after screening were included in the review independent of their risk of bias classification. The assigned risk of bias in studies had an influence on the assessment of the certainty of the evidence (GRADE).

### Teprotumumab-associated chronic hearing loss screening and proposed treatments [^116ZHc7k]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Potential treatment

Sensorineural hearing loss is primarily caused by damage or dysfunction of cochlear hair cells, which have little ability to proliferate or regenerate in postnatal mammalians. Systemic corticosteroids with or without local intratympanic corticosteroid injection has traditionally been used to treat idiopathic sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss, with variable success. Unfortunately, steroids would not be expected to help teprotumumab-associated hearing loss since its mechanism is not inflammatory. Oral steroids were used in one reported case of teprotumumab-associated hearing loss but were ineffective. Hearing aids and cochlear implantation are options to improve functional hearing but do not address the underlying pathophysiological cause. They do not prevent or reverse otological pathology and would be needed lifelong.

Local IGF-1 therapy has shown promising results in the treatment of refractory sensorineural hearing loss but is not yet currently widely used. It is given intratympanically and diffuses through the round window membrane to enter the inner ear (figure 4). Risks of any intratympanic injection include pain, headache, vertigo, nausea, infection and tympanic membrane perforation. This targeted therapy should be considered for treatment of teprotumumab-associated sensorineural hearing loss. Acting on the same signalling pathway in a timely manner could theoretically negate the local effects of teprotumumab in the ear. This could potentially prevent or reverse teprotumumab-associated sensorineural hearing loss. Prophylactic treatment in susceptible patients could also be considered.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hearing loss: a systematic review and analysis of individual patient data [^115er3at]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are related to various immune-related adverse events (irAEs). However, the knowledge is limited with rare irAEs like hearing loss. Therefore, we evaluated the characteristics, presentation, and treatment of ICI-related hearing loss by reviewing the individual patient data from the previous studies.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of the Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases for studies published until 17 November 2022. The selected MeSH search terms were "hearing loss" OR "hearing impairment" OR "ototoxicity" OR "vestibular toxicity" OR "audiovestibular toxicity" AND "immune checkpoint inhibitor" OR "immunotherapy".

Results

A total of 38 patients were included. Melanoma was the most frequent diagnosis (73.7%). The median time from ICI initiation to hearing loss development was 3 months. The hearing impairment was secondary to bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in 24 (68.6%) patients, and at least one other irAE accompanied the hearing loss in 24 patients. Hearing loss significantly improved in 45.7% of the patients. The overall response rate and disease control rate were 67.6% and 85.3%, respectively.

Conclusion

We observed that most cases of ICI-related hearing loss were reversible, observed in patients with melanoma, accompanied by other irAEs, and associated with a high response rate to ICIs. With the expanded use of ICIs in the earlier treatment lines and adjuvant settings, the number of survivors with ICI-related hearing loss is expected to increase. Further research is needed to define the true prevalence of ICI-related hearing loss, optimal diagnosis, and management.

### A phase I / IIa safety and efficacy trial of intratympanic gamma-secretase inhibitor as a regenerative drug treatment for sensorineural hearing loss [^111GYkiV]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Trial Oversight

The trial (ISRCTN59733689, registration date 16/5/2017) was designed and coordinated by the REGAIN Consortium, supported by an EU Horizon 2020 grant, sponsored by the Consortium lead Audion Therapeutics BV and overseen by an independent steering committee. The trial protocol was approved by national regulatory authorities, medical ethical committees and local R&D authorities in London (London, Central REC Committee, REC Number: 17/LO/0632), Athens (Hellenic Republic Ministry of Heath National Ethics Committee - Reg. No.: 83052/2018) and Tübingen (Ethik‐Kommission der Medizinischen Fakultät und am Universitätsklinikum Tübingen, Proj. No.: 592/2018AMG1). The trial was conducted in accordance with GCP and principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and enrolment first started after trial registration and ethical approval Patient and study data were monitored by an independent Contract Research Organisation. During the Phase I trial, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) assessed safety and tolerability (see Supplementary Information page 4).

Patients

Eligible for the Phase I/II trial were patients aged from 18 to 80 years with a primary complaint of hearing loss of more than 10 years duration and stable hearing, their history suggesting an age-related, noise-induced or unknown cause, and diagnosed at the trial screening visit with bilateral symmetrical (< 15 dB difference between ears) mild to moderate SNHL (mean pure-tone hearing threshold 25 to 60 dB HL across frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz). Patient sex was self-reported. Excluded were patients presenting with a primary complaint of tinnitus, a 'true' air-bone gap > 15 dBHL in 3 or more contiguous frequencies between 0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz, a history of suspected or diagnosed genetic cause of hearing loss, suspected or known diagnosis of inner ear pathology (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Information for details), evidence of acute or chronic middle ear disease and/or surgery), use of ototoxic medication within 12 months of screening, or ongoing or planned systemic or local drug-based therapy for SNHL or tinnitus during the study.

### Sudden sensorineural hearing loss in children: a report of 75 cases [^112C3Jqb]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is rare in children. It is an abrupt hearing loss of more than 30 dB that affects at least three consecutive frequencies with no identifiable cause. The optimum period for speech and language development in children is between the ages of 1 and 6 years; therefore, without immediate treatment, SSNHL can cause serious disorders such as permanent hearing loss and can severely affect children's speech and cognitive development, resulting in psychiatric sequelae that increase the burden on families and society.

SSNHL indicates an abnormality of the cochlea, auditory nerve, or higher aspects of central auditory perception or processing. Up to 90% of SSNHL is idiopathic at presentation and is presumptively attributed to vascular, viral, immunizing, or multiple etiologies. Approximately, 32 to 65% of patients with SSNHL recover spontaneously.

The definitive etiology of SSNHL is unknown, and its treatment is thus controversial. Many studies report therapy options such as systemic and topical steroids, antiviral agents, diuretics, and hyperbaric oxygen treatments for adults. The prognosis for recovery depends on a number of factors including, patient age; presence of vertigo at onset; degree of hearing loss; audiometric configuration; and the time between the onset of hearing loss and treatment. The pathogenesis of SSNHL with various audiometric curves may be different. Treatment options should be based on the audiometric configuration.

Many studies have investigated the causes, treatments, and prognostic factors of SSNHL in adults, but few studies on children have been reported because of the low incidence of SSNHL in this population. Current guidelines for SSNHL diagnosis and treatment are proposed for adults. The lack of standardization in approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of SSNHL in children leaves them vulnerable to the most efficacious therapy during a critical window of their lives. Pediatric literatures on children have discussed only the benefits of oral steroids in a small number of patients, and the data on intratympanic or postauricular steroid administration are lack.

We retrospectively analyzed the data of 75 cases of SSNHL in children to study the clinical characteristics, efficacy, treatment, and prognostic factors associated with different audiometric configurations.

### Predictors of delays in the management of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115FMAMy]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Total (presentation+ diagnostic+ treatment) delay is affected by the venue of the first medical encounter for the diagnosis and treatment of ISSNHL. The total delay to the first presentation to the ED was a median (interquartile range, IQR) of 1 (0–1) day, 7 (6–12) days to a community otolaryngologist, and 15 (8–25) days to a general practitioner. Efforts should be made to raise awareness of ISSNHL among general practitioners by education programs, lectures, and hands‐on seminars. Empiric steroidal treatment should be considered whenever ISSNHL is suspected in patients with no risk factors for adverse effects.

Results

Description of studies

Results of the search

The flow of records from the number of references identified in the search to the number of studies included in the review is shown in Figure 1. The database search yielded 1720 records after duplicates were removed. We identified 59 additional records through other sources. We screened 1779 records for initial inclusion and discarded 1399 records because they did not study intratympanic corticosteroid treatment of ISSNHL. We discarded a further 328 articles because they were reviews, case reports, study protocols or not randomised controlled studies (i.e. randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials). Finally, we assessed 52 randomised and quasi‐randomised trials for eligibility. We excluded 20 studies because either the study was carried out in the wrong population (n = 3), or used the wrong intervention (n = 4) or wrong comparator (n = 12). We excluded one study because the duration of follow‐up was seven days or less. See Excluded studies and Characteristics of excluded studies.
