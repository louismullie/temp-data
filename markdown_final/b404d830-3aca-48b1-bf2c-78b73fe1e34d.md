What blood tests should be obtained to evaluate a hormonally active neuroendocrine tumor given a possible cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what blood tests should be obtained to evaluate a suspected hormonally active pancreatic tail neuroendocrine tumor given a possible cystic lesion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clinical syndrome characterization and pre-analytic preparation. Then, I should review baseline general biomarkers and their limitations. Next, I will consider a syndrome-directed fasting hormone panel. After that, I should outline when to escalate to provocative testing. Then, I need to check indications for hereditary syndrome testing. Finally, I will synthesize interpretation pitfalls and provide a concise test summary tailored to a cystic, potentially functional pancreatic tail lesion, making sure I verify each step against current guidelines and key evidence before moving on [^114Yny8e] [^116wiHYJ].

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome elements that narrow the biochemical focus, because premature panel ordering without anchoring to symptoms inflates false positives. Hypoglycemic episodes push insulinoma up the list; necrolytic migratory erythema, new diabetes, and weight loss suggest glucagonoma; persistent watery diarrhea with hypokalemia indicates VIPoma; refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer disease and reflux raise suspicion for gastrinoma; less common possibilities include flushing with carcinoid phenotype or features of ectopic Cushing syndrome or PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia for ACTHoma or PTHrPoma respectively [^114Yny8e] [^114nWCS5]. Hold on, I should verify pre-test preparation before any blood is drawn: PPIs should be stopped 10–14 days prior to fasting gastrin and chromogranin A when safe, with H2 blockers as a bridge held 48 hours pre-draw; samples for insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, gastrin, VIP, pancreatic polypeptide, and glucagon should be obtained after an overnight fast, and I need to check renal and hepatic function because impaired clearance elevates many peptides and chromogranin A independent of tumor burden [^115a8FyC] [^112RLg5N] [^116nxXqx]. Wait, let me verify one more confounder: autoimmune atrophic gastritis also elevates gastrin and CgA, so documentation of gastric acidity or histology is critical when interpreting borderline results [^115a8FyC] [^112RLg5N].

> Next, I will examine baseline circulating biomarkers, but I should not overinterpret them. Chromogranin A is widely used in NETs; however, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — CgA is suboptimal as a screening test in localized PanNETs, is frequently normal in insulinoma, and is prone to false positives with PPIs, renal impairment, and atrophic gastritis; its greater value is in trend monitoring once measurable disease is established rather than in initial diagnosis [^112RLg5N] [^112ncUmW] [^111uvmxo]. Pancreatic polypeptide can be elevated in nonfunctioning PanNETs and may track burden, especially in metastatic disease, but sensitivity is modest and context dependent, so I need to ensure consistent fasting sampling for comparability [^112ncUmW] [^116nxXqx]. Neuron-specific enolase is more of a prognostic marker, tending to rise with higher-grade neoplasms; I should confirm that a normal NSE does not exclude a well-differentiated functioning tumor [^114hPzqp].

> Now, I should review a syndrome-directed fasting hormone panel, tailored to a tail lesion yet guided by phenotype rather than location alone. Let me consider glucagon first because glucagonomas often localize to the tail; even modest elevations are meaningful if clinical features fit, and if basal glucagon is equivocal I can check for suppressibility with a standard oral glucose load, as early glucagonomas may still suppress with hyperglycemia; I will keep in mind this is supportive rather than definitive evidence of autonomy [^116kdQsC] [^114Yny8e]. For hypoglycemic spells, I need simultaneous fasting glucose with insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin; inappropriately normal or elevated insulin or proinsulin during hypoglycemia supports endogenous hyperinsulinism, and if outpatient sampling is nondiagnostic I should proceed to a supervised fast, which I will detail shortly [^114hPzqp]. For suspected gastrinoma, I should obtain fasting gastrin with documentation of gastric acidity and avoid PPI confounding; if fasting gastrin is less than tenfold the upper limit of normal but suspicion remains, a secretin stimulation test with a rise of at least 110 pg/mL above baseline supports the diagnosis, which I need to plan only after appropriate acid-suppressive management and safety review [^115a8FyC] [^114xoDEj]. VIP should be measured when there is secretory diarrhea with hypokalemia, somatostatin when there is diabetes, steatorrhea, and gallstones, and selective assays for ectopic ACTH, PTHrP, or calcitonin only when the clinical picture points strongly in those directions to avoid fishing expeditions [^114Yny8e] [^114nWCS5].

> When basal testing is nondiagnostic but pretest probability is high, I will escalate to conditional provocative testing with careful safeguards. For insulinoma, I should double-check that the patient can safely undergo an inpatient supervised fast up to 72 hours with serial sampling; diagnostic criteria hinge on demonstrating endogenous insulin or proinsulin in the face of symptomatic hypoglycemia, which is the gold standard biochemical confirmation for insulinoma, and I need to be meticulous about terminating criteria and sampling timing to avoid equivocal results [^114hPzqp]. For gastrinoma with equivocal fasting gastrin, I will confirm the logistics and expertise for secretin stimulation testing; the discriminant threshold for a positive result is an increment in serum gastrin of at least 110 pg/mL over baseline, which I should interpret alongside gastric acidity and clinical context to mitigate false positives from achlorhydria or PPI effect [^114xoDEj] [^115a8FyC]. For suspected glucagonoma with borderline elevations, I can reassess suppressibility with an oral glucose load to support autonomy if there is failure to suppress appropriately, acknowledging that early disease can still suppress and that this is adjunctive rather than definitive [^116kdQsC].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook hereditary syndromes, because that changes both testing breadth and follow-up. A young patient, multifocality, or personal or family history of hyperparathyroidism or pituitary tumors should prompt germline evaluation, with MEN1 at the top of the list and consideration of VHL, NF1, and TSC when the phenotype fits; genetic counseling should precede testing given implications for relatives and lifelong surveillance [^114nGCE7] [^11114J4N]. Let me verify surveillance guidance: in MEN1, annual fasting hormone panels that include gastrin, glucagon, VIP, PP, CgA, and insulin with concomitant fasting glucose are recommended, alongside periodic pancreatic imaging, which influences how I interpret isolated biochemical elevations in this population where multifocal microadenomas are common [^112sg3VF] [^1128QDqZ].

> Next, I should review interpretation pearls and pitfalls to avoid misclassification. CgA is best used as a trend marker rather than for initial diagnosis in localized PanNETs, and it is frequently normal in insulinoma; indeed, even selective arterial calcium stimulation in insulinoma augments insulin but not CgA or NSE, reinforcing the limited utility of CgA in that subtype; I need to double-check PPI exposure, renal function, and gastric pathology before calling a CgA elevation tumor related [^111uvmxo] [^111CCHBR] [^111kcyEc] [^112RLg5N]. For gastrinoma, I must distinguish hypergastrinemia from hypochlorhydria by documenting gastric acidity or by using a properly performed secretin test, and I should explicitly plan safe PPI withdrawal with H2 blockade bridging when clinical risk allows, noting this is hazardous in true Zollinger–Ellison syndrome and must be supervised [^115a8FyC]. For nonfunctioning PanNETs, pancreatic polypeptide can help track burden in metastatic disease but elevations are nonspecific; NSE elevations should steer my concern toward higher grade biology rather than functioning status per se; and across markers, assay variability and pre-analytic handling matter, so I should use validated laboratories and consistent fasting protocols to improve longitudinal interpretability [^112ncUmW] [^114hPzqp] [^112RLg5N].

> But wait, what about emerging multianalyte blood tests; could they refine early detection beyond CgA. I should acknowledge that consensus panels have highlighted the limitations of monoanalyte markers and suggested that multianalyte gene expression assays may offer higher sensitivity and specificity for minimal disease detection, with evolving iterations such as NETest 2.0 showing promising discrimination in validation cohorts; however, availability, standardization, and prospective clinical utility in decision-making remain under study, so I must frame them as adjuncts rather than replacements for syndrome-driven biochemistry and imaging at this time [^117L7TBr] [^112niqX4] [^113wrcVL].

> Summarizing the recommended blood testing approach for a cystic, potentially hormonally active pancreatic tail lesion, I should first ensure appropriate preparation by holding PPIs for 10–14 days when safe, fasting overnight, and documenting renal and hepatic function, then obtain baseline CgA, pancreatic polypeptide, and neuron-specific enolase to establish a reference for follow-up while recognizing their diagnostic limits; in parallel, I should order a fasting, syndrome-directed panel driven by symptoms and suspicion, including insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin with a simultaneous fasting glucose when hypoglycemia is suspected, glucagon when there are skin changes, weight loss, and glucose intolerance, fasting gastrin with acid assessment when there is refractory peptic disease or reflux, and VIP or somatostatin assays only when the classic clinical pictures are present; if results are equivocal but suspicion remains high, I should proceed to supervised fasting for insulinoma and secretin stimulation for gastrinoma per established criteria, all the while reassessing hereditary risk and counseling as indicated [^115a8FyC] [^112RLg5N] [^114Yny8e] [^114hPzqp] [^114xoDEj] [^112sg3VF].

For a cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail suspicious for a hormonally active neuroendocrine tumor, order a **fasting hormone panel** [^114Yny8e] (insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, gastrin, glucagon, VIP, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, ACTH, and serotonin/5-HIAA) to detect functional syndromes [^114hPzqp]. Include **chromogranin A** [^114rAZsH] as a general NET marker, but interpret cautiously due to false positives from PPIs, renal/hepatic impairment, and atrophic gastritis [^112RLg5N]. Use **secretin stimulation** [^114xoDEj] if gastrinoma is suspected and a **72-hour fast** for insulinoma evaluation [^114hPzqp]. Consider NETest for high diagnostic accuracy and early relapse detection. Collect all samples fasting [^116nxXqx], stop PPIs 10–14 days prior [^115a8FyC], and interpret results with clinical context and imaging [^116zBKCG].

## General neuroendocrine tumor markers

- **Chromogranin A (CgA)**: A general NET marker [^114rAZsH], elevated in many NETs but not insulinomas [^111CCHBR]; interpret cautiously due to false positives from PPIs, renal/hepatic impairment, and atrophic gastritis [^112RLg5N].

- **Pancreatic polypeptide (PP)**: Often elevated in non-functioning PanNETs [^114rAZsH]; useful when CgA is inconclusive [^116nxXqx].

- **Neuron-specific enolase (NSE)**: Less specific [^114rAZsH]; may be elevated in high-grade NETs [^114hPzqp].

## Hormone-specific blood tests

| **Hormone** | **Clinical syndrome** | **Indications** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin | Insulinoma | Hypoglycemia symptoms | Elevated insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin during hypoglycemia [^114hPzqp] [^111Ut88o] |
| Gastrin | Gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison) | Refractory ulcers, diarrhea | Fasting gastrin > 10x ULN; confirm with secretin stimulation [^114xoDEj] |
| Glucagon | Glucagonoma | Diabetes, rash, weight loss | Elevated fasting glucagon [^114hPzqp] [^116kdQsC] |
| VIP | VIPoma | Profuse diarrhea, hypokalemia | Elevated fasting VIP [^114hPzqp] |
| Somatostatin | Somatostatinoma | Diabetes, steatorrhea, gallstones | Elevated fasting somatostatin [^114hPzqp] |
| ACTH | Ectopic Cushing's | Cushingoid features | Elevated ACTH, cortisol [^114hPzqp] |
| Serotonin, 5-HIAA | Carcinoid syndrome | Flushing, diarrhea | Elevated serotonin/5-HIAA [^114hPzqp] [^116zBKCG] |

## Advanced and emerging biomarkers

NETest is a multianalyte blood test with **high sensitivity (85–98%) and specificity (93–97%)** for NET detection; it is unaffected by PPIs or SSAs and useful for early relapse detection. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) correlate with **tumor burden and grade** [^114hPzqp] but have **limited utility** in routine diagnosis [^117L7TBr].

---

## Sample collection and interpretation considerations

- **Fasting samples**: Collect after an overnight fast to avoid postprandial hormone elevations [^114rAZsH] [^116nxXqx].

- **Medication interference**: Stop PPIs 10–14 days before testing [^115a8FyC]; interpret results cautiously if PPIs cannot be stopped [^112RLg5N] [^114rAZsH].

- **Clinical context**: Interpret results with clinical presentation and imaging to avoid false positives/negatives [^114rAZsH] [^116zBKCG].

---

## Recommended blood tests summary

- **General markers**: Chromogranin A, pancreatic polypeptide, neuron-specific enolase [^114rAZsH].

- **Hormone-specific tests**: Insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, gastrin, glucagon, VIP, somatostatin, ACTH, serotonin/5-HIAA [^114Yny8e].

- **Advanced biomarkers**: NETest (if available) [^117L7TBr].

- **Provocative tests**: Secretin stimulation (gastrinoma) [^114xoDEj], 72-hour fast (insulinoma) [^114hPzqp].

---

A comprehensive, fasting hormone panel with CgA and PP, plus selective provocative tests and NETest when available, provides the **best biochemical assessment** for a suspected hormonally active PanNET [^114Yny8e] [^116wiHYJ].

### Chirhostim 40 [^114xoDEj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A physician or institution planning to perform secretin stimulation testing as an aid to the diagnosis of pancreatic disease should begin by assessing enough normal subjects (greater than 5) to develop proficiency in proper techniques and to generate normal response ranges for the commonly assessed parameters for pancreatic exocrine response to Chirhostim®.

In three crossover studies evaluating 21 different patients with a documented history of chronic pancreatitis, synthetic human secretin (sHS) was compared to synthetic porcine secretin (sPS) and bovine porcine secretin (bPS) at a dose of 0.2 mcg/kg for each drug. All of the patients treated with these drugs had peak bicarbonate concentrations of less than 80 mEq/L.

The pancreatic secretory response to intravenous synthetic human secretin in 35 healthy subjects demonstrated a mean peak bicarbonate concentration of 100 mEq/L and a mean total volume over one hour of 260.7 mL. All 35 subjects had peak bicarbonate concentrations greater than or equal to 80 mEq/L.

- **Stimulation of gastrin secretion to aid in the diagnosis of gastrinoma**: Chirhostim® administered intravenously stimulates gastrin release in patients with gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome), whereas no or only small changes in serum gastrin concentrations occur in healthy subjects and in patients with duodenal ulcer disease. Discriminant analysis was used to establish secretin stimulation testing as an aid in the diagnosis of gastrinoma. An increase from basal levels of greater than or equal to 110 pg/mL was the optimal point separating positive and negative tests. This gastrin response is the basis for the use of secretin as a provocative diagnostic tool.

### Role of biomarker tests for diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumours [^114rAZsH]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are neoplasms that arise from neuroendocrine cells. These cells and their tumours can secrete a wide range of amines and polypeptide hormones into the systemic circulation. This characteristic has led to extensive investigation into circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of NETs, as well as for predicting the biological behaviour of tumour cells.

Classic examples of circulating biomarkers for gastroenteropancreatic NETs include chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, and pancreatic polypeptide. Additionally, hormones that elicit clinical syndromes, such as serotonin and its metabolites, insulin, glucagon, and gastrin, are noted. While biomarker metrics for diagnosing all gastroenteropancreatic NET subtypes are limited, specific hormonal measurements can be diagnostically valuable in select cases.

In the past decade, new methods for detecting circulating transcripts and tumour cells have been developed to improve diagnostic capabilities for patients with NETs. Concurrently, advancements in scanning techniques and superior radiotracers for functional imaging have significantly expanded the options available to clinicians managing NETs. This review covers the latest research on NET biomarkers, offering clinicians a comprehensive overview of diagnostic biomarkers applicable to various clinical scenarios.

### What every gastroenterologist should know about gastrointestinal NETs [^112RLg5N]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

- **Establishing a NET diagnosis**: Exercise caution in obtaining and interpreting NET markers. Chromogranin A (CgA) is the most common marker in the management of NETs but has limited sensitivity and specificity. It is not meant to be a screening test and is more appropriate following a confirmed NET diagnosis and in patients with measurable disease, such as metastases. CgA can be normal in patients with small and limited tumors. It is also frequently elevated in patients without NETs; while proton pump inhibitor use is by far the most common reason for false positive CgA, renal or hepatic insufficiency, and autoimmune atrophic gastritis are also associated with elevated CgA levels.

- **Endoscopic characteristics and considerations**: Gastroduodenal and rectal NETs are often incidentally found on routine endoscopy; most of them are not associated with a hormonal syndrome. Importantly, tumors with low malignant potential cannot be differentiated endoscopically from higher-grade, more aggressive tumors. GI NETs may be firm, nonmobile, and polypoid or round with either a smooth overlying mucosa or central erosion or depression. They may also have an underlying red or yellow hue. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) characteristically demonstrates a hypoechoic, well-defined lesion within the deep mucosal and submucosal layers. Because NETs arise from enterochromaffin-like cells in the mucosal layer and infiltrate into the submucosa, biopsies with endoscopic forceps often establish a NET diagnosis, unlike other subepithelial lesions for which mucosal biopsies fail to obtain diagnostic tissue.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms [^114hPzqp]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

The increase or inappropriate presence of relevant biomarkers, mainly peptide hormones, can confirm the diagnosis of a specific endocrine syndrome. Occasionally, when levels of a biomarker related to a specific clinical setting are nondiagnostic, a stimulation test may be required. This mostly applies to gastrinoma patients with nondiagnostic basal gastrin levels when the secretin test is performed. Patients suspected of having insulinoma should undergo a 72-hour supervised fast to detect inadequately elevated (pro-)insulin and C-peptide levels during hypoglycemia. Neuron-specific enolase is also commonly used and is mostly found to be elevated in patients with high-grade neoplasms, also exhibiting a prognostic role.

Less commonly used markers include pancreastatin, a CgA derivative that is less affected by PPI administration; it is found to be elevated in 58% to 81% of NENs. However, pancreastatin does not correlate with tumor burden and/or disease aggressiveness, and its measurement is not widely available. Other less commonly used monoanalytes are neurokinin A and progastrin-releasing peptide, whereas N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic protein is a valuable nonspecific tool for evaluating patients with CHD.

- **Circulating tumor cells**: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are secreted either by the primary tumor or metastatic deposits and are initially found in the circulation in 43% of midgut, 21% of pancreatic, and 31% of bronchopulmonary metastatic NENs. CTCs are associated with increased tumor load and grade and are also found to be predictors of a worse progression.

This ENETS guidance paper aims to provide practical advice to clinicians for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of functioning syndromes in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). A NET-associated functioning syndrome is defined by the presence of a clinical syndrome combined with biochemical evidence of inappropriately elevated hormonal levels. Different hormonal syndromes can be encountered in pancreatic NET patients, including insulinoma, gastrinoma, and the rare glucagonoma, VIPoma, ACTHoma, PTHrPoma, carcinoid syndrome, calcitoninoma, GHRHoma, and somatostatinoma. The recommendations provided in this paper focus on the biochemical, genetic, and imaging work-up, as well as the therapeutic management of individual hormonal syndromes in well-differentiated, grade 1–3, functioning NETs with the primary tumour originating in the pancreas, and for specific subtypes also in the duodenum.

### Plasma protein biomarkers for the detection of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and differentiation from small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors [^112ncUmW]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET) are rare, with an incidence of 0.25–0.8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, and the incidence is rising. A minority of these tumors produce hormones such as insulin, glucagon, and gastrin, which give rise to specific clinical symptoms and are classified as functional tumors. Patients often have incurable metastatic disease at diagnosis.

Commonly used blood-based biomarkers for NET are chromogranin A (CgA) and 5-hydroxyindolicacetic acid (5-HIAA). According to recent studies, CgA has a limited role as a diagnostic biomarker for well-differentiated PanNET. An analysis from the CLARINET study demonstrated that at the time of diagnosis, only 49% and 26% of patients with PanNET had higher than the upper limit of normal (ULN) levels of CgA and 5-HIAA, respectively. In the CLARINET FORTE study, only 22.7% of the PanNET patients had a CgA level > ULN. For non-functional PanNET, pancreatic polypeptide (PP) could be used to assist in the diagnosis of the disease. The sensitivity for PP in metastatic disease ranges from 50% to 80%. Analyzing levels of multiple mRNA from blood has shown to be superior to CgA in the detection of PanNET. There is clearly an unmet need to identify new biomarkers that could more precisely detect PanNET at an early, curable stage as well as aid in disease management after surgery.

Supervised machine learning (SML) has been used in research for the detection, classification, and prognostication of cancer diseases for more than two decades. We have previously shown that this method improves the diagnostic accuracy of patients with PanNET.

### Circulating neuroendocrine gene transcripts (NETest): A postoperative strategy for early identification of the efficacy of radical surgery for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^113wrcVL]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Surgery remains the only treatment for the cure of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). However, biomarkers to identify the completeness of resection and predict recurrence are lacking.

- **Objective**: The aims of this study were to evaluate if the blood measurement of neuroendocrine gene transcripts (NETest) was diagnostic of PanNETs and whether NETest blood levels could identify complete resection. We compared transcript analysis with the biomarker chromogranin A (CgA).

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, longitudinal, single-center study including 30 patients with a postoperative histological confirmation of PanNET. Blood for NETest and CgA was collected preoperatively and on postoperative day (POD) 1, POD5, and POD30. Transcripts were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and multianalyte algorithmic analysis (NETest; normal < 20), and CgA was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; normal < 109 ng/mL). Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

- **Results**: Pancreatic surgical resections (n = 30) were R0, 26; R1, 2; and R2, 2. Preoperatively, NETest score was elevated in all 30 patients (44.7 ± 27), but postoperatively, NETest scores significantly decreased (p = 0.006) to POD30 (24.7 ± 24). The proportion of patients (15/30) with an elevated score significantly decreased by POD30 (p < 0.0001). CgA levels were elevated preoperatively (184 ± 360 ng/mL) in only 9/30 patients but did not decrease significantly postoperatively at POD30 (260 ± 589 ng/mL, p = 0.398). The number of patients with elevated CgA levels remained unaltered.

### Priorities for improving the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^1147cZAj]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2008). Low credibility.

A National Cancer Institute summit meeting on gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors was held in September 2007 to present the currently accepted standards of care for patients with these tumors and to identify areas requiring investigation and development. These tumors are clinically and pathologically heterogeneous, present commonly with obscure symptoms that lead to delays in diagnosis by years, and have an incidence in the United States of 2.5 to 5 cases per 100,000. The 5-year survival rates range between 15% and 95%, depending on the site and extent of disease.

This report delineates the main conclusions of the meeting, including the best practice diagnosis and treatment strategies for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and the identification of clinical and scientific areas that are most in need of attention. The most pressing needs were public and physician education, identification of molecular markers for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring, improved imaging modalities and molecular prognostication, development of a standardized pathological classification system, and creation of regional centers of expertise with tumor and laboratory data banks. In addition, adequately validated neuroendocrine tumor models and cell lines should be established to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of their growth and secretion, and to facilitate the development of specific therapies that should be examined in well-designed multicenter studies of defined patient groups.

### Changing biological behaviour of NETs during the evolution of the disease: Progress on progression [^111vEfzm]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Following improvements in the management and outcome of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) in recent years, we observe a subset, particularly of pancreatic NENs, which become more aggressive during the course of the disease. This is reflected by an increase in the Ki-67 labelling index as a marker of proliferation, which may occasionally lead to an increase in grading but generally does not appear to be correlated with histologically confirmed dedifferentiation.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase until May 2020 to identify cases that have behaved in such a manner. We screened 244 articles: only seven studies included cases in their cohort, or in a subset of the cohort studied, with a proven increase in the Ki-67 during follow-up through additional biopsy.

In addition to these studies, we have also tried to identify possible pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in advanced NENs. However, currently, no studies seem to have addressed the mechanisms implicated in the switch to a more aggressive biological phenotype over the course of the disease. Such progression of the disease course may demand a change in management.

Summarizing the overall evidence, we suggest that future studies should concentrate on changes in the molecular pathways during disease progression with sequential biopsies in order to shed light on the mechanisms that render a neoplasm more aggressive than its initial phenotype or genotype.

### The importance of the measurement of circulating markers in patients with neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas and gut [^1153KZtF]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The measurement of general and specific biochemical markers in patients with neuroendocrine tumours assists with diagnosis, gives an indication of the effectiveness of treatment, and may be used as prognostic indicators. There is much agreement that chromogranin A is the most universally helpful marker; it is found to be elevated in the circulation of about 90% of patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumours, and there are several excellent commercially available kits which provide reliable estimations. Specific markers are useful for diagnosis also and are helpful indicators of the effectiveness of treatment, particularly when tumour bulk may not change as much as tumour activity. Sporadic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours may secrete more than one peptide, indicating a worsening prognosis. Because of the wide variation in the progression of neuroendocrine tumours, a prognostic indicator provides a significant advantage to the clinician in facilitating optimum treatment at the optimum stage of disease. Both chromogranin A and neurokinin A have been used as powerful prognostic indicators for midgut carcinoid tumours.

### Chromogranin a is a reliable serum diagnostic biomarker for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors but not for insulinomas [^111yPFwy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are a group of rare tumors whose prevalence and incidence have increased over the past three decades. The clinical presentations of PNETs are very complicated due to the excess of gut peptides produced by functioning PNETs, while the symptoms of nonfunctioning PNETs (NF) are obscure. Moreover, most PNETs can be biologically aggressive. Thus, earlier and accurate diagnosis of PNET is important to facilitate surgical resection and initiate appropriate medical management, such as molecular targeted therapy, biotherapy, and other intensive care.

Chromogranin A (CgA) is a 46-kDa glycoprotein and a member of the granin family that exists within all types of neurons and normal neuroendocrine cells and is expressed in NET cells. Over the past two decades, many studies have reported and confirmed that CgA is a reliable diagnostic biomarker for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), including gastroentero-pancreatic NETs (GEP-NET), and may also be a prognostic biomarker for NETs. Moreover, several studies showed that peripheral blood levels of CgA were increased in endocrine-associated tumors, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. Recently, elevated serum/plasma levels of CgA were found in several non-endocrine solid tumors, including hepatic carcinomas and pancreatic cancer. Examination of CgA levels can be used not only for diagnosis but also for prognostic evaluation in these tumors.

In recent ENETS and NANETS consensus guidelines, CgA was considered the most practical and useful serum tumor marker in PNET patients. Some studies suggested that testi

### Are biochemical markers of neuroendocrine tumors coreleased with insulin following local calcium stimulation in patients with insulinomas [^111kcyEc]. Pancreas (2011). Low credibility.

The objective was to test whether chromogranin A (CgA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) are released from the pancreas during the selective arterial calcium stimulation and hepatic venous sampling test (ASVS) in patients with insulinomas.

Methods involved determining CgA, NSE, PP, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin in blood samples obtained during the ASVS test in 19 patients with insulinomas. Levels following calcium injection into the arteries supplying the tumor were compared with levels following calcium stimulation of arteries supplying healthy pancreatic tissue.

Results indicated that after calcium injection into the artery supplying the insulinoma, there was a significant 8-fold increase in insulin (range: 2.3–117; P < 0.001), a 3.8-fold increase in C-peptide (1.7–32.4; P < 0.001), and a 1.9-fold increase in proinsulin (0.7–5.3, P < 0.001), whereas NSE and CgA did not increase. No significant increases in insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, CgA, and NSE concentrations were found after calcium injection into control arteries. Pancreatic polypeptide increased 1.5-fold (0.8–4.5; P = 0.017) after calcium injection into the tumor artery and 2.4-fold (0.8–7.9; P = 0.016) after injection into the control artery.

Conclusions suggest that insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin are released by insulinoma cells in response to arterial calcium stimulation, whereas CgA and NSE are not released. Also, from our study, it seems that PP may be released by healthy islet cells after calcium stimulation.

### Consensus on biomarkers for neuroendocrine tumour disease [^117L7TBr]. The Lancet Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Management of neuroendocrine neoplasia represents a clinical challenge due to its late presentation, limited treatment options, and the inadequacies of current imaging modalities and biomarkers for guiding management. Monoanalyte biomarkers have shown poor sensitivity, specificity, and predictive ability. In 2007, a National Cancer Institute summit on neuroendocrine tumours highlighted these biomarker limitations as a crucial unmet need in the management of such tumours.

A multinational consensus meeting of multidisciplinary experts assessed the use of biomarkers and defined the prerequisites for novel biomarkers via the Delphi method. Consensus (at more than 75%) was reached for 88 out of 107 assessment questions (82%). The panel concluded that circulating multianalyte biomarkers provide the highest sensitivity and specificity necessary for minimal disease detection and that this type of biomarker offers adequate information to predict treatment effectiveness and prognosis.

However, the panel also noted that no monoanalyte biomarker for neuroendocrine tumours has fulfilled these criteria. Furthermore, there is insufficient information to support the clinical use of miRNA or circulating tumour cells as useful prognostic markers for this disease. The panel recommended that trials measuring multianalytes, such as neuroendocrine gene transcripts, should aim to identify how such information can optimize the management of patients with neuroendocrine tumours.

### Utility of chromogranin A, pancreatic polypeptide, glucagon and gastrin in the diagnosis and follow-up of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 patients [^115qwDLe]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNETs) are the major source of disease-specific mortality in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) patients. Chromogranin A (CgA), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), glucagon, and gastrin have some diagnostic value in sporadic PNETs, but there is very little evidence for their efficacy in diagnosing PNETs in MEN1 patients.

- **Design**: We performed a retrospective chart review of the existing MEN1 database in our institution.

- **Patients**: One hundred and thirteen patients were eligible for diagnostic value analysis of tumour markers. Patients were excluded if measurement of tumour markers was missing, either 3 months prior to PNET diagnosis (PNET patients) or prior to abdominal imaging (non-PNET patients).

- **Measurements**: Clinicopathologic characteristics and tumour marker measurements were analysed.

- **Results**: Of 293 confirmed MEN1 cases, 55 PNETs and 58 non-PNETs met inclusion criteria. The area under the curve (AUC) for CgA, PP, glucagon, and gastrin in MEN1 cases was 59.5%, 64.1%, 77.0%, and 75.9%, respectively. The AUC for the combination of CgA, PP, and gastrin was 59.6%. PP, but not CgA, glucagon, or gastrin, was significantly associated with both age and PNET functional status (P = 0.0485 and 0.0188, respectively). No markers were significantly associated with sex, PNET size, tumour number, tumour location, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, presence of lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, or overall survival. CgA values were not significantly lower following PNET resection than pre-operatively (P = 0.554).

### Current practices and novel techniques in the diagnosis and management of neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary [^1146rT4i]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

Neuroendocrine neoplasms comprise a broad, heterogeneous group of tumors that develop from hormone- or neuropeptide-producing cells that function to regulate various physiological and homeostatic processes. These tumors are diagnosed in approximately 5.25 per 100,000 people in the United States and may occur at slightly higher frequencies among African Americans (6.50 per 100,000) than among whites (4.44 per 100,000).

Neuroendocrine neoplasms can vary widely in their secretion of vasoactive substances, histological appearance, malignancy, and prognosis. Well-differentiated (grade 1 and some grade 2) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) often progress slowly, can secrete hormones that manifest as a set of nonspecific clinical symptoms, and are frequently diagnosed after metastasis to the liver. In contrast, high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) are often more aggressive and associated with a worse prognosis. Partly because of their lack of differentiation, NECs are less likely to secrete vasoactive substances, and patients are often diagnosed as having widespread metastatic disease without first presenting with hormone-related symptoms.

Neuroendocrine cells are an important cellular component of multiple organ systems, such as the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and pancreaticobiliary tracts; therefore, tumors that initiate from neuroendocrine cells can be found in a wide variety of organ systems. Anatomic sites of primary neuroendocrine neoplasms include, but are not limited to, the lung, stomach, jejunum/ileum, pancreas, skin, and at least seven other anatomic sites.

### Secretin stimulation test and early diagnosis of gastrinoma in MEN1 syndrome: Survey on the MEN1 Florentine database [^114ZPvC7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare inherited endocrine cancer syndrome. Multiple gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) affect 30% to 80% of MEN1 patients, with the most common functioning GEP-NET being gastrinoma. Biochemical identification of hypergastrinemia may help to recognize the presence of gastrinomas before they are detectable by instrumental screening, enabling early diagnosis and start of therapy, preferably before tumor progression and metastases occurrence.

- **Objective**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the secretin stimulation test to precociously diagnose the presence of gastrin-secreting tumors.

- **Design**: Results of secretin stimulation tests, performed between 1991 and February 2020, were retrospectively analyzed, as aggregate, in a cohort of MEN1 patients with GEP-NETs.

- **Setting**: Data were extracted from the MEN1 Florentine database.

- **Patients**: The study included 72 MEN1 patients with GEP-NETs who underwent a secretin stimulation test for the evaluation of gastrin secretion.

- **Outcomes**: A positive secretin stimulation test was assumed with a difference between basal fasting serum gastrin (FSG) and the maximum stimulated value of gastrin over 120 pg/mL.

The secretin stimulation test showed a secretin-induced hypergastrinemia in 27.8% (20/72) of patients with GEP-NETs, and a positive test in 18 cases. The test allowed the identification of a positively stimulated hypergastrinemia in 75.0% (3/4) of patients who presented a basal FSG within the normal range. Diagnosis of gastrinoma is complex and difficult.

### Circulating gene expression assay as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours in MEN1 [^111GAenC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

There is an unmet need for biomarkers in MEN1-related pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs) that allow for the prediction of clinical behavior and metastatic potential. This study aims to investigate the potential of a circulating NET mRNA gene expression assay as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.

- **Design**: Single-centre, prospective cohort study.
- **Methods**: MEN1 patients were enrolled between July 2016 and June 2017. Blood samples were collected in PAXgene tubes, and the original NETest assay was recalibrated for MEN1 PanNETs. The mNET assay was performed at baseline, and patients were followed for 39 months (range 12–48 months). Diagnostic and predictive values were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Results indicate that of 110 eligible patients, 60% were diagnosed with PanNETs at baseline, and 9% developed PanNETs during follow-up. At baseline, the mNET assay differentiated between patients without manifestations and those with only PanNETs (p = 0.04). The AUC for predicting PanNET development was 0.65 (p = 0.15). In separate analyses, the assay did not predict PanNET growth (AUC = 0.49), number of PanNETs (AUC = 0.54), new metastatic disease (AUC = 0.39), or metastasis progression (AUC = 0.46).

In conclusion, in line with previous studies in non-MEN1 associated NET, in MEN1, a circulating NET gene expression assay identified patients without any manifestations from PanNETs. The mNET assay did not predict PanNET development, progression, or metastasis. The underlying genetic condition, epigenetic modifications, microadenomas, and coexistence were not addressed in the study.

### Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: diagnosis and treatment [^1174MEqH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

- **Diagnosis**: GEP-NETs are characterized by their ability to produce, store, and secrete a large number of peptide hormones and biogenic amines, which can lead to the development of distinct clinical syndromes. Based on this, GEP-NETs are broadly subdivided into "functional" or "non-functional" tumors, with or without a clinical syndrome attributable to hormonal hypersecretion, respectively. Most GEP-NETs do not secrete biologically active substances and present fairly late with symptoms of mass effects or distant metastases.

	- Among the "functional" tumors, each of these secreted substances causes a specific clinical syndrome, including carcinoid, Zollinger-Ellison, insulinoma, Verner-Morrison, and glucagonoma syndromes. Specific markers for these syndromes are basal and/or stimulated levels of urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid; serum or plasma gastrin; insulin; vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; and glucagon, respectively. General markers such as chromogranin A, pancreatic polypeptide, serum neuron-specific enolase, and the subunit of glycoprotein hormones have been used for screening purposes in patients without distinct clinical hormone-related syndromes. The most important general circulating tumor marker is chromogranin A, expressed in 80–90% of all patients with GEP-NETs. Chromogranin A determination is also useful for staging, prognosis, and follow-up since the serum concentration correlates to the tumor mass.

### Plasma protein biomarkers for the detection of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and differentiation from small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors [^112CM3En]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

The baseline characteristics of the three study groups are provided in Table 1. Baseline chromogranin A (nmol L–1) values are presented as mean (SD) and median (range): for controls, 4.4 (4.8) and 3.3 (2–43); for SI-NET, 46.7 (85.5) and 12.0 (2–620); and for PanNET, 55.8 (145.4) and 8.8 (2–785).

Altogether, 33 patients (24%) with SI-NET and 5 patients (13%) with PanNET underwent primary tumor surgery prior to study inclusion. At the time of diagnosis (baseline visit), 78% of the SI-NET and 57% of the PanNET cohort had CgA levels greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN). Eighteen patients (46%) with PanNET had fewer than three liver metastases, while nine patients (23%) had no liver metastases. In this non-functional PanNET patient cohort, only a minority (15%) experienced any type of daily symptoms potentially related to the NET.

In the SI-NET cohort, 48% of the patients reported at least one daily symptom that could be tumor related, such as flushing, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.

### Sporadic pancreatic polypeptide secreting tumors (PPomas) of the pancreas [^116ZxnJL]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Sporadic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, which predominantly secrete pancreatic polypeptide (PPomas), are rare and have not been associated with a clinical syndrome. A wider understanding of their pathological features and behavior is needed.

- **Methods**: Four PPoma patients who presented with nonspecific abdominal pain are described. Their diagnosis was established by the presence of an enhancing solitary pancreatic tumor on computed tomography (CT) and elevated fasting pancreatic polypeptide hormone levels. Patient 1 was treated with a pancreatoduodenectomy because of elevation of serum CEA level. Two of the cases underwent enucleation because of prolonged stable CT appearance. Patient 4 underwent distal pancreatectomy for a pancreatic neck tumor causing ductal obstruction and distal parenchymal atrophy.

- **Results**: All cases had benign histological features apart from patient 1, whose tumor demonstrated occasional mitotic activity. These tumors have not recurred following a median of 49 (range, 35–57) months. The protein expression in the tumor tissue was measured by SELDI-TOF MS and was different from the profile of pancreatic adenocarcinoma that was previously demonstrated in our laboratory. This may lead to future helpful diagnostic testing on fine needle aspirates.

- **Conclusion**: Resection of sporadic PPomas presenting as a solitary well-defined mass with benign histological features results in good long-term survival.

### Plasma protein biomarkers for the detection of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and differentiation from small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors [^111ueLMM]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

This is an exploratory analysis from the ongoing Nordic EXPLAIN study, an exploratory, non-interventional study for evaluating the diagnostic, prognostic, and response-predictive value of a multi-biomarker approach in metastatic GEP NETs.

- **Patients**: In total, 135 patients with SI-NETs and 39 with PanNET were included in the present study. These patients were referred to the hospitals attending the study due to a diagnosed NET or suspicion of having NET based on symptoms and/or radiological findings. All patients underwent standard work-up with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or somatostatin receptor imaging, and eventually tissue sampling for diagnosis and grading according to the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) guidelines. Inclusion criteria were provision of written informed consent, metastatic non-resectable SI-NET or metastatic non-resectable PanNET (World Health Organization Grade 1 or 2, up to 20% Ki-67), and aged 18 years or older. Exclusion criteria included prior treatment with anti-proliferative treatments for NET disease (such as somatostatin analogues), peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, other malignant diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, or severe renal or liver dysfunction. Patients who had surgery of the primary tumor but with residual metastatic disease were included.

Clinical data were collected at each regular follow-up and entered into an electronic case report form (VieDoc, Pharma Consulting Group, Uppsala Sweden).

### Multiple proinsulin-secreting tumors of the pancreas treated by laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy [^115cnV8i]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with pancreatic tumors that induce hypoglycemia present with a myriad of symptoms. Laboratory testing can frequently result in data challenging for the clinician to confirm the biochemical diagnosis. Proinsulin, in addition to insulin levels, may be essential in evaluating and diagnosing an insulinoma.

- **Methods**: The objective of this case report is to demonstrate the potential importance of proinsulin levels in the evaluation of tumor-induced hypoglycemia. We report a 49-year-old woman with an unusual clinical presentation. Unlike many patients with tumor-induced hypoglycemia, her fasting glucose levels were fairly unimpressive, her insulin levels were undetectable during a prolonged fast, and she had elevated proinsulin levels.

- **Results**: The inpatient fast was remarkable for levels of serum glucose 53 mg/dL or higher, a serum insulin < 2 uIU/mL, C-peptide 0.7–1.1 (nl 0.8–3.1 ng/mL), and proinsulin 29.2–36.8 pmol/L (nl ≤ 18.8 pmol/L). CT scanning of the abdomen revealed multiple pancreatic lesions. A laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy led to the removal of multiple neuroendocrine tumors, which stained only for proinsulin and not for other pancreatic tumor markers. Postoperatively, she normalized her biochemical serum studies and has remained symptom-free 2 years later.

- **Conclusions**: The measurement of proinsulin plays an important part in the diagnostic workup of neuroendocrine tumors causing hypoglycemia. These potentially malignant tumors can be treated adequately with minimally invasive surgery.

### Biomarkers for prognosis in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^113piXqQ]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) encompass a diverse group of malignancies marked by histological heterogeneity and highly variable clinical outcomes. We performed a systematic review on potential prognostic biomarkers in PNETs by searching the PubMed database.

### Recent developments in imaging of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^113J8zy5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The detection of a functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) can be a diagnostic challenge, as these tumors may cause very prominent hormonal symptoms but remain small. In contrast, symptoms from non-functioning PNETs are typically secondary to mass effects, such as abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss, or due to metastatic disease. Consequently, patients with non-functioning PNETs often present with larger tumors that are generally more easily detected compared to their functioning counterparts.

Due to availability, CT and MRI are usually the preferred modalities for the initial investigation. PNETs, due to their hypervascular nature, exhibit robust contrast enhancement in the late arterial phase, which is the optimal vascular phase for their identification. PNETs must be differentiated from other hypervascular lesions, such as primary exocrine tumors (e.g. serous cystic adenoma, solid pseudopapillary neoplasia, acinar cell carcinoma), hypervascular metastases (e.g. renal cell carcinoma, carcinoid, medullary thyroid carcinoma), neurogenic tumors (e.g. schwannoma), vascular lesions (e.g. aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous malformation), and developmental lesions (e.g. intrapancreatic splenule). However, PNETs do not always show hypervascularity, which is more often the case for non-functioning tumors. On unenhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequences, PNETs have lower signal intensity compared to the adjacent parenchyma, while on T2-weighted sequences they more often exhibit high signal intensity.

### Chromogranin A in the follow-up of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: Is it really game over? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uvmxo]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Little is known about chromogranin A (CgA) during the follow-up of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. We hypothesized that serial CgA monitoring might be useful for assessing tumor progression, and we performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: A bibliographic search was performed in PubMed using "chromogranin A", "neuroendocrine tumors", "follow-up", and "biomarker" to identify all pertinent articles published in the last 10 years.

- **Results**: Eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. Chromogranin A as a follow-up marker shows sensitivity between 46% and 100%, and specificity between 68% and 90%. The meta-analysis results showed an overall accuracy of 84% (95% confidence interval, 81–86.6), a cumulative sensitivity of 74.6% (95% CI, 61.9–85.4), and a cumulative specificity of 84.7% (95% CI, 81.3–87.7). These data indicate that circulating CgA has better overall accuracy in the follow-up setting; it can be used to confirm the diagnosis of recurrence/progression.

Chromogranin A is more reliable when used to monitor disease progression and response to treatment, and for the early detection of recurrence after treatment, rather than in the diagnostic setting. It is more sensible to use this marker in cases where the initial values were impaired.

### Netest® 2.0-a decade of innovation in neuroendocrine tumor diagnostics [^112niqX4]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP‐NENs) are challenging to diagnose and manage. Because there is a critical need for a reliable biomarker, we previously developed the NETest, a liquid biopsy test that quantifies the expression of 51 neuroendocrine tumor (NET)‐specific genes in blood using real‐time PCR (NETest 1.0). In this study, we have leveraged our well‐established laboratory approach (blood collection, RNA isolation, qPCR) with contemporary supervised machine learning methods and expanded training and testing sets to improve the discrimination and calibration of the NETest algorithm (NETest 2.0).

qPCR measurements of RNA‐stabilized blood‐derived gene expression of 51 NET markers were used to train two supervised classifiers. The first classifier trained on 78 controls and 162 NETs, distinguishing NETs from controls; the second, trained on 134 stable disease samples, 61 progressive disease samples, differentiated stable from progressive NET disease. In all cases, 80% of data was retained for model training, while the remaining 20% were used for performance evaluation.

The predictive performance of the AI system was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and area under received operating characteristic curves (AUROC). The algorithm with the highest performance was retained for validation in two independent validation sets. Validation Cohort #I consisted of 277 patients and 186 healthy controls from the United States, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, while Validation Cohort #II comprised 291 European patients from the Swiss NET Registry.

### Plasma glucagon levels suppressed by a glucose load in a man with incidental pancreatic glucagonoma [^116kdQsC]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To describe a patient with a histologically proven pancreatic glucagonoma, noted incidentally during a follow-up visit for high aminotransferase levels, and to evaluate its autonomy with a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, we present the results of a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Plasma glucagon and blood glucose levels were measured every 30 minutes after an oral glucose load. In addition, we provide a brief review of the literature on the diagnosis and management of glucagonomas and the importance of long-term surveillance.

In our patient, who had a 1-year history of impaired fasting glucose, plasma glucagon levels were persistently suppressed to within the normal range after the oral glucose challenge. Octreotide scintigraphy revealed abnormal uptake in the pancreatic tail, and a 2.8-cm mass was removed during laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor tissue showed intense reactivity for glucagon. Plasma glucagon levels were reduced to less than 50 pg/mL postoperatively, and a scintigraphic study at 4-month follow-up showed no residual uptake at the previous tumor site or elsewhere.

Glucagon-secreting pancreatic tumors are extremely rare. A substantially elevated plasma level of glucagon is usually seen in patients with metastatic tumors. In the early stage of a glucagonoma, however, the plasma glucagon level may be only modestly elevated and may still be susceptible to normal negative feedback inhibition. We demonstrated plasma glucagon complete suppressibility after oral glucose challenge in a patient with glucagonoma.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms [^114nWCS5]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Clinicians are increasingly confronted with neuroendocrine neoplasms as their incidence and prevalence are rising across all primary sites. Patients presenting with a neuroendocrine neoplasm should be scrutinized for the presence of a functional hormonal syndrome as this can impair survival, offers the possibility of sensitive biomarkers, and requires dedicated therapy. Obtaining histology of a suspected neuroendocrine neoplasm is crucial for confirmation of the diagnosis as well as for classification into a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor or a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.

- **Functional imaging**: 68 Gallium-labelled somatostatin analog and 18 F-FDG PET tracers ensure superior staging and prognostication of neuroendocrine neoplasms.

- **Treatment options**: Long-acting somatostatin analogs are the preferred first-line option for several hormonal syndromes associated with neuroendocrine neoplasms as well as for growth control in well-differentiated irresectable or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic tumors. Several novel treatment options for hormonal and/or antiproliferative control in neuroendocrine neoplasms have shown efficacy in randomized controlled trials, expanding the clinical repertoire and allowing for improved management based on individual patient and tumor characteristics.

### Marked expansion of exocrine and endocrine pancreas with incretin therapy in humans with increased exocrine pancreas dysplasia and the potential for glucagon-producing neuroendocrine tumors [^115naBag]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The β-cell mass, computed from the product of the pancreatic fractional insulin-positive area and pancreatic mass, was 55% decreased in DM patients not on incretin therapy compared with ND control subjects (0.29 ± 0.08 vs. 0.60 ± 0.10 g; P < 0.05). In contrast, β-cell mass was increased sixfold in DM-I patients (1.81 ± 0.56 vs. 0.29 ± 0.08 g; P < 0.01). Moreover, β-cell mass was threefold greater in DM-I individuals compared with ND control subjects (1.81 ± 0.56 vs. 0.60 ± 0.10 g; P < 0.05).

The sixfold increase in β-cell mass in DM-I subjects was almost entirely due to increased β-cell numbers rather than β-cell size, although there was a 3% increase in β-cell size with incretin therapy (8.9 ± 0.1 vs. 8.6 ± 0.1 μm, DM vs. DM-I; P < 0.05). The pancreatic fractional area immunostained for glucagon was comparable between DM individuals not subject to incretin therapy and ND control subjects (0.57 ± 0.12 vs. 0.52 ± 0.08%; P = NS).

However, the pancreatic fractional area immunostained for glucagon was markedly increased in DM-I individuals compared with DM patients on other therapy (1.65 ± 0.39 vs. 0.57 ± 0.12%; P < 0.0001), as well as compared with ND control subjects (1.65 ± 0.39 vs. 0.52 ± 0.08%; P < 0.0001). The pattern of the calculated glucagon mass followed that of the pancreatic fractional area: it was comparable in individuals with DM not treated with incretin therapy and control subjects, but fivefold increased in DM-I individuals compared with DM patients not treated with incretin therapy (2.08 ± 0.75 vs. 0.45 ± 0.10 g, DM-I vs. DM; P < 0.05).

### Chromogranin A is a reliable serum diagnostic biomarker for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors but not for insulinomas [^111CCHBR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Circulating chromogranin A (CgA) levels have been confirmed to be useful diagnostic markers for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), with high specificity and sensitivity. In the present study, we verified the diagnostic value of serum CgA in a series of patients with non-insulinoma pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), in agreement with previous studies. The sensitivity and specificity were 65.6% and 91.9%, respectively, similar to the rates of 67% and 96% when using CIS Bio kits, as described by Ardill and Erikkson. Similar to previous studies, we found that CgA levels in patients with gastrinomas were much higher than those in patients without gastrin-secreting PNETs.

The interesting finding in the study was that serum CgA levels were not elevated in patients with insulinomas, including one patient with extensive liver metastases (48 ng/ml). Most previous studies on PNETs did not clarify this unusual biochemical feature of insulinoma, the most common subtype of PNETs, but Wouter de Herder pointed out in a review that blood levels of CgA were rarely slightly elevated in subjects with insulinomas. Moreover, Portela-Gomes GM et al. mentioned in a review that well-differentiated NETs expressed CgA epitopes except insulinomas. A recently published guideline revised by the UK and Ireland Neuroendocrine Tumor Society and the British Society of Gastroenterology addressed that CgA would not be raised in benign insulinomas. Additionally, Nobels et al. studied more than 200 NETs and found that serum CgA levels were rarely slightly elevated in patients with insulinomas (elevated in 2 of 21 patients, range 63–236 ng/ml).

### Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^116wiHYJ]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors:

- **Definition**: Gastroenteropancreatic NETs are a heterogeneous group of epithelial neoplasms arising from neuroendocrine cells within the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, characterized by variable hormonal activity and malignant potential.

- **Pathophysiology**: Gastroenteropancreatic NETs originate from neuroendocrine cells capable of hormone production and secretion. They are classified by primary site (e.g. pancreas, small intestine, rectum), functional status (hormone-secreting vs. nonfunctional), and histologic grade based on mitotic rate and Ki-67 proliferation index. The biological behavior varies widely, ranging from indolent, well-differentiated tumors to aggressive high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Hormone-producing tumors may cause clinical syndromes such as carcinoid syndrome or insulinoma, while nonfunctional tumors often present late with mass effect or metastases.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs has increased over recent decades. In the US, the estimated incidence is approximately 3.6 per 100,000 individuals per year, with a 20-year prevalence of 48 per 100,000. In Europe, incidence rates range from 1.3 to 2.3 per 100,000, though estimates vary due to heterogeneity in national and regional registry data.

- **Risk factors**: Most gastroenteropancreatic NETs are sporadic, but risk is increased in patients with inherited syndromes such as MEN1, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis complex.

### Guidelines for the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (including carcinoid) tumours (NETs) [^115J8YPB]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Pancreatic and periampullary NETs form a special group that requires particular consideration. As with all other neoplasms at these sites, surgery should only be undertaken in specialist hepatopancreatobiliary units. It is recognized that pancreatic resectional surgery is increasingly being performed via laparoscopic access. For the moment, the decision as to whether this surgery is performed by the traditional open or laparoscopic route should be left to the discretion of each designated specialist pancreatic surgery center.

According to the WHO classification, tumor size correlates with malignant potential. Localized tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter warrant aggressive resection. Surgical management remains to be proven effective for non-functioning pancreatic NETs in MEN1 syndrome. Often, the diagnosis is established biochemically before surgery and, although preoperative localization can be difficult, the biochemical diagnosis provides some indication of the likelihood of malignancy (e.g. low with insulinoma). Localization can be aided by hepatic venous sampling after calcium stimulation. Thus, for insulinoma, if the lesion is clearly localized before surgery, and is near or at the surface of the pancreas and easily defined at surgery, enucleation may be sufficient, provided histopathology demonstrates complete excision and benign features. However, this may not be possible, and Kausch–Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy, left pancreatectomy, or even total pancreatectomy may be justified in selected cases.

### Hereditary endocrine tumours: Current state-of-the-art and research opportunities: MEN1-related pancreatic NETs: Identification of unmet clinical needs and future directives [^112EXz38]. Endocrine-related Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

The PanNET Working Group of the 16th International Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Workshop (MEN2019) convened in Houston, TX, USA, from March 27–29, 2019, to discuss key unmet clinical needs related to PanNET in the context of MEN1, with a special focus on non-functioning (nf)-PanNETs. The participants included medical scientists, representatives from patient organizations, the pharmaceutical industry, and research societies.

In a case-based approach, participants addressed early detection, surveillance, prognostic factors, and management of localized and advanced disease. For each topic, following a review of evidence, key unmet clinical needs and future research directives to make meaningful progress for MEN1 patients with nf-PanNETs were identified.

International multi-institutional collaboration is needed for adequately sized studies and validation of findings in independent datasets. Collaboration between basic, translational, and clinical scientists is paramount to establishing a translational science approach. In addition, bringing clinicians, scientists, and patients together improves the prioritization of research goals, assures a patient-centered approach, and maximizes patient involvement.

It was concluded that collaboration, research infrastructure, and methodologic and reporting rigor are essential to any translational science effort. The highest priorities for nf-PanNETs in MEN1 syndrome are:

1. The development of a data and biospecimen collection architecture that is uniform across all MEN1 centers.
2. Unified strategies for diagnosis and follow-up.

### Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^114nGCE7]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

The diagnostic investigations for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, specifically concerning genetic testing, should adhere to the ESMO 2020 guidelines. These guidelines recommend obtaining genetic testing in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasias, such as hyperparathyroidism and/or pituitary tumors, and in those with a family history of neuroendocrine neoplasms or associated diseases. Additionally, features that suggest a hereditary disease warrant genetic testing. It is also advised to obtain genetic testing in young patients (age < 40 years) with gastrinoma.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and therapy of MEN type 1 and type 2 [^112nATwD]. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

This consensus statement is from an international group, primarily consisting of clinical endocrinologists. MEN1 and MEN2 are hereditary cancer syndromes. The most common tumors secrete PTH or gastrin in MEN1 and calcitonin or catecholamines in MEN2. Management strategies have improved after the discoveries of their genes.

In MEN1, there are no clear syndromic variants. Tumor monitoring in MEN1 carriers involves annual biochemical tests and less frequent imaging tests. Neck surgery options include subtotal or total parathyroidectomy, parathyroid cryopreservation, and thymectomy. Proton pump inhibitors or somatostatin analogs are the main management strategies for oversecretion of entero-pancreatic hormones, except insulin. There are several controversies regarding surgeries for most entero-pancreatic tumors, such as the exclusion of most operations on gastrinomas and the indications for surgery on other tumors. It is likely that each MEN1 family carries an inactivating MEN1 germline mutation. Testing for this mutation provides useful information but rarely necessitates intervention.

The most distinctive MEN2 variants include MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), which vary in the aggressiveness of MTC and the spectrum of affected organs. Mortality in MEN2 is more commonly due to MTC than to pheochromocytoma. The goal for all MEN2 carriers is thyroidectomy during childhood, if possible, to prevent or cure MTC. It is probable that each MEN2 index case contains an activating germline RET mutation. RET testing has replaced calcitonin testing for diagnosing the MEN2 carrier state. The specific RET codon mutation correlates with the MEN2 syndromic variant and the age of onset.

### Routine measurement of plasma chromogranin B has limited clinical utility in the management of patients with neuroendocrine tumours [^112BWQoU]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective - Chromogranin A (CgA) and chromogranin B (CgB) are markers for monitoring disease status in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). These are specialized diagnostic tests often necessitating referral of specimens to a supraregional assay service (SAS) laboratory for analysis. The aim of this audit was to assess whether measurement of either plasma CgA or CgB alone provides sufficient clinical information in comparison with the practice of measuring both markers together.

Design - A retrospective analysis was undertaken for all chromogranin tests requested for patients with a known NET diagnosis. Results were categorized based on whether plasma concentrations were elevated for one or both CgA and CgB.

Results - A total of 325 sequential patients with a NET diagnosis had plasma chromogranin levels measured during the period of review. Baseline CgA was elevated in 60.9% of patients. Isolated elevations in CgA (with normal CgB) were found in 44.9% of patients, whilst combined elevations in both CgA and CgB were found in 16% of patients. Combined CgA and CgB concentrations within the normal range were observed for 38.5% of patients. Only two patients (0.6%) had an isolated elevation in CgB at baseline. Both patients had a diagnosis of pancreatic NET and were radiologically stable. Plasma CgA and CgB corresponded with disease stage (localized vs metastatic). CgB in addition to CgA did not provide any significant improvement in diagnostic performance for identification of metastatic disease compared to CgA alone.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, more specifically with respect to histopathology, the ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining and reporting the morphology, grading, and immunohistochemical staining for chromogranin A and synaptophysin for appropriate pathological diagnosis. Consider obtaining somatostatin receptor staining or specific staining for peptide hormones and amines, as well as using molecular markers, based on clinical requirements.

### The impact of re-characterizing metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: A prospective study [^111jwET1]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

This is the first prospective study on how pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (panNET) biology changes over time across all clinically relevant dimensions: hormone spectrum, tumor cell proliferation, and functional imaging profile. At the first disease re-characterization, nearly two-thirds (62%, 13/21) of patients showed changes that resulted in modified patient management in 7/13. Additionally, three out of seven patients experienced further clinically relevant changes during their second re-characterization. These findings highlight the potential significance of re-evaluating the biology of metastatic panNET, particularly at the time of disease progression.

- **Interpretation**: In this research project, we aimed to generate data to determine if, when, and how disease re-characterization of metastatic panNET should be performed. The most significant finding was that most patients experienced clinically relevant changes in disease biology, which led to alterations in their management. This underscores the importance of re-evaluating panNET biology, which could lead to improved treatment strategies. The timepoint for such reassessment still needs to be better defined. Most patients (n = 18) were included at disease progression on systemic therapies, which is a logical time for re-evaluating the management plan. Due to the heterogeneous nature of this disease, we propose that disease re-characterization should involve all relevant dimensions: symptoms, hormones, tumor proliferation, and functional imaging profiles. An individualized approach is needed in the clinical setting to balance different aspects of the disease.

### Preoperative assessment of the pancreas in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^114dp9Ez]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Many serologic and radiographic modalities are used for monitoring multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) patients for pancreaticoduodenal neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). We compared serum markers and imaging studies obtained preoperatively with the gross pathology and immunohistochemical findings and correlated preoperative testing with postoperative outcomes.

- **Methods**: From 2000 to 2008, 52 MEN 1 patients [32 (62%) female; median age 43 years, range 19–74 years] underwent 56 pancreatic operations [49 (88%) distal pancreatectomies] for suspected PNETs. Preoperative serum markers [human pancreatic polypeptide (HPP), gastrin, and glucagon] and imaging [CT, (111)In pentetreotide scintigraphy, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)] were compared to the pathologic findings. Postoperative serum markers and survival were followed.

- **Results**: Human pancreatic polypeptide had the highest agreement between an elevated serum level and positive tumor immunostaining (83% vs. 50% agreement for gastrin vs. 67% agreement for glucagon). Preoperative CT had 81% sensitivity and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97% for PNETs. (111)In pentetreotide scintigraphy had 84% sensitivity and a PPV of 96%. Preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) had 100% sensitivity and PPV, with a close correlation (r(s) = 0.93) between the largest lesion seen on EUS and pathology. Median follow-up was 4.3 years (range 0.1–10.9 years). Overall survival was 89% at 5-year follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Our study substantiates EUS as providing the highest preoperative sensitivity and…

### Update on the clinical management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^111i82aw]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines advise initiating radiological surveillance for the pancreas at age 10, while others advocate postponing until the age of 16, in the absence of signs and symptoms. Modeled data from the Dutch MEN1 cohort show that the estimated age at which the chance is 1%, 2.5%, and 5% of having a clinically relevant NF‐PanNET (≥ 2 cm or documented growth of ≥ 1.6 mm within 1 year above a baseline size of ≥ 15 mm) is 9.5, 13.5, and 17.8 years, respectively. The authors conclude that screening should start in the second decade of life, and a starting age of 13–14 years is justifiable.

Patients with MEN1 are screened for the presence of a gastrinoma by yearly determination of FSG levels. Although classically gastrinoma/ZES is diagnosed biochemically by the combination of an FSG more than tenfold the upper limit of normal, in combination with a gastric pH < 2 (without retained antrum), the biochemical diagnosis of gastrinoma/ZES has become increasingly complicated. This is due to the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the risk of cessation in true ZES, unreliable gastrin assays, and the unavailability of secretin stimulation testing. Recently, experts from the NIH have suggested possible new criteria to diagnose ZES in patients with elevated FSG when gastric acidity cannot be assessed. They rank different combinations of clinical findings — symptoms, secretin test, somatostatin receptor imaging, histology/cytology, and [suspected] presence of MEN1 — into categories of strongly, moderately, weakly, and minimally supportive of the diagnosis of ZES.

### Current practices and novel techniques in the diagnosis and management of neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary [^116zBKCG]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

Approaches to NET subtype identification

Multimodal diagnostic methods are often used to identify and further characterize neuroendocrine neoplasms, with the specific sequence of techniques depending on the clinical presentation. The standard-of-care diagnostic workup typically includes a detailed history and physical examination, laboratory assays for serum biomarkers, diagnostic imaging, and pathology examination of the tumor tissue. Once a diagnosis of a neuroendocrine neoplasm is confirmed through this multidisciplinary process, additional resolution may be necessary to confidently identify the neuroendocrine subtype. Gene expression profiling provides a molecular approach based on tumor biology for NET subtype classification. Diagnostic accuracy of NET subtype classification by gene expression profiling is reported to be 95% or greater, although not all NET subtypes have been clinically validated.

- **Biochemical testing**: The onset of hormone-related symptoms such as flushing, nocturnal diarrhea, and cardiac effects is frequently the first indication that the patient may have a functional neuroendocrine neoplasm. Well-differentiated NETs often secrete hormones or vasoactive substances that can be measured by serum or urinary analysis, with the elevated hormone pattern suggestive of a particular NET subtype. Testing for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is usually recommended regardless of the suspected subtype, with additional tests done according to clinical presentation. Plasma chromogranin A and serotonin and urinary or plasma 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid are often included in this process.

### Morphological and functional investigations of neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas [^111Ut88o]. European Radiology (2003). High credibility.

Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas are rare neoplasms arising predominantly from the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and are thus known as islet cell tumors. More than half of all neuroendocrine tumors are called functioning islet cell tumors because they secrete one or more biologically active peptides that may produce clinical symptoms. Clinical diagnosis of non-functioning, i.e. biologically inactive, tumors is often delayed, and patients tend to present with advanced tumors (size greater than 5 cm) that are easily localized using conventional imaging modalities. On the other hand, symptoms of functioning islet cell tumors usually appear early in the clinical course, making the preoperative localization of these small hormone-producing tumors (size less than 2 cm) difficult with non-invasive methods.

Since functioning islet cell tumors can often be cured by surgical resection, invasive procedures are warranted when necessary for localization diagnosis. Failure to search for, detect, and resect these small tumors will invariably result in persistent symptoms. Regarding the unsatisfactory results of morphological imaging methods, functional studies, especially arterial stimulation with hepatic venous samplings, may provide a preoperative regionalization of the pancreatic adenoma, regardless of its size.

### Guidelines for the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (including carcinoid) tumours (NETs) [^115a8FyC]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

The laboratory diagnosis of gastrinoma may be difficult. Both gastrin and chromogranin A (CgA) are raised in gastrinoma; however, both are also elevated in many common conditions, particularly when gastric acid is reduced or absent, such as in patients with atrophic gastritis or those receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and gastric biopsy are always required to differentiate gastrinoma from atrophic gastritis; secretin stimulation and intragastric pH measurement may also be necessary in some cases.

When circulating gastrin and CgA levels are raised, a fasting specimen is required. It is important to exclude autoimmune atrophic gastritis and eradicate Helicobacter pylori. Recurrent peptic ulcer disease, especially with gastrointestinal bleeding in the absence of H. pylori, strongly suggests gastrinoma. PPIs and H2 antagonists increase both circulating CgA and gastrin levels; therefore, PPIs should be withdrawn with great caution and ideally stopped 10 to 14 days before any planned estimation of circulating fasting gastrin. In patients with suspected gastrinoma, oral H2 antagonists may be used as an alternative during this period, but it is advisable to interrupt their use 48 hours before the test. Patients with a gastrinoma should be advised that it is dangerous to stop PPIs without supervision. Where uncertainty persists regarding the diagnosis, a secretin test may be performed, with or without gastric acid studies.

Patients with gastrinoma may present with circulating gastrin levels that are less than 10% above the reference range. The majority of gastrinomas are…

### The impact of re-characterizing metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: A prospective study [^1161WYGy]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Study objectives, variables, and method for outcome reporting**: Data analyses were finalized once follow‐up for all patients was complete. Our objective was to describe the results and clinical impact of re‐characterizing metastasized panNET patients. First, we aimed to investigate the proportion of patients exhibiting clinically significant changes in disease characteristics, defined as (i) the occurrence of a new hormonal syndrome or relevant hormone secretion, (ii) changes in PET-tracer uptake pattern (loss or gain of 18F-FDG- or 68Ga-DOTATOC-positive tumor lesions), (iii) an increase in Ki-67 index resulting in a transition from low grade to a higher grade panNET, or from low G2 (Ki-67 3% to 10% to < 20%), leading to changes in treatment strategy according to European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) guidelines. Secondly, we aimed to describe disease evolution of panNETs in an unselected cohort with progressive disease by using the collected data and biomaterials. Finally, we sought to explore the potential use of functional imaging as a minimally invasive method to detect increases in tumor proliferation.

- **Biochemistry, tumor markers, and hormones**: A comprehensive panel of relevant hormone and neuropeptide analyses was conducted according to established clinical routines during re‐characterization, and hormonal syndromes were classified accordingly. The hormones analyzed were predetermined in the study protocol and were collected for all patients at study inclusion and further progression.

### Somatostatin analogs versus active surveillance in small pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^112mfca6]. Pancreas (2025). High credibility.

Despite pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) being considered rare pancreatic neoplasms, accounting for about 2% of all pancreatic cancers, they are the second most common malignancy of the pancreas due to their frequency almost doubling over the last 20 years. The majority of newly diagnosed PanNETs are G1-G2 sporadic (not genetically determined), non-functional (NF), and are lesions below 2 cm incidentally detected by the widespread use of axial imaging and/or endoscopic ultrasound in clinical practice for other reasons.

Whether a small NF, G1-G2 PanNET requires treatment may depend on several factors, including the tumor's characteristics (e.g. grade) and the individual patient's circumstances. According to the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society guidelines, if the PanNET is NF, not growing rapidly (G1-G2), and not causing symptoms due to its localization in the pancreas (for example, in the head of the pancreas and likely to cause symptoms versus those in the body/tail), then it may not require surgery. Indeed, NF, G1-G2 PanNETs that are ≤ 2 cm are considered to have lower aggressiveness and a better prognosis than larger tumors.

Recent studies have suggested that active surveillance (AS) may be a viable option for certain patients with small, NF, G1-G2 PanNETs in comparison to surgery. However, data in the literature are inconsistent and limited by the retrospective design of studies and the small number of patients investigated. Because of their relatively heterogeneous biology, the malignant potential of PanNETs and the possibility of progression are not negligible, particularly when considering the tumor's characteristics.

### Chromogranin A is a reliable serum diagnostic biomarker for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors but not for insulinomas [^116kyqBi]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

We studied 89 PNET patients. Among them, 73 underwent curative surgery, and 16 did not undergo operation. All tumors were well differentiated. The clinicopathological characteristics of 89 patients with PNETs and 57 patients with insulinomas were summarized in a table not included here.

- **CgA serum levels in PNET patients and ROC curves**: The median values of CgA levels in 86 healthy controls, 57 patients with insulinomas, and 32 patients with non-insulinoma PNETs were 53.4 ng/ml (range 39.1–94.1 ng/ml), 64.8 ng/ml (range 25.0–164.2 ng/ml), and 192.5 ng/ml (range 26.9–9020.7 ng/ml), respectively. Serum levels of CgA in 89 PNET patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (P = 7.2 × 10⁻⁹). Compared to serum levels in healthy controls, CgA levels were significantly elevated in 32 patients with non-insulinoma PNETs (P = 3.7 × 10⁻⁷). In contrast, levels of CgA in 57 patients with insulinomas were just slightly higher than in healthy participants (median 64.8 ng/ml vs. 53.4 ng/ml). The serum levels of CgA in patients with insulinomas (median 64.8 ng/ml) were significantly lower than in patients with non-insulinoma PNETs (median 192.5 ng/ml), P = 0.001.

### Clinical practice guidelines for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [^112sg3VF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, specifically with respect to indications for screening, the ES 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining an annual plasma biochemical assessment of fasting gastrointestinal tract hormone profile. This includes the measurement of gastrin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, pancreatic polypeptide, chromogranin A, and insulin, with an associated fasting glucose level, as a minimum for screening of gastropancreatic NETs in patients with MEN1.

### Guidelines for the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (including carcinoid) tumours (NETs) [^116nxXqx]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Non-functioning tumours of the pancreas often secrete PP, which may serve as a helpful marker in patients with these tumours.

The majority of rectal tumours do not secrete CgA. However, many secrete PP, and some may secrete enteroglucagon, human chorionic gonadotropin-β, or acid phosphatase. When a marker is identified, this is helpful; however, the absence of a marker does not equate to the absence of a tumour.

A range of peptide markers can be measured in two laboratories in the UK, and specimens may be sent to these laboratories through local hospitals. Some other NHS laboratories measure CgA.

Some peptides show a significant rise postprandially, particularly insulin, gastrin, and PP. These peptides may remain elevated for more than 6 hours; therefore, it is ideal that all specimens should be collected after an overnight fast. For some of the markers (e.g. CgA), a fasting specimen is not required. If specimens at clinics are not always collected following a fast, the fasting or random status of the specimen should be recorded on the accompanying form to enable appropriate interpretation by the laboratory. With the exception of insulin, peptide markers for NETs are all raised in the circulation of patients with renal failure. Interpretation of results from these patients is difficult.

A number of circulating markers have been reported to be of prognostic value: CgA for the majority of tumours, pancreastatin for hepatic tumour bulk, and neurokinin A for serotonin-secreting tumours of the small bowel.

In a significant number of sporadic NETs, cell type may change, and tumours may produce different markers.

### Consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: Guidelines from a Canadian national expert group [^1138KUCt]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are rare, heterogeneous tumors that have been steadily increasing in both incidence and prevalence over the past few decades. These tumors are categorized as functional (F) or nonfunctional (NF) based on their ability to secrete hormones that cause clinically relevant symptoms. Specialized diagnostic tests are required for accurate diagnosis.

Treatment options are diverse and include surgical resection, intra-arterial hepatic therapy, and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Systemic therapy options consist of targeted agents as well as chemotherapy when indicated. The diagnosis and management of pNETs should involve a collaborative team of healthcare practitioners who are experienced in managing such tumors.

Recent advances in pNET treatment options have led to the development of the Canadian consensus document discussed in this report. The discussion includes the epidemiology, classification, pathology, clinical presentation and prognosis, imaging and laboratory testing, medical and surgical management, and recommended treatment algorithms for pancreatic neuroendocrine cancers.

Regarding medical management for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and more specifically with respect to symptomatic management of insulinoma, the ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend providing counseling to patients, and when appropriate, to family and friends. This counseling should address the symptoms of hypoglycemia, including precipitating factors such as exercise and prolonged intervals between meals.
