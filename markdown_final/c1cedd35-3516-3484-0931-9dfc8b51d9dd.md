## Question

A 28-year-old woman with a 7-year history of ulcerative colitis has failed multiple medical therapies and is now being considered for elective proctectomy. She is otherwise healthy, has no children, and expresses concerns about her future quality of life. During the preoperative clinic visit, she asks what she should know about the surgery and its potential long-term effects.

According to current guidelines, what specific topics should you address when counseling this patient preoperatively about the potential effects of proctectomy?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what specific topics should be addressed when counseling a 28-year-old woman with medically refractory ulcerative colitis who is being considered for elective proctectomy, with emphasis on long-term effects and quality-of-life implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline-mandated counseling domains. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and quantify outcomes where possible. Next, I will examine each domain in detail, including fertility, sexual and urinary function, functional outcomes, neoplastic risk, and surgical options. After that, I need to consider perioperative strategy and shared decision-making. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, patient-centered summary and note any uncertainties or areas where counseling should be individualized.

> Let me first confirm the core counseling domains. The ASCRS 2021 guideline explicitly recommends counseling patients with UC undergoing proctectomy regarding possible effects on fertility, pregnancy, sexual function, and urinary function, and this is graded as a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, which anchors the preoperative discussion for this patient [^efbb474a] [^1eff86c6].

> I will now examine fertility effects, since this is often the most critical issue for a 28-year-old woman. Meta-analyses show that infertility increases from roughly 12–20% in medically managed UC to 26–63% after IPAA, with a pooled relative risk around 3.2, and laparoscopic approaches may mitigate this risk compared with open surgery, though the evidence is observational and heterogeneous; importantly, once pregnancy is achieved, outcomes are generally favorable, and IVF success rates are comparable to those without UC, although failed pouches have lower IVF success, so I should present both the magnitude of risk and the availability of reproductive options [^1eff86c6] [^7ba927b7] [^f85c0955] [^ca7b6c4f].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic and modifiable factors. The dominant mechanism appears to be pelvic adhesions and tubal dysfunction from pelvic dissection, which explains why minimally invasive techniques and, in selected cases, ileorectal anastomosis to avoid pelvic dissection may better preserve fertility; I should also counsel that if childbearing is planned soon, delaying proctectomy or choosing a staged strategy with rectal preservation could be considered, recognizing the trade-offs in cancer risk and future surgery needs [^f85c0955] [^8aa48800].

> Next, I should review sexual function. In women, most quality-of-life scores improve within 12 months after IPAA, and dyspareunia is the most commonly reported issue, though rates vary and often improve over time; in men, abnormal ejaculation is uncommon long term, reported around 3% at 10 years, so I need to set expectations while emphasizing that most patients report preserved or improved sexual function after recovery [^1eff86c6].

> Hold on, I should verify urinary function. Urinary function is generally preserved in the immediate postoperative period and long term after IPAA, with clinically significant dysfunction uncommon, though I should still screen for baseline urinary symptoms and discuss transient changes during recovery [^1eff86c6].

> I will now examine functional outcomes and quality of life. After an initial adjustment, patients with IPAA typically average 4–8 daytime bowel movements and 1–2 nighttime movements, with continence generally good but with small risks of frequency, urgency, and nocturnal leakage; pouchitis occurs in about 20–50% of patients over time, most episodes respond to antibiotics, and surveillance pouchoscopy is recommended at 1 year and then every 3–5 years, with closer intervals if neoplasia was present; importantly, quality of life after IPAA or end ileostomy is broadly comparable and often approaches that of healthy populations, so the choice should reflect patient preferences and anatomy [^9fc73c02] [^29b3fa54] [^30e5d9ce] [^e469a4c4].

> But wait, what if the rectum is relatively spared and the patient prioritizes fertility. Ileorectal anastomosis can be considered in carefully selected patients with rectal sparing, avoiding pelvic dissection and potentially preserving fertility, yet it requires lifelong rectal surveillance due to substantial long-term risks of dysplasia and cancer, with cumulative risks rising over decades; I should confirm rectal disease activity and the patient's willingness to comply with surveillance before proposing this option [^8aa48800].

> Next, I should review surgical options and staging. Total proctocolectomy with IPAA, end ileostomy, or continent ileostomy are all acceptable elective strategies, with IPAA being the most common restorative option; in the era of modern immunosuppression, a staged approach is often preferred to mitigate complications, particularly when patients are on high-dose corticosteroids or biologics, and minimally invasive techniques are preferred when available to reduce short-term morbidity without compromising long-term function [^4f4e1907] [^7a453fff] [^41feaee3].

> I need to ensure I address neoplastic risk and surveillance. Complete removal of colon and rectum is curative for the intestinal manifestations of UC, eliminating colitis-associated cancer risk; if any rectal mucosa is retained, such as with IRA or occasionally near the anal transition zone with IPAA, surveillance is mandatory, and patients with UC have an elevated baseline CRC risk that guides pre-colectomy screening and postoperative surveillance planning [^af96939f] [^666996d7] [^29b3fa54].

> Let me consider perioperative optimization and shared decision-making. Early surgical involvement, patient education by an enterostomal therapist, and enhanced recovery pathways improve preparedness and outcomes; patients consistently report wanting more information, earlier surgeon consultation, and peer support, so I should integrate decision aids, connect her with peers, and schedule adequate time for questions to align the plan with her values and goals [^18b37bbb] [^8a0c63dc] [^b78e2b62] [^1986436c] [^70010851].

> Hold on, I should verify medication timing and staging. High-dose corticosteroids increase postoperative infectious complications, so a staged strategy with initial colectomy and ileostomy, followed by IPAA after steroid weaning, is prudent; evidence for anti-TNF exposure is mixed, but many centers favor staging in this context as well, and I should individualize based on disease severity, nutrition, and surgeon experience [^a6a0f02c] [^7a453fff].

> Finally, I should synthesize a concise, patient-centered summary. You should expect that proctectomy with IPAA will likely reduce your fertility by about two- to threefold compared with medical therapy, but pregnancy outcomes after conception are generally excellent and IVF remains an effective path; sexual function is usually preserved or improved after recovery, though dyspareunia can occur; urinary function is typically unaffected; bowel function settles to roughly 4–8 daytime and 1–2 nighttime movements with good continence, and pouchitis is common but treatable; laparoscopic surgery may lessen fertility impact, and if fertility preservation is paramount, rectal-sparing options with surveillance can be considered; throughout, the decision between IPAA and end ileostomy should be guided by your preferences, anatomy, and lifestyle, with support from a multidisciplinary team and peers who have faced similar choices [^1eff86c6] [^f85c0955] [^9fc73c02] [^30e5d9ce] [^41feaee3].

Preoperative counseling for a 28-year-old woman with medically refractory UC facing proctectomy should cover **fertility, sexual function, urinary function, and quality of life** [^efbb474a], with explicit discussion of infertility risk and the potential need for IVF [^1eff86c6] [^7ba927b7]. Counsel on **surgical options** (IPAA, end ileostomy, continent ileostomy) [^4f4e1907], their risks, benefits, and functional outcomes [^e469a4c4], and the need for lifelong surveillance after IPAA or IRA [^29b3fa54] [^8aa48800]. Address **pregnancy planning**, including timing, mode of delivery, and postpartum pouch function [^1eff86c6] [^f85c0955]. Provide written materials, connect with peer support, and ensure shared decision-making to align care with her values and goals [^1986436c] [^70010851].

## Fertility and reproductive considerations

- **Infertility risk**: IPAA increases infertility risk to 26–63% vs 12–20% in nonoperative controls; counsel on this risk and the potential need for IVF [^1eff86c6] [^7ba927b7].

- **Laparoscopic approach**: May reduce infertility risk compared to open surgery; discuss this option [^f85c0955].

- **Pregnancy outcomes**: Pregnancy after IPAA is generally safe, with transient third-trimester pouch dysfunction that typically returns to baseline postpartum; mode of delivery should be individualized [^1eff86c6] [^f85c0955].

- **Timing of surgery**: If fertility is a priority, consider delaying proctectomy or choosing IRA to preserve fertility, with counseling on rectal surveillance needs [^8aa48800] [^f85c0955].

---

## Sexual function

In women, **sexual function** is generally preserved after IPAA, though dyspareunia can occur; quality-of-life scores typically improve within 12 months [^1eff86c6]. In men, **sexual function** is also generally preserved, with abnormal ejaculation reported in only 3% at 10 years [^1eff86c6].

---

## Urinary function

Urinary function is **typically preserved** after IPAA, with no significant long-term urinary dysfunction reported [^1eff86c6].

---

## Surgical options and their implications

| **Attribute** | **Ipaa** | **End ileostomy** | **Continent ileostomy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Description | Most common restorative option; removes all diseased colon and rectum; creates ileal pouch with anal anastomosis [^e469a4c4] | Permanent stoma; eliminates diseased colon and rectum; no pouch [^e0259cc9] | Alternative to conventional ileostomy; internal pouch with continent valve; rarely performed [^b7194c88] |
| Functional outcomes | 4–8 daytime movements, 1–2 nighttime; pouchitis in 20–50%; quality of life often excellent [^9fc73c02] [^e469a4c4] | No pouch; no pouchitis; quality of life comparable to IPAA in many patients [^e0259cc9] | Good quality of life but higher complication and reoperation rates [^b7194c88] |
| Risks | Infertility, pouchitis, pouch failure, pelvic sepsis, anastomotic leak [^1eff86c6] [^e469a4c4] | Stoma complications, dehydration, body image issues [^notfound] | Valve failure, leakage, infection, need for catheterization [^b7194c88] |
| Surveillance | Pouchoscopy at 1 year, then every 3–5 years; more frequent if neoplasia [^29b3fa54] | No pouch surveillance | No pouch surveillance |

---

## Quality of life and psychosocial considerations

Quality of life after IPAA or end ileostomy is **generally excellent**, with many patients reporting satisfaction similar to healthy individuals [^e469a4c4] [^30e5d9ce]. Psychosocial impacts include potential **body image concerns**, anxiety, and depression; provide resources and support [^notfound].

---

## Long-term complications and surveillance

- **Pouchitis**: Occurs in 20–50% of patients; most respond to antibiotics; some require chronic therapy [^notfound].

- **Pouch failure**: Occurs in 5–10%; may require redo pouch or conversion to ileostomy [^notfound].

- **Surveillance**: Lifelong pouchoscopy every 3–5 years after IPAA; more frequent if neoplasia [^29b3fa54].

---

## Patient education and support

Provide **written materials** covering surgical options, risks, benefits, and expected outcomes [^bed1014c]. Connect the patient with **peer support** groups or mentors to share experiences and coping strategies [^70010851]. Use **shared decision-making** to align care with her values, preferences, and goals [^67d7c7d8].

---

## Summary of key counseling points

- **Fertility**: Increased infertility risk after IPAA; consider laparoscopic approach or delay surgery if fertility is a priority [^1eff86c6] [^f85c0955].

- **Sexual function**: Generally preserved; discuss potential dyspareunia and management [^1eff86c6].

- **Urinary function**: Typically preserved after IPAA [^1eff86c6].

- **Surgical options**: IPAA, end ileostomy, continent ileostomy; discuss risks, benefits, and functional outcomes [^4f4e1907] [^e469a4c4].

- **Quality of life**: Generally excellent after IPAA or end ileostomy; address psychosocial concerns [^e469a4c4] [^30e5d9ce].

- **Long-term complications**: Pouchitis, pouch failure, need for lifelong surveillance [^29b3fa54].

- **Patient education**: Provide written materials, peer support, and engage in shared decision-making [^1986436c] [^70010851].

---

Preoperative counseling for a 28-year-old woman with medically refractory UC should comprehensively address **fertility, sexual and urinary function, surgical options, and quality of life**, with explicit discussion of infertility risk and the potential need for IVF [^1eff86c6] [^7ba927b7]. Emphasize **shared decision-making**, provide educational resources, and connect her with peer support to ensure her values and goals guide the surgical plan [^1986436c] [^70010851].

Ulcerative colitis in adults — future directions highlight unmet needs, stating that this guideline did not address the arenas of endoscopic surveillance or management of UC during pregnancy and that these topics will be addressed in future guidelines and a pregnancy consensus statement by the ACG. There is great interest in the application of IUS to the assessment of UC, and further research is needed to define the timing of this tool and the role for transmural assessment in prognosticating treatment response and outcomes. The authors note a great need for head-to-head RCTs to clarify sequencing and positioning of therapies and to understand the role and optimal timing for elective proctocolectomy, emphasizing that such direct evidence is needed to inform comparative effectiveness. Additional priorities include prediction biomarkers for personalized therapy selection, breaking through the existing therapeutic ceiling in UC via novel mechanisms of action and combinations of therapies to improve efficacy without sacrificing safety while addressing costs and access issues, and determining whether earlier advanced treatment in UC improves long-term outcomes. For future IBD guideline updates, the ACG has initiated a rapid update protocol, with updated guidance released annually to provide timely and practical guidance on the ever-changing field.

Ulcerative colitis — Restorative proctectomy (IPAA) counseling: Patients with UC undergoing restorative proctectomy should be counseled regarding possible effects on fertility, pregnancy, sexual function, and urinary function. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Meta-analyses report increased infertility rates of 26% to 63% compared to 12% to 20% in nonoperative controls; natural conception rates after laparoscopic IPAA (31%–73%) or open IPAA (> 50%) vary, and there are no significant differences in cumulative live birth rates after in vitro fertilization between patients with UC and patients without UC, although patients with a failed IPAA had significantly lower in vitro fertilization success rates compared with all other patients with UC. Pregnancy after IPAA is not associated with an increased rate of maternal or fetal complications; pouch dysfunction reported in the third trimester appears to be transient with function returning to pregestational baseline independent of mode of delivery; and when a pouch patient plans a cesarean delivery it is recommended to consider having surgical expertise available to assist, if necessary. Sexual and urinary function are generally preserved: in men, IPAA does not appear to significantly impair sexual function and 10 years after IPAA abnormal ejaculation has been reported in only 3% of men; in women, affected quality-of-life scores improve within 12 months of IPAA, and urinary function does not appear to be significantly affected in the immediate postoperative period.

Ulcerative colitis — Ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) option: Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis may be considered in selected patients who have UC with relative rectal sparing. Grade of recommendation: Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B. IRA is associated with improved functional outcomes and higher quality-adjusted life-years compared with IPAA and avoids a pelvic dissection which may preserve fertility in women; patients undergoing IRA should be counseled regarding the potential need for future medical therapy, recognizing that at 5, 10, and 20 years post-IRA, 10%, 24% to 27%, and 40% undergo completion proctectomy. Surveillance endoscopy of the retained rectum is necessary because dysplasia and adenocarcinoma occur in 7%, 12% to 14%, and 24% and 0% to 3%, 2% to 7%, and 9% of patients at 10, 20, and 25 years, and if conversion to IPAA is required, overall pouch survival of 94% and 92% has been reported for primary and secondary pouches.

### Prospective cohort study of appendicectomy for treatment of therapy-refractory ulcerative colitis [^f4dc0ec1]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Appendicectomy may reduce relapses and need for medication in patients with ulcerative colitis, but long-term prospective data are lacking. This study aimed to analyse the effect of appendicectomy in patients with refractory ulcerative colitis.

Methods

In this prospective multicentre cohort series, all consecutive patients with refractory ulcerative colitis referred for proctocolectomy between November 2012 and June 2015 were counselled to undergo laparoscopic appendicectomy instead. The primary endpoint was clinical response (reduction of at least 3 points in the partial Mayo score) at 12months and long-term follow-up. Secondary endpoints included endoscopic remission (endoscopic Mayo score of 1 or less), failure (colectomy or start of experimental medication), and changes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) (range 32–224), EQ-5D™ and EORTC-QLQ-C30-QL scores.

Results

A total of 28 patients (13 women; median age 40.5years) underwent appendicectomy. The mean baseline IBDQ score was 127.0, the EQ-5D™ score was 0.65, and the EORTC-QLQ-C30-QL score was 41.1. At 12months, 13 patients had a clinical response, five were in endoscopic remission, and nine required a colectomy (6 patients) or started new experimental medical therapy (3). IBDQ, EQ-5D™ and EORTC-QLQ-C30-QL scores improved to 167.1 (P < 0.001), 0.80 (P = 0.003) and 61.0 (P < 0.001) respectively. After a median of 3.7 (range 2.3–5.2) years, a further four patients required a colectomy (2) or new experimental medical therapy (2). Thirteen patients had a clinical response and seven were in endoscopic remission. The improvement in IBDQ, EQ-5D™ and the EORTC-QLQ-C30-QL scores remained stable over time.

Conclusion

Appendicectomy resulted in a clinical response in nearly half of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and a substantial proportion were in endoscopic remission. Elective appendicectomy should be considered before proctocolectomy in patients with therapy-refractory ulcerative colitis.

The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons is dedicated to assuring high-quality patient care by advancing the science, prevention, and management of disorders and diseases of the colon, rectum, and anus. The Standards Committee is composed of Society members who are chosen because they have demonstrated expertise in the specialty of colon and rectal surgery. This committee was created to lead international efforts in defining quality care for conditions related to the colon, rectum, and anus. This is accompanied by developing Clinical Practice Guidelines based on the best available evidence. These guidelines are inclusive, and not prescriptive. Their purpose is to provide information on which decisions can be made, rather than dictate a specific form of treatment. These guidelines are intended for the use of all practitioners, health care workers, and patients who desire information about the management of the conditions addressed by the topics covered in these guidelines. It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all of the circumstances presented by the individual patient.

IPAA — patient selection, age, and obesity considerations: The guideline cautions that an IPAA "may not be suitable for all patients", noting that "Advanced age, significant medical comorbidities, underlying bowel dysfunction, and obesity should be considered to optimize IPAA functional outcomes". Appropriately selected older patients without fecal incontinence may safely undergo IPAA because chronological age alone does not significantly affect short- or long-term functional outcomes, though counseling should account for comorbidities and impaired function; older patients with a pouch may experience worsening stool frequency and increased fecal incontinence with age. Obesity is associated with increased operative difficulty but "is not associated with impaired functional outcomes", and preoperative weight loss and performing "a 3-stage IPAA" to allow time for weight loss and mesenteric lengthening may be useful.

Conclusion

Our findings demonstrate that ulcerative colitis patients play an active role in decision making between IPAA and EI. However, they struggle with obtaining adequate social support and information to support decision-making and perceive these decisions to be overwhelmingly complex. Patients could be better supported in decision-making through a multi-faceted approach that would include increased access to relevant educational resources, surgeons, and peers. Preoperative educational materials should include information about postoperative complications and long-term changes in lifestyle. These materials could help improve decision-making and facilitate discussions with loved ones.

ACG guideline — Grading of recommendations and implications for ulcerative colitis care states that factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include the quality of the evidence, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, risk of harm, and costs/ healthcare resource utilization. Strong recommendations are offered when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects, with patient implications that most individuals would prefer the recommended course and clinician implications that most patients should receive the recommended course or an alternative with similar strength. Conditional recommendations are offered when trade-offs are less certain — either because of low quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced, with patient implications that some individuals would want the suggested course while others may not and clinician implications that a shared decision-making model considering patient values and preferences is appropriate.

Ulcerative colitis surgical decision-making — Individualized assessment and decision making should take into account patient-specific preferences, previous medical therapy including exposure to monoclonal antibodies, and concomitant risk factors for requiring a total abdominal colectomy including age at diagnosis of less than 40 years, extensive colitis, severe endoscopic disease with spontaneous bleeding and deep ulcerations, previous hospitalization for colitis, elevated C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and low serum albumin.

Ulcerative colitis with diagnosed colorectal cancer — operative approach emphasizes that patients with UC diagnosed with CRC should undergo staging and be discussed in a multidisciplinary team tumor board and are typically recommended to undergo total proctocolectomy. For those undergoing total proctocolectomy, an oncological resection with appropriate lymph node harvest should be performed to allow for appropriate oncological staging. Patients with UC diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma who undergo neoadjuvant radiotherapy should be appropriately counseled that an IPAA in this setting may have worse functional outcomes; however, external beam radiation therapy is not an absolute contraindication to subsequent pouch formation.

### Ileostomy or ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis: patient participation and decisional needs [^dc4ffe15]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results further demonstrate that patient participation in decision-making can change with different decisions. In the present study, we found that patients undergoing subtotal colectomy as a first step in their surgical treatment were likely to report a passive role in decision-making regarding the decision to undergo subtotal colectomy, but then later played an active role in making a decision about IPAA vs EI. The reasons for the decreased participation at the time of subtotal colectomy were not purposefully explored in the present study, however, other studies demonstrate that patients making medical decisions tend to defer decision making to physicians when they have more severe disease or disease likely to result in mortality. This finding underscores the importance of reassessing patient desire to participate in decision-making at each step of treatment.

The association between patient education and the desire to engage in shared decision-making has been shown in a variety of disease states including inflammatory bowel disease. The majority of patients in the present study desired increased information prior to making a decision about surgery. The need for improving patient education is particularly relevant in ulcerative colitis patients, because more than 56–62% feel insufficiently informed about their disease. However, patients feel that existing educational materials are not tailored to their needs, including a lack of coverage of important topics, such as long-term recovery, and practical matters, such as returning to exercise, dietary restrictions, and management of stomas. The educational needs of ulcerative colitis patients should be addressed in order to support patients in engaging in decision-making in a meaningful way. Our group previously reported a pilot study demonstrating increased patient knowledge and confidence regarding decision-making among ulcerative colitis patients using a decision aid. It is possible that the identified knowledge gap could be closed through wider dissemination of existing decision aids and web-based sources, which should be specifically evaluated for information completeness using large groups of ulcerative colitis patients and other stakeholders.

### Women's health issues after ileal pouch surgery [^1ef82977]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis who require colectomy. This surgical intervention allows for resection of colon, while offering intestinal continuity with fecal continence, discontinuation of most medications related to ulcerative colitis and reduction in the risk of colitis-associated neoplasia. As a proportion of these patients are women of childbearing age, it is important to understand the impact on reproductive health and function. Although limited data exist, restorative proctocolectomy/IPAA does not seem to adversely affect menstrual function. In general, sexual function is reported to improve postsurgery with the ability to achieve orgasm unaltered. However, dyspareunia is commonly reported post restoratively. Of concern, there are data to suggest that fertility is decreased post-IPAA. The reasons stated are pelvic adhesions and obstruction of fallopian tubes. Laparoscopic approach may improve fertility outcomes by reducing postoperative adhesions as compared with the open approach. Once achieved, pregnancy in patients with IPAA is characterized by a transient increase in stool frequency that resolves postdelivery. Whether vaginal delivery or cesarean section is preferred route of delivery in these patients is still controversial. But commonly cesarean section is advocated for patients' post-IPAA to prevent anal sphincter injury and long-term effects on pouch function. All of these issues should be included in the discussion with women who are contemplating IPAA, so they are well aware of them before deciding on the best management plan.

### ACG releases updated practice guidelines for ulcerative colitis in… [^aa6ed6ae]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The American College of Gastroenterology's Practice Parameters Committee has issued updated practice guidelines for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in adults. The guidelines were generated by an expert panel's review of published evidence and outline the preferred approaches to the treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis, a chronic disease characterized by diffuse mucosal inflammation of the colon and marked by bloody diarrhea, rectal urgency, and tenesmus. Ulcerative colitis affects 250, 000 to 500, 000 people in the United States each year resulting in steep hospital and drug costs as well as lost work. The full text of the updated practice guidelines, which originally appeared in the July 2004 issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, is available at http: //www. acg. gi. org/physicians/guidelines/UlcerativeColitisUpdate. pdf.

3.13.4 Fertility and delivery after restorative proctocolectomy

Good Practice Recommendation 4. For females requiring emergency subtotal colectomy and ileostomy, decisions regarding proctectomy and ileoanal pouch reconstruction should be discussed because of the potential for impaired fertility. Decisions should be personalised, including use of laparoscopic techniques and the option of delaying until after completion of the family (Agreement: 100%).

Any pelvic surgery incurs a risk to fertility. Whereas there is evidence that medical treatment of UC does not impair female fertility, a retrospective systematic review and meta-analysis of fertility rates 1 year after open IPAA surgery showed 63% infertility with a relative risk of 3.91 associated with the surgery, corroborating an earlier meta-analysis showing an infertility rate of 15% for medically-treated UC and 48% after IPAA. Time to conception is longer post-surgery, with a more frequent necessity of in vitro fertilisation and higher incidence of caesarean section. It is likely that Fallopian tube scarring in relation to the procedure is the cause of infertility. In selected female patients without proctitis, subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) may be preferable as this does not impair fertility, although this procedure is not suitable for all and the long-term risk of rectal malignancy remains following IRA. There is evidence that pelvic scarring is much reduced when IPAA is performed laparoscopically. Consistent with this, time to first spontaneous pregnancy following IPAA is shorter in those undergoing laparoscopic surgery in comparison to open procedures. In a retrospective questionnaire-based study comparing fertility in 15 women following laparoscopic IPAA to that in a control group having appendectomy, infertility was demonstrated in 27% which was no different to the control group, suggesting that laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy may be the preferred option for female patients of reproductive age.

### The informational needs and preferences of patients considering surgery for ulcerative colitis: results of a qualitative study [^1986436c]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients considering surgery for ulcerative colitis (UC) face a difficult decision as surgery may or may not improve quality of life. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for UC emphasize the importance of providing quality preoperative information to patients but note no quality studies for the desired content of this information. Our aim was to explore patient information preferences prior to undergoing surgery for ulcerative colitis.

Methods

Semistructured interviews with patients who underwent an operation and patients who considered but declined an operation were conducted. Interviews explored informational preferences, with emphasis on preoperative information given, preoperative information desired but not received, and retrospective informational desires. Interviews were transcribed and coded using an inductive thematic analysis using NVivo software. Data saturation was assessed after 12 interviews, with interviews continuing until saturation was achieved. Ethical approval was gained prior to interviews commencing (16/NW/0639).

Results

A total of 16 interviews were conducted before data saturation was achieved (male n = 7, female n = 9). Eight patients declined surgery, and 8 opted for subtotal colectomy with permanent end ileostomy (n = 5) or ileoanal pouch (n = 3). A total of 4 themes and 14 subthemes were identified. Three dominant subthemes of informational shortcomings emerged: "long-term effects of surgery", "practicalities of daily living", and "long-term support". Peer support was desired by patients but was infrequently supported by health care professionals.

Conclusions

Current preoperative information does not address patient informational needs. Surgical consultations should be adapted to suit patient preferences. Clinical practice may need to be altered to ensure that patients are better supported following surgery.

Ulcerative colitis–associated colorectal neoplasia — regardless of extent of disease at initial diagnosis, patients should undergo a screening colonoscopy within a year of the onset of symptoms, and surveillance colonoscopy should, ideally, be performed when the colonic disease is in remission; patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis should begin screening at the time of diagnosis and undergo surveillance annually; European Crohn's and Colitis Organization guidance recommends annual colonoscopy for highest-risk patients (PSC or history of dysplasia or stricture), every 2 to 3 years for intermediate-risk patients (extensive or long-standing colitis or a family history of CRC), and a 5-year interval for low-risk patients, while the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommends annual surveillance colonoscopy for patients with PSC, active inflammation, a history of dysplasia or CRC in a first-degree relative, or a stricture and every 1 to 3 years for average-risk patients; patients with a rectal stump after colectomy are at risk of developing neoplasia and should undergo regular proctoscopic surveillance.

Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) — outcomes and techniques: Total proctocolectomy with IPAA is described as the most commonly performed operation in UC and is associated with "an acceptable morbidity rate (19%–27%)", and "an extremely low mortality rate (< 0.5%)", with quality of life approaching healthy populations; when appropriate, "a minimally invasive approach should typically be considered". J-type pouches are commonly used, S-pouch may be useful when more length is needed, and "a stapled anastomosis is typically preferred over a mucosectomy with handsewn anastomosis" because data suggest better function and symptom-specific quality of life.

### Is there still a role for continent ileostomy in the surgical treatment of inflammatory bowel disease? [^b7194c88]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The continent ileostomy (CI) was first described in 1969 as an important advancement in the surgical treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis, providing an option for fecal continence to patients who would otherwise require a conventional ileostomy. The CI enjoyed a brief period of relative popularity during the 1970s before being displaced by today's gold standard for the surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis, the restorative proctocolectomy (ileal pouch-anal anastomosis [IPAA]). Although the CI is only rarely performed today, it still has a role to play in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have failed medical treatment. Current indications are patients with failed IPAAs who are not candidates for redo-IPAA, patients who require total proctocolectomy but cannot be reconstructed with IPAA, and patients with an existing conventional ileostomy that is adversely affecting their quality of life. CI, however, is a complex procedure that carries significant risk of both postoperative complications and the need for reoperation over the long term due to slippage of the nipple valve. Patients being considered for this procedure should undergo extensive preoperative counseling and must have a thorough understanding of the associated risks and a realistic vision of anticipated benefits. In well-selected and properly motivated patients, however, CI can be durable in the majority with long-term pouch survival rates approaching 80%. Published data suggest that these patients enjoy greater quality of life than their counterparts with a conventional ileostomy and that 95% would choose to undergo the procedure again or recommend it to another.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) — early surgical involvement for hospitalized patients: When escalating the medical care of hospitalized patients with UC, early surgical consultation should be considered to optimize patient education and position surgery as a relevant treatment option when there has been an insufficient response to the escalation of medical therapy. Consensus statements recommend surgical consultation for hospitalized patients with UC who do not show signs of improvement within 72 hours of initiating intravenous corticosteroids or rescue therapy, because early operative intervention has been associated with decreased postcolectomy complications. Additional considerations include early involvement of an enterostomal therapist to facilitate stoma education, establish preoperative ostomy care, appropriately mark the anticipated stoma location, and alleviate patients' anxiety.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) surgical management — Approximately 15% to 20% of patients with UC still require colectomy for medically refractory disease and/or neoplasia of the colon or rectum. Complete removal of all at-risk tissue (ie, the colon and the rectum) is considered curative for the intestinal manifestations of UC. Operative strategies for patients with UC may include a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy or ileoproctostomy or total proctocolectomy with a permanent end ileostomy, a continent ileostomy, or construction of an IPAA, all of which are increasingly performed using minimally invasive techniques. Optimal management involves a multidisciplinary team approach including colorectal surgeons, gastroenterologists, radiologists, pathologists, nutritionists, and enterostomal therapists.

Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) staging during immunosuppressive therapy: A staged approach for an IPAA should typically be considered in patients being treated with high-dose corticosteroids or monoclonal antibodies (Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C). Because preoperative exposure to corticosteroids is associated with adverse postoperative outcomes, patients maintained on high-dose corticosteroids should typically undergo total abdominal colectomy and end ileostomy as their initial stage rather than a total proctocolectomy with IPAA, and after a staged colectomy proctectomy with IPAA should typically be delayed until corticosteroids have been weaned. High-dose corticosteroids, defined as > 20 mg of prednisone equivalents per day, are associated with significantly increased postoperative infectious complications. Immunomodulators have not been associated with increased postoperative complications, and the decision to perform a proctocolectomy and IPAA in a staged fashion should not typically be influenced by immunomodulator exposure. Evidence regarding preoperative anti-TNF therapy is mixed: the 2 largest single-center series showed increased anastomotic leak and pelvic sepsis; the largest meta-analysis reported increased early complications after IPAA (OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 2.37–7.15) and late complications (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.27–4.05); whereas the largest prospective study did not show any association, and another prospective study of 94 consecutive patients with UC found no association between preoperative anti-TNF drug levels and adverse postoperative outcomes.

Improving decision making

When discussing ways to improve decision-making, three themes emerged. Themes included a desire to have peer education regarding surgical options, earlier consultation with a surgeon, and the desire for more information prior to making a decision (Table 4).

Table 4
Representative quotes regarding ways to improve decision-making between end ileostomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis

Within the theme of desire for more information, 3 subthemes emerged. First, patients expressed a desire to have more information in general terms:

There were quite a few details that I wish I had known before. But I didn't know to ask about them, even.

Others desired more information about complications:

I wanted to hear more details about the complications. And as far as I remember, it wasn't trivialized. But it was kind of, like, not enough attention was paid to discuss that in length.

Still others wished to have more information about what life would be like in the long-term:

I mean, most of the stuff I heard sounded as close to a regular life as you could get. So I don't know. To me, there's lots of realities that I don't feel like are really introduced or just explained.

Only three patients felt content with the information they used to decide about surgery. These patient experiences demonstrate the variable needs of patients as they go through the decision-making process and highlight the need for reliable and relevant information for patients who are making decisions between IPAA and EI.

3.13.2 Outcomes after colectomy for UC

Statement 21. We suggest that surgical resection of the colon and rectum in ulcerative colitis should be offered to patients who have chronic active symptoms despite optimal medical therapy. Ileoanal pouch reconstruction or end ileostomy provide equivalently good quality of life, and are a matter of patient choice (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 94.4%).

Proctocolectomy followed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is well-established as a management option for UC. Multiple case series have demonstrated good outcomes in terms of quality of life, with a majority of patients indicating they would undertake the same procedure again. In one of the larger series, 95% of patients reported good or excellent functional and quality of life outcomes over up to 10 years of follow-up. A further study showed no deterioration in functional outcome over 10 years or more. Comparison with medical therapies are difficult since there are no published comparative data, and in the absence of randomisation there would be selection bias. Comparison of IPAA to end ileostomy suggests that both are associated with equivalent quality of life, and the decision should be a matter of patient choice after detailed explanation and counselling. Functional outcomes are just as good after laparoscopic-assisted pouch surgery.

Statement 22. We suggest that pouch surgery should be performed in specialist high-volume referral centres (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement 97.4%).

Ileoanal pouch surgery is not currently a centralised service in the UK. However, data from the UK suggest that high-volume centres (more than 100 procedures between 1996 and 2008) had lower pouch failure rates. In this study, high-volume centres had a pouch failure rate of 5.2%, similar to the rate of 5.3% reported from the Cleveland Clinic (5.3%) in the USA. A further study showed that there is a significant learning curve for pouch surgery, with improving outcomes dependent on the number of procedures undertaken for both trainees and senior staff. Likewise, there is evidence that management of leaks after IPAA procedure improves with increasing experience, and results in better pouch salvage rates.

### Inflammatory bowel disease in pregnancy clinical care pathway: a report from the American Gastroenterological Association IBD parenthood project working group [^ca7b6c4f]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Fertility concerns — In women with CD and UC whose disease is in remission and who have never had surgery, fertility rates are equal to those in the general population, whereas women who have had IPAA surgery, proctectomy, and permanent ostomies have decreased fertility; laparoscopic rather than open IPAA surgery may improve fertility rates, and women with active IBD may also have decreased fertility. A review reported that 17% of women with IBD are voluntarily childless compared to 6% in the general population. Medical therapy for IBD, including biologics, steroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, and mesalamine, does not impair fertility. Infertility care should be individualized, women with CD above the age of 30 years may have decreased ovarian reserve, and patients who have tried unsuccessfully to conceive for 6 months should be referred for infertility evaluation, particularly if they have had surgery. IBD medications have no clear effect on egg freezing or assisted reproductive technology (ART) efficacy; in the authors' experience, hormones used as part of ART have no adverse effect on IBD activity. ART in women with CD and UC is not as effective as in infertile women in the general population and is less effective after CD surgery, likely due to a lesser chance of achieving a chemical pregnancy (positive human chorionic gonadotropin 2 weeks after embryo transfer); once pregnant, women with CD and UC have equal chances of achieving a live birth compared to women in the general population who underwent ART.

Methods

Participants

We enrolled adult patients age 18–70 years with ulcerative colitis who had surgery at the University of California, San Francisco resulting in an IPAA or a permanent EI in any number of stages. Eligible patients completed surgical therapy 4–24 months prior to the interview. We required a minimum of 4 months so that patients had recovered from surgery and would have experience adjusting to living with IPAA or EI. We also limited enrollment to those who completed surgery within the prior 24 months to maximize recall regarding preoperative decision-making processes. The age limit of 70 was chosen to optimize the group where IPAA would be a surgical option. We identified all candidate patients, and then did a selective invitation process (letter followed by telephone call) to balance enrollment of patients into age categories (age 18–30, age 31–50, and age 51–70). In each of these age groups we planned to recruit at least one man, one woman, one patient undergoing permanent end ileostomy and one undergoing IPAA. These categories were developed in an effort to obtain a balanced mix of views and opinions with the hypothesis that patient experiences and perceptions would vary by age, sex, and procedure type.

Interviews

Semi-structured interviews were conducted by a female member of the team with prior experience conducting qualitative research (RH). The interview guide (Additional file 1) consisted of open- and closed-ended questions refined iteratively by pilot testing with a large team that included an experienced colorectal surgeon (EF), decision scientist (EO), qualitative expert, and gastroenterologist. Interviews took place in person (n = 3) or over the phone (n = 13) and were conducted from a research office. Participants did not have an established relationship with the interviewer, nor were participants given any personal information about the interviewer. At the conclusion of each interview, participants were asked if they would like to discuss anything else about their decision-making experience. Interviews ranged in length from 25 to 58 min. No field notes were taken during or after the interview. Transcripts were not returned to participants for comment or correction. All participants completed survey of basic demographic and disease-specific information, which was recorded in REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure web-based application. Participants were offered a small monetary incentive for participating.

Guideline scope and outcomes — this guideline addresses adult outpatients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and hospitalized adults with ASUC, focusing on "immunomodulators, biologics, and small molecules for induction and maintenance of remission", and notes that "in general, most drugs that are initiated for induction of remission are continued as maintenance therapy, if they are effective", which "is considered standard of care" with the assumption effective drugs "will be continued for maintenance of remission". It states "this guideline does not address surgical management of moderate to severe UC or ASUC", and for ASUC evidence profiles include "short-term colectomy risk (within 3 months of hospitalization)". Effect estimates "are presented as the risk for failure to induce or maintain remission, that is, a relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) < 1 suggests that the drug under consideration is more effective than the comparison drug or placebo for induction or maintenance of remission".

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^4fc0b57e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — goals for managing patients — UC is a chronic condition for which therapy is required to induce and maintain remission; therapeutic decisions should be categorized into those for (i) induction and (ii) maintenance, and strategies for management of UC should reflect the patient's and provider's goals and recognize the chronic nature of the disease. Symptomatic remission relates to improvement in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) while endoscopic mucosal healing is defined as restoration of intact mucosa without friability; deep remission implies both symptomatic and endoscopic remission and should be assessed as a preferred goal of management, and corticosteroid-free remission is defined based on symptomatic and endoscopic response during a steroid-free period of time (usually more than 12 wk). Initial treatment of UC should focus on restoration of normal bowel frequency and control of the primary symptoms of bleeding and bowel urgency; an endoscopically healed mucosa is associated with sustained remission and reduced risk of colectomy. Histologic remission is associated with some improved clinical outcomes but has not yet been validated prospectively as a preferred target for treatment, and control of mucosal inflammation may reduce dysplasia risk. Given the chronic nature of UC and the therapies for UC, monitoring for disease-related and drug-related complications is important, routine visits are recommended to monitor for relapse and address health maintenance needs, and patients with UC should be screened for coexistent anxiety and depressive disorders with resources provided when identified.

### Impact of proctectomy on continence and sexual function in women [^76b8dc06]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Whether treating a patient with colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, or a variety of other gastrointestinal ailments, gastroenterologists sometimes need to enlist the help of colorectal surgeons to treat their patients. Surgical resection of the rectum is a frequently preformed procedure that has changed significantly over the last century. We have progressed from the early twentieth century, when removal of the rectum and anus with a permanent colostomy was a revolutionary and life-saving treatment for rectal cancer, to the present era of rectal resection and multiple, complex options for its reconstruction. Extensive knowledge of the pelvic anatomy is necessary in order for surgeons to preserve pelvic function while excising diseased tissue. Pelvic surgery poses unique challenges to patients, and proctectomy can drastically affect a woman's continence, sexual function, and fertility. It is imperative for gastroenterologists to understand how proctectomy can affect their patient's quality of life, independent of their disease state.

### Ulcerative colitis: female fecundity before diagnosis, during disease, and after surgery compared with a population sample [^f99aecbb]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Women with ulcerative colitis generally have normal fertility. The aim of this study was to compare patients' fecundability before and after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis with the fecundability of the general population.

Methods

Historical follow-up was performed on 343 consecutive female patients aged 10.6–40.5 years at surgery and a reference population of 1200 women aged 25–40 years. A total of 290 (85%) patients and 661 (55%) women in the reference population agreed to participate in a structured telephone interview concerning reproductive behavior and waiting times to pregnancy. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier plots were used for analysis.

Results

Surgery significantly reduced the ratio of patient to reference population fecundability, which decreased to 0.20 (P < 0.0001). Before diagnosis and from diagnosis until colectomy, the fecundability of the patients was similar to that of the reference population.

Conclusions

Female patients with ulcerative colitis have normal fecundity before surgical treatment. Surgery severely reduces female fecundity.

### Inflammatory bowel disease and pregnancy: fertility, complications and treatment [^f4b5eee1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

In rare cases, pregnant women with severely active IBD might require surgery to treat life-threatening conditions refractory to medical therapy, such as toxic megacolon, intestinal obstruction and significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Colectomy during the second and third trimester is low-risk without significant adverse pregnancy outcomes. If necessary, mothers with less than 28 weeks gestation can opt for the Turnbull-Blowhole colostomy for colonic decompression and ileal diversion with delayed restorative proctocolectomy and IPAA. On the other hand, for patients with more than 28 weeks gestation, a synchronous cesarean section with subtotal colectomy is a feasible alternative. Surgery for perineal fistulas is usually postponed until after delivery. Non-obstetric surgeries are generally well tolerated and should ideally be performed in the second trimester.

A systematic review of 3 databases of women who underwent IBD surgery during pregnancy noted that there were no maternal or fetal mortalities, but there was an almost 50% preterm delivery rate. Approximately 18% of cases were de novo presentations and the most common reasons were refractory UC and small bowel perforations.

### Ileostomy or ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis: patient participation and decisional needs [^70010851]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Up to 30% of patients with ulcerative colitis will undergo surgery resulting in an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) or permanent end ileostomy (EI). We aimed to understand how patients decide between these two options.

Methods

We performed semi-structured interviews with ulcerative colitis patients who underwent surgery. Areas of questioning included the degree to which patients participated in decision-making, challenges experienced, and suggestions for improving the decision-making process. We analyzed the data using a directed content and thematic approach.

Results

We interviewed 16 patients ranging in age from 28 to 68 years. Nine were male, 10 underwent IPAA, and 6 underwent EI. When it came to participation in decision-making, 11 patients felt independently responsible for decision-making, 3 shared decision-making with the surgeon, and 2 experienced surgeon-led decision-making. Themes regarding challenges during decision-making included lack of support from family, lack of time to discuss options with the surgeon, and the overwhelming complexity of the decision. Themes for ways to improve decision-making included the need for additional information, the desire for peer education, and earlier consultation with a surgeon. Only 3 patients were content with the information used to decide about surgery.

Conclusions

Patients with ulcerative colitis who need surgery largely experience independence when deciding between IPAA and EI, but struggle with inadequate educational information and social support. Patients may benefit from early access to surgeons and peer guidance to enhance independence in decision-making. Preoperative educational materials describing surgical complications and postoperative lifestyle could improve decision-making and facilitate discussions with loved ones.

### Surveillance issues in inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis [^facc83cf]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

This review article on the surveillance of patients with ulcerative colitis provides an overview of the criteria for evaluating screening and surveillance programs and applies the criteria to the available evidence to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance of patients with ulcerative colitis. We examine the clinical outcomes associated with surveillance, the additional clinical time required to confirm the diagnosis of dysplasia and cancer, compliance with surveillance and follow-up, and the effectiveness of the individual components of a surveillance program, including colonoscopy and pathologist's interpretation. The disability associated with colectomy is considered, as are the cost and acceptability of surveillance programs. Patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis are at risk for developing colorectal cancer. Recommended surveillance colonoscopy should be supported. New endoscopic and histopathologic techniques to improve the identification of high-risk patients may enhance the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surveillance practices.

### Short article: recommendations on rectal surveillance for colorectal cancer after subtotal colectomy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^ea214129]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 30% of patients with ulcerative colitis require a colectomy during their disease course. This substantially reduces colorectal cancer risk, although it is still possible to develop colorectal neoplasia in the remaining rectum. Although clear and well-accepted surveillance guidelines exist for patients with inflammatory bowel disease with an intact colon, specific surveillance recommendations following colectomy are less clear. Here, we aim to summarize the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for developing colorectal cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who underwent subtotal colectomy with a permanent end ileostomy and rectal stump, or with ileorectal anastomosis. Subsequently, gained insights are integrated into a proposed endoscopic surveillance strategy of the residual rectum.

Medical care for individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC) has become increasingly subspecialized, and this population presents unique challenges in the delivery of care. Most points of contact are with gastroenterology subspecialty clinics, and primary care providers have shown concern and unfamiliarity about managing these individuals. Gastroenterology subspecialists need to be comfortable discussing the unique preventive care needs of patients with UC, tailored to specific recommendations based on their demographics and current medication usage. This article reviews pertinent topics in preventive care for individuals with UC to provide a framework for gastroenterology subspecialists to be able to provide patient-centered care.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the surgical management of ulcerative colitis [^29b3fa54]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis post-ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA) surveillance — Endoscopic surveillance should typically be performed after IPAA (Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C). Retained rectal mucosa near the anal transition zone (ATZ) following IPAA is at risk for developing dysplasia, and although the risk of dysplasia in the rectal remnant/ATZ or ileal pouch is low, periodic endoscopic evaluation should typically be performed. Although examination intervals are not universally accepted, typically, pouchoscopy is performed 1 year after surgery and then every 3 to 5 years thereafter; for patients who had neoplasia at the time of their proctocolectomy, pouchoscopy every 1 to 3 years should be considered. Pouchoscopy is often performed using a more flexible scope (eg, an upper endoscope) to facilitate retroflexion within the pouch, and treatment of neoplasia diagnosed under these circumstances warrants a multidisciplinary discussion because there is limited evidence to guide practice and the clinical scenarios are often heterogeneous.

### Threefold increased risk of infertility: a meta-analysis of infertility after ileal pouch anal anastomosis in ulcerative colitis [^7ba927b7]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Increased infertility in women has been reported after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis but reported infertility rates vary substantially.

Aims

(1) To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relative risk of infertility post-IPAA compared with medical management; (2) to estimate the rate of infertility post-IPAA; and (3) to identify modifiable risk factors which contribute to infertility.

Methods

Medline, EMBASE, Current Contents, meeting abstracts, and bibliographies were searched independently by two investigators. The titles and abstracts of 189 potentially relevant studies were reviewed; eight met the criteria and all data were extracted independently. Consensus was achieved on each data point, and fixed effects meta-analyses, a funnel plot, and sensitivity analyses were performed.

Results

The initial meta-analysis of eight studies had significant heterogeneity (p = 0.004) due to one study with very high preoperative infertility (38%). When this study was omitted, the relative risk of infertility after IPAA was 3.17 (2.41–4.18), with non-significant heterogeneity. The weighted average infertility rate in medically treated ulcerative colitis was 15% for all seven studies, and the weighted average infertility rate was 48% after IPAA (50% if all eight studies are included). We were unable to identify any procedural factors that consistently affected the risk of infertility.

Conclusions

IPAA increases the risk of infertility in women with ulcerative colitis by approximately threefold. Infertility, defined as achieving pregnancy in 12 months of attempting conception, increased from 15% to 48% in women post-IPAA for ulcerative colitis. This provides a basis for counselling patients considering colectomy with IPAA. Further studies of modifiable risk factors are needed.

Target audience and use of recommendations — the guideline describes intended users and emphasizes context-specific application. The target audience for this guideline includes health care professionals (ie, primary care, gastroenterology, and surgical professionals who care for patients after IPAA), patients, and policy makers. This guideline is not intended to impose a standard of care, but rather to provide the basis for rational, informed decisions for patients and health care professionals. Statements regarding the underlying values and preferences, as well as qualifying comments should not be omitted when quoting or translating recommendations from this guideline. Recommendations are intended to provide guidance for typical scenarios that arise among patients with pouchitis and other inflammatory conditions of the pouch; no recommendation can consider all unique circumstances that must be accounted for when making recommendations for individual patients. Shared decision-making with discussion of potential benefits and harms of therapy, particularly for conditional recommendations, and consideration for specific tradeoffs and patient preferences and values should be undertaken when making treatment decisions.

### A Treat-to-target update in ulcerative colitis: a systematic review [^81ee59d9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Payer perspective

Payers will require clear and unequivocal assessments of the favorable risk-benefit ratio for T2T approaches vs the current status quo before this paradigm enters the mainstream of coverage. Ideally, these assessments would be supported by long-term randomized controlled trials, as well as adequate cost-effectiveness analysis. Evidence will be needed demonstrating that earlier aggressive treatment (or alternatively a more rapid step-up approach) and frequent monitoring may be more cost-effective in the long-term despite increased short-term costs. Obviously, the development of less costly and burdensome monitoring strategies would also lower the barrier to acceptance.

Patient perspective

Patient considerations could be key to the success of personalized T2T approaches because motivated patients would be expected to remain adherent and compliant with protocols, even during times of disease remission and symptom resolution. Physicians should discuss specific goals that patients may have and patient concurrence with the treatment target. Patient adherence to a T2T approach will require their acceptance of dose escalation if the goal is deeper level healing or remission (histological or molecular/biomarker). Personalized regimens should consider disease severity and a patient's tolerance of aggressive treatment and possibly repeated procedures and testing, as well as the risk factors for complications, relapse, and side effects. Ideally, patient education would also foster the incorporation of lifestyle changes (dietary recommendations, etc.), which may have limited intrinsic efficacy but could contribute to symptom improvement.

Ultimately, the overarching aim of a T2T approach in UC is to meaningfully modify the disease course, restoring QoL and preventing major long-term functional impairment and disability. Therefore, measuring how T2T strategies deliver against specific goals under each perspective will be critical to validate this clinical paradigm and propel its wider adoption. Undoubtedly, such validation will require studies that are ambitious in scope (encompassing measures of clinical status, surgery rates, resource utilization, cost-effectiveness, patient function, QoL, and PROs), large in size, and lengthy in duration. Real-world cohorts may offer a good platform for such studies, although the challenges of conceptualizing comparative schemas (i.e. what would the reference controls for such a study be, and would historic data be valid) and reaching investigator consensus in the definition of suitable treatment targets and outcome measures should not be underestimated. Alternatively, large prospective clinical trials investigating the benefit of a T2T approach in UC, similar to that of CALM or REACT2 in CD, could help clinicians understand the value and feasibility of meeting targets with current therapies and monitoring tools.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^60e530ff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

### Current misunderstandings in the management of ulcerative colitis [^c8214d05]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Past and ongoing therapeutic concepts for ulcerative colitis have only been moderately successful. A significant proportion of patients with ulcerative colitis will still have to undergo colectomy and overall half of the patients do not achieve sustained remission, leading to impairment of physical and mental health, social life, employment issues and sexual activity. Reluctance to treat patients early on with sufficiently potent drug regimens is obvious. Several popular misconceptions might have led to this situation. First, ulcerative colitis is still considered a more 'benign' disease than Crohn's disease. Furthermore, the general assumption is often that colectomy can 'cure' the disease. Mucosal healing as a therapeutic target has not been widely accepted. Finally, the use of antitumour necrosis factor antibodies in ulcerative colitis has been low because this treatment is considered to be less effective than in Crohn's disease. In the current review we try to disprove these misunderstandings by discussing relevant studies showing how harmful this disease can be and explaining why future studies targeting sustained suppression of inflammation could have an enormous impact on the natural course of the disease. Until these studies are available, we encourage physicians to intensify and maintain treatment until sustained remission and mucosal healing has been reached.

### Up-to-date surgery for ulcerative colitis in the era of biologics [^7ff8cfbf]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: In recent decades, biologics have resulted in significantly improved medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC). Rates of surgery for UC are declining. However, there is still a controversial question of the relation of biologics to postoperative adverse outcomes and the most appropriate timing for operative intervention. Areas covered: In this review, we explore the updated treatment algorithm of acute severe colitis, describe postoperative outcomes in patients exposed to biologics preoperatively, and discuss the primary indications for staging surgery in chronic refractory cases, largely with prolonged medical therapy. Expert opinion: Delaying pouch construction to when patients are in better health is suggested as a safer strategy over the long term. The surgical management of UC patients in the biologic era needs to be individualized, and a case-based multidisciplinary decision is critical for improved outcomes and a reduction of morbidity and mortality.

### Simultaneous development of ulcerative colitis in the colon and sigmoid neovagina [^be37efc9]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Vaginoplasty using sigmoid colon is a common technique for creation of a neovagina. However, special consideration must be given to potential long term consequences of using a colonic conduit for vaginal replacement. We report on the youngest described case in which a patient developed ulcerative colitis refractory to medical therapy with simultaneous involvement of a sigmoid neovagina requiring total proctocolectomy and neovaginectomy. A 17 year old XY female with a history of gonadal dysgenesis and sigmoid graft vaginoplasty presented with a history of bloody, mucoid vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea and weight loss. Colonic and neovaginal biopsies demonstrated active colitis with diffuse ulcerations, consistent with ulcerative colitis. Despite aggressive immunosuppressive treatment she had persistent neovaginal and colonic bleeding requiring multiple transfusions, subtotal colectomy and ultimately completion proctectomy and neovaginectomy. It is imperative to recognize that colectomy alone may be an inadequate surgical intervention in patients with ulcerative colitis and a colonic neovaginal graft and that a concomitant neovaginectomy may be integral in providing appropriate treatment.

### Creation of an institutional preoperative checklist to support clinical risk assessment in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) considering ileoanal pouch surgery [^755f96ff]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the most established restorative operative approach for patients with ulcerative colitis. It has associated morbidity and the potential for major repercussions on quality of life. As such, patient selection is crucial to its success. The main aim of this paper is to present an institutional preoperative checklist to support clinical risk assessment and patient selection in those considering IPAA.

Methods

A literature review was performed to identify the risk factors associated with surgical complications, decreased functional outcomes/quality of life, and pouch failure after IPAA. Based on this, a preliminary checklist was devised and modified through an iterative process. This was then evaluated by a consensus group comprising the pouch multidisciplinary team (MDT) core members.

Results

The final preoperative checklist includes assessment for risk factors such as gender, advanced age, obesity, comorbidities, sphincteric impairment, Crohn's disease and pelvic radiation therapy. In addition, essential steps in the decision-making process, such as pouch nurse counselling and discussion regarding surgical alternatives, are also included. The last step of the checklist is discussion at a dedicated pouch-MDT.

Discussion

A preoperative checklist may support clinicians with the selection of patients that are suitable for pouch surgery. It also serves as a useful tool to inform the discussion of cases at the MDT meeting.

And patients found that specific people were helpful, while others were not:

My Dad's just kind of there, literally, he's just kind of there. My sister, she doesn't really like to talk about it, especially when, like, she almost fainted when she came in to see me when I was here after my surgery. She doesn't like thinking about me being sick, or knowing anything about it, really. But it was mainly me and my mom. I don't think I've ever really made an executive decision, you know, completely by myself.

It was common that stigma regarding ileostomy surgery was a source of difficulty in feeling supported:

The people that I decided not to include in divulging I was having this kind of surgery were the people who were, like, 'Oh, that would be the last thing. I don't know what I would do if I had that. That's horrible'… So there have been some people in my life who, again, have this stigma of what this is like, having an ileostomy. And I say that their negativity is what played a role in me having to keep it from them. So as far as my decision-making for the surgery, I decided not to take their opinions in account.

One patient felt comfortable having less involvement from family members:

Well, there was no one to talk it over with. I mean, I had my mom. I mean, no one really understands, either from an intellectual aspect, or a technical aspect. And the emotional part, you know, I never really need any help with that.

Ulcerative colitis patients vary in their desire for social support and in the amount of support available when making a decision between permanent EI and IPAA, highlighting the role for an individual assessment of patient needs during decision making.

Segmental colectomy in highly selected ulcerative colitis patients — observational outcomes indicate that although total proctocolectomy is most often recommended to remove all at-risk tissue, selected patients with an increased operative risk or poor functional status may benefit from a segmental colectomy depending on the degree and extent of colitis, and appropriate ongoing endoscopic surveillance of the retained colon and rectum is necessary when a segmental colectomy is performed. In a retrospective study of 59 patients with UC with a median age of 73 years, 24 underwent a segmental colectomy (40% had active colitis at operation) and 35 underwent a total proctocolectomy (77% had active colitis at operation; p = 0.005) and, over a median follow-up period of 7 years, no patient undergoing segmental colectomy developed metachronous cancer. In another retrospective Swedish study of 51 patients with UC who underwent segmental colectomy (n = 22) or proctocolectomy (n = 29), none of the patients undergoing segmental colectomy developed metachronous CRC at a mean follow-up of 9.4 years, although 10 patients underwent subsequent proctocolectomy for medically refractory UC.

### Surgical management of ulcerative colitis in the era of biologicals [^e9ecbec1]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Proctocolectomy has been a curative option for patients with severe ulcerative colitis. In recent years, there has been a growing use of medical salvage therapy in the management of patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed at reviewing the role of surgical management in a time of intensified medical management on the basis of published trial data. The aim was to determine the efficacy of aggressive medical versus surgical management in achieving multifaceted treatment goals.

Methods

A comprehensive search of Pubmed, Medline, the Cochrane database was performed. Abstracts were evaluated for relevance. Selected articles were then reviewed in detail, including references. Recommendations were then drafted based on evidence and conclusions in the selected articles.

Results

The majority of patients with UC will not need surgery. However, steroid-refractoriness and steroid-dependence signal a subset of patients with more challenging disease. Biological therapy has been shown to achieve short-term improvement and temporarily reduce the need for a colectomy. However, there is a substantial financial and medical price to pay because a high fraction of these salvaged patients will still need a curative colectomy but may be exposed to the negative impact of prolonged immunosuppression, chronic illness, and a higher probability to require 3 rather than 2 operations. Proctocolectomy with ileo-anal pouch anastomosis-performed in 1, 2, or 3 steps depending on the patient's condition-remains the surgical procedure of choice. Even though it has its share of possible complications, it has been associated with excellent long-term outcomes and high levels of satisfaction, such that in the majority of patients they become indistinguishable from unaffected normal individuals.

Conclusions

The current data demonstrate that use of medical salvage therapy in the treatment of UC will likely continue to grow and evolve. Consensus is being developed to better define and predict failure of medical therapy and clarify the role of the different treatment modalities. For many patients, sacrificing the nonresponsive diseased colon is an underused or unnecessarily delayed chance to normalize their health and life. Biologicals in many instances may have to be considered the bridge to that end.

### Ulcerative colitis practice guidelines in adults: American College of Gastroenterology, practice parameters committee [^6d2aa676]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Guidelines for clinical practice are aimed to indicate preferred approaches to medical problems as established by scientifically valid research. Double-blind placebo controlled studies are preferable, but compassionate-use reports and expert review articles are used in a thorough review of the literature conducted through Medline with the National Library of Medicine. When only data that will not withstand objective scrutiny are available, a recommendation is identified as a consensus of experts. Guidelines are applicable to all physicians who address the subject regardless of specialty training or interests and are aimed to indicate the preferable but not necessarily the only acceptable approach to a specific problem. Guidelines are intended to be flexible and must be distinguished from standards of care, which are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of specifics in any health-care problem, the physician must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables in existence at the moment of decision. Guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the board of trustees. Each has been intensely reviewed and revised by the Committee, other experts in the field, physicians who will use them, and specialists in the science of decision analysis. The recommendations of each guideline are therefore considered valid at the time of composition based on the data available. New developments in medical research and practice pertinent to each guideline will be reviewed at a time established and indicated at publication to assure continued validity. The recommendations made are based on the level of evidence found. Grade A recommendations imply that there is consistent level 1 evidence (randomized controlled trials), grade B indicates that the evidence would be level 2 or 3, which are cohort studies or case-control studies. Grade C recommendations are based on level 4 studies, meaning case series or poor-quality cohort studies, and grade D recommendations are based on level 5 evidence, meaning expert opinion.

Surgery in ASUC is indicated when the disease is medically resistant, there are intolerable side effects of medication, or when there is life-threatening haemorrhage, toxic megacolon or perforation. Toxic megacolon is a devastating complication of severe colitis, characterised by radiographic distension of the colon often with fever, tachycardia, neutrophil leucocytosis and anaemia.

In this setting, the operation of choice is a subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy with long rectal stump. This could be performed laparoscopically or open according to local expertise, although a laparoscopic approach is likely to result in shorter length of stay and reduced risk of infectious complications.

Care should be taken to avoid leakage from the rectosigmoid stump, either by formation of mucous fistula, locating the top of the remnant in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall, or closing the stump but leaving a transanal catheter in the initial postoperative period to prevent stump 'blow-out', with no clear evidence of the preferred technique. If the patient wishes to consider restoration of intestinal continuity with a proctectomy and ileoanal pouch, this should not be undertaken in the acute setting, given the significant risk of complications in a patient who is likely to be clinically unwell, hypoalbuminaemic and on immunosuppressive medication. Timing of pouch surgery should be an individualised decision with multidisciplinary input, with a minimum of 3 months and preferably 6 months from the initial subtotal colectomy in order that adhesions may be safely manageable and the patient allowed time to generally recover from the initial procedure. A population cohort study from Sweden showed that the median time to subsequent reconstructive surgery is almost 12 months. At the time of ileoanal pouch surgery, a temporary covering loop ileostomy will reduce the clinical anastomotic leak rate as well as the septic sequelae of a leak, but may be omitted in optimal circumstances. A subsequent anastomotic leak from a non-defunctioned ileal pouch-anal anastomosis would generally require defunctioning.

### Delphi consensus survey: the opinions of patients living with refractory ulcerative proctitis and the health care professionals who care for them [^b048a3c8]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) has a prevalence of 1 in 125 (0.8%). It is unclear at any one time how many patients with UC have ulcerative proctitis where inflammation is confined to the anatomical region of the rectum. Refractory ulcerative proctitis is a prevalent problem and there is a large unmet need within IBD research on this chronic, progressive condition.

A ratio of 4.2:3.7:2.2for extensive colitis (E3), left-sided colitis (E2) and proctitis (E1) has been reported, respectively, with the highest prevalence of ulcerative proctitis identified at 33%. In a recent prospective European population-based inception cohort, 31% (93/300) of patients with UC have E1 at diagnosis, with 24% progressing to E2 and 14% progressing to E3 at the end of 7-year follow-up. The pooled frequency of UC extension rates are 22.8%, more specifically 17.8% at 5 years and 31% at 10 years, or 17.8% (95% CI 11.2 to 27.3) from E1 to E3, 27.5% (95% CI 7.6 to 45.6) from E2 to E3 and 20.8% (95% CI 11.4 to 26.8) from E1 to E2. Controlling the disease in limited proctitis is essential to preventing disease extension and any possible risks that may result from extension, such as a more severe clinical course and an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

In patients whose disease does not progress and remains confined to the rectum, ulcerative proctitis is still often responsible for distressing symptoms such as tenesmus, urgency, faecal incontinence, proximal constipation and rectal bleeding, leading to a reduced quality of life. A third (31%) of patients with ulcerative proctitis have refractory disease. Refractory disease is defined as active proctitis which fails rectal and oral therapy with aminosalicylates (5-ASA) and corticosteroids.5-ASA suppositories are the first-line treatment in patients with refractory disease, followed by immunomodulators and/or biological therapies. Treatment of refractory proctitis remains challenging because these patients are systematically excluded from randomised controlled trials with drugs with new modes of action. In the absence of controlled data, recommendations for the management of ulcerative proctitis are therefore extrapolated from data in more extended UC or from small real-world evidence.

### Ileostomy or ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis: patient participation and decisional needs [^3e9c9f8a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The surgery is going to change your life. So if you need to make some drastic changes in your life, you might as well be the one in charge of that.

Others expressed that the surgeon's opinion was an important part of decision making:

I felt like [IPAA] was… the option for me. All the information [the surgeon] gave me, you know, my age, and my health, would increase my chances of success, and again, it would be a better choice for me.

Those who experienced surgeon-led decision making felt comfortable trusting the opinion of the surgeon:

Well, I put all my faith in my doctors. And it's like, you know, they're in the business. I'm not… so I put a lot of faith in them. And when [the surgeon] told me that I'd have problems at my age… well, I just went along with her, because I figured, you know, she's the professional not me.

Seven patients underwent a subtotal colectomy as a first step in treatment. In this group, 6 patients had a passive tone in decision making regarding the choice to have surgery, and in many instances, didn't see that there was a choice to be made. This sometimes was due to the severity of the illness:

There was really no [choice] - I didn't care. I mean, just do anything, but do it now… just get [the colon] out of me.

The Humira didn't work. They put me on the TPN [total parenteral nutrition]. And then that's when they said, 'We're going to need the surgery'. And so it wasn't like I had a doctor's appointment, walked in and somebody said, 'We need to discuss surgery'.

### Ileostomy or ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis: patient participation and decisional needs [^03fba590]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study demonstrated that some patients struggled with inadequate support from family members and there was a desire for increased peer support as a mechanism to improve the decision-making process. This support gap has been challenging in inflammatory bowel disease patients because, although other studies show that patients wish to have peer support when they are making decisions, structured, regular peer support groups for inflammatory bowel disease often fail. One reason for this finding is that patients find peer support helpful during flares of disease or when they need help with a particular problem as opposed to when they are feeling well. This challenge indicates that a different "on-demand" structure for peer support is needed, such as online groups that patients can utilize when they need specific support, such as around the time of surgery.

The patients enrolled in the present study desired earlier consultation with a surgeon. This finding is in agreement with prior work that shows that more than half of UC patients would have preferred to have an earlier operation. We recommend that surgical consultation not be viewed as a failure of medical management. Involving surgeons early is particularly relevant because a multidisciplinary team-based approach to inflammatory bowel disease is increasingly viewed as important and is recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology and British Society of Gastroenterology. Earlier consultation with a surgeon could also address patient concerns of the overwhelming complexity of the information and not having enough time with the surgeon, as surgical discussions could be spaced out over time and new questions answered as they arise.

This study provides a rich qualitative analysis of decision making between IPAA and EI among patients with ulcerative colitis, however, there are limitations that must be considered when interpreting the results. First, the results are based on a relatively small sample from a single institution. In order to create the generalizability, we performed purposeful enrollment of patients across age groups, sex, and procedure type and ensured saturation prior to completing enrollment. Second, we performed interviews postoperatively after decision-making was completed. Patient postoperative experiences could change the way that patients view their decision-making process, and it may be difficult for patients to recall information from the past. However, we attempted to mitigate these influences by conducting interviews 4–24 months after surgery, a shorter time interval than used in prior studies.

Ulcerative colitis restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA) — For patients with UC undergoing restorative total proctocolectomy with IPAA, a 2-stage, 3-stage, or modified 2-stage approach is preferred for most patients (Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). Two-stage, 3-stage, and modified 2-stage approaches to IPAA are the most common pouch operations performed, and nearly 3 quarters of IPAAs are performed with a 2-stage approach. In a retrospective series of 144 patients with medically refractory UC who underwent a 2-stage IPAA (n = 116) or 3-stage IPAA (n = 28) over an 11-year period, perioperative complications were significantly influenced by surgeon experience (high-volume surgeons were defined as having performed > 50 IPAAs) and not by emergent operative status or preoperative exposure to corticosteroids or anti-TNF therapy, and a 2-stage IPAA was not associated with an increased risk of anastomotic leak or pouch failure. Another series of 212 patients with IPAA compared a 2-stage (n = 157) with a 3-stage (n = 55) and found no differences in postoperative complications, including rates of anastomotic leak, pouchitis, or pouch failure; of note, there were no differences in the preoperative exposure to corticosteroids or monoclonal antibodies between the 2 groups. On the other hand, 2 multicenter studies found improved postoperative outcomes with a 3-stage approach, and in practice it is important to individualize treatment.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of outcomes after elective surgery for ulcerative colitis [^3221bc2c]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

Approximately 20%-30% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) will undergo surgery during their disease course, the vast majority being elective due to chronic refractory disease. The risks of elective surgery are reported variably. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarize the outcomes after elective surgery for UC.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted that analysed studies reporting outcomes for elective surgery in the modern era (> 2002). It was prospectively registered on the PROSPERO database (ref: CRD42018115513). Searches were performed of Embase and MEDLINE on 15 January 2019. Outcomes were split by operation performed. Primary outcome was quality of life; secondary outcomes were early, late and functional outcomes after surgery. Outcomes reported in five or more studies underwent a meta-analysis of incidence using random effects. Heterogeneity is reported with I 2, and publication bias was assessed using Doi plots and the Luis Furuya-Kanamori index.

Results

A total of 34 studies were included (11 774 patients). Quality of life was reported in 12 studies, with variable and contrasting results. Thirteen outcomes (eight early surgical complications, five functional outcomes) were included in the formal meta-analysis, all of which were outcomes for ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). A further 71 outcomes were reported (50 IPAA, 21 end ileostomy). Only 14 of 84 outcomes received formal definitions, with high inter-study variation of definitions.

Conclusion

Outcomes after elective surgery for UC are variably defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the range of reported incidences and provides practical information that facilitates shared decision making in clinical practice.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^9fc73c02]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Normal bowel function after ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC) and typical pouchitis symptoms — after an initial postoperative adjustment, patients with IPAA can expect to average 4–8 bowel movements per day and 1–2 bowel movements per night; typical symptoms described in pouchitis include increased stool frequency, urgency, lower abdominal pain or cramping, and/or pelvic discomfort, and clinical symptoms of pouchitis do not necessarily correlate with findings on endoscopy or histology.

### Impact of inflammatory bowel disease on women's reproductive life: a questionnaire-based study [^9d67e9a1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Taking into account the number of pregnancies in the two groups, we did not find significant differences between female patients with IBD and healthy women. Likewise, we did not find significant differences between female patients with IBD and healthy women regarding the occurrence of complications during pregnancy. However, we observed a sixfold higher risk of complications in patients with active disease than in women in disease remission, similar to those reported in the literature. The disease reactivation during pregnancy was unrelated to the active state at conception, conversely to those reported in the literature.

Regarding the frequency of abortions, we have recorded that this is significantly increased in women with IBD, both considering spontaneous and VTP. There are limited studies about this topic; a Danish cohort study by Nørgård et al. reported that pregnant female patients with IBD are not more likely to choose an elective abortion compared with the general population. Regarding the rate of cesarean deliveries, we did not find a difference between patients and controls. The last guidelinesreport that the literature does not support a specific preference for cesarean section over vaginal delivery in patients with IBD regarding damage of the anal sphincter in the case of restorative proctocolectomy or development of de novo perianal disease. Therefore, the mode of delivery for these patients should be taken case by case by a multidisciplinary team.

In confirmation of what was highlighted by Selinger et al.women with IBD in our cohort breastfeed less frequently than healthy women, primarily for personal choice or for fear that the therapy could affect the children's health (13.1% versus 3.4%). However, most of these patients were taking mesalamine, which is allowed during breastfeeding by both international guidelines and medical agencies.

Limitations

It must be emphasized that our study has limitations: first, since it was a single-center study, the number pool of patients recruited was limited, especially those with at least one pregnancy. All data come from self-reported patient answers, which could lead to a potential recall bias; however, we believe that pregnancy is such an essential moment in a woman's life that the recall bias is reduced. Moreover, as it is a cross-sectional survey and patient reported outcomes, you are not able to accurately assess the IBD disease activity at the time of conception or pregnancy. Finally, we observed that the CI of the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes in active IBD is very wide. This may be due to the low number of events in this subgroup of patients (active versus remission).

### Considerations and complications in patients undergoing ileal pouch anal anastomosis [^1ef3716e]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) preserves fecal continence as an alternative to permanent end ileostomy in select patients with ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. The procedure is technically demanding, and surgical complications may arise. This article outlines both the early and late complications that can occur after IPAA, as well as the workup and management of these potentially morbid conditions.
