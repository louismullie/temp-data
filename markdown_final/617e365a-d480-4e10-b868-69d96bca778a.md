## Question

what is the BMR test?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the "BMR test" is, how it is measured, and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining basal metabolic rate and distinguishing it from resting metabolic rate. Then, I should verify the gold-standard measurement method and the calculation used. Next, I will set the standardized pre-test conditions and steady-state criteria. After that, I need to review alternatives when indirect calorimetry is not available and quantify their error. Then, I will examine physiological and clinical factors that influence BMR. Finally, I should synthesize clinical applications, limitations, and provide a precise, clinically useful definition of the BMR test.

> Let me first confirm what BMR represents. Basal metabolic rate is the minimal energy required to sustain essential physiological functions in a post-absorptive state, with the subject awake, motionless, and in a thermoneutral environment, typically reported in kcal/day or normalized to body mass and time for comparison across individuals. Wait, let me verify something I almost glossed over: I initially thought that expressing energy as kcal·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹ is simply "a MET", but that's imprecise; 1 MET is a convention approximating resting oxygen consumption at about 1 kcal·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹, and it overestimates measured RMR in many adults by roughly 10–15%, so I should not equate BMR in those units with a MET without caveats [^11536WNV] [^113AaVFj]. I need to ensure the physiological basis is clear: thyroid hormones (T3/T4) increase tissue oxygen consumption and thereby raise basal metabolic rate, which is why thyroid dysfunction materially alters BMR [^112v6nEJ].

> I will now examine how BMR is measured. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the reference standard and the calculation. The gold standard is indirect calorimetry, which quantifies oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production and converts these gas exchange data to energy expenditure using the Weir equation, usually implemented by validated metabolic carts and hood, canopy, or mouthpiece/mask interfaces [^116w25bj]. Let me double-check device considerations: a ventilated hood or canopy is typical in adults, while a face mask can be more acceptable in children with stable results after about 20 minutes, and handheld systems can approximate group means but show wide individual limits of agreement that limit clinical decision-making for individuals [^116tiHj1] [^116R7QXY]. I need to ensure steady-state protocols are applied because brief, unstable snapshots can mislead estimates of true basal expenditure [^113uFSW1].

> Next, I should review standardized pre-test conditions, since failure here undermines validity. The subject should fast for approximately 12 hours to eliminate the thermic effect of food, abstain from exercise for at least 12–24 hours, and be measured in the morning in a thermoneutral room while awake, supine, still, and relaxed, often with a slight head elevation; afternoon measurements run about 100 kcal/day higher than the morning, and circadian variation in RMR can confound interpretation if timing is inconsistent [^114b6DWX] [^1175KzqU] [^113yjx3f]. Let me verify duration and data handling: a 30–60 minute session with an initial equilibration period discarded and steady-state selection improves accuracy and reliability, which I should explicitly enforce in the protocol [^113uFSW1].

> I need to check the steady-state requirement carefully. The best correlation between short measurements and 24-hour energy expenditure occurs when oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production vary less than about 10% over several minutes; more lenient criteria reduce agreement and inflate variability, so I should confirm that the coefficient of variation for VO2 is under 10% during the analyzed window, which in children using a mask often stabilizes by 20 minutes with low within-test variability [^113uFSW1] [^116tiHj1]. Hmm, wait a minute, if steady state is not achieved, I risk reporting variability rather than true basal metabolism, so I should document whether steady state was met and repeat the measure if not [^113uFSW1].

> But what if indirect calorimetry is unavailable? Let me consider predictive equations and their limitations. In general adults, the Mifflin–St Jeor equation outperforms Harris–Benedict, which often overestimates, yet accuracy varies by population and can drift by ± 10–30% for individuals, so I should state the expected error margin explicitly [^115vP7NQ] [^112Tm9mG]. In critical illness and mechanical ventilation, population-specific equations such as Penn State or ventilator-integrated models perform best at the group level but still show imperfect individual accuracy, with the Penn State approach among the most accurate across subgroups in ICU cohorts [^1151yV8b] [^115n49XR]. I should double-check athletic and geriatric populations: Cunningham's FFM-based equation performs comparatively well in high-level athletes, while in old-old adults common formulas, including Mifflin–St Jeor, can be biased and imprecise, underscoring the need for either direct measurement or population-specific models [^115gbqKY] [^114YhzVw]. Hold on, I should verify disease-specific biases too: equations tend to overestimate in HFpEF and CKD by roughly 10–20%, which argues for measured RMR when nutritional dosing carries risk [^113BHzJJ] [^112Tm9mG].

> Let me think about physiologic determinants that influence BMR and must be accounted for during interpretation. Fat-free mass is the dominant determinant, with age-related BMR decline largely reflecting loss of metabolically active tissue; after controlling for body composition, obese and non-obese individuals may have similar resting expenditure, and sex differences persist but diminish when scaled to FFM [^115fjraf] [^115TbP9j]. I should confirm environmental and behavioral modulators: short-term sleep restriction lowers RMR by about 2.6% and racial differences show lower RMR in African Americans compared with Caucasians at similar composition, while therapeutic moderate hypothermia markedly reduces measured expenditure, all of which can bias testing if not standardized or documented [^111mZ2gz] [^1136M8Ay]. I need to ensure endocrine status is considered: thyroid hormone excess raises and deficiency lowers BMR, although in some pediatric obesity cohorts with subclinical hypothyroidism, measured BMR may be unchanged despite lipid perturbations, reminding me to pair calorimetry with clinical context [^112v6nEJ] [^111ZvSRA]. Finally, hold on, I should verify autonomic and metabolic disease effects: in spinal cord injury with autonomic dysfunction, BMR may not differ materially when composition is matched, and basal RER differences in type 2 diabetes are inconsistent across studies, so blanket assumptions risk error [^116BuiNS] [^115xyvTD].

> Next, I should review clinical applications and practical limitations so my guidance is actionable. Clinically, measured BMR or RMR informs precise nutrition prescriptions for obesity management, geriatrics, heart failure, kidney disease, oncology, athletes, and critical care, and helps identify hypo- or hypermetabolic states, but the method's cost, operator time, and need for controlled conditions limit widespread use. Let me reconsider reliability: even under standardization, intra-individual variability hovers around 5–6%, afternoon values run higher than morning by about 100 kcal/day, and circadian influences can mimic differences in thermic effect of food across meals unless modeled, so timing and replication matter [^114b6DWX] [^113yjx3f]. I should double-check device selection: portable systems may perform acceptably at the group level yet show wide individual limits of agreement, so for individual therapeutic decisions I should prefer high-quality carts or repeat measures to mitigate error [^116R7QXY].

> Now I will synthesize the definition of the BMR test as a protocol I can defend clinically. The BMR test is a standardized indirect calorimetry procedure designed to quantify the minimal energy expenditure necessary to maintain vital functions at rest, conducted after a 12-hour fast, with no recent exercise, in a thermoneutral room, in the morning when feasible, with the subject awake, supine, and still, and analyzed only during a verified steady state using the Weir equation to calculate energy expenditure from VO2 and VCO2 [^113uFSW1] [^116w25bj]. Let me first confirm the execution details: discard the initial equilibration, document that VO2 and VCO2 vary less than about 10% during the analyzed window, and note any deviations in timing, posture, temperature, or medications that could bias results; if steady state is not achieved, repeat the test rather than reporting an unstable value [^113uFSW1]. When calorimetry is not feasible, I may estimate with validated equations such as Mifflin–St Jeor and clearly communicate an expected individual error of roughly 10–30%, choosing population-specific formulas when appropriate and prioritizing direct measurement in high-risk settings like CKD, HFpEF, or critical illness [^115zYrcD] [^112Tm9mG] [^113BHzJJ] [^1151yV8b]. Finally, I need to ensure interpretation accounts for body composition, age, sex, endocrine status, race, sleep, and environmental factors, and I should avoid equating per-kilogram, per-hour units with "1 MET" without noting the known overestimation relative to measured resting metabolism in many adults [^115fjraf] [^113AaVFj].

The BMR test measures the **energy your body uses at complete rest** to maintain vital functions [^115zYrcD]. It is typically assessed by **indirect calorimetry**, which calculates energy expenditure from oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production under strict fasting, rest, and thermoneutral conditions [^114b6DWX]. BMR is influenced by age, sex, body composition, and hormones [^113AaVFj] [^112v6nEJ] and guides nutrition and weight management [^115fjraf]. When indirect calorimetry is unavailable, predictive equations are often used but **can be inaccurate in certain populations** [^112Tm9mG].

---

## Definition and physiological significance

BMR is the **minimal energy required to sustain vital functions at rest** — such as breathing, circulation, temperature regulation, and cellular metabolism — and accounts for about 60–75% of total daily energy expenditure, making it a key determinant of energy balance and body weight [^115zYrcD].

---

## Methods of measurement

### Indirect calorimetry (gold standard)

Indirect calorimetry, the **gold standard** for measuring BMR, calculates energy expenditure from oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) [^113uFSW1]. It is performed under standardized conditions including ≥ 12-hour overnight fasting, complete rest in a thermoneutral environment, and avoidance of recent physical activity or caffeine intake [^116tiHj1]. The method is highly accurate and reliable but requires specialized equipment and trained personnel [^116w25bj].

---

### Predictive equations (alternative method)

- **Principle**: Estimates BMR using demographic and anthropometric variables (age, sex, weight, height) [^115zYrcD].

- **Common equations**: Harris-Benedict, Mifflin-St Jeor, and WHO equations [^1151yV8b].

- **Limitations**: Less accurate than indirect calorimetry, especially in populations with altered body composition or metabolic conditions [^113BHzJJ].

## Factors influencing BMR

| **Factor** | **Effect on BMR** |
|-|-|
| Age | Decreases with age due to loss of lean body mass [^115GeoKz] |
| Sex | Higher in males due to greater muscle mass [^113AaVFj] |
| Body composition | Higher with increased lean mass [^1113WZpw] |
| Hormonal status | Thyroid hormones significantly increase BMR [^112v6nEJ] |
| Genetic factors | Genetic variations influence BMR [^117GzuS3] |
| Environmental temperature | Extreme temperatures increase BMR |

---

## Clinical and research applications

- **Clinical nutrition**: Guides dietary planning and weight management strategies [^115fjraf].

- **Endocrinology**: Assesses metabolic effects of hormonal disorders (e.g. thyroid dysfunction) [^112v6nEJ].

- **Sports medicine**: Determines energy requirements for athletes [^115gbqKY].

- **Research**: Investigates metabolic adaptations to interventions (e.g. calorie restriction, exercise) [^1174vzau].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Variability**: BMR measurements can vary due to circadian rhythms, recent activity, and dietary intake [^113yjx3f] [^114b6DWX].

- **Population-specific accuracy**: Predictive equations may be inaccurate in certain populations (e.g. elderly, obese, chronic kidney disease) [^112Tm9mG] [^113BHzJJ].

- **Practical constraints**: Indirect calorimetry requires specialized equipment and trained personnel [^116w25bj].

---

The BMR test measures the energy required to maintain vital functions at rest; **indirect calorimetry** is the gold standard [^113uFSW1]. BMR is influenced by age, sex, body composition, and hormones and is used in clinical nutrition, endocrinology, sports medicine, and research.

### Examining variations of resting metabolic rate of adults: a public health perspective [^113AaVFj]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to address the lack of recent comprehensive efforts to examine existing studies on the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of adults, focusing on the effects of common population demographic and anthropometric characteristics. We reviewed the literature on RMR (kcal·kg(-1)·h(-1)) to determine the relationship of age, sex, and obesity status to RMR as compared with the commonly accepted value for the metabolic equivalent (MET; e.g. 1.0 kcal·kg(-1)·h(-1)).

- **Methods**: Using several databases, we identified scientific articles published from 1980 to 2011 that measured RMR, and from those, others dating back to 1920 were identified. One hundred and ninety-seven studies were identified, resulting in 397 publication estimates of RMR that could represent a population subgroup. An inverse variance weighting technique was applied to compute means and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Results**: The mean value for RMR was 0.863 kcal·kg(-1)·h(-1) (95% CI = 0.852–0.874). It was higher for men than women, decreased with increasing age, and was less in overweight than normal-weight adults. Regardless of sex, adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg·m(-2) had the lowest RMR (< 0.741 kcal·kg(-1)·h(-1)).

- **Conclusions**: No single value for RMR is appropriate for all adults. Adhering to the nearly universally accepted MET convention may lead to the overestimation of the RMR by approximately 10% for men and almost 15% for women, and be as high as 20%-30% for some demographic and anthropometric combinations. These large errors raise questions about the longstanding adherence to the conventional MET value for RMR.

### Variability of measured resting metabolic rate [^114b6DWX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

The necessity of a 12-hour fast before measuring resting metabolic rate (RMR) is often a barrier to conducting these measurements. This study compared RMR measurements obtained in the morning and afternoon and across repeated days to elucidate the magnitude and sources of variability.

Healthy men (n = 12) and women (n = 25) aged 21–67 years, with body mass indexes (in kg/m²) ranging from 17 to 34 and body fat ranging from 6% to 54%, completed four RMR measurements. RMR measurements were conducted in the morning (following a 12-hour fast and 12 hours post-exercise) and in the afternoon (following a 4-hour fast and 12 hours post-exercise) on two separate days using the ventilated-hood technique. Body composition was assessed through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

The mean (± SE) afternoon RMR was significantly higher than the morning RMR on both visit 1 (1593.5 ± 35.6 compared with 1508.0 ± 31.5 kcal/day; P = 0.001) and visit 2 (1602 ± 29.3 compared with 1511.4 ± 35.9 kcal/day; P = 0.001). The two morning measurements (r = 0.93) and the two afternoon measurements (r = 0.93) were highly correlated, and no significant differences between measurements were observed. The mean difference between the morning and afternoon measurements was 99.0 ± 35.8 kcal/day (6%).

Repeated morning and evening measurements of RMR were stable and highly correlated. Day-to-day measurements of RMR were not significantly different. RMR measured in the afternoon following a 4-hour fast and exercise was approximately 100 kcal/day higher than RMR measured in the morning.

### Are prediction equations reliable for estimating resting energy expenditure in chronic kidney disease patients [^112Tm9mG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

The determination of resting energy expenditure (REE) is the primary step for estimating the energy requirement of an individual. Although numerous equations have been formulated for predicting metabolic rates, there is a lack of studies addressing the reliability of those equations in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether the main equations developed for estimating REE can be reliably applied for CKD patients.

- **Methods**: A total of 281 CKD patients (124 non-dialysis, 99 haemodialysis, and 58 peritoneal dialysis) and 81 healthy control individuals were recruited. Indirect calorimetry and blood sample collection were performed following a 12-hour fasting period. Two of the most traditionally used equations for estimating REE were chosen for comparison with the REE measured by indirect calorimetry: (i) the equation proposed by Harris and Benedict, and (ii) the equation proposed by Schofield, which is currently recommended by the FAO/WHO/UNU.

- **Results**: Schofield's equation exhibited a higher REE [1492 ± 220 kcal/day (mean ± SD)] in relation to Harris and Benedict's equation (1431 ± 214 kcal/day; P < 0.001), and both prediction equations showed higher REE in comparison with the reference indirect calorimetry (1352 ± 252 kcal/day; P < 0.001). In patients with diabetes, inflammation, or severe hyperparathyroidism, the REE estimated by the Harris and Benedict equation was equivalent to that measured by indirect calorimetry. The intraclass correlation of the REE measured by indirect calorimetry with Schofield's equation was r = 0.48 (P < 0.001) and with the Harris equation [information cut off].

### "Cool" topic: Feeding during moderate hypothermia after intracranial hemorrhage [^1136M8Ay]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Therapeutic moderate hypothermia (MH; T core 33°C-34°C) is being studied for the treatment of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Nutrition assessment begins with accurate basal metabolic rate (BMR) determination. Although early enteral nutrition (EN) is associated with improved outcomes, it is often deferred until rewarming. We sought to determine the accuracy of predictive BMR equations and the safety and tolerance of EN during MH after ICH.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients were randomized to 72 hours of MH or normothermia (NT; T core 36°C-37°C). Harris-Benedict (BMR-HB) and Penn-State equation (BMR-PS) calculations were compared with indirect calorimetry (IC) at day (D) 0 and D1–3. Patients with MH received trophic semi-elemental gastric EN. Occurrences of feeding intolerance, gastrointestinal (GI)-related adverse events, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were analyzed with a double-sided matched pairs t-test.

- **Results**: Thirteen patients with ICH participated (6 MH, 7 NT). The mean time to initiate EN was 29.9 (MH) vs. 18.4 (NT) hours (P = 0.046). Average daily EN calories received D0–3: 398 (MH) vs. 1006 (NT) (P < .01). Three patients with MH experienced high gastric residuals prior to prokinetic agents, one had mild ileus, and one patient with NT vomited. No GI-related adverse events were reported. One patient with MH and one patient with NT had VAP. Two patients with MH received IC, and from D0 to D1–3, BMR-HB remained stable (1331 kcal), BMR-PS decreased (1511 vs. 1145 kcal, P = 0.5), and IC decreased (1413 vs. 985 kcal, P = 0.2).

### New predictive resting metabolic rate equations for high-level athletes: A cross-validation study [^115gbqKY]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Low credibility.

The present study aims to assess the agreement between the measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) using indirect calorimetry and different predictive equations (predicted RMR), and to propose and cross-validate two new predictive equations for estimating the RMR in high-level athletes.

- **Methods**: The RMR of 102 athletes (44 women) was assessed using indirect calorimetry, whereas body composition was evaluated using skinfolds. Comparisons between measured and predicted RMR values were performed using one-way ANOVA. Mean difference, root mean square error (RMSE), simple linear regression, and Bland-Altman plots were employed to evaluate the agreement between measured and predicted RMR. The accuracy of predictive equations was analyzed using narrower and wider accuracy limits (± 5% and ± 10%, respectively) of measured RMR. Multiple linear regression models were used to develop the new predictive equations based on traditional predictors (equation 1) and the stepwise method (equation 2).

- **Results**: The new equations 1 and 2 demonstrated good agreement based on the mean difference (3 and -15 kcal·d⁻¹), RMSE (200 and 192 kcal·d⁻¹), and R² (0.71 and 0.74), respectively, and accuracy (61% of subjects within the limit of ± 10% of measured RMR). Cunningham's equation provided the best performance among existing equations for both males and females, whereas Jagim's equation showed the worst performance for males (mean difference = -335 kcal·d⁻¹; RMSE = 386 kcal·d⁻¹). Compared with measured RMR, most predictive equations exhibited heteroscedastic distribution.

### Measurement of resting energy expenditure in healthy children [^116tiHj1]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

The role that the components of energy expenditure play in the etiology of childhood obesity has highlighted the need for greater accuracy and standardized protocols for the measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE). However, protocols used to assess REE in children are varied, and consensus on a suitable method for measuring REE in children has not been reached. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of measurement time and measurement device (mask or mouthpiece) on REE in healthy children.

- **Design**: Following a 12-hour fast and abstinence from exercise, 23 children (age, 7–12 years) completed two 35-minute protocols: one with a face mask and the other with a mouthpiece/noseclip. Energy expenditure was measured continuously via indirect calorimetry, while device acceptability was assessed using a 6-point comfort rating scale.

- **Results**: Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that there was no significant difference in REE when measured after 10, 15, 20, or 25 minutes of rest compared to 30 minutes for either the mask or mouthpiece/noseclip (REE range, 1371–1460 kcal/d). Examination of the percentage coefficient of variation (CV) in energy expenditure for each time period by device showed that the least variation existed after 20 minutes of measurement using the mask (CV 6%). Paired t-test analysis indicated significantly less discomfort when wearing the mask compared to the mouthpiece/noseclip.

- **Conclusion**: It would appear that a 20-minute protocol using a mask may increase compliance and prove to be a more practical protocol for measuring REE in children.

### Resting metabolic rate in obese and nonobese Chinese Singaporean boys aged 13–15 y [^115TbP9j]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Previous studies investigating the hypothesis that a low resting metabolic rate (RMR) is a cause of obesity yielded discrepant findings. Two explanations for these findings are the use of imprecise methods to determine obesity and a failure to control for differences in fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) when comparing RMR values.

- **Objective**: This study tested the hypothesis that RMR is lower in obese than in nonobese boys using precise methods to quantify body fatness and with adjustment for differences in both FM and FFM.

- **Design**: Forty Chinese Singaporean boys aged 12.8–15.1 years were recruited. Boys were classified as obese (n = 20) or nonobese (n = 20) based on their adiposity index (ratio of FM to FFM: > 0.60 = obese, < 0.40 = nonobese) determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RMR was determined using indirect calorimetry. RMR values were compared using both linear (analysis of covariance) and log-linear (analysis of covariance with log-transformed data) regression to control for differences in FM and FFM.

- **Results**: Age, height, and FFM did not differ significantly between groups. Body mass was 13 kg greater and FM was 16 kg greater in the obese boys than in the nonobese boys (P < 0.001). After control for FFM and FM, RMR did not differ significantly between the groups.

- **Conclusion**: When body composition is appropriately controlled for, RMR does not differ significantly between obese and nonobese boys.

### Association of predicted basal metabolic rate and insulin resistance in a Chinese general population [^111v9B34]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

In this study, we analyzed data from 36,115 participants. While previous studies have explored the BMR–IR relationship, few have specifically focused on large, well-characterized non-diabetic populations, in whom early metabolic alterations can be examined without the confounding influence of overt diabetes. Furthermore, our inclusion of sex-stratified analyses allows for the identification of potential sex-specific associations, an area that remains underexplored. By stratifying analyses according to sex, metabolic subgroups, and diabetes status, this study aims to elucidate the role of BMR in the development of IR and to identify high-risk phenotypes, thereby informing targeted prevention strategies for T2DM and its related complications.

### Achievement of steady state optimizes results when performing indirect calorimetry [^113uFSW1]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Use of steady state as the endpoint for performance of indirect calorimetry (IC) is controversial. This prospective study was designed to evaluate the necessity and significance of achieving steady state.

- **Methods**: Patients with respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation in a short- or long-term acute care unit at any one of three university-based urban hospitals were eligible for the study. The 24-hour total energy expenditure (TEE) was determined using a Nellcor Puritan Bennett 7250 continuous IC monitor. Gas exchange parameters were measured and averaged every minute for the initial hour and then every 15 minutes for the next 23 hours. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was averaged at intervals over the first 20, 30, 40, and 60 minutes, and for various definitions of steady state where oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) changed by < 10%, 15%, and 20%. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for VO2 over the first 30 minutes of the study.

- **Results**: Twenty-two patients (mean age 52.8 years, 59% male, mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE III) score 42.0) participated in the study. The best correlation between short-term "snapshot" REE and the 24-hour TEE was achieved during the steady-state period defined by the most stringent criteria (change in VO2 and VCO2 by < 10%). The average REE for all steady-state and interval periods significantly correlated to TEE with no significant difference in absolute values for REE and TEE. Adding 10% for an activity factor to the average REE…

### The effect of walking on postprandial glycemic excursion in patients with type 1 diabetes and healthy people [^1175KzqU]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Basal metabolic rate was measured for 30 minutes using indirect calorimetry on the morning of day 2 at 0630 hours. Subjects slept uninterrupted overnight in the CRU, did not move prior to measurements, and had not eaten since 1900 hours the previous night. During these measurements, subjects lay supine and awake with their head at a 10° tilt. To assess the energy expenditure associated with daily physical activity, participants were seated in a backed, armed office chair with their backs, arms, and legs supported.

Indirect calorimetry was conducted for 10 minutes each using a high-precision indirect calorimeter (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) as described previously under the following conditions: standing motionless, relaxed and still, with arms hanging by their sides and feet spaced 6 inches apart; and walking. Walking energy expenditure was measured for 10 minutes each while subjects walked at 1.6, 3.2, and 4.8 km/h (1, 2, and 3 mph) on a calibrated treadmill (True 600, O'Fallon, MO).

Expired air was collected using a full-face transparent dilution mask (Scott Aviation, Lancaster, NY) connected to the calorimeter by leak-proof tubing (Vacumed, Ventura, CA). Breakfast was served at 0700 hours, and the energy expenditure measurement started at 1130 hours, ensuring sufficient time had elapsed to avoid the thermic effect of food.

### Calculation of energy expenditure in women using the MET system [^11536WNV]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006).

Interpretation of physical activity as energy expenditure requires adjustment for body size. This is usually accomplished by means of the MET system, which assumes a basal metabolic rate (BMR) of 4.184 kJ.kg(-1).h(-1) and, when the standard calculation is used, that the energy costs of different activities are proportional to BMR. These relationships may be altered by increases in percent total body fat (% TBF), and this paper examines relationships between % TBF and total energy expenditure (TEE) obtained using the standard and a proposed calculation.

Published data regarding body composition, physical activity (heart rate recording), and BMR in 11 American women (before and after weight gain) and in 15 Swedish women (before and during pregnancy) were used to calculate TEE. Reference estimates of TEE were obtained using doubly labeled water.

- **Results**: In Swedish women, reference TEE minus standard TEE (MJ.24 h(-1)) was 1.37 ± 1.29 (P < 0.05) and 0.31 ± 1.28 (P > 0.05) (MJ.24 h(-1)), respectively. In American women before and after weight gain, reference TEE minus standard TEE (MJ.24 h(-1)) were 0.38 ± 1.79 (P > 0.05) and 1.39 ± 2.36 (P > 0.05), respectively, whereas the corresponding differences for proposed TEE (MJ.24 h(-1)) were -0.52 ± 2.20 (P > 0.05) and 0.21 ± 2.36 (P > 0.05), respectively. In Swedish women before pregnancy and American women after weight gain (N = 26, BMI = 18–39), significant (P < 0.001) relationships were observed.

### The competitive mediating role of basal metabolic rate in the association between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure and depression risk [^112YTANy]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). High credibility.

The effect of basal metabolic rate (BMR) on depression was unclear. This study investigated the potential role of BMR in the association between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure and depression.

- **Methods**: The study was based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). BMR was calculated using both the revised Harris-Benedict equation (BMR1) and the Mifflin-St Jeor equation (BMR2). Generalized linear and logistic regression models were applied to examine the associations between PAH metabolites, BMR, and depression. Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) were utilized to analyze the combined effects of multiple PAH metabolites. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore the role of BMR.

- **Results**: The study included 8323 participants. For every 100 kcal/day increase in BMR1 and BMR2, the depression risk increased by 5% (95% CI: 1.00, 1.10) and 7% (95% CI: 1.02, 1.13), respectively. The WQS model indicated that mixed PAH metabolites were negatively associated with BMR1 (β: -0.06, P = 0.020) and BMR2 (β: -0.06, P = 0.014). BKMR models showed that when all PAH metabolites were at P 75 compared to P 50, BMR1 and BMR2 decreased by 20.54 and 20.31 units, respectively, while the depression risk increased by 0.23 units (95% CI: 0.07, 0.38). Mediation analyses suggested that BMR exerted a competitive mediation effect in the association between 1-NAP, 2-FLU, 1-PHE, 1-PYR, and depression.

- **Conclusion**: PAH exposure led to a reduction in BMR and contributed to depression at high levels of exposure.

### Energy requirements of women of reproductive age [^115fjraf]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

The energy requirements of women have been based on total energy expenditure (TEE) derived from the factorial approach or as multiples of basal metabolic rate (BMR).

This study was designed to reevaluate the energy requirements of healthy, moderately active underweight, normal-weight, and overweight women of reproductive age.

- **Design**: The energy requirements of 116 women — 13 with a low body mass index (BMI), 70 with a normal BMI, and 33 with a high BMI — were estimated from TEE measured by the doubly labeled water method. Twenty-four-hour energy expenditure (EE) and BMR were measured by room respiration calorimetry. Activity EE was estimated from nonbasal EE as TEE minus BMR, and physical activity level was calculated as TEE divided by BMR. Body composition was derived from a multicomponent model. Fitness, strength, and physical activity level were assessed, and fasting serum indexes were measured.

- **Results**: Energy requirements differed among the low-BMI (8.9 ± 0.9 MJ/d), normal-BMI (10.1 ± 1.4 MJ/d), and high-BMI (11.5 ± 1.9 MJ/d) groups (P = 0.02–0.001 for all pairwise comparisons). Major predictors of BMR, 24-hour EE, and TEE were weight, height, and body composition; minor predictors were fasting metabolic profile and fitness. Fat-free mass and fat mass accounted for the differences in EE observed between the BMI groups. The mean physical activity level of 1.86 suggested that the multiples of BMR used to estimate energy requirements have been underestimated.

### The healthy/unhealthy dietary pattern is associated with resting metabolic rate status among women with overweight/obesity [^116tTiAW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

The prevalence of obesity, which has been shown to be relevant in the context of the development of various chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and various cancers, has risen at an alarming rate; according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, in recent decades, more than 650 million adults around the world are obese. In 2002, about 70% of recorded mortalities in Iran were associated with obesity-related chronic diseases.

It is now well accepted that transitions in dietary intakes and eating habits play prominent roles in the increased rate of obesity, as a multifactorial disorder. Although prior studies have mostly investigated the intake of individual nutrients in relation to various chronic diseases, it has been proved that the combined effects of all these nutrients are of greater importance. Therefore, classifying the effects of these dietary components and their metabolic interactions is of both theoretical and practical significance.

Using dietary patterns allows a more comprehensive approach to prevent various health outcomes. Recent investigations have shown that dietary patterns and obesity could be closely linked. Furthermore, some studies have demonstrated that dietary patterns are among the major causes of obesity. However, data in this regard are conflicting, so more studies are needed to shed light on this issue.

### Comparison of two systems of measuring energy expenditure [^116w25bj]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Health care professionals typically use resting metabolic rate (RMR) via indirect calorimetry to determine a person's energy expenditure. Traditional indirect calorimetry measurements involve an expensive, cumbersome piece of equipment that requires careful calibration. The recent development of a handheld indirect calorimeter makes it easier to measure RMR. The purpose of this study was to compare simultaneous measurements of RMR with handheld and traditional indirect calorimeters.

- **Methods**: Healthy, free-living subjects (n = 50) aged 18 years and older were tested simultaneously with both indirect calorimeters. All subjects breathed through the handheld device using a mouthpiece while wearing nose clips to prevent leaks. The handheld indirect calorimetry device was placed inside a canopy. The exhaled gas from the handheld was positioned directly over the inlet to the port delivering gases to the traditional device's mixing chamber. The canopy facilitated the simultaneous collection of all expired gases into the traditional device. During the measurement, oxygen consumption and RMR were continuously recorded on a personal computer.

- **Results**: Mean oxygen consumption and RMR did not significantly differ between the two devices, with a mean difference of 0.58 ± 15.33 mL/min (p = .790) and 4.66 ± 113.39 kcal/day (p = .773), and an absolute difference of 12.3 ± 8.99 mL/min and 86.58 ± 72.32 kcal/day, respectively. Correlation coefficients for oxygen consumption and RMR were 0.945 and 0.941, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: No significant difference was found between the two systems of measuring energy expenditure.

### Liothyronine sodium [^112v6nEJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body and increase the basal metabolic rate and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. In vitro studies indicate that T3 increases aerobic mitochondrial function, thereby increasing the rates of synthesis and utilization of myocardial high-energy phosphates. This, in turn, stimulates myosin ATPase and reduces tissue lactic acidosis. Thus, thyroid hormones exert a profound influence on virtually every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system.

While the source of levothyroxine (T4) and some triiodothyronine (T3) is via secretion from the thyroid gland, it is now well-established that approximately 80% of circulating T3 arises predominantly by way of the extrathyroidal conversion of T4. The membrane-bound enzyme responsible for this reaction is iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase. Activity of the enzyme is greatest in the liver and kidney. A second pathway of T4 to T3 conversion occurs via a PTU-insensitive 5'-deiodinase located primarily in the pituitary and central nervous system.

The prohormone T4 must be converted to T3 in the body before it can exert biological effects. During periods of illness or stress, this conversion is often inhibited and can be diverted to the inactive reverse T3 (rT3) moiety. Therefore, correction of the hypothyroid condition in patients with myxedema coma is facilitated by the parenteral administration of triiodothyronine (T3). T3 is bound much less firmly to serum binding proteins.

### New predictive resting metabolic rate equations for high-level athletes: A cross-validation study [^115vP7NQ]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Low credibility.

The present study aims to assess the agreement between the measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) using indirect calorimetry and different predictive equations (predicted RMR), and to propose and cross-validate two new predictive equations for estimating the RMR in high-level athletes.

- **Methods**: The RMR of 102 athletes (44 women) was assessed using indirect calorimetry, while body composition was assessed using skinfolds. Comparisons between measured and predicted RMR values were performed using one-way ANOVA. Mean difference, root mean square error, simple linear regression, and Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate the agreement between measured and predicted RMR. The accuracy of predictive equations was analyzed using narrower and wider accuracy limits (± 5% and ± 10%, respectively) of measured RMR. Multiple linear regression models were employed to develop the new predictive equations based on traditional predictors (Equation 1) and the stepwise method (Equation 2).

- **Results**: The new Equations 1 and 2 presented good agreement based on the mean difference (3 and -15 kcal.d-1), RMSE (200 and 192 kcal.d-1), and R² (0.71 and 0.74), respectively, and accuracy (61% of subjects between the limit of ± 10% of measured RMR). Cunningham's equation provided the best performance for males and females among the existing equations, whereas Harris & Benedict's equation showed the worst performance for males (mean difference = 406 kcal.d-1; RMSE = 473 kcal.d-1). Compared to measured RMR, most predictive equations showed a heteroscedastic distribution.

### Lower than predicted resting metabolic rate is associated with severely impaired cardiorespiratory fitness in obese individuals [^111dKDU4]. Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Obese individuals exhibit reduced cardiorespiratory fitness compared to their leaner counterparts. Regular exercise plays a crucial role in maintaining or enhancing fitness and lean body mass, which in turn directly affects the resting metabolic rate (RMR). Given these relationships, this study aimed to evaluate the association between RMR and cardiorespiratory fitness in obese individuals.

The study evaluated 64 obese individuals (78% female) with direct assessments of RMR and cardiorespiratory fitness through breath-by-breath measurements of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production at rest and during exercise. The mean age and BMI of the participants were 47.4 ± 12.2 years and 47.2 ± 9.2 kg/m², respectively. A significant majority, 69%, had a measured RMR above the predicted values as per the Harris-Benedict equation.

- **BMI comparison**: Compared to the higher RMR group, those with a lower than predicted RMR had an increased BMI, with values of 52.9 vs. 44.7 kg/m², respectively (P = 0.001).

- **Peak oxygen uptake (VO₂ peak)**: Analysis of participants demonstrating significant effort during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (peak respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.10) showed significantly higher VO₂ peak in the higher RMR group (17.3 ± 3.5 ml/min/kg) compared to the lower RMR group (13.6 ± 1.9 ml/min/kg), P = 0.003.

In summary, a lower than predicted RMR was associated with a severely reduced VO₂ peak and a higher BMI in this cohort. These findings suggest that morbid obesity may perpetuate a vicious cycle involving increasing BMI, reduced cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle deconditioning, and lower RMR. Collectively, these responses can exacerbate the imbalance over time.

### Non-zero basal oxygen flow a hazard to anesthesia breathing circuit leak test [^113gdU7H]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

The non-zero basal flow (BF) of oxygen in anesthesia machines has been set to supply the basal metabolic requirement of oxygen. However, there is no scientific evidence of its necessity. In this study, we sought to clarify whether non-zero BF affects leak detection during preanesthetic inspections. Twenty-five participants performed leak tests on anesthesia machines to detect breathing circuit leaks. Artificial leak-producing devices were used to create leaks from 0 to 1.0 L/min. The investigator randomly chose the leak device and connected it into the breathing circuit. Participants, blinded as to the presence or the type of leak-producing device, then tested the breathing circuit for leaks. The conventional breathing system leak test was performed with and without BF. The results of leak detection in each procedure were analyzed statistically. The leak detection rate with BF was less than without BF (P < 0.01).

We demonstrated that non-zero BF of oxygen decreases the leak detection rate and is an obstacle for leak detection, especially for small leaks. Therefore, we recommend that breathing circuit leak tests should be performed in the absence of BF of oxygen.

### Resting metabolic rate in old-old women with and without frailty: variability and estimation of energy requirements [^114YhzVw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to measure the resting metabolic rate (RMR) in old-old adults living in the community. The study aimed to examine the association between measured RMR and frailty status, and to compare it with expected RMR as predicted by a specific equation.

- **Design**: Physiological substudy conducted as a home visit within an observational cohort study.

- **Setting**: Baltimore City and County, Maryland.

- **Participants**: Seventy-seven women aged 83 to 93 enrolled in the Women's Health and Aging Study II.

- **Measurements**: Resting metabolic rate measured with indirect calorimetry, alongside frailty status, fat-free mass, ambient and body temperature, and expected RMR according to the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation.

- **Results**: The average RMR was 1,119 ± 205 kcal/d (range 595–1,560 kcal/d). There was a biased and poor agreement between observed and expected RMR (between-subject coefficient of variation 38.0%, 95% confidence interval = 35.1–40.8). The variability of RMR was greater in frail individuals (heteroscedasticity F-test P = 0.02). Both low and high RMR were associated with frailty (odds ratio 5.4, P = 0.04) and slower self-selected walking speed (P < .001) after adjusting for covariates.

- **Conclusion**: Equations not validated for old-old adults correlate poorly with measured RMR. The RMR is highly variable in old-old women, with variations from the mean predicting clinical frailty. These exploratory findings suggest a potential pathway to clinical frailty through high or low RMR.

### Metabolic adaptation is not a major barrier to weight-loss maintenance [^1174vzau]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

The existence of metabolic adaptation at the level of resting metabolic rate (RMR) remains highly controversial, likely due to a lack of standardization in participants' energy balance. Moreover, its role as a driver of relapse remains unproven.

- **Objective**: The main aim was to determine if metabolic adaptation at the level of RMR was present after weight loss and at 1- and 2-year follow-ups, with measurements taken under conditions of weight stability. A secondary aim was to investigate racial differences in metabolic adaptation after weight loss and whether this phenomenon was associated with weight regain.

- **Methods**: A total of 171 overweight women [BMI (kg/m²): 28.3 ± 1.3; age: 35.2 ± 6.3 years; 88 whites and 83 blacks] enrolled in a weight-loss program to achieve a BMI < 25 and were followed for 2 years. Body weight and composition (4-compartment model) and RMR (indirect calorimetry) were measured after 4 weeks of weight stability at baseline, after weight loss, and at 1 and 2 years. Metabolic adaptation was defined as a significantly lower measured RMR compared with predicted RMR (from the participants' regression model).

- **Results**: Participants lost, on average, 12 ± 2.6 kg and regained 52% ± 38% and 89% ± 54% of their initial weight loss at 1- and 2-year follow-ups, respectively. Metabolic adaptation was found after weight loss (-54 ± 105 kcal/d; P < 0.001), with no difference between races. It was positively correlated with fat-mass loss but not with weight regain overall. In a subset of women (n = 46) with data at all time points, metabolic adaptation was present after weight loss, but not at 1- or 2-year follow-ups.

### Measured versus estimated resting metabolic rate in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113BHzJJ]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

Obesity is common in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and a hypocaloric diet can improve functional capacity. Malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty are also frequently present, and calorie restriction could harm some patients. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is an essential determinant of caloric needs; however, it is rarely measured in clinical practice. The accuracy of commonly used predictive equations in HFpEF is unknown.

- **Methods**: RMR was measured with indirect calorimetry in 43 patients with HFpEF undergoing right heart catheterization at the University of Michigan, and among 49 participants in the SECRET trial (Study of the Effects of Caloric Restriction and Exercise Training in Patients With Heart Failure and a Normal Ejection Fraction). SECRET patients also had dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry body composition measures. Measured RMR was compared with RMR estimated using the Harris Benedict, Mifflin-St Jeor, World Health Organization, and Academy for Nutrition and Dietetics equations.

- **Results**: All predictive equations overestimated RMR (by > 10%, P < 0.001 for all), with mean (95% CI) differences: Harris Benedict equation +250 (186–313), Mifflin-St Jeor equation +169 (110–229), World Health Organization equation +300 (239–361), and Academy for Nutrition and Dietetics equation +794 (890–697) kcal/day. Results were similar across both patient groups, and the discrepancy between measured and estimated RMR tended to increase with body mass index. In SECRET, measured RMR was closely associated with lean body mass (ρ = 0.74; by linear regression).

### Youth metabolic equivalents differ depending on operational definitions [^114XFAR1]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Low credibility.

Youth metabolic equivalents (METy) are sometimes operationally defined as multiples of predicted basal metabolic rate (METyBMR) and other times as multiples of measured resting metabolic rate (METyRMR). This study aimed to examine the comparability of METyBMR and METyRMR.

Indirect calorimetry data (Cosmed K4b) were analyzed from two studies, with a total sample of 245 youth (125 male participants, aged 6–18 years, 37.4% overweight or obese). The Schofield equations were used to predict BMR, and K4b data from 30 minutes of supine rest were used to assess RMR. Participants performed structured physical activities (PA) of various intensities, and steady-state oxygen consumption was divided by predicted BMR and measured RMR to calculate METyBMR and METyRMR, respectively. A two-way (activity-METy calculation) analysis of variance was used to compare METyBMR and METyRMR (α = 0.05), with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc tests. Intensity classifications were also compared after encoding METyBMR and METyRMR as sedentary behavior (≤ 1.50 METy), light PA (1.51–2.99 METy), moderate PA (3.00–5.99 METy), or vigorous PA (≥ 6.00 METy).

There was a significant interaction (F(30) = 3.6, P < 0.001), and METyBMR was significantly higher than METyRMR for 28 of 31 activities (P < 0.04), ranging from 15.6% (watching television) to 23.1% (basketball). Intensity classifications were the same for both METy calculations in 69.0% of cases.

In conclusion, METyBMR and METyRMR differ considerably. Greater consensus is needed regarding how metabolic equivalents should be operationally defined in youth.

### Association of predicted basal metabolic rate and insulin resistance in a Chinese general population [^1139QRTo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Although indirect calorimetry remains the gold standard for measuring BMR, its high cost and operational complexity limit its feasibility in large population-based studies. As a practical alternative, predictive equations are commonly used. In this study, BMR was estimated using the Singapore equation, which has been validated as the most accurate predictor for Chinese populations. The equation is as follows: BMR (kcal) = 0.2389 × [52.6 × weight (kg) + 828 × gender (female = 0, male = 1) + 1960]. Based on estimated BMR values, participants were classified into quartiles: Q1 (< 1,198 kcal), Q2 (1,198–1,281.3 kcal), Q3 (1,281.3–1,394.8 kcal), and Q4 (≥ 1,394.8 kcal), with Q1 designated as the reference group for comparative purposes.

- **Definitions of metabolic status**: Normal glucose tolerance (NGT) was defined as FPG < 6.1 mmol/L and PPG < 7.8 mmol/L. Impaired glucose regulation (IGR) was defined when 6.1 mmol/L ≤ FPG < 7.0 mmol/L and/or 7.8 mmol/L ≤ PPG < 11.1 mmol/L. DM was defined as FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L and/or PPG ≥ 11.1 mmol/L. Normal blood pressure (NBP) was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) within the range of 90 mmHg ≤ SBP < 140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) within 60 mmHg ≤ DBP < 90 mmHg. Hypertension (HTN) was defined when SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg. According to the Chinese Guideline for the Management of Dyslipidemia in Adults (revised in 2016), LDL-C was classified into two subgroups: the LDL-C < 2.6 mmol/L subgroup and the LDL-C ≥ 2.6 mmol/L subgroup. Similarly, HDL-C was divided into two subgroups: the HDL-C < 1 mmol/L subgroup and the HDL-C ≥ 1 mmol/L subgroup.

### Are individuals with type 2 diabetes metabolically inflexible? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xyvTD]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The overall impression of the basal respiratory exchange ratio (RER) from the 65 studies was that the groups in general did not differ (Tables 1 and S1). However, a large variability in the reported basal RER values was apparent, for example in lean subjects where a basal RER of 0.91 was reported. Basal RER is typically measured after an overnight fast, and Miles‐Chan et al. found a positive relationship between the dietary proportion of carbohydrates and the post‐absorptive RER. As such, diet composition may partly account for the variability in the studies. However, 21 out of the 35 studies with approximately 40 mU/m²/min infusion rate studies did not provide information about the diet in the preceding day(s).

Basal RER has been shown to correlate inversely with ΔRER; therefore, it is important for the interpretation of a change in RER with insulin stimulation that the basal RER values are comparable across the studies. In the present meta-analysis of basal RER, the mean values clustered closely around the overall mean value of 0.80 (Figure 2), albeit with a few exceptions. For instance, Fechner et al. reported a mean of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.70–0.72) in overweight subjects, and de Courten et al. and Szendroedi reported a mean of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.80–1.00) and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.67–0.75), respectively, in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

### Resting metabolic rate and exercise capacity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^112UHL6Z]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and exercise capacity, or maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and central adiposity.

In this cross-sectional study, RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry, and VO2 max was assessed using the Astrand test. The study included 31 women with PCOS and 29 control subjects matched for age and body mass index but differing in body fat distribution. Differences between the means were analyzed.

The results showed no significant differences in RMR or VO2 max values between the two groups.

In conclusion, central adiposity was not predictive of an altered RMR or decreased exercise capacity in women with PCOS.

### Resting metabolic rate varies by race and by sleep duration [^111mZ2gz]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of sleep duration on energy expenditure and its potential role in weight gain, particularly among African Americans and men. Short sleep duration is recognized as a significant risk factor for weight gain, predominantly driven by increased caloric intake; however, the role of decreased energy expenditure needed clarification. The study evaluated the impact of sleep restriction and recovery sleep on energy expenditure among African American and Caucasian men and women.

Healthy adults participated in a controlled laboratory study. After two baseline sleep nights, participants were randomized into either an experimental group, with 36 subjects receiving 4 hours of sleep per night for five nights followed by one night of 12-hour recovery sleep, or a control group of 11 participants who received 10 hours of sleep per night. Resting metabolic rate and respiratory quotient were measured using indirect calorimetry in the morning after overnight fasting.

- **Results**: Resting metabolic rate, a significant component of energy expenditure, decreased by 2.6% (P = 0.032) after sleep restriction but returned to baseline levels following recovery sleep. There were no changes in the resting metabolic rate of control subjects. While African Americans (n = 22), in comparison to Caucasians (n = 14), showed similar daily caloric intake, they exhibited a lower resting metabolic rate (P = 0.043) and a higher respiratory quotient (P = 0.013), irrespective of sleep duration.

The study concludes that sleep restriction leads to a decreased morning resting metabolic rate in healthy adults, suggesting that sleep loss triggers metabolic changes aimed at conserving energy.

### Metabolic drug survey highlights cancer cell dependencies and vulnerabilities [^114WJtrY]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

To uncover the basis for these differences, we first decided to investigate the basal metabolic profiles of our cancer cell line panel. We determined the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as proxies for mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, respectively, by performing the Seahorse mitochondrial stress test (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Generally, cell lines in Groups I, II, and IV were predominately oxidative, whereas cell lines in Groups III and V were primarily glycolytic, as assessed by differences in basal OCR, maximum respiration rate achieved, and the basal OCR/ECAR ratio (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Fig. 3c).

Comparison of overall metabolic profiles (OCR vs. ECAR) showed that the examined cell lines have analogous baseline metabolic phenotypes with few exceptions, suggesting that the mitochondrial cell function, as measured by Seahorse analysis, did not significantly influence the cell line clustering (Fig. 2e). Evaluation of the spare respiratory capacity, as an indication of cellular fitness or flexibility, implied that Groups I and II had the highest energetic stress response capability, consistent with the comparable drug response profiles detected (Supplementary Fig. 3d).

Since the mitochondrial stress test functionally evaluated the basal metabolic activity of cells, it is likely that it did not fully capture the complete cellular metabolic profile. Thus, it is plausible to assume that the test output had an impact only on the sensitivity of inhibitors targeting energy metabolism.

### Toward the development of predictive equations for resting metabolic rate in acutely ill spontaneously breathing patients [^117S1Bd7]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

There are many equations used for calculating energy needs of nutrition support patients but few developed specifically for the subset of spontaneously breathing, acutely ill patients. The purpose of the study was to validate existing equations and to start developing new equations for this cohort.

- **Methods**: Acutely ill patients not requiring mechanical ventilation had their resting metabolic rate measured using an indirect calorimeter. Metabolic rate was also calculated using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, the Ireton-Jones equation for spontaneously breathing patients, and a modification of the Penn State equation in which the minute ventilation-dependent variable was removed. These calculated values were compared with measured expenditure and considered accurate if they fell within 10% of the measurement.

- **Results**: Fifty-five patients were measured successfully. The modified Penn State equation was accurate in 71% of patients compared with 44% for Ireton-Jones and 42% for Mifflin-St Jeor. Several forms of a new equation were outlined but not validated. The equation with the highest R² (0.82) was as follows: resting metabolic rate (kcal/d) = weight in kg (20) - age in years (3) + male sex (197) + body mass index in kg/m² (25.9) + mean heart rate in beats/min (9.4) + 89.

- **Conclusions**: A modification of the Penn State equation for predicting resting metabolic rate was shown to accurately predict resting metabolic rate in acutely ill, spontaneously breathing patients if body mass index was ≥ 20.5 kg/m². A new set of population-specific equations was outlined.

### Impact of the basal metabolic ratio in predicting early deaths after allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^115mptQQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

Early deaths after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) are of major concern. Assuming that both decreased and increased basal metabolism might relate to early deaths, we analyzed the risk factors for overall survival to days 30 (OS30) and 60 (OS60). The Harris-Benedict equation was used to calculate basal metabolism. By comparing a patient's basal metabolism (PBM) calculated from pretransplant body weight with the standard basal metabolism (SBM) calculated from standard body weight (body mass index (BMI) = 22), we defined the basal metabolic ratio (BMR) as a parameter (BMR = PBM/SBM).

We retrospectively analyzed 360 adult patients transplanted between 1997 and 2006 at a single center in Japan. A multivariate analysis of OS30 identified the risk factors to be:

- **High basal metabolic ratio (HBR)**: (BMR ≥ 1.05) (P = 0.005)
- **Non-complete remission (non-CR)**: (P = 0.001)

Meanwhile, a multivariate analysis of OS60 showed the following risk factors:

- **Low basal metabolic ratio (LBR)**: (P = 0.02)
- **High basal metabolic ratio (HBR)**: (P = 0.04)
- **Non-complete remission (non-CR)**: (P = 0.002)
- **Performance status ≤ 1**: (P = 0.01)

OS30 and OS60 were found to be favorable in the range 0.95 < BMR ≤ 1.05 (average BMR; ABR), showing 96.8% and 90.3% for ABR, compared to 87.1% and 76.2% for LBR, and 87.8% and 81.1% for HBR, respectively. In conclusion, BMR may be a predictor of early death after allo-SCT.

### Levothyroxine therapy, calculated deiodinases activity and basal metabolic rate in obese or nonobese patients after total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, results of a retrospective observational study [^111gsp2R]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

- **Basal metabolic rate evaluation**: We evaluated BMR by the Mifflin‐St. Jeor formula (MSTF). The MSTF equation is commonly used in the assessment of basal metabolism and is more particularly used in obese patients. The MSTF was also applied differently to female and male sexes as follows:
	- Females = 9.99 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) − 4.92 × age (years) − 161.
	- Males = 9.99 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) − 4.92 × age (years) + 5.

We studied the effect of the L‐T4 replacement dose on thyroid hormone homeostasis, estimated BMR, and total deiodinase activity (GD) in obese and nonobese patients. Data were collected from patients after thyroidectomy, 131 I administration, and a persistent euthyroid state under replacement therapy for approximately 3 months with no significant change in L‐T4 dose administration, daily caloric intake, or body weight. A subgroup of 45 patients, maintaining the same replacement dose over the last 6 months, was also studied to better evaluate the interplay between the L‐T4 administered dose and total GD in the long term.

- **Evaluation of stimulated deiodination**: GD, which reflects the maximum stimulated activity of deiodination, was calculated by SPINA Thyr 4.2 (Structure Parameter Inference Approach by Johannes W. Dietrich, Lab XU44, Bergmannsheil University Hospitals, Ruhr University of Bochum, D-44789 Bochum, NRW, Germany), which is a mathematical tool for the integrated interpretation of laboratory results. SPINA allows the calculation of GD from TSH, FT4, and FT3 serum levels obtained from routine laboratory assays.

### Obesity-related subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood: Elevated triglycerides but not basal metabolic rate [^111ZvSRA]. Pediatric Research (2025). High credibility.

Studies on the associations between obesity-related subclinical hypothyroidism with basal metabolic rate and risk factors of cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents are scarce.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of children with obesity (n = 294) from the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Childhood Obesity cohort. Differences in basal metabolic rate quantified by indirect calorimetry, and the cardiovascular risk factors — body mass index, blood lipids, fasting and 2h oral glucose tolerance test glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and insulin resistance — between subjects with and without subclinical hypothyroidism were investigated. The associations of baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and ΔTSH with change in cardiovascular risk factors over time were assessed.

- **Results**: Subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism had elevated triacylglycerides but no alterations in basal metabolic rate or other measured cardiovascular risk factors. ΔTSH was positively associated with Δtriacylglycerides, Δtotal-cholesterol, and ΔLDL-cholesterol, independently of age, sex, Δbody mass index, and ΔT4. In the subclinical hypothyroidism group, 92% of individuals normalized their TSH 0.9–2.9 years later.

- **Conclusions**: Children with obesity and subclinical hypothyroidism did not have an altered basal metabolic rate but had elevated triacylglycerides. During the follow-up period, TSH changed in parallel with several blood lipids. Elevated TSH often normalized without pharmaceutical intervention within 3 years.

- **Impact**: The present study found that subclinical hypothyroidism in children with obesity was associated with elevated triglycerides.

### Effect of calorie restriction on resting metabolic rate and spontaneous physical activity [^1147wcJP]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

It is unclear if resting metabolic rate (RMR) and spontaneous physical activity (SPA) decrease in weight-reduced non-obese participants. Additionally, it is unknown if changes in SPA, measured in a respiratory chamber, reflect changes in free-living physical activity level (PAL).

- **Research methods and procedures**: Participants (N = 48) were randomized into four groups for six months: calorie restriction (CR, 25% restriction), CR plus structured exercise (CR+EX, 12.5% restriction plus 12.5% increased energy expenditure via exercise), low-calorie diet (LCD, 890 kcal/d supplement diet until 15% weight loss, then weight maintenance), and control (weight maintenance). Measurements were collected at baseline, Month 3, and Month 6. Body composition and RMR were measured by DXA and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Two measures of SPA were collected in a respiratory chamber (percent of time active and kcal/d). Free-living PAL (PAL = total daily energy expenditure by doubly labeled water/RMR) was also measured. Regression equations at baseline were used to adjust RMR for fat-free mass and SPA (kcal/d) for body weight.

- **Results**: Adjusted RMR decreased at Month 3 in the CR group and at Month 6 in the CR+EX and LCD groups. Neither measure of SPA decreased significantly in any group. PAL decreased at Month 3 in the CR and LCD groups, but not in the CR+EX group, who engaged in structured exercise. Changes in SPA in the chamber and free-living PAL were not related.

Body weight is defended in non-obese participants during modest caloric restriction, as evidenced by metabolic adjustments.

### Investigating the impact of body composition on the estimation of resting metabolic rate: new equations for adults aged ≥ 65 years developed using cross-sectional data [^115GeoKz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Due to changes in body composition during aging, including body composition measures as a variable within equations to predict resting metabolic rate (RMR) may improve their predictive accuracy.

- **Objectives**: This analysis of cross-sectional data aimed to develop and validate new RMR equations for older adults (≥ 65 years), incorporating variables for body composition. The study sought to predict performance and accuracy and to explore the relative contribution of body composition variables acting directly or potentially via fat-free mass (FFM) to RMR.

- **Methods**: Analyses were conducted utilizing a unique international dataset of gold standard measures developed for this purpose. RMR was predicted from potential predictive variables using stepwise multiple regression. Predictive performance of the final model was assessed using double cross-validation. The new prediction equation was compared with published prediction equations for similar populations and with previously published RMR prediction equations that did not include FFM. Direct associations between the determined predictor variables and RMR, with indirect effects mediated via FFM, were examined using mediation analysis.

- **Results**: The dataset contained 1238 participants. The predictive equations, utilizing either FFM (Equation 1) or lean body weight (LBW) (Equation 2), are as follows:
	- **Equation 1**: RMR = 8.645 × height + 23.684 × weight - 29.717 × age + 38.213 × FFM + 209.637 × sex + 2693.223
	- **Equation 2**: RMR = -30.570 × age + 80.736 × LBW - 186.825 × sex + 3956.822, where RMR (kJ/d); height (cm); weight (kg); age

### Obesity-related subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood: Elevated triglycerides but not basal metabolic rate [^113ttDjx]. Pediatric Research (2025). High credibility.

Studies on the associations between obesity-related subclinical hypothyroidism, basal metabolic rate, and risk factors of cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents are scarce.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on children with obesity (n = 294) from the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Childhood Obesity cohort. Differences in basal metabolic rate were quantified by indirect calorimetry. Cardiovascular risk factors such as body mass index, blood lipids, fasting and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test glucose, glycated haemoglobin, and insulin resistance were investigated between subjects with and without subclinical hypothyroidism. The associations of baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and ΔTSH with changes in cardiovascular risk factors over time were assessed.

- **Results**: Subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism had elevated triacylglycerides but no alterations in basal metabolic rate or other measured cardiovascular risk factors. ΔTSH was positively associated with Δtriacylglycerides, Δtotal-cholesterol, and ΔLDL-cholesterol, independently of age, sex, Δbody mass index, and ΔT4. In the subclinical hypothyroidism group, 92% of individuals normalized their TSH levels 0.9–2.9 years later.

- **Conclusions**: Children with obesity and subclinical hypothyroidism did not have an altered basal metabolic rate but displayed elevated triacylglycerides. During the follow-up period, TSH changed in parallel with several blood lipids. Elevated TSH often normalized without pharmaceutical intervention within 3 years.

### Are individuals with type 2 diabetes metabolically inflexible? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vQAFK]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

We excluded 69% (n = 161) of the retrieved reports in our literature search because we could not obtain the ΔRER value. This issue was more prevalent in older studies but was also found in 47% (n = 7) of the studies published within the last 5 years. For transparency and comparison, the presentation of RER values (or the V̇O₂ and V̇CO₂) is essential and should be the standard.

We originally intended to correlate insulin sensitivity with ΔRER but were unable to do so due to varying data presentations. Glucose infusion rate (GIR), glucose clearance, and the M-value are used interchangeably as measures of insulin sensitivity. They can be presented relative to body weight or fat-free mass (FFM). Although conversions are possible, they require information such as body mass, fat-free mass, plasma glucose, and/or plasma insulin, depending on the presentation format. However, these variables were not always provided.

Based on this, we suggest that the minimum participant characteristics presented in a clamp study should include body weight, BMI, and fat-free mass (if applicable). Insulin sensitivity should preferably be presented as either GIR (per body weight or FFM) or glucose clearance (per body weight or FFM). Additionally, both plasma glucose and insulin at basal levels and during the steady state of the clamp should be reported to validate the clamp procedure.

### Analysis of estimation methods for resting metabolic rate in critically ill adults [^1151yV8b]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Prediction of metabolic rate is an important part of the nutrition assessment of critically ill patients, yet there are limited data regarding the best equation to use to make this prediction.

- **Methods**: Standardized indirect calorimetry measurements were made in 202 ventilated, adult critical care patients, and resting metabolic rate was calculated using the following equations: Penn State equation, Faisy, Brandi, Swinamer, Ireton-Jones, Mifflin, Mifflin x1.25, Harris Benedict, Harris Benedict x1.25, Harris Benedict using adjusted weight for obesity, and each of the adjusted weight versions of Harris Benedict x1.25. The subjects were subgrouped by age and obesity status (young nonobese, young obese, elderly nonobese, elderly obese). Performance of each equation was assessed using bias, precision, and accuracy rate statistics.

- **Results**: Accuracy rates in the study population ranged from 67% for the Penn State equation to 18% for the weight-adjusted Harris Benedict equation (without multiplication). Within subgroups, the highest accuracy rate was 77% in the elderly nonobese using the Penn State equation and the lowest was 0% for the weight-adjusted Harris Benedict equation. The Penn State equation was the only equation that was unbiased and precise across all subgroups. The obese elderly group was the most difficult to predict. Therefore, a separate regression was computed for this group: Mifflin(0.71) + Tmax(85) + Ve(64) - 3085.

- **Conclusions**: The Penn State equation provides the most accurate assessment of metabolic rate in critically ill patients if indirect calorimetry is used.

### Accuracy of a portable indirect calorimeter for measuring resting energy expenditure in individuals with cancer [^116R7QXY]. JPEN Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Determining optimal caloric intake for an individual with cancer is complicated by metabolic changes that occur, namely, alterations in resting energy expenditure (REE). There is currently no validated clinically available equation or tool to measure energy expenditure in these patients.

- **Methods**: Patients with newly diagnosed solid tumors underwent REE assessments using the FitMate GS portable indirect calorimeter and the reference VMax metabolic cart, both utilizing canopy hoods. REE was also estimated from the Harris-Benedict, Mifflin St. Jeor, and Henry equations for comparison. Data were analyzed using paired samples t-test and the Bland-Altman approach to assess group-level and individual-level agreement compared with the metabolic cart.

- **Results**: A total of 26 patients (19 males; body mass index: 27.8 ± 5.5 kg/m²; age: 62 ± 10 years) participated in the study. Biases for the FitMate GS and both equations were low (ranging from -44 to -92 kcal or -2.3% to -5.1%), indicating good group-level accuracy. The FitMate GS had low bias but the widest limits of agreement (-28.0% to 21.2%) compared with the three equations (Harris-Benedict: -15.8% to 11.2%; Mifflin St. Jeor: -17.1% to 6.9%; Henry: -15.4% to 11.5%). These differences were not due to volume of oxygen, BMI category, or sex.

- **Conclusion**: FitMate GS performed well on a group level, but its accuracy was poor on an individual level. Further research should develop better equations and validate tools to measure energy expenditure for accurate dietary recommendations for patients at nutrition risk.

### Validation of a predictive method for an accurate assessment of resting energy expenditure in medical mechanically ventilated patients [^115n49XR]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to use a comparison with indirect calorimetry to confirm the ability of our previously described equation to predict resting energy expenditure in mechanically ventilated patients.

- **Design**: Prospective, validation study.

- **Setting**: Conducted in an eighteen-bed medical intensive care unit at a teaching hospital.

- **Patients**: All adult patients intubated for more than 24 hours were assessed for eligibility. Exclusion criteria were clinical situations that could contribute to erroneous calorimetric measurements.

- **Interventions**: Resting energy expenditure was calculated using the original Harris-Benedict equations and those corrected for common stress factors. Additional equations used included the Swinamer equation, the Fusco equation, the Ireton-Jones equation, and our equation: resting energy expenditure (kcal/day) = 8 x weight (kg) + 14 x height (cm) + 32 x minute ventilation (L/min) + 94 x temperature (degrees C) - 4834.

- **Measurements and main results**: Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry for the 45 included patients. Resting energy expenditure calculated with our predictive model correlated with the measured resting energy expenditure (r² = .62, p < .0001), and Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean bias of -192 ± 277 kcal/day, with limits of agreement ranging from -735 to 351 kcal/day. Resting energy expenditure calculated with the Harris-Benedict equations was more weakly correlated with measured resting energy expenditure (r² = .41, p < .0001), with Bland-Altman analysis showing a mean bias of 279 ± 346 kcal/day between them and the limits of agreement ranging from -399 to 957 kcal/day.

Overall, the study aimed to validate the efficacy of the previously described predictive method for assessing resting energy expenditure in the specific patient population.

### Predictive equations for energy expenditure in adult humans: From resting to free-living conditions [^115zYrcD]. Obesity (2022). Low credibility.

Humans acquire energy from the environment for survival. A central question for nutritional sciences is how much energy is required to sustain cellular work while maintaining an adequate body mass. Because human energy balance is not exempt from thermodynamic principles, the energy requirement can be approached from the energy expenditure. Conceptual and technological advances have allowed understanding of the physiological determinants of energy expenditure. Body mass, sex, and age are the main factors determining energy expenditure. These factors constitute the basis for predictive equations for resting (REE) and total (TEE) energy expenditure in healthy adults. These equations yield predictions that differ up to ~400 kcal/d for REE and ~550 kcal/d for TEE. Identifying additional factors accounting for such variability and the most valid equations appears relevant. This review used novel approaches based on mathematical modeling of REE and analyses of the data from which REE predictive equations were generated. As for TEE, R² and SE were considered because only a few predictive equations are available. From these analyses, Oxford's and Plucker's equations appear valid for predicting REE and TEE in adults, respectively.

### Association between basal metabolic rate and cognitive function in Chinese older adults: The mediating effect of sarcopenia [^1126o4as]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Basal metabolic rate estimation applied the Mifflin-St Jeor equations:

- **For males**: BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) − 5 × age (years) + 5.
- **For females**: BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) − 5 × age (years) − 161.

- **Sarcopenia**: The 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS2019) criteria exclude a sarcopenia diagnosis in those with intact chair stand ability and preserved strength. Probable sarcopenia applies to borderline cases showing strength or functional impairment. A definitive diagnosis requires low muscle mass plus either strength deficiency or functional limitation. Handgrip strength (HGS) evaluation employed a calibrated TM WL-1000 dynamometer (in kg units). Skeletal muscle strength was assessed by averaging peak measurements across both trials. Per diagnostic thresholds, reduced strength was defined as HGS ≤ 12 kg for men and ≤ 8 kg for women, a timed 12-second five-repetition chair stand, or an SPPB score ≤ 9.

Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) — a principal indicator of muscle quantity — was calculated using validated prediction equations. Studies demonstrate high concordance between ASM values derived from these equations and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), the reference method for body composition analysis. This measurement reliability is further verified in Chinese demographic samples: ASM = 0.193 × weight (kg) + 0.107 × height (cm) − (age and gender-specific constants).

### Circadian rhythms in resting metabolic rate account for apparent daily rhythms in the thermic effect of food [^113yjx3f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Fourteen participants completed the study: 8 male and 6 female. The mean age of the participants was 45.6 years (SD ± 9.6), height 173.2 cm (SD ± 9.2), weight 95.3 kg (SD ± 12.7), and body mass index was 31.7 (SD ± 3.04). The average energy intake (EI) over the day was 2223.4 ± 103.1 kcal (average of 741 ± 34 kcal per meal).

- **The effects of different approaches**: The effects of the different approaches to calculating the thermic effect of food (TEF) on the TEF incremental area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Fig. 2, and the calculated values are shown in Table 1. We found that when using the premeal resting metabolic rate (RMR) approach to calculate TEF, there was an overall significant effect of mealtime, with morning TEF (kcal) 1.6 and 2.4 times greater than TEF at lunch and dinner, respectively. Post hoc analysis showed that breakfast TEF (kcal) was significantly greater than lunch TEF (kcal) (P = 0.045) and dinner TEF (kcal) (P = 0.037), with no difference between lunch and dinner TEF (kcal) (P = 0.749).

- **Comparison of RMR approaches**: However, when using either the baseline RMR approach or the circadian RMR approach, there were no significant effects of mealtime, indicating no differences in TEF between breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This effect was due to the premeal RMR method underestimating the dinner TEF and overestimating the breakfast TEF compared to the circadian-derived method (see Table 1). While both the baseline RMR approach and the circadian RMR approach resulted in no significant differences in TEF between meals, adjusting for the underlying modeled circadian RMR yielded lower values for TEF for all meals compared to the baseline RMR approach (see Table 1). As a percentage of consumed EI, results were nearly identical for all methods used.

### Acute vigorous exercise decreases subsequent nonexercise physical activity and body temperature linked to weight gain [^117N17ot]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Low credibility.

Body temperature, serving as a sensitive indicator of whole-body metabolic activity, immune function, and physical activity levels, is largely influenced by nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) and basal metabolism. Therefore, a compensatory reduction in these physiological activities following exercise is more likely to be directly linked to a reduction in body temperature. In this context, we highlighted body temperature as a marker of thermogenesis encompassing NEAT and basal metabolism.

Our study revealed the vigorous exercise–specific reduction in body temperature during the dark period following exercise. This observation suggests that vigorous exercise leads to a decrease in subsequent thermogenesis, encompassing NEAT and basal metabolism. Intriguingly, we also observed a post-exercise reduction in body temperature during the late dark period, a time when exercise-induced reduction in nonexercise physical activity (NEPA) did not occur. This implies that thermogenesis decreased independently of NEPA during this period, namely, reducing other physiological tasks in response to exercise.

Probably, the post-exercise reduction in thermogenesis during the late dark period might result from decreases in the basal metabolic rate in mice. Considering that this reduction in body temperature during the late dark period is observed consistently in both moderate exercise (ME) and vigorous exercise (VE) groups, our results suggest that exercise is likely to elicit a compensatory reduction in basal metabolic rate in mice, independent of exercise intensity. This insight hints at the notion that a decrease in basal metabolic rate may preferentially occur following vigorous exercise.

### Screening for basal metabolic rate and visceral fat among postmenopausal osteoporosis with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113eVJWQ]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Low credibility.

In people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), there is an increase in basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is associated with the level of glycaemic control. Women with postmenopausal osteoporosis have decreased BMR. The aim of the present study is to find the BMR using the Mifflin-St Jeor predictive equation in women with T2DM who have attained menopause with osteoporosis.

- **Materials and methods**: 100 women who have attained menopause and were diagnosed with osteoporosis and T2DM were assessed for BMR using the Mifflin-St Jeor predictive equation. A detailed history of diabetes and menopause was obtained. Blood glucose values were measured using standard glucometers. Body composition for visceral fat (VF) was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. The level of physical activity of the participants was measured using the global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ).

- **Results**: The median BMR of the participants was 1,075 (714, 1,483.25). A statistically significant correlation was found between BMR and GPAQ (rₛ = 0.731), and BMR and VF (rₛ = 0.678). However, BMR was not correlated with fasting blood sugar (FBS) (rₛ = 0.083) or the duration of diabetes (rₛ = -0.046).

- **Conclusion**: There is a decrease in BMR in women with T2DM with postmenopausal osteoporosis. BMR was significantly correlated with the level of physical activity and visceral fat.

### Association between basal metabolic rate and cognitive function in Chinese older adults: The mediating effect of sarcopenia [^116HbitV]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Future research should prioritize several directions to validate and deepen insights into the BMR-sarcopenia-cognition nexus. Firstly, employ objective measures using indirect calorimetry for BMR and DXA for muscle mass to address methodological limitations. Secondly, integrate biomarker analyses, such as inflammatory cytokines, IGF-1, and oxidative stress markers, to elucidate underlying biological pathways. Thirdly, conduct intervention trials testing combined metabolic-muscle targets, like resistance training and nutritional support, to establish causality. Fourthly, extend longitudinal designs with baseline cognitive adjustments and longer follow-ups across diverse populations, including younger cohorts and multi-ethnic groups, to enhance generalizability and explore life-course effects. Finally, leverage advanced neuroimaging to assess brain-metabolism interactions.

### Relationship between basal metabolic rate, gender, age, and body composition in 8,780 white obese subjects [^114v9zeg]. Obesity (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of the present study was to explore the relationship between basal metabolic rate (BMR), gender, age, anthropometric characteristics, and body composition in severely obese white subjects. In total, 1,412 obese white children and adolescents (BMI > 97th percentile for gender and age) and 7,368 obese adults (BMI > 30 kg/m²) from 7 to 74 years were enrolled in this study. BMR was measured using an indirect calorimeter equipped with a canopy, and fat-free mass (FFM) was obtained using tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).

Using analysis of covariance, we tested the effect of gender on the relationship between BMR, age, anthropometry, and body composition. In children and adolescents, the predictor by gender interaction was significant in all cases except for FFM by gender. In adults, all predictor by gender interactions were significant. A prediction equation based on body weight (BW), age, and gender had virtually the same accuracy as the one based on FFM, age, and gender to predict BMR in both children and adults (R²(adj) = 0.59 and 0.60, respectively).

In conclusion, gender was a significant determinant of BMR in children and adolescents but not in adults. Our results support the hypothesis that the age-related decline in BMR is due to a reduction in FFM. Finally, anthropometric predictors of BMR are as accurate as body composition estimated by BIA.

### A cellular-level approach to predicting resting energy expenditure across the adult years [^1113WZpw]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

We previously derived a whole-body resting energy expenditure (REE) prediction model using organ and tissue mass measured by magnetic resonance imaging combined with assumed stable, specific resting metabolic rates of individual organs and tissues. Although the model predicted REE well in young persons, it overpredicted REE by approximately 11% in elderly adults. This overprediction may occur because of a decline in the fraction of organs and tissues as cell mass with aging.

- **Objective**: The aim of the present study was to develop a cellular-level REE prediction model that would be applicable across the adult age span. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that REE can be predicted from a combination of organ and tissue mass, the specific resting metabolic rates of individual organs and tissues, and the cellular fraction of fat-free mass.

- **Design**: Fifty-four healthy subjects aged 23–88 years had REE, organ and tissue mass, body cell mass, and fat-free mass measured by indirect calorimetry, magnetic resonance imaging, whole-body (40)K counting, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively.

- **Results**: REE predicted by the cellular-level model was highly correlated with measured REE (r = 0.92, P < 0.001). The mean difference between measured REE (x̅ ± SD: 1487 ± 294 kcal/d) and predicted REE (1501 ± 300 kcal/d) for the whole group was not significant, and the difference between predicted and measured REE was not associated with age (r = 0.009, NS).

- **Conclusion**: The present approach establishes an REE-body composition link with the use of a model at the cellular level.

### Basal metabolic rate and autonomic nervous system dysfunction in men with spinal cord injury [^116BuiNS]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between autonomic nervous system dysfunction and basal metabolic rate (BMR), as well as the effect of spasticity on basal metabolic rate.

Twenty men (11 paraplegic and 9 tetraplegic) with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)-A and -B grade chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) participated in this study. Total body fat mass and lean tissue mass were measured in all participants using DXA by standard methods. Patients were allocated into two groups to determine the effect of autonomic nervous system dysfunction on BMR:

- **Group I**: T6 and upper-level injuries with a history of autonomic dysreflexia.
- **Group II**: T7 and lower-level injuries without a history of autonomic dysreflexia. BMR was measured using indirect calorimetry under standardized conditions.

There were 13 patients in Group I and 7 patients in Group II. No significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of time since injury, BMI, age, weight, lean tissue mass, BMR, and BMR/kg.

The conclusion drawn is that autonomic nervous system dysfunction does not affect BMR and may be disregarded when considering energy needs in spinal cord injury.

### Mammalian maxilloturbinal evolution does not reflect thermal biology [^111rcCKu]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The presence of the maxilloturbinal has been used to infer the endothermic conditions and basal metabolic rates of extinct tetrapods, whereas its relative size has been argued and/or tested to correlate with body temperature and metabolic rates. However, extant mammalian species differ in their thermal and metabolic characteristics. Diminished temperature regulation, relatively low body temperature, and basal metabolic rates have been documented among marsupials, monotremes, xenarthrans, subterranean rodents, and afrotherians, as well as some mammals that undergo different forms of heterothermy (e.g. long-term hibernation or daily torpor). Such thermal and physiological exceptions have been hypothesized to be linked to peculiar maxilloturbinals.

Using a comparative three-dimensional (3D) µCT dataset of 424 skulls and unstained ethanol-preserved heads for 310 species across all major mammalian orders, we explored the anatomical diversity of the maxilloturbinal based on relative surface area, morphology, and complexity. We subsequently extended the initial investigations of Owerkowicz et al. and tested the hypothesis that maxilloturbinal size reflects species thermophysiology. We specifically test the relationship between the size-corrected basal metabolic rate (cBMR) and the relative surface area of the maxilloturbinal (Maxillo RSA), as well as between body temperature (T b) and Maxillo RSA.

Here, we show that neither corrected basal metabolic rate (cBMR) nor body temperature (T b) significantly correlate with the relative surface area of the maxilloturbinal (Maxillo RSA).

### Circadian rhythms in resting metabolic rate account for apparent daily rhythms in the thermic effect of food [^112cete2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

- **Thermic effect of food**: Calculated with a premeal resting metabolic rate (RMR) and baseline RMR of circadian RMR, reported as energy expenditure in kilocalories and as a percentage of energy intake.

- **Energy expenditure (EE)**: Measured fasting and for 15 hours over a day following three test meals provided at breakfast (1 hour after waking), lunch (5 hours after breakfast), and dinner (5 hours after lunch). Mean ± SEM are represented. The solid line shows measured EE over the entire day; the dotted line represents the baseline resting metabolic rate (RMR); short dashes represent the RMR directly before meals; and long dashes represent the circadian model of RMR.
