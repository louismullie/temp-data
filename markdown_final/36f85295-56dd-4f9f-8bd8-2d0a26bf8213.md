## Question

For chromosome 11 q deletion, what are the typical phenotypes and the general history seen in patients with this disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the typical phenotypes are and what general natural history is seen in patients with chromosome 11q terminal deletions (Jacobsen syndrome). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precisely defining the condition and avoiding conflation with 22q11.2 deletion syndromes. Then, I should verify the core phenotypic spectrum across neurodevelopmental, hematologic/immune, congenital, and prenatal domains. Next, I will assess natural history, genetics, and variability. After that, I need to distinguish Jacobsen syndrome from 22q11.2 deletion features. Finally, I should review diagnostic approaches, management implications, and the quality of evidence before synthesizing a concise clinical take-home, making sure each claim is supported by references and double-checking any assumptions I might be making.

> Let me first confirm the specific entity. Wait, let me verify the nomenclature and locus: chromosome 11q terminal deletion is classically Jacobsen syndrome, often involving distal 11q23.3 to the telomere, and typically presents as a contiguous gene deletion with multisystem involvement rather than a single-gene disorder. I need to ensure I do not mix this with the much more common 22q11.2 deletion syndrome; although both can involve immunologic manifestations, they are distinct conditions with different loci and typical features. Yes, Jacobsen syndrome is the terminal 11q deletion, confirmed across case series and cohort reports, including immunologic phenotypes and neurodevelopmental impacts, with considerable variability in deletion size and breakpoints in distal 11q [^112H6GMe] [^1154cXeE].

> Next, I should review the neurodevelopmental and behavioral profile. Let me think about the strength of evidence for ASD and cognitive outcomes. The prospective cohort of 17 patients showed a 47% prevalence of autism spectrum disorder without correlation to deletion size, and intellectual skills ranged from low average to severe or profound intellectual disability, with ID severity tending to correlate with deletion size. Hold on, I initially assumed ASD might scale with deletion size, but the data specifically say there was no correlation for ASD, which I should correct here. There is a candidate region in distal 11q including ARHGAP32 implicated in ASD risk. In prenatal settings, ventriculomegaly may be the only detectable CNS sign mid-trimester, so I should keep that on the radar for fetal counseling and surveillance planning [^113335Jp].

> Now, the hematologic and immunologic features deserve careful verification because they can drive morbidity. I will now examine the platelet phenotype and immune dysfunction. Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia with qualitative platelet dysfunction is characteristic and may present as chronic thrombocytopenia or bleeding diathesis. But wait, I should double-check the immune data: both case reports and small cohorts demonstrate vulnerabilities consistent with combined defects, including B-, T-, and NK-lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, impaired specific antibody responses to protein and polysaccharide vaccines, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections; in at least one adult, a late-onset combined immunodeficiency phenotype emerged in midlife, reminding me to consider lifelong immune surveillance. Autoimmunity, such as autoimmune thyroiditis, may complicate the course. I need to ensure I state this as a pattern observed in small studies rather than a universal finding, given sample sizes and heterogeneity [^112H6GMe] [^1154cXeE].

> Let me consider congenital and structural anomalies beyond hematology and immunity. I should verify specifics from prenatal and postnatal reports: facial dysmorphism is frequently noted, though descriptions vary; gastrointestinal anomalies such as Meckel's diverticulum and intestinal adhesions have been documented; pulmonary lobation anomalies including bilobed lungs have been reported; and prenatal features may include oligohydramnios and decreased fetal movements. I need to check if these are consistent across series or primarily case-level observations; the variability appears substantial, so I'll present them as possible rather than defining features. Severe asthma and cutaneous or genital condylomas in adults may partly reflect underlying immune dysfunction rather than primary developmental anomalies, which I should clarify to avoid over-attribution [^113335Jp] [^112H6GMe].

> Hold on, I should verify the genomic architecture and inheritance. Deletion sizes in well-characterized cohorts commonly range around 8.7 to 14.5 Mb at the 11q terminal region, with genotype-phenotype relationships complex and not reducible to a single "critical region" for the full syndrome. Most are de novo events, although parental rearrangements can occur and should be considered in counseling, particularly when array findings suggest structural variants or mosaicism. Let me be precise: the mid-2000s prenatal case demonstrates a de novo terminal deletion with paternal origin of the deleted segment, and the 17-patient ASD study maps deletion extents via array CGH, reinforcing the typical distal 11q involvement. I should confirm that interstitial deletions can also present with similar immune and bleeding vulnerabilities in some cases, underscoring contiguous gene effects and heterogeneity [^113335Jp] [^1154cXeE].

> I will now examine the temporal presentation and natural history. Prenatally, subtle CNS findings such as mild to moderate ventriculomegaly or oligohydramnios may be the earliest signs, sometimes in isolation. In infancy and early childhood, thrombocytopenia and bleeding tendencies often surface first, with neurodevelopmental delays becoming more apparent during early developmental milestones and schooling. But wait, the immune phenotype may evolve: recurrent infections can emerge in later childhood, and, in some patients, clinically significant combined immunodeficiency may manifest only in adulthood, necessitating periodic reassessment rather than one-time clearing. Autoimmunity may appear later, which I should note for anticipatory guidance [^113335Jp] [^1154cXeE] [^112H6GMe].

> But wait, what if I'm inadvertently importing features from 22q11.2 deletion syndrome? I initially thought conotruncal cardiac defects and thymic hypoplasia might be expected here as in 22q11.2 deletion, but that would be a mistake; those are cardinal for 22q11.2 deletion and should not be ascribed to 11q deletions without direct evidence. I should double-check and state explicitly: Jacobsen syndrome is distinct from 22q11.2 deletion syndromes in both locus and typical phenotype profiles; while both may show immunologic issues, the 22q11.2 phenotype classically includes conotruncal heart disease, thymic hypoplasia with T-cell lymphopenia, and velopharyngeal insufficiency, among other features, and it is far more prevalent in the general population. This is an important diagnostic and counseling distinction to prevent misattribution given the numerical similarity of the loci [^1148K2fs] [^113Goqa5] [^114btiCF].

> Next, I should review diagnostic pathways and prenatal detection considerations. Let me first confirm the role of chromosomal microarray for postnatal diagnosis in individuals with developmental delay, ASD, and multiple congenital anomalies; CMA is the first-tier test with clearly superior diagnostic yield to karyotype, which aligns with standard practice for suspected CNVs. For prenatal detection, I need to check: noninvasive prenatal testing can sometimes flag subchromosomal imbalances including Jacobsen syndrome, but confirmatory diagnostic testing via invasive sampling and array CGH is required due to screening limitations; prenatal ultrasound may detect ventriculomegaly or other anomalies, but findings can be subtle or isolated mid-trimester. I should ensure counseling emphasizes the variable expressivity and the need for confirmatory testing if screening is positive [^115aSXfY] [^112CK9iF] [^113335Jp].

> For management, I need to ensure a multidisciplinary, anticipatory approach grounded in observed risks. I should confirm that baseline and longitudinal hematologic assessment for thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction is warranted, along with bleeding precautions and perioperative planning. For immunity, periodic reassessment of quantitative immunoglobulins and specific antibody responses, with a low threshold for immunology referral, antibiotic prophylaxis, or immunoglobulin replacement when clinically indicated, is reasonable in light of recurrent infections and impaired vaccine responses reported in cohorts and case studies. Hold on, I should verify that these recommendations are inferred from limited Jacobsen-specific data and general immunology practice; by analogy, frameworks from 22q11.2 immunology guidelines illustrate principles of evolving humoral dysfunction and periodic reassessment across the lifespan, but I must clearly state they are not Jacobsen-specific and should be adapted case-by-case given the current evidence base [^1154cXeE] [^112H6GMe] [^1137dgXo].

> I should now assess data quality and limitations. The available Jacobsen-specific literature consists largely of small cohorts and case reports from which generalization is challenging, and heterogeneity in breakpoints and gene content complicates genotype-phenotype mapping. Let me reconsider whether critical-region reasoning applies strongly here; evidence from other contiguous gene syndromes, such as ATR-16, supports that severity often scales with deletion size but is substantially modified by genetic background, without a single critical region explaining the full phenotype. Therefore, I need to emphasize that clinical variability is expected and caution against overinterpreting small series for universal screening or management mandates [^1154cXeE] [^111399gf] [^113335Jp] [^116kxN1H].

> Final synthesis: Jacobsen syndrome, a distal 11q terminal deletion disorder, typically features Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia with platelet dysfunction, variable neurodevelopmental impairment with a high prevalence of ASD, and a spectrum of congenital anomalies including gastrointestinal and pulmonary lobation findings, with prenatal clues such as ventriculomegaly and oligohydramnios. Immune abnormalities may involve combined defects and impaired vaccine responses, with some cases evolving to clinically significant immunodeficiency only later in life, warranting periodic reassessment. Prognosis and expressivity are variable across patients due to differences in deletion size and genetic background. This condition is distinct from the more common 22q11.2 deletion syndrome; clinicians should avoid conflating their phenotypes despite numerical similarity. Diagnosis relies on chromosomal microarray postnatally and confirmatory testing of any prenatal screening findings, and care is multidisciplinary with hematology and immunology surveillance tailored to clinical course and evolving immune function over time [^112H6GMe] [^111399gf] [^113335Jp] [^1154cXeE] [^115aSXfY] [^113Goqa5].

Chromosome 11q deletion syndrome (Jacobsen syndrome) is a rare contiguous gene disorder [^111399gf] with a prevalence of ~1/100,000 live births and a female predominance (2:1). The phenotype is multisystem and variable, with severity correlating to deletion size and specific gene loss [^111399gf]. Key features include Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia (96%) with bleeding risk, congenital heart defects (44–56%) such as left-sided lesions, and developmental delay/intellectual disability (mild to severe) [^111399gf]. Additional findings include craniofacial dysmorphism, growth restriction, immunodeficiency (B/T-cell defects, hypogammaglobulinemia) [^112H6GMe] [^1154cXeE], and neurobehavioral issues (ASD, ADHD, anxiety, rare psychosis) [^111399gf].

Most cases are de novo; inheritance is autosomal dominant with 50% recurrence if a parent is affected. Management is multidisciplinary, with early diagnosis [^115aSXfY] and surveillance improving outcomes.

---

## Genetic basis and inheritance

Chromosome 11q deletions are terminal or interstitial and most often involve 11q23.3–q25 [^1154cXeE], typically spanning 7–20 Mb and disrupting multiple genes [^113335Jp]. Inheritance is predominantly de novo (~85%); when a parent is affected, transmission is autosomal dominant with a 50% recurrence risk.

## Clinical phenotypes

### Hematological abnormalities

**Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia** occurs in approximately 96% of patients [^1154cXeE] and is characterized by macrothrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction [^112H6GMe], and a bleeding diathesis. Manifestations include easy bruising, epistaxis, mucosal bleeding, and perioperative hemorrhage.

---

### Congenital heart defects

**Congenital heart disease** affects 44–56% of patients [^1154cXeE]. Common defects include left-sided lesions (hypoplastic left heart, coarctation, bicuspid aortic valve), septal defects, and conotruncal anomalies.

---

### Craniofacial dysmorphism

Characteristic facial features include **hypertelorism, ptosis, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, a thin upper lip, micrognathia, low-set ears, and a high forehead**. These findings aid clinical recognition when considered alongside anomalies in other systems [^1154cXeE].

---

### Growth and developmental abnormalities

Growth restriction is common, with **prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, short stature, and microcephaly** [^1154cXeE]. Developmental impairment ranges from mild to severe intellectual disability and is associated with speech and motor delays and hypotonia [^111399gf].

---

### Immunological abnormalities

**Immunodeficiency** may include B- and T-cell defects [^1154cXeE] and hypogammaglobulinemia [^112H6GMe], leading to recurrent infections. Autoimmune manifestations include thyroiditis [^1154cXeE] and Evans syndrome.

---

### Neurobehavioral and psychiatric manifestations

Neurobehavioral features include ADHD, anxiety, ASD [^111399gf], and rarely psychosis. Structural brain anomalies have been reported, including ventriculomegaly [^113335Jp], agenesis of the corpus callosum, and cerebellar hypoplasia.

---

### Other congenital anomalies

- **Renal anomalies**: Hydronephrosis, renal dysplasia, vesicoureteral reflux [^1154cXeE].
- **Gastrointestinal anomalies**: Malrotation, Meckel's diverticulum, anal atresia [^113335Jp].
- **Skeletal anomalies**: Clinodactyly, syndactyly, scoliosis.

---

## Genotype-phenotype correlations

Phenotypic severity generally increases with **larger deletions**, which are associated with more severe intellectual disability, cardiac defects, and immunodeficiency [^111399gf]. Critical genes implicated include FLI1 for thrombocytopenia, ETS1 for immunodeficiency, JAM3 for cardiac defects, and KIRREL3 for neurodevelopmental delay.

---

## Natural history and prognosis

- **Infancy**: Neonatal thrombocytopenia, cardiac defects, growth restriction, developmental delay [^1154cXeE].
- **Childhood**: Persistent developmental delay, recurrent infections, bleeding, behavioral issues [^111399gf].
- **Adolescence/adulthood**: Continued ID, psychiatric disorders, chronic health issues (cardiac, immune, hematologic) [^112H6GMe].
- **Life expectancy**: Reduced, with mortality from cardiac defects, bleeding, and infections [^1154cXeE].

---

## Management and treatment

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Hematology, cardiology, immunology, neurology, genetics, developmental pediatrics [^1154cXeE].
- **Hematological management**: Platelet transfusions, antifibrinolytics, DDAVP, thrombopoietin receptor agonists.
- **Cardiac management**: Surgical repair, medical management, regular surveillance.
- **Immunological management**: Immunoglobulin replacement, prophylactic antibiotics, vaccinations [^112H6GMe].
- **Developmental management**: Early intervention, speech/occupational/physical therapy, special education [^111399gf].
- **Psychiatric management**: Behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy for ADHD, anxiety, ASD.
- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for families regarding recurrence risk and prenatal diagnosis [^113335Jp].

---

## Prenatal diagnosis

Prenatal diagnosis relies on **chromosomal microarray or FISH** performed on samples from amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling [^115aSXfY] [^112CK9iF]. Noninvasive prenatal testing may suggest 11q deletions but requires diagnostic confirmation [^112CK9iF].

### Terminal deletion of 11q with significant late-onset combined immune deficiency [^112H6GMe]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

We report a 45-year-old female adult patient with terminal deletion of chromosome 11q, resulting in a clinical phenotype of late-onset combined immunodeficiency. We describe the clinical phenotype and discuss the similarities between our patient and those with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Immunological evaluation included immunoglobulin levels, vaccine responses, number and function of T, NK, and B cell subsets, and a comparative genomic hybridization test of blood and fibroblasts.

The patient suffered from recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia, genital and cutaneous condylomas. She had a history of learning difficulties, dysmorphic features, autoimmune thyroiditis, chronic thrombocytopenia, and severe asthma. We found Paris-Trousseau type thrombocytopenia, B-, T- and NK-lymphopenia, T cell oligoclonality, and IgG hypogammaglobulinemia, with an inability to respond to pneumococcal polysaccharide, tetanus, and diphtheria vaccines. A terminal deletion of chromosome 11q, compatible with partial Jacobsen syndrome, was found.

This confirms Jacobsen syndrome as a chromosome deletion syndrome able to cause combined immunodeficiency.

### Patients with chromosome 11q deletions are characterized by inborn errors of immunity involving both B and T lymphocytes [^1154cXeE]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. Firstly, we describe only a small cohort in whom the genetic defects vary considerably and chromosomal abnormalities occur. This reflects medical practice as 11q disorders are a rare contiguous gene syndrome, but extrapolation of results to other 11q disorders is challenging. In our cohort, seven patients had the "classical" Jacobsen syndrome (11q23.3 terminal deletion syndrome). Two patients had an interstitial 11q deletion. We have chosen to include these two patients as well because both show the same vulnerability to infections and bleeding as terminal 11q patients exhibit. It is unknown if this is due to other candidate genes or due to downstream loss of function resembling terminal 11q deletion patients.

There is hardly any data available on this rare entity, and with our results, we aim to raise awareness that inborn errors of immunity may be seen in patients with interstitial 11q disorders. The same accounts for the two 11q duplication patients. Three patients had additional chromosomal abnormalities, one of whom, P14, had a combination also referred to as Emanuel syndrome. No clear inborn errors of immunity have yet been reported to occur in Emanuel syndrome, but frequent ENT infections are reported in cases and are mentioned by the unique patient organization to occur "in a minority". The trisomy of 11q23.3 in our patient may give rise to hypogammaglobulinemia and T lymphocyte dysfunction, but the 22q11 region can also cause T lymphocyte dysfunctions or T lymphocytopenia as is seen in other chromosome 22q disorders.

### Evidence for autism spectrum disorder in Jacobsen syndrome: Identification of a candidate gene in distal 11q [^111399gf]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Jacobsen syndrome, also called the 11q terminal deletion disorder, is a contiguous gene disorder caused by the deletion of the end of the long arm of chromosome 11. Intellectual skills range from low average to severe/profound intellectual disability and usually correlate with deletion size. Comprehensive genotype and phenotype evaluations are limited, and little is known about specific behavioral characteristics associated with the 11q terminal deletion disorder.

In this prospective study, 17 patients with 11q terminal deletion disorder underwent cognitive and behavioral assessments. Deletion sizes were determined by array comparative genomic hybridization. Deletion sizes ranged from 8.7 to 14.5 Mb across the patients. We found that 8 of 17 patients (47%) exhibited behavioral characteristics consistent with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. There was no correlation between deletion size and the presence of autism spectrum disorder, implicating at least one predisposing gene in the distal 8.7 Mb of 11q. The findings from three additional patients with autistic features and "atypical" distal 11q deletions led to the identification of an autism "critical region" in distal 11q containing four annotated genes, including ARHGAP32 (also known as RICS), a gene encoding rho GTPase activating protein.

Results from this study support early autism spectrum disorder screening for patients with 11q terminal deletion disorder and provide further molecular insights into the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder.

### The role of parental cognitive, behavioral, and motor profiles in clinical variability in individuals with chromosome 16p11.2 deletions [^1163vZdk]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Most disorders caused by copy number variants (CNVs) display significant clinical variability, often referred to as incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Genetic and environmental sources of this variability are not well understood.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the contributors to phenotypic variability in probands with CNVs involving the same genomic region, measure the effect size for de novo mutation events, and explore the contribution of familial background to resulting cognitive, behavioral, and motor performance outcomes in probands with de novo CNVs.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Family-based study design with a volunteer sample of 56 individuals with de novo 16p11.2 deletions and their noncarrier parents and siblings from the Simons Variation in Individuals Project.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: We used linear mixed-model analysis to measure effect size and intraclass correlation to determine the influence of family background for a de novo CNV on quantitative traits representing three neurodevelopmental domains: cognitive ability (Full-Scale IQ), social behavior (Social Responsiveness Scale), and neuromotor performance (Purdue Pegboard Test). An anthropometric trait, body mass index, was included for comparison.

- **Results**: A significant deleterious effect of the 16p11.2 deletion was demonstrated across all domains. Relative to the biparental mean, the effect sizes were -1.7 SD for cognitive ability, 2.2 SD for social behavior, and -1.3 SD for neuromotor performance (p < 0.001). Despite these large deleterious effects, significant po…

### Mouse and human CRKL is dosage sensitive for cardiac outflow tract formation [^117LBwvL]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

The human chromosome 22q11.2 region is susceptible to rearrangements during meiosis, leading to velo-cardio-facial/DiGeorge/22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) characterized by conotruncal heart defects (CTDs) and other congenital anomalies. The majority of individuals have a 3 Mb deletion whose proximal region contains the presumed disease-associated gene TBX1 (T-box 1). Although a small subset have proximal nested deletions including TBX1, individuals with distal deletions that exclude TBX1 have also been identified. The deletions are flanked by low-copy repeats (LCR22A, B, C, D).

We describe cardiac phenotypes in 25 individuals with atypical distal nested deletions within the 3 Mb region that do not include TBX1, including 20 with LCR22B to LCR22D deletions and 5 with nested LCR22C to LCR22D deletions. Together with previous reports, 12 of 37 (32%) with LCR22B-D deletions and 5 of 34 (15%) individuals with LCR22C-D deletions had CTDs, including tetralogy of Fallot. In the absence of TBX1, we hypothesized that CRKL (Crk-like), mapping to the LCR22C-D region, might contribute to the cardiac phenotype in these individuals.

We created an allelic series in mice of Crkl, including a hypomorphic allele, to test for gene expression effects on phenotype. We found that the spectrum of heart defects depends on Crkl expression, occurring with analogous malformations to those in human individuals, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of CRKL could be responsible for the etiology of CTDs in individuals with nested distal deletions and might act as a genetic modifier.

### Novel microdeletion syndromes detected by chromosome microarrays [^116KQ3i6]. Human Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

Array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) has revolutionized cytogenetic testing available for patients with learning disabilities who exhibit "chromosomal" phenotypes with dysmorphic features and multiple anomalies. Screening large patient cohorts with mental retardation by array CGH has recently led to the characterization of many novel microdeletion and microduplication syndromes, initially identified through shared cytogenetic aberrations, followed by the secondary characterization of corresponding phenotypes.

This review provides a detailed clinical and molecular cytogenetic description of several common aberrations. We focus on patients whose cytogenetic abnormalities were principally described by array CGH, rather than G-banded karyotyping or fluorescence in-situ hybridization. The syndromes we examine include the 17q21.31 deletion and 17q21.31 duplication syndromes, 15q13.3 deletion syndrome, 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, 15q24 deletion syndrome, 1q41q42 deletion syndrome, 2p15p16.1 deletion syndrome, and 9q22.3 deletion syndrome.

In time, we hypothesize that at least some of these will become as clinically well characterized and recognizable to clinicians as the more common microdeletion syndromes today. Although the full extent of the phenotypes is still evolving for many of these novel microdeletions, it is evident that array CGH has heralded an unparalleled era of discovery for clinical cytogenetics.

### Schizophrenia and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^114VxLmN]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS) is a genetic syndrome associated with a chromosome 22q11.2 deletion and variable phenotypic expression that commonly includes schizophrenia. Approximately 1% of patients with schizophrenia have 22qDS. The schizophrenia in 22qDS appears broadly similar to that found in the general population with respect to core signs and symptoms, treatment response, neurocognitive profile, and MRI brain anomalies. However, individuals with a 22qDS form of schizophrenia typically have distinguishable physical features, a lower IQ, and may differ in auxiliary clinical features. IQ, length of 22q11.2 deletions, and COMT functional allele do not appear to be major risk factors for schizophrenia in 22qDS. Ascertainment biases and small sample sizes are limitations of most studies. Larger studies over the lifespan and continuing education about this underrecognized condition are needed. 22qDS-schizophrenia is an important genetic subtype and a valuable model of neurodevelopmental mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the immunological management of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and other defects in thymic development [^1148K2fs]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Historically, patients were labeled as having DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) if they had hypocalcemia, thymic hypoplasia, and conotruncal cardiac anomalies, and as having velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) if they demonstrated dysmorphic facies and conotruncal cardiac anomalies. It was eventually recognized that DGS and VCFS had both phenotypic overlap and a common genetic basis, with 90% of each group having a hemizygous 22q11.2 deletion. Thus, the term VCFS has largely fallen out of favor and is now generally referred to as 22q11.2del or DGS in instances where the deletion is not detected.

Given the advances in molecular diagnostics, the practice of referring to a condition by its underlying genetic cause has become commonplace in many medical specialties, including immunology. Available information suggests that 90% of patients diagnosed with DGS have a hemizygous 22q11.2 deletion. Thus, when a deletion of 22q11.2 can be confirmed, many specialists now refer to the condition as 22q11.2del rather than DGS. Other centers may label an affected individual to have DGS secondary to 22q11.2del. Other experts have recommended abandoning the term "DiGeorge syndrome" altogether, although this proposal makes it difficult when the phenotypic criteria are met but a genetic defect cannot be identified.

### Mavyret [^1129GmQG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Selection of HCV genotype 1a, 2a, or 3a replicons for reduced susceptibility to pibrentasvir resulted in the emergence of amino acid substitutions at known NS5A inhibitor resistance-associated positions, including Q30D/deletion, Y93D/H/N, or H58D + Y93H in genotype 1a replicons; F28S + M31I or P29S + K30G in genotype 2a replicons; and Y93H in genotype 3a replicons. The majority of individual amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to other HCV NS5A inhibitors at positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93 in NS5A did not reduce susceptibility to pibrentasvir. However, individual NS5A amino acid substitutions that reduced susceptibility to pibrentasvir include M28G or Q30D in a genotype 1a replicon (244-fold and 94-fold, respectively), and a P32-deletion in a genotype 1b replicon (1,036-fold).

- **Genotype 3b replicon**: In a genotype 3b replicon, the presence of naturally occurring polymorphisms K30 and M31 in NS5A reduced susceptibility to pibrentasvir by 24-fold relative to the activity of pibrentasvir in a genotype 3a replicon. The introduction of an NS5A Y93H substitution into a genotype 3b replicon further reduced susceptibility to pibrentasvir by 6,336-fold.

Some combinations of two or more NS5A inhibitor resistance-associated amino acid substitutions may result in greater reductions in pibrentasvir susceptibility.

### Velocardiofacial syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome: The chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndromes [^113Goqa5]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Velocardiofacial syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, and other related clinical syndromes share a high frequency of hemizygous deletions of chromosome 22q11.2. This deletion syndrome is notably common, affecting nearly one in 3000 children. Here, we focus on recent advances in cardiac assessment, speech, immunology, and pathophysiology of velocardiofacial syndrome. The complex medical care of patients requires a multidisciplinary approach, and each patient has unique clinical features necessitating a tailored approach. While patients with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome might achieve a high level of functioning, most often, interventions are needed to enhance the function of various organ systems.

### Prenatal diagnosis of a large de novo terminal deletion of chromosome 11q [^113335Jp]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2006). Low credibility.

To describe the prenatal phenotype of the 11q deletion syndrome (Jacobsen syndrome) and present the molecular characterization of the deletion in the case presented, an ultrasound at 18 and 20 weeks of gestation was performed on a 34-year-old woman who presented for amniocentesis. The ultrasound revealed slow fetal movements, oligohydramnios, and dilatation of the cerebral ventricles. The maternal and paternal ages were 34 and 38 years, respectively.

Prenatal karyotyping of cultured amniotic fluid cells revealed an 11q terminal deletion, 46, XX, del(11)(q23) (Jacobsen syndrome). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis was used to identify and physically map the breakpoint to a 45-kb region located 14.5 Mb from the 11q telomere. Polymorphic DNA marker analysis showed that DNA sequences on the paternally derived chromosome are deleted. At autopsy, facial dysmorphism without major malformations was recorded. Examination of the internal organs disclosed the following abnormalities: a Meckel's diverticulum of 4-mm length, adhesion between the gall bladder and the transverse colon, and bilaterally bilobed lungs without further situs anomalies.

Our case demonstrates significant phenotypic variability of Jacobsen syndrome at midtrimester pregnancy; the syndrome may be manifested at this stage only by mild to moderate ventriculomegaly of the brain.

### Genetic compensation in a human genomic disorder [^112KGV7k]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Cytogenetic studies of the parents of a girl with the DiGeorge (or velocardiofacial) syndrome, who carried a deletion at 22q11.2, revealed an unexpected rearrangement of both 22q11.2 regions in the unaffected father. He carried a 22q11.2 deletion on one copy of chromosome 22 and a reciprocal 22q11.2 duplication on the other copy of chromosome 22. Genetic compensation, which is consistent with the normal phenotype of the father, was shown through quantitative-expression analyses of genes located within the genetic region associated with the DiGeorge syndrome. This finding has implications for genetic counseling and represents a case of genetic compensation in a human genomic disorder.

### Atr-16 syndrome: mechanisms linking monosomy to phenotype [^116kxN1H]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

Deletions removing 100s-1000s kb of DNA and variable numbers of poorly characterized genes are often found in patients with a wide range of developmental abnormalities. In such cases, understanding the contribution of the deletion to an individual's clinical phenotype is challenging.

- **Methods**: Here, as an example of this common phenomenon, we analyzed 41 patients with simple deletions of ~177 to ~2000 kb affecting one allele of the well-characterized, gene-dense, distal region of chromosome 16 (16p13.3), referred to as ATR-16 syndrome. We characterized deletion extents and screened for genetic background effects, telomere position effect, and compensatory upregulation of hemizygous genes.

- **Results**: We find the risk of developmental and neurological abnormalities arises from much smaller distal chromosome 16 deletions (~400 kb) than previously reported. Beyond this, the severity of ATR-16 syndrome increases with deletion size, but there is no evidence that critical regions determine the developmental abnormalities associated with this disorder. Surprisingly, we find no evidence of telomere position effect or compensatory upregulation of hemizygous genes; however, genetic background effects substantially modify phenotypic abnormalities.

- **Conclusions**: Using ATR-16 as a general model of disorders caused by CNVs, we show the degree to which individuals with contiguous gene syndromes are affected is not simply related to the number of genes deleted but depends on their genetic background. We also show there is no critical region defining the degree of phenotypic abnormalities.

### 22q13 deletion syndrome: An update and review for the primary pediatrician [^117Qm1bc]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Recent advances in genetic testing can help provide a specific diagnosis to children born with syndromes that result in congenital anomalies and developmental delay. One such emerging condition is the 22q13 deletion syndrome. With the introduction of subtelomeric fluorescence-in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, the 22q13 deletion has become recognized as a relatively widespread and underdiagnosed cause of mental retardation.

Primary-care physicians play an important role in the care of children with 22q13 deletion syndrome, from suspecting the diagnosis in a developmentally delayed child through the medical, developmental, and behavioral aspects of their care. Furthermore, they serve as a valuable source of support and advocacy for the family and a resource for other care providers.

The remainder of this article addresses the state of knowledge regarding 22q13 deletion syndrome and offers the primary-care physician a framework in which to provide care and information.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the immunological management of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and other defects in thymic development [^114iu9hF]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

In late 2020, an immunology workgroup was formed with the specific intent of reviewing and addressing these widely varying approaches and working to offer comprehensive management guidelines. The workgroup consisted of members of the Advocacy Committee of the Clinical Immunology Society with clinical immunologists considered experts in the field. Based on experience related to 22q11.2 deletion/DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and other defects in thymic development (DTD), identified experts were invited to participate from five countries: Canada, Colombia, Italy, the UK, and the United States.

Surveys were sent to 13 invited physicians, consisting of 39 questions assessing their individual approach related to the diagnosis and immunologic management of patients affected with these conditions. The questions and their answers were reviewed and discussed over two subsequent meetings among the workgroup and served as a platform to establish clinical practice guidelines in both the affected pediatric and adult populations. A draft manuscript was subsequently circulated among the workgroup for review and editing and was followed by a third meeting for final edits as deemed appropriate.

Guidelines in this manuscript focus on the immune system and are based on a literature review of over 100 clinically relevant publications, as well as the collective experience and majority consensus of the workgroup members. Content includes addressing the T cell compartment and B cell abnormalities, the latter of which may predispose affected individuals to infections later in childhood and into adulthood.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the immunological management of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and other defects in thymic development [^1172rrZj]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

These findings have led to the recommendation for patients with 22q11.2 deletion to undergo periodic evaluations, including a humoral immune assessment beginning at 8–10 months of age, regardless of whether earlier immune assessments are normal. Quantitative immunoglobulin assessments should be conducted earlier if the child experiences early onset of recurrent, unusual, refractory, or severe infections. It is important to note that IgG in an infant is predominantly maternally derived early in life, and an undetectable IgA level (< 6 mg/dL) is not considered abnormal in the first year of life. The workgroup recommends obtaining periodic humoral assessments along with a detailed clinical infection history initially every 5 years if clinically well regarding infections, and then every 5–10 years. If the infection history is abnormal or if ongoing humoral assessments are abnormal, an additional and more comprehensive immune work-up should be performed, including an assessment of capsular polysaccharide-specific responses.

- **Specific antibody responses**: Similar to other primary immune deficiency disorders, in cases of 22q11.2 deletion, normal immunoglobulin levels do not exclude impaired specific antibody responses. In a study evaluating the frequency of impaired specific antibody response to pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens in individuals aged 4 to 22 years, 11 of 20 patients (55%) had an abnormal or poor response. All but one of these patients had IgG levels over 550 mg/dL, and 80% were experiencing reinfections. The frequency and severity of infections improved following prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole or IgG replacement therapy.

Frequency of immunological assessment

Expert opinion has been divided regarding the follow-up needed in the absence of clinical infection. Some clinicians obtain an initial immunologic lab set at the time of diagnosis or initial evaluation and, if normal or deemed unremarkable, recommend immunology follow-up only on an as-needed basis, largely depending on the clinical course. This practice contrasts with the approach of other clinicians who recommend serial immunological evaluations, including lab studies in the first year of life and then annually thereafter, even when the initial lab sets are normal and one's infection history is unremarkable. Most approaches fall between these practices. General guidelines published in 2011 for managing patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome recommended immunologic evaluations at diagnosis, 0 to 12 months, and 1 to 5 years.

The rationale for the updated consensus is largely due to evidence suggesting that immune function changes over time in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, with humoral deficiencies being recognized more frequently later in childhood and into adulthood. Recommendations suggest an evaluation at the time of diagnosis and prior to 12 months of age (assuming initial diagnosis is made early in life). Subsequent immune evaluations are recommended following the 4–5-year booster series (including MMRV) and every 5–10 years thereafter, guided by clinical course and patient or family preference. Additional follow-ups are recommended sooner or in between the regularly recommended intervals should recurrent, severe, unusual, or refractory infections occur.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^117MkqS9]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

We present here the largest Dutch clinical cohort with different pathogenic 16p11.2 deletions and duplications. All 100 cases were assessed at our clinical genetics center at Amsterdam UMC. Genetic testing was initiated based on clinical presentation, with chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) often being a first-tier test for cases with intellectual disabilities and/or congenital anomalies. It is likely that we have predominantly observed cases with more severe phenotypes. However, we also included relatives, such as parents and siblings carrying the same 16p11.2 copy number variation (CNV), who had questions about recurrence risks rather than their own clinical phenotype.

It is known that cases with 16p11.2 CNVs exhibit significant clinical heterogeneity, as demonstrated in our cohort. In general, the prevalence of clinical features in our cohort of cases with different 16p11.2 CNVs resembles those described in previously reported large cohorts.

### 19q13.11 cryptic deletion: Description of two new cases and indication for a role of WTIP haploinsufficiency in hypospadias [^111ZMxV3]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Comparing all the reported patients, we confirm a significantly more severe phenotype in patient 1 than in others concerning the presence of a disabling movement disorder and the severity of developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID). We did not identify any genes in the deleted region that can currently be considered as an obvious candidate for dystonia, which dominates the clinical phenotype of our patient 1. Therefore, a synergistic effect between several genes may be a predisposing factor for this phenotypical feature. Eventually, other genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors would be clearly required for the full expression of dystonia, according to the second hit model. Alternatively, changed expression/regulation of genes in the vicinity of the deletion might contribute to the more severe phenotype of this patient, or, finally, the deletion might unmask a recessive mutation in a gene responsible for dystonia.

In addition, patient 1 had a long Q–T episode related to pimozide treatment. It is well known that neuroleptics can be associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including prolongation of the Q–T interval, and sudden death due to inhibition of cardiovascular sodium, calcium, and potassium channels. The 19q13.11 deleted region includes the SCN1B gene encoding a sodium channel β-1 subunit whose heterozygous mutations may result in generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, Brugada syndrome 5, and defects in cardiac conduction. Thus, SCN1B haploinsufficiency might have a synergistic effect with pimozide, making manifest an otherwise hidden abnormal repolarization defect.

### Prevalence of hypocalcaemia and its associated features in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^1162zn41]. Clinical endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Hypocalcaemia is considered a classic feature of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), a common yet still under-recognized genetic syndrome associated with hemizygous microdeletions of the long arm of chromosome 22. The deletion is present in over 1 in 4000 live births and usually occurs as a de novo mutation; only about 10% of individuals are found to have inherited the deletion from an affected parent. The clinical presentation of 22q11.2DS is highly variable, with manifestations involving multiple organ systems and of wide-ranging severity, differing from patient to patient. Thus far, there is no confirmed association between any two endocrine features. While some features are recognizable in infancy, many others, including hypocalcaemia, can occur later. The severe set of features associated with DiGeorge syndrome, one of the previous names for 22q11.2DS, is now known to be rare in the syndrome.

Previous studies have reported that the prevalence of hypocalcaemia in 22q11.2DS ranges from 32.8% to 64.1%, but most have involved paediatric cohorts and/or relatively small samples of older individuals. Hypoparathyroidism is considered the primary cause of hypocalcaemia in the syndrome. The presentation of hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism ranges from 'transient' neonatal hypocalcaemia to overt hypoparathyroidism. Patients can experience a wide range of symptoms, such as fatigue, 'brain fog', and paraesthesia, with more severe manifestations including a lowered seizure threshold and prolongation of the QT interval.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^113vPTjP]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). High credibility.

The 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, hyperphagia, obesity, macrocephaly, and psychiatric problems. Cases with 16p11.2 duplication syndrome exhibit similar neurodevelopmental issues but typically show a partial 'mirror phenotype' with underweight and microcephaly. Various copy number variants (CNVs) of the chromosomal 16p11.2 region have been described. Most information is known about the 'typical' 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 (29.6–30.2 Mb; ~600 kb) deletions and duplications, but there are also several published cohorts with more distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs (28.8–29.0 Mb; ~220 kb), which exhibit clinical overlap.

We assessed 100 cases with various pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs and compared their clinical characteristics to provide clearer genotype-phenotype correlations and raise awareness of the different 16p11.2 CNVs. Neurodevelopmental and weight issues were reported in the majority of cases. Cases with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion showed the most severe obesity phenotype (73.7% obesity, mean BMI SDS 3.2). In addition to the better-defined typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 and distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs, we describe the clinical features of five cases with other overlapping 16p11.2 CNVs in more detail.

Interestingly, four cases had a second genetic diagnosis, and 18 cases had an additional gene variant of uncertain significance, which could potentially help explain the cases' phenotypes. In conclusion, we provide an overview of our Dutch cohort of cases with various pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs and relevant second genetic diagnoses.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^111auMYv]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

Information about adaptive functioning and disharmonic intelligence profiles was incomplete and not taken into account in our study. The variety of neurocognitive problems associated with pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs can lead to difficulties in daily functioning. Early diagnosis and guidelines for support and treatment are important for overall functioning and quality of life. For all cases with a 16p11.2 CNV and DD/ID, early intervention services, such as speech or physical therapy and educational interventions may be helpful. We advise performing an IQ assessment at least once and more often (particularly at every transition between educational levels) when learning problems are observed. Some cases can benefit from psychological/psychiatric evaluation and interventions to address behavioral and emotional problems, such as psycho-education or cognitive-behavioral therapy. Clinicians should be careful with prescribing potentially obesogenic psychotropic medication for cases with 16p11.2 deletion and anorexic medication to cases with 16p11.2 duplication. A pharmacogenetic passport will be offered to cases with 16p11.2 CNV who visit our clinics. Such a passport provides recommendations for medication choice and dosage, based on an individual's genotype data, to minimize side effects and optimize personalized medical treatment. An overview of our clinical recommendations is provided in Supplementary Table S2.

### Six at sixty. 'Have you tested for 22q?' [^114bJVYj]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2025). Low credibility.

In 1997, the Journal of Medical Genetics published our paper on the spectrum of clinical features associated with interstitial chromosome 22q11 deletions. This copy number variation is associated with an extraordinary range of clinical features, which initially led to its association with several diagnostic labels. Since 1997, research on both clinical and basic science aspects of the syndrome, and the genes reduced to hemizygosity, has provided a wealth of information pertaining to best practice care as well as underlying biology. It is recognized that 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is an excellent model for probing mechanisms underlying psychiatric disease, cardiovascular development, and more.

### Practical guidelines for managing adults with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^113fi1Dm]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

22q11.2 Deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common microdeletion syndrome in humans, estimated to affect up to 1 in 2,000 live births. Major features of this multisystem condition include congenital anomalies, developmental delay, and an array of early- and later-onset medical and psychiatric disorders. Advances in pediatric care ensure a growing population of adults with 22q11.2DS. Informed by an international panel of multidisciplinary experts and a comprehensive review of the existing literature concerning adults, we present the first set of guidelines focused on managing the neuropsychiatric, endocrine, cardiovascular, reproductive, psychosocial, genetic counseling, and other issues that are the focus of attention in adults with 22q11.2DS. We propose practical strategies for the recognition, evaluation, surveillance, and management of the associated morbidities.

**Proposed terminology of 22q11.2del in association with T cell lymphopenia**: Replace use of 22q11.2del with DiGeorge syndrome when the genetic defect cannot be identified. Alternatively, use another specific causative genetic defect if distinct from 22q11.2del.

### Phenotype of the 22q11.2 deletion in individuals identified through an affected relative: Cast a wide FISHing net [^115RQX6i]. Genetics in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The chromosome 22q11.2 deletion has been identified in the majority of patients with DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome, as well as in some patients with the autosomal dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome and Cayler cardiofacial syndrome. Additionally, 22q11.2 deletion studies are becoming part of a standardized diagnostic workup for certain isolated defects, such as conotruncal cardiac anomalies and velopharyngeal incompetence. However, there is a scarcity of information on the clinical findings of unselected patients, such as those identified during prenatal diagnosis, as part of a generalized screening protocol, or following the diagnosis in a relative. This information is invaluable for defining the variability of the disorder and observing long-term outcomes without targeted remediations. This study allows examination of the first unselected cohort of patients, highlighting the importance of deletion testing in parents of affected probands.

- **Methods**: Thirty individuals with a 22q11.2 deletion were identified following the diagnosis in a relative. Nineteen were adults diagnosed only after their child was diagnosed, ten were children identified following their sibling's diagnosis, and one was a child diagnosed prenatally after the diagnosis in her parent.

- **Results**: Sixty percent of patients had no visceral anomalies. Specifically, only 6 of the 19 adults (32%) and 6 of the 11 children (55%) had major findings that would have brought them to medical attention.

### Neurodevelopmental trajectories and psychiatric morbidity: Lessons learned from the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^115VFg15]. Current psychiatry reports (2021). Low credibility.

Since the earliest clinical descriptions of 22q11DS in the 1960s, a vast body of research continues to contribute to our understanding of this complex, multisystem genetic disorder. Since the 1990s, the increased risk for schizophrenia became clear, followed by observations of other psychopathology, including developmental disorders identifiable early in life. Subsequent and more recent studies are starting to elucidate the relationships between different domains of psychopathology and the role of cognition.

There is an increasing awareness to view these components in a developmental, lifespan perspective, and the need to consider symptoms not only in a categorical but also in a dimensional, quantitative framework. These changing perspectives allow for a more holistic diagnostic approach and treatment for this population, and are also vital for research.

Studies in the 22q11DS population continue to contribute to our understanding of schizophrenia, other developmental disorders, variable penetrance and expressivity, and pleiotropy. All of these are challenging phenomena that are relevant to neuropsychiatric outcomes in individuals with the 22q11.2 deletion, as well as other rare pathogenic variants, and to the understanding of the expression of, and mechanisms underlying, neuropsychiatric disorders more broadly.

### Neurodevelopmental trajectories and psychiatric morbidity: Lessons learned from the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^1173esq6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In the general population, the effect of parental level of cognitive functioning on offspring cognitive functioning, also reflected in the role of common (shared) genetic variance for IQ, has been well established. Evidence from studies of 22q11DS and other pathogenic variants in support of a similar mechanism is emerging. A recent study reported that while IQ scores were approximately 30 points lower in 22q11DS patients compared to their unaffected parents, the distribution was significantly associated with the parental distribution. This is in line with the finding that common genetic variants associated with IQ, or proxies thereof, in the general population (IQ polygenic score) are similarly important in shaping the cognitive phenotype in the context of the high-impact 22q11.2 deletion.

While severe levels of intellectual disability are uncommon in children, they are more frequently observed in adults with 22q11DS, suggesting that cognitive abilities may not be stable in all individuals with 22q11DS. Several studies, including one which studied the cognitive trajectories of 718 individuals with 22q11DS, have reported that, overall, individuals with 22q11DS show a modest but significant decline in IQ throughout development. These longitudinal IQ data suggest that in childhood and adolescence, the observed typical decline in 22q11DS mostly reflects a slower pace in cognitive development compared to typically developing peers. In adulthood, however, the observed decline suggests that individuals with 22q11DS are losing cognitive capacities at a faster pace compared to the general population.

### Expansion of the deletion 13q syndrome phenotype: a case report [^115262A6]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The phenotypic description of deletion 13q syndrome is dependent on the location and size of the deleted segment. At present, the syndrome is divided into three groups based on the deletion's location relative to chromosomal band 13q32. Groups 1 (proximal to q32) and 2 (including q32) have shown distinctive phenotypes including mental retardation and growth deficiency, whereas group 3 (q33–34 deletion) is defined by the presence of mental retardation but usually the absence of major malformations. The authors report an 8-year-old Hispanic female with dysmorphic facial features, microcephaly, moderate to severe mental retardation, and uncontrolled epilepsy associated with a terminal 13q33.3 deletion. These features expand the characterization of the phenotype associated with group 3 of the 13q deletion syndrome to include major clinical manifestations. This case report will contribute to more accurate genetic counseling as well as may help identify more individuals with this syndrome.

### Prenatal diagnosis, ultrasound findings and pregnancy outcome of 7q11.23 deletion and duplication syndromes: What are the fetal features [^117K1bpC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

The genetic pattern of 7q11.23 deletion and duplication syndromes follows an autosomal dominant inheritance. The penetrance rates for these syndromes, as reported in previous literature, are close to 100% for deletions and 45% for duplications, respectively. The 7q11.23 deletion and duplication syndromes affect the same genomic region but exhibit significant phenotypic heterogeneity. The clinical manifestations of the 7q11.23 deletion syndrome include distinctive facial features, often referred to as "elfin face"; motor and cognitive delays; behavioral and cognitive abnormalities; and structural malformations of the cardiovascular system, with artery stenosis being the most typical.

In our study, among seven cases with 7q11.23 deletions, four exhibited cardiovascular system abnormalities, and three displayed fetal growth restriction. These findings suggest that these phenotypes are the dominant clinical characteristics of 7q11.23 deletions detectable in prenatal ultrasound. A previous report identified that five out of seven prenatal cases of Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) had cardiovascular malformations, accounting for approximately 71%, with three cases of aortic stenosis detected at 30 weeks gestational age. In our study, three out of four cases of cardiovascular malformation were detected around 30 weeks of gestational age. This suggests that cardiovascular malformations in WBS fetuses may only be detectable during mid to late pregnancy ultrasound examinations.

In this study, we identified one case with multiple structural abnormalities, including ventricular septal defect.

### Abnormal auditory processing and underlying structural changes in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^117BEsMs]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Low credibility.

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS), one of the highest genetic risk factors for the development of schizophrenia, offers a unique opportunity to understand neurobiological and functional changes preceding the onset of the psychotic illness. Reduced auditory mismatch negativity response (MMN) has been proposed as a promising index of abnormal sensory processing and brain pathology in schizophrenia. However, the link between the MMN response and its underlying cerebral mechanisms in 22q11.2 DS remains unexamined.

We measured auditory-evoked potentials to frequency deviant stimuli with high-density electroencephalogram and volumetric estimates of cortical and thalamic auditory areas using structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of 130 individuals, 70 with 22q11.2 DS and 60 age-matched typically developing (TD) individuals. Compared to the TD group, the 22q11.2 deletion carriers reveal reduced MMN response and significant changes in topographical maps, and decreased gray matter volumes of cortical and subcortical auditory areas, however, without any correlations between MMN alteration and structural changes.

Furthermore, exploratory research on the presence of hallucinations (H+ and H−) reveals no change in MMN response in 22q11.2DS (H + and H −) compared to TD individuals. Nonetheless, we observe bilateral volume reduction of the superior temporal gyrus and left medial geniculate in 22q11.2DSH + compared to 22q11.2DSH − and TD participants. These results suggest that the mismatch response might be a promising neurophysiological marker of function.

### DiGeorge syndrome chromosome region deletion and duplication: Prenatal genotype-phenotype variability in fetal ultrasound and MRI [^1151xUSt]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to assess the genotype-phenotype correlation of prenatally diagnosed fetal DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and dup22q11 syndrome using fetal molecular genetic analysis, fetal ultrasound, and/or MRI.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective consecutive case series, pregnant women were screened for fetal anomalies over a period of 10 years. Fetal genotype was assessed in 72 cases based on five prenatal fetal phenotypic features: cardiac anomalies, hypo/aplastic thymus, craniofacial malformations, urinary abnormalities, or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); genotype-phenotype correlation was tested to potentially improve prenatal diagnosis of fetal DGS and dup22q11 syndrome.

- **Results**: Fetal genotypes involving deletions or duplications in proximal clusters of LCR22s (A-B) were associated with fetal cardiac anomalies, hypo/aplastic thymus, and craniofacial malformations, suggesting a correlation with deleted HIRA. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) associated with an aplastic thymus and renal defects indicated a relevant correlation with TBX1 deletion. Deletions in central LCR22s (B-D) with the loss of CRKL suggested a trend of genotype-phenotype correlation with fetal urinary abnormalities.

- **Conclusion**: Genotype-phenotype correlation might improve prenatal diagnosis of fetal DGS and dup22q11 syndrome. Therefore, prenatal screening and counseling are highly enhanced by a combination of fetal molecular genetic analysis, fetal ultrasound, and/or MRI. The implications of these findings remain to be explored.

### Possible mechanisms and gene involvement in speech problems in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^111xR5Lg]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome represents a contiguous gene syndrome with a highly variable phenotype. At the time of writing, over 180 clinical features have been described. Studies have been conducted to identify the responsible genes. Several candidate genes, such as TBX1 and COMT, seem to be important in the development of the phenotype. One of the prevalent and serious problems encountered by patients with the 22q11.2 deletion is difficulty with speech. This may be due to several factors, such as adenoid hypoplasia, muscle hypotonia, platybasia, upper airway asymmetry, and neuroanatomical abnormalities. The complex interaction of these factors leads to less favorable results after surgery to correct velopharyngeal insufficiency. This article offers a theoretical overview and proposes future research to investigate which factors are indeed responsible for the speech problems encountered by patients with the 22q11.2 deletion and to identify responsible genes.

### Downregulation of genes outside the deleted region in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^116dTAMM]. Human Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is caused by hemizygous deletions of chromosome 22q11.2. The phenotype of the syndrome is complex and varies widely among individuals. Little is known about the role of the different genes located in 22q11.2, and we hypothesized that genetic risk factors lying elsewhere in the genome might contribute to the phenotype. Here, we present the whole-genome gene expression data of 11 patients with approximately 3 Mb deletions. Apart from the hemizygous genes mapped to the 22q11.2 region, the TUBA8 and GNAZ genes, neighboring the deleted interval but in normal copy number, showed altered expression.

- **Genome-wide dysregulation**: When genes mapped to other chromosomes were considered in the gene expression analysis, a genome-wide dysregulation was observed, with increased or decreased expression levels. The enriched pathways of these genes were related to immune response, a deficiency that is frequently observed in 22q11.2DS patients.

- **Gene network analysis**: We also used the hypothesis-free weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), which revealed the co-expression gene network modules with clear connection to mechanisms associated with 22q11.2DS, such as immune response and schizophrenia. These findings, combined with the traditional gene expression profile, can be used for the identification of potential pathways and genes not previously considered to be related to the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the immunological management of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and other defects in thymic development [^114xdTDi]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

The thymus is an organ responsible for and essential to the production of T lymphocytes. Numerous defects are known to adversely affect thymic development. DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) is historically the condition clearly associated with a small or absent thymus. The small deletion within chromosome 22 was linked to DiGeorge syndrome in the early 1980s, although this syndrome was named in 1965 when Angelo DiGeorge described the common embryologic derivation of the heart, thymus, and parathyroid glands. The classic phenotypic triad of DGS consists of conotruncal heart defects, hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism, and T cell deficiency due to thymic hypoplasia. Other sources list five major phenotypic abnormalities, adding abnormal facies and velopharyngeal insufficiency with submucosal cleft palate to the above three criteria.

Over the years, the terminology evolved but also proved confusing, due to the fact some individuals have the deletion without evidence of the syndrome, while others meet the clinical criteria for DGS but do not have an identifiable deletion. The term chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is now used in individuals identified as having a hemizygous deletion of chromosome 22q11.2. Numerous other gene defects as well as environmental exposures have been identified as causing defects in thymic development (DTD), also termed thymic hypoplasia. These factors are further detailed in the genetics section.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the immunological management of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and other defects in thymic development [^1137dgXo]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

The work of many authors and their publications over many years have addressed immunological aspects of 22q11.2del/DGS. Despite this, widely variable approaches to initial and long-term assessment, as well as the best management practices for affected individuals, have continued. By forming an expert workgroup to discuss how to best diagnose and care for affected individuals and incorporating pertinent information gained from previously published literature, the hope is that these guidelines will provide clinicians with an updated clinical practice framework that is both comprehensive and practical as it relates to immunology.

### Biktarvy [^114vT5oo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **In clinical trials**: In subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history, pooled results of genotypic resistance analyses were performed on paired baseline and on-treatment HIV-1 isolates from subjects receiving Biktarvy in Trials 1489 and 1490 through Week 144 of the double-blind phase (N = 634) or Week 96 of the extension phase (n = 1025) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] who had HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 200 copies/mL at the time of confirmed virologic failure or early study drug discontinuation. In the final resistance analysis population, no specific amino acid substitutions emerged consistently in the 11 treatment failure subjects with evaluable genotypic resistance data, and no association with genotypic BIC resistance was established. There were no treatment-emergent NRTI resistance-associated substitutions detected in the 11 evaluated treatment failure isolates. Phenotypic resistance analyses of failure isolates found fold-changes in drug susceptibility below the biological or clinical cutoffs for BIC, FTC, and TFV, compared to wild-type reference HIV-1.

- **In virologically suppressed adult subjects**: In two of the switch trials, Trials 1844 and 1878, involving virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected subjects (n = 572), only one subject with virologic rebound in the resistance analysis population had IN genotypic and phenotypic data, and two rebounders had RT genotypic and phenotypic data. No subjects exhibited HIV-1 with treatment-emergent genotypic or phenotypic resistance to BIC, FTC, or TAF. In Trial 4030, no subjects receiving Biktarvy had treatment-emergent phenotypic resistance.

### All-cause mortality and survival in adults with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^1141r4zW]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

We prospectively studied all-cause mortality and survival in adults with 22q11.2DS compared to their unaffected siblings and parents. Informed consent was obtained in writing, and the study was approved by the local research ethics boards of hospitals (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and University Health Network) affiliated with the University of Toronto.

Adults with 22q11.2DS included all 309 consenting individuals (148 male, 161 female) who were 17 years or older as of 31 December 2017 and confirmed to have a typical chromosome 22q11.2 deletion (i.e. including the LCR22A-LCR22B region, most commonly involving the 2.5-Mb LCR22A-LCR22D region) by standard methods, as previously described. All patients were ascertained through a specialty clinic for adults with 22q11.2DS (The Dalglish Family 22q Clinic or the Clinical Genetics Research Program, Toronto, Canada), through referrals (from genetics, psychiatric, or other sources), and/or active screening, mostly at an adult congenital cardiac clinic.

We retained 100 adults (of 102, i.e. excluding two subjects with atypical 22q11.2 deletions) where there were 12 deaths (compared with none in their siblings). Ethnicity was characterized as European (n = 260, 84.1%) or non-European descent, with the latter comprising Asian (n = 24, 7.8%), African (n = 10, 3.2%), or other including mixed (n = 15, 4.9%) ethnicity. Of the 309 subjects from 291 families, 275 were singleton affected individuals, 28 were from 14 families with two affected individuals, and there were two families with additional complexities.

### Bilateral polymicrogyria: Always think in chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndromes [^11478naf]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Polymicrogyria (PMG) is a malformation of cortical development due to abnormal organization. It is a heterogeneous disorder associated with genetic and acquired events, namely 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) or velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS), among others. This association has been known since 1996, and more than 30 cases have been described. Neurological features include motor and cognitive impairment, epilepsy, microcephaly, and spasticity. The authors present an 8-month-old infant with minor dysmorphic features, microcephaly, global psychomotor retardation, and epilepsy. Brain MRI revealed diffuse bilateral PMG. The 22q11.2 deletion was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The child had no other manifestations of DGS/VCFS.

- **Awareness and recommendations**: Pediatricians, neuropaediatricians, developmental specialists, and geneticists should be aware that in the presence of PMG, especially when bilateral, 22q11.2 deletion should be investigated, even in the absence of the typical features of DGS/VCFS. Conversely, in children with a 22q11.2 deletion, brain malformations should be ruled out.

### From karyotypes to precision genomics in 9p deletion and duplication syndromes [^115AaJU7]. HGG Advances (2022). Low credibility.

While 9p deletion and duplication syndromes have been studied for several years, small sample sizes and minimal high-resolution data have limited a comprehensive delineation of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. In this study, we examined genetic data from 719 individuals in the worldwide 9p Network Cohort — a cohort seven to nine times larger than any previous study of 9p. Most breakpoints occur in bands 9p22 and 9p24, accounting for 35% and 38% of all breakpoints, respectively. Bands 9p11 and 9p12 have the fewest breakpoints, each accounting for 0.6% of all breakpoints.

The most common phenotype in 9p deletion and duplication syndromes is developmental delay. We identified eight known neurodevelopmental disorder genes in 9p22 and 9p24. Since it has been previously reported that some individuals have a secondary structural variant related to the 9p variant, we examined our cohort for these variants and found 97 events. The top secondary variant involved 9q in 14 individuals (1.9%), including ring chromosomes and inversions. We identified a gender bias with significant enrichment for females (p = 0.0006) that may arise from a sex reversal in some individuals with 9p deletions.

Genes on 9p were characterized regarding function, constraint metrics, and protein-protein interactions, resulting in a prioritized set of genes for further study. Finally, we achieved precision genomics in one child with a complex 9p structural variation using modern genomic technologies, demonstrating that long-read sequencing will be integral for some cases. Our study is the largest.

### Consensus statement: Chromosomal microarray is a first-tier clinical diagnostic test for individuals with developmental disabilities or congenital anomalies [^115aSXfY]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is increasingly utilized for genetic testing of individuals with unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), or multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). Performing CMA and G-banded karyotyping on every patient substantially increases the total cost of genetic testing. The International Standard Cytogenomic Array (ISCA) Consortium held two international workshops and conducted a literature review of 33 studies, including 21,698 patients tested by CMA.

We provide an evidence-based summary of clinical cytogenetic testing, comparing CMA to G-banded karyotyping with respect to technical advantages and limitations, diagnostic yield for various types of chromosomal aberrations, and issues that affect test interpretation. CMA offers a much higher diagnostic yield (15%-20%) for genetic testing of individuals with unexplained DD/ID, ASD, or MCA than a G-banded karyotype (approximately 3%, excluding Down syndrome and other recognizable chromosomal syndromes). This is primarily because of its higher sensitivity for submicroscopic deletions and duplications. Truly balanced rearrangements and low-level mosaicism are generally not detectable by arrays, but these are relatively infrequent causes of abnormal phenotypes in this population (< 1%).

Available evidence strongly supports the use of CMA in place of G-banded karyotyping as the first-tier cytogenetic diagnostic test for patients with DD/ID, ASD, or MCA. G-banded karyotype analysis should be reserved for patients with obvious chromosomal syndromes (e.g. Down syndrome).

### Rare copy number variants and congenital heart defects in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^111K2nR2]. Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS; velocardiofacial/DiGeorge syndrome; VCFS/DGS; MIM #192430; 188400) is the most common microdeletion syndrome. The phenotypic presentation of 22q11DS is highly variable; approximately 60–75% of 22q11DS patients have been reported to have a congenital heart defect (CHD), mostly of the conotruncal type, and/or aortic arch defect. The etiology of the cardiac phenotypic variability is not currently known for the majority of patients. We hypothesized that rare copy number variants (CNVs) outside the 22q11.2 deleted region may modify the risk of being born with a CHD in this sensitized population.

Rare CNV analysis was performed using Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 data from 946 22q11DS subjects with CHDs (n = 607) or with normal cardiac anatomy (n = 339). Although there was no significant difference in the overall burden of rare CNVs, an overabundance of CNVs affecting cardiac-related genes was detected in 22q11DS individuals with CHDs. When the rare CNVs were examined with regard to gene interactions, specific cardiac networks, such as Wnt signaling, appear to be overrepresented in 22q11DS CHD cases but not 22q11DS controls with a normal heart. Collectively, these data suggest that CNVs outside the 22q11.2 region may contain genes that modify risk for CHDs in some 22q11DS patients.

### Genomic disorders: Molecular mechanisms for rearrangements and conveyed phenotypes [^1176TUe7]. PLOS Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation disorder usually associated with a cytogenetically visible heterozygous deletion of sub-band 17p11.2, i.e. del(17)(p11.2p11.2). Rare patients without the deletion have been identified, and some were found to have heterozygous point mutations in the retinoic acid inducible 1 (RAI1) gene. As would be anticipated, most of these are frameshift or nonsense mutations consistent with a haploinsufficiency mechanism. Chromosome-engineered mouse models that delete one copy of the mouse Chromosome 11 region syntenic to human 17p11.2 (i.e. Df(11)17 and other derivative deficiencies), as well as targeted disruption of Rai1, recapitulate much of the SMS phenotype.

Animal models that are compound heterozygotes for deletion and duplication (Df(11)17/Dp(11)17) have a normal phenotype; this "rescue" is consistent with a dosage mechanism for the phenotypes observed in the mice harboring heterozygous rearrangements. A syndrome associated with heterozygous duplication of the genomic interval deleted in SMS, dup(17)(p11.2p11.2), has been described. The dup(17)(p11.2p11.2) phenotype likely results from a dosage-sensitive gene in the human Chromosome 17p11.2 region. This dosage-sensitive gene is probably RAI1 since Dp(11)17/Rai1− animals, who have a normal Rai1 gene copy number but three copies for all the other genes in the rearranged intervals, have a normal phenotype. The knockout allele appears to rescue the duplication phenotypes (unpublished data), although this hypothesis awaits formal verification.

### Evans syndrome in a patient with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: a case report [^111A9s4Z]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

One patient with a chromosome 22q11.2 deletion and Evans syndrome is reported in this paper. Microdeletions of 22q11.2 are the main etiology for DiGeorge syndrome, a disorder characterized by heart defects, immune deficiencies due to aplasia or hypoplasia of the thymus, and hypocalcemia. Evans syndrome refers to a hematological autoimmune disorder with autoimmune hemolytic anemia accompanied by immune thrombocytopenia. A wide range of autoimmune disorders have been described in DiGeorge syndrome and velocardiofacial syndrome, including one prior report of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia. The patient reported herein strengthens the association between the 22q11.2 deletion spectrum and Evans syndrome.

### Bcl11b-related disease: A single phenotypic entity [^112KdVAy]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Upon identification of Patient 3, we conducted a literature search for individuals with 14q32 microdeletions involving BCL11B. This resulted in an additional 12 individuals with deletions of interest. The clinical features of patients with deletions involving BCL11B are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Notably, 50% of the cohort of BCL11B deletion patients presented with CRS. We subsequently searched the Decipher database for overlapping deletions within our candidate region for whom CRS was a reported feature and found one additional patient.

- **Deletions encompassing BCL11B**: Genes in the region are represented in red. The deletion identified in Patient 3 is shown in purple. Patients from the literature and/or Decipher are represented in green. Bars with a hatched pattern indicate that CRS was present in that patient. The two black arrows indicate that these deletions extend beyond the picture frame.

There are 9 cardinal or major features associated with BRD. Seven of those (79%) were observed in the cohort of patients with BCL11B deletions. In contrast, there are 16 features associated with 14q32 terminal microdeletions. Only seven of those (44%) were observed in the BCL11B gene deletion cohort, and most (4 out of 7) are also part of BRD (facial dysmorphism, psychomotor delay, hypotonia).

### Cochlear implantation in 13q deletion syndrome [^115BAkiJ]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

The advent of cochlear implantation has led to significant surgical and technological advances, resulting in changes in the management of sensorineural hearing loss. Individuals with rare genetic abnormalities, previously not considered candidates for cochlear implantation, are now benefiting from this technology. One such condition is 13q deletion syndrome, a rare chromosomal abnormality first described in the early 1960s. Despite this, the literature lacks detailed descriptions of the phenotypic abnormalities associated with the syndrome. Patients with 13q deletion syndrome show varying degrees of cognitive and growth delays, craniofacial dysmorphisms, and congenital malformations. The cause of sensorineural hearing loss in these patients remains unclear, but genes linked to other syndromes featuring sensorineural hearing loss have been suggested as potential culprits. This study details the unique clinical and surgical considerations for patients with 13q deletion syndrome and reviews the factors to consider for cochlear implantation in syndromic hearing loss.

- **Materials and methods**: Case report.

- **Results**: Successful cochlear implantation in a patient with 13q deletion syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: Many patients with 13q deletion syndrome suffer from sensorineural hearing loss and may benefit from cochlear implantation if appropriately selected. Similarly, other syndromic patients, following careful selection, may also benefit from cochlear implantation and should not be automatically excluded from consideration.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms as antecedents of later psychotic outcomes in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^1173pdCU]. Schizophrenia Research (2019). Low credibility.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is diagnosed typically based on its clinical presentation along with laboratory evidence of a deletion or copy number variant (CNV) at band q11.2 on chromosome 22. Approximately 1 in 4000 individuals are affected by 22q11.2DS, making it the most common chromosomal microdeletion syndrome. While the microdeletions range in size from 0.7 to 3 million base pairs (MB), the majority of patients (~85%) have a 3 MB deletion.

The physical, cognitive, and psychiatric manifestations associated with 22q11.2DS are variable and involve multiple systems, including immune, cardiac, palatal, gastrointestinal, and endocrine deficits, regardless of deletion size. An association between the 22q11.2 deletion and psychosis has long been recognized. Approximately 1 in 4 individuals with 22q11.2DS develop schizophrenia and around 1 in 100 individuals with schizophrenia have been found to carry the 22q11.2 deletion. This indicates that individuals with 22q11.2DS are at a substantially elevated risk of developing schizophrenia spectrum disorders, with an onset typically occurring after mid-to-late adolescence.

### The diverse clinical features of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome) [^114Ygzkj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old boy with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome was referred for recurrent sinopulmonary infections. He was diagnosed shortly after birth by a fluorescence in situ hybridization test that was performed due to interrupted aortic arch type B. He had no hypocalcemia, and his recovery from cardiac repair was uneventful. He had difficulty feeding and gained weight slowly, but, otherwise, there were no concerns during his first year of life.

At 15 months of age, he began to develop significant otitis media and bronchitis. He was hospitalized once for pneumonia at 18 months of age and has never been off antibiotics for more than 1 week since then. He has not had any previous immunologic evaluation. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections in a child with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can have the same etiologies as in any other child. Atopy, anatomic issues, cystic fibrosis, and new environmental exposures could be considered in this setting. Early childhood can be problematic for patients with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome due to unfavorable drainage of the middle ear and sinuses.

Atopy occurs at a higher frequency in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and these children also have a higher rate of gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration than the general population. As would be appropriate for any child who presents with recurrent infections at 2 years of age, an immunologic evaluation should be performed. In this review, we will highlight recent findings and new data on the management of children and adults with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

### From karyotypes to precision genomics in 9p deletion and duplication syndromes [^114F1mAv]. HGG Advances (2022). High credibility.

Another area for future development is the linking of genotypes with phenotypes in individuals with 9p deletion and duplication syndromes. Many approaches can be utilized, including critical region delineation. However, we also highlight the application of machine learning to complex biological problems and suggest it as a strategy to combine all of the genomic and phenotypic data. The application of novel genomic technologies with deep phenotyping on a large cohort of individuals would provide the ideal input for these types of models.

Considerable progress has been made in the assessment of 9p deletion and duplication syndromes. However, predicting an affected individual's phenotypes remains challenging with the currently available data. Part of this phenotypic unpredictability is attributable to the low genomic resolution possible with older genotyping methods. Technological advances in genomics are providing strategies to detect all forms of variations in the genome at a large scale and a reasonable cost.

For example, in 9p deletion syndrome, these technologies can identify the precise breakpoints of the event, detect potentially relevant variations on the remaining allele, and examine the remainder of the genome for other relevant events (e.g. a second hit). Utilizing this information across many individuals with 9p deletion and duplication syndromes and combining it with leading-edge analyses of phenotypic data (e.g. the parsing of electronic health records) will enable the delineation of complete genotype-phenotype correlations.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^116K1CfX]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

In clinical genetic practice, 5–7% of cases with intellectual disability (ID) or congenital malformations are diagnosed with two different Mendelian disorders. Dual diagnoses have also been described for 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. Trained clinicians must decide whether more extensive genetic testing is recommended following a molecular 16p11.2 deletion or duplication diagnosis. In our cohort, additional genetic testing was performed in the majority of cases. Dual diagnoses identified in our cohort should encourage close attention to determining whether an individual's phenotype is fully explained by the 16p11.2 CNV.

For example, one case with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion had short stature (height SDS –2.9) and a congenital heart defect, both cardinal features of Noonan syndrome. We confirmed this second diagnosis. As this second diagnosis could affect our results and conclusions, we excluded this particular case from our subgroup analyses. Clinical overlap of two syndromes makes it harder to realize that these cases could have a dual diagnosis. We recommend consultation with a clinical geneticist in cases of severe or previously unreported symptoms.

Importantly, we mentioned one case with an apparent de novo typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion when tested using array-CGH, whose mother eventually carried the same typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion in mosaic form when reanalyzed with SNP array nine years later. Even though this is a rare finding, it can be relevant for siblings of cases with an apparent de novo deletion, who were analyzed with previous genetic techniques.

### Prenatal cardiac findings and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: Fetal detection and evaluation [^112H3CBt]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). High credibility.

The chromosome 22q11.2 microdeletion, associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), is the most common human microdeletion characterized by congenital anomalies as well as other multisystem health and psychosocial issues that can emerge over time. The 22q11.2DS has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 2148 live births, 1 in 992 pregnancies unselected for cardiac or palatal anomalies, and 1 in 1497 miscarriages. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a prominent feature in 22q11.2DS; the deletion has been reported in 1 in 19 pregnancies undergoing diagnostic genetic testing for fetal cardiac anomalies, and in 1 in 93 fetuses tested for all indications.

Given these prevalence rates and the associated morbidity, recognizing the fetus with 22q11.2DS is of critical importance. This paper will review important aspects including:

- **Postnatal features**: Associated with 22q11.2DS.
- **Fetal features**: Cardiac and non-cardiac features of 22q11.2DS.
- **Prenatal testing**: For the 22q11.2 microdeletion.
- **Features by trimester**: Features of 22q11.2DS in each trimester of pregnancy.

The goal of this review is to equip the prenatal team to identify associated features in the fetus diagnosed with a 22q11.2 deletion. This will support improved perinatal care and help identify the fetus at risk for 22q11.2DS that warrants genetic counseling and screening.

### A novel immunodeficiency syndrome associated with partial trisomy 19p13 [^113U3qhe]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, few chromosomal disorders have been associated with primary immunodeficiency diseases. The best known is 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, including a DiGeorge phenotype and Velo-Cardio-Facial syndrome. Besides characteristic syndromic dysmorphies, those patients develop no or a hypoplastic thymus, leading to defective thymocyte development. The degree of immunodeficiency varies between the affected patients up to severe combined immunodeficiency with cellular and humoral defects. Although 22q11.2 deletion is the most frequent deletion syndrome (incidence 1:4000), and a defect of a T-box family transcriptional regulator, TBX1, relevant during organogenesis in mice and humans, appears a candidate mechanism for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, the genes that directly cause the involved immunodeficiency could not be identified so far, which stresses the difficulty behind such intentions.

Other microdeletion syndromes associated with impaired immunity include Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome due to partial deletions of chromosome 4p and syndromes caused by deletion of chromosome 10p13–14 and partial deletions of chromosome 18. In addition, patients with 45, X0 phenotype (Turner's syndrome) may present with antibody deficiency and an increased predisposition to autoimmunity.

Immunodeficiency associated with partial or complete chromosomal duplications is rare, with the exception of, for example, duplication of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), a regulator of gene expression and chromatin structure encoded on Xq28, which leads to a complex syndrome with mild dysmorphia.

### Jacobsen syndrome detected by noninvasive prenatal testing [^112CK9iF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing has a high detection rate of common fetal chromosomal aneuploidies. However, detection of additional chromosome abnormalities has not been well described or validated.

- **Case**: We report a case of Jacobsen syndrome, a congenital disorder involving deletion of chromosome 11q, detected by noninvasive prenatal testing at 14 weeks of gestation and confirmed on neonatal testing with array chromosomal genomic hybridization.

- **Conclusion**: Noninvasive prenatal testing should be considered when multiple fetal anomalies are present and invasive testing is declined. As the clinical application of noninvasive prenatal testing continues to evolve, additional submicroscopic chromosomal information may be clinically helpful and should be confirmed with diagnostic testing until larger studies help further define the screening characteristics of noninvasive prenatal testing.
